25|$|By Thursday, March 28, the {{investigators}} were growing weary after five consecutive days of questioning about 200 suspects, chasing {{over a hundred}} false leads and tips <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> over the meager clues. They managed to get three suspects in custody because of bloody clothing, two of whom were released on explanations that satisfied the officers. The third suspect was held in Vernon, Texas for further grilling. Dick Oldhan, another Ranger, was called in and arrived Wednesday from Tyler, Texas {{to help in the}} investigation.|$|E

Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E

25|$|Atlanta {{started off}} {{the second half}} with a 9-play, 80-yard drive to take their first lead of the game on Miller's 20-yard scoring pass to Haynes. The rest of the quarter would belong to the Saints, who {{consumed}} a franchise playoff record 10:49 by driving 80 yards in 19 plays <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> up 20-17 with a 1-yard touchdown run by Hilliard. New Orleans was aided by another key penalty against the Falcons defense, an offsides penalty against linebacker Jessie Tuggle on an Andersen field goal attempt that gave the Saints a first down. With 7:43 left in the game, Johnson kicked a field goal to tie the score at 20 {{at the end of}} a 45-yard drive. The next time they got the ball, Haynes took off past cornerback Milton Mack, caught a short slant from Miller, and raced 61 yards to the end zone, giving Atlanta a 27-20 lead. After Haynes scored the winning touchdown for the Falcons, the Saints reached the Atlanta 35-yard line before Hebert threw an interception to Falcons defensive back Tim McKyer to clinch the victory.|$|E

500|$|Choosing to self-title the album, Lazzara said: [...] "We haven’t had , <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the {{original}} lineup, it seems appropriate." [...] Nolan mentioned a recurring theme throughout the album: [...] "The issue of being an adult with a real life and a long-term relationship or marriage, {{and trying to make}} that work." [...] The album's sound has been described as rock. Band members made up their own sequences for the track listing, then noted the similarities. Lazzara said [...] "...with El Paso ... Why not come out swinging?" [...] The track {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, and Lazzara said it encapsulates [...] "both the mood of the environment we were in down there and the mood we were in about being back together again and writing new music". Lazzara called it [...] "probably the heaviest rock song we've ever written". After the group finished the track, they listened to it 15 or 16 times in a row, and proceeded to exclaim: [...] "Holy shit." [...] "When everybody's like 'Holy shit' about something, you're onto something. It's a total motorcycle-raging-down-the-highway kind of song." [...] Lazzara said [...] "Faith (When I Let You Down)" [...] matches a [...] "huge, punishing" [...] chorus with a soft verse, which comes across as a [...] "roller coaster" [...] to him. Lazzara mentioned that the track took longer to work on compared to the other songs on the album, going through 4 or 5 sets of lyrics.|$|E

[...] "When we got {{done with the}} other song, I kept going back, saying, 'Man, there's something about what you were playing earlier ... let's mess with that before we leave.' So he started playing it again," [...] Davidson recalled. After the keyboard elements were completed, Scott and Kelley finished the song's music and lyrics at the studio. They discussed ideas for the song; Kelley put forward the basic melody and Scott followed up with her own contribution. After they wrote the lyrics, Davidson proposed that the song's title be [...] "Just a Kiss Goodnight". It was later changed to [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] after Scott felt that [...] "it's cool to have 'just a kiss' goodnight rather than going all the way." [...] Kelley told Country Weekly that the song {{was inspired by the}} band members' experiences: [...] "I remembered being out the first night with Cassie and thinking, 'This is different, and I don't want to give any wrong impression. I [...] don't want to make the wrong move because this feels like something [...] special.' We started talking about that <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> and forth with [...] different experiences when we wrote the song." [...] The song was recorded and mixed by Clarke Schleicher, with assistance from Joe Martino and Andrew Bazinet. The B-side track, [...] "Bottle Up Lightning", was written by Kelley, Haywood, Tony Martin and Wendell Lee Mobley.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1980s it {{has become}} common to speak of Post-Boom writers, {{most of whom were}} born during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, such as Roberto Bolaño, the post Boom Spanish {{language}} writer who has made the greatest impact on world literature. It is difficult to clearly situate the Post-Boom as many of its writers were active {{before the end of the}} Boom. [...] Indeed, some writers, like Jose Donoso could be said to belong to both movements. [...] His novel The Obscene Bird of Night (El obsceno pájaro de la noche, 1970) is considered, as Philip Swanson notes, [...] "one of the classics of the Boom." [...] His later work, however, fits more comfortably into the post-Boom. [...] Manuel Puig and Severo Sarduy are considered writers whose works embody the transition from the Boom to the Post-Boom. It is important to note that this uneasiness in categorization is perpetuated by the fact that major writers of the Boom (Fuentes, García Márquez and Vargas Llosa) continued writing well after the end of the Boom. [...] The post-Boom is distinct from the Boom in various respects, most notably in the presence of female authors such as Isabel Allende, Luisa Valenzuela, Giannina Braschi, Cristina Peri Rossi, and Elena Poniatowska. [...] While Valenzuela and Poniatowska were both active writers during, and in Poniatowska's case even before, the Boom period, Allende is considered [...] "a product of the Boom." [...] Shaw also identifies Antonio Skármeta, Rosario Ferre and Gustavo Sainz as Post-Boom writers. [...] The Post-Boom writers challenge the perceived elitism of the Boom by using a simpler, more readable style <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to realism.|$|E

It was executively produced by the singer alongside her A agent Mark Pitts and writing/production duo Tricky Stewart and The-Dream who also produced records for her previous album, Fantasy Ride.

2500|$|The {{second half}} of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of being a {{successful}} techno wunderkind.

He explained: [...] "I was opening for Soundgarden and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night."

2500|$|From 1941, the Nazi-aligned {{regime of}} Conducător Ion Antonescu ordered Romania's {{participation}} {{in the war against}} the Soviet Union. Cocea was active in the informal opposition to Antonescu, approaching his old friends in the mainstream political parties. As early as January 1942, Cocea met with the National Peasantist leadership, probing its attitude toward the Soviet Union and the Romanian communists. Like them, Cocea was positively impressed that the PCR was turning into a [...] "patriotic" [...] party <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> on its pro-German stance. Around 1944, Cocea resumed contacts with the since-revived PCR. In June, Siguranța reported that he was rounding up support for communist sympathizer Mihai Ralea and his underground Socialist Peasants' Party. He later served as the communists' liaison with the National Liberal Party wing of Gheorghe Tătărescu (later, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu). Cocea's intervention contributed to a strategic alliance between the communists and the various other parties, within a coalition which Antonescu (see King Michael's Coup). Cocea's actress sister Alice, who was living in Nazi-occupied France, was taking a different path: she and her manager, Robert Capgras, had a friendly relationship with the Germans and were later deemed collaborators with the enemy.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with 'MaximoTV' on April 12, 2010, Ciara announced that the album would be titled, Basic Instinct. The title {{was inspired by the}} 1992 film of the same name, which starred Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas. Stone's character, Catherine Tramell, was a beautiful, seductive, and stealthy crime writer. Ciara told the interviewer [...] "When you get the record, you're gonna get a really fun vibe. You're gonna get an even more sensual side and also confident and cocky. I got like such an attitude on this record, but in such a fun way." [...] One song which follows this theme is [...] "I Run It," [...] Rap-Up described it as a sensual slow jam. The new album is said to sound much like Ciara's debut album, Goodies, and her 2006 single, [...] "Promise," [...] following on from comments made by Tricky Stewart that Ciara was going back to her roots with this album. Meanwhile, she told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul magazine, that [...] "Basic Instinct is really about her trusting her instinct <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the R/urban basics in her music – like where she first started, in the days of [...] "Goodies" [...] and [...] "1, 2 Step." [...] In a later interview with Maxim, she said [...] "The album is about our basic wants and desires. But I have to say, Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct was smart, a little shady, and she definitely had a sexy gangsta thing going on." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{spin-off}}, Bianca {{had fallen}} upon hard times, and accidentally got a visiting Ricky {{embroiled in a}} drugs heist. Despite talk of reconciling, Bianca opted to leave Ricky behind once again, leaving Liam in his care. The spin-off brought in various characters unrelated to the main serial, including Vince, Bianca's drug dealing boss played by Craig Charles, and Ricky's fiancée Cassie, played by Sally Ann Triplett. Both Ricky and Liam returned to the main serial as regular characters later that year, without Bianca. In an interview, Palmer discussed the spin-off and the reasons why {{she did not want}} to return to EastEnders: [...] "I have absolutely no desire to return to EastEnders. Not at all. In fact, I think that brief spin-off of a storyline for Ricky and Bianca was a double-edged sword. On one hand, I don't think we should ever have done it, it was a mistake on my behalf. But on the other, it convinced me that Bianca was someone that I did not want to see again. She was past history as far as I was concerned, I certainly learned that. Don't get me wrong, I had the time of my life when I was in EastEnders in the middle and late nineties and I worked with some terrific people both in front of and behind the camera. But that was then and this is now – the cast has nearly all changed <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> would be worse than foolish." [...] In August 2005, Palmer reiterated that she had no desire to return to EastEnders and branded the show [...] "rubbish".|$|E
