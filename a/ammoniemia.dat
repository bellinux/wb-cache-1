40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) multimodality evoked potentials (MEPs) {{and clinical}} findings were correlated in a 47 -year-old epileptic man in whom parenteral valproic acid (VPA) therapy induced severe comatose hyperammonemic encephalopathy without biological signs of hepatotoxicity (or hepatocytic dysfunction). Although the plasma VPA level remained within a normal therapeutic range, the <b>ammoniemia</b> increased to a toxic peak level at 411 micromol/l 24 h after symptom onset, requiring VPA therapy discontinuation. Brain MR monitoring demonstrated early cytotoxic edema evolving into delayed vasogenic edema and final brain atrophy. Concomitantly to abnormalities within the brainstem on MR images, {{an increase in}} brainstem conduction at MEPs and clinical disturbance of brainstem reflexes were observed at the initial phase of the disease course. Later, {{the resolution of the}} MR and MEPs abnormalities paralleled the clinical recovery of the reflexes...|$|E
40|$|Acquired hepatocerebral {{degeneration}} (AHD) {{is a rare}} type of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} characterized by neuropsychiatric symptomatology, and peculiar neuroradiologic findings, without the clinical evidence of Wilson’s disease (WD). We studied a patient with AHD responsive to penicillamine who was heterozygote carrier for a novel mutation in the ATP 7 B gene, and discussed the possible role of the mutation in facilitating {{the appearance of the}} syndrome. A 37 -year-old man with liver cirrhosis related to chronic hepatitis C was admitted because of progressive consciousness impairment. Family history was negative for WD. <b>Ammoniemia</b> was 176 lmol/L (NR, 9 – 33 lmol/L); total bilirubin 1. 71 mg/dL (NR, 0. 2 – 1. 3 mg/dL); serum albumin 2. 6 g/dL (NR, 3. 3 – 5 g/dL); AST 62 U/L (NR, 10 – 45 U/L). Electroencephalogram disclosed diffuse slow wave activity. After rifaximin, lactulose, and branched chain amino acid infusion, his arousal state went back normal in about 12 hours, and ammonia levels decreased to 94 lmol/L...|$|E
