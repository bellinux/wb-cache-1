40|$|The {{significance}} of the <b>braking</b> <b>devices</b> is increasing due to the intensification of manufacturing, increase in the moving masses, speeds of movement and frequency of braking. During a short time period the <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> needs to convert {{a significant amount of}} mechanical energy into heat energy and transfer it into the environment without compromising the operability of both devices and machines in general. For electric actuators braking a normally closed mechanical brake is frequently used. When disconnecting the motor from the network the brake friction surfaces are closed and prevent rotation, and when the motor is switched on, they are opens under the action of the electromagnet, electro-hydraulic pusher, special electric motor, mechanical or pneumatic device. In the case of joint implementation of the asynchronous motor and the mechanical brake, the drive of quick stop is more compact and convenient. Such devices are further called asynchronous motors with electromechanical braking systems henceforth. The large number of requirements as well as different conditions of operation cause a large variety of designs of such motors. One of the major shortcomings of the functioning of well-known design is the periodic wear of the friction linings and the need for frequent replacement of them. The solution to this problem is the use of asynchronous motor with recessed combo <b>braking</b> <b>device.</b> However, for some mechanisms that do not require a smooth stop of the motor shaft and that have a speed of rotation of the motor shaft less than 1500 rpm, more simple and cheap solution would be the use of an electromechanical <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> with an air gap compensation. Due to wear of the friction linings the air gap of the electromagnet increases. Due to the compensation of the air gap of the electromagnet these devices make it possible to rub the material of the friction lining longer. The current designs of the electromechanical <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> with compensation of the air gap are quite bulky and complicated to be manufactured. Therefore, the authors developed, experimentally investigated and implemented two new, simple and cheap designs of electromechanical <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> with compensation of the air gap. </p...|$|R

40|$|Time and the {{stopping}} {{distance of the}} electric drive with frequent starting-and-braking modes that contain embedded asynchronous motor with a recessed combined <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> depend on the moment of an electromagnet disinhibition. At the same time other important criteria are taken into the account, i. e. wear resistance of the <b>brake</b> <b>device</b> and the smoothness of the deceleration of the electric drive. In general such an asynchronous motor contains asynchronous engine with squirrel-cage rotor, electromechanical normally-closed brake, electromagnetical slip clutch and control circuit. The mechanical characteristics of the deceleration of asynchronous motor with recessed combined <b>brake</b> <b>device</b> at different moments of an electromagnet disinhibition are presented.  The mathematical model is featured and the transients in such a motor are presented.  Formation models for computer research were {{carried out in the}} Fortran 2008 programming language.

The deceleration of the electromechanical brake at various speeds caused different time values and {{stopping distance}}s.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{widespread}} methods to increase the power of internal-combustion engines (ICEs) is turbocharging. But turbochargers used for 70 % of engines {{have a number of}} essential disadvantages: their low service reliability as up to 30 % of engine failures are caused by turbochargers; their high price; their cost-demanding reconditioning caused by high labour inputs and considerable downtime periods of machine-tractor units; losses due to long downtime periods of machine-tractor units. ICE life reducing usual for those equipped with turbochargers is due to frequent high-temperature overloads abnormal for turbochargers. To reduce the thermal factor of turbocharger elements and the running-out durability can be possible when using a hydraulic accumulator and a <b>braking</b> <b>device.</b> Thus, a test bench is manufactured for examining the turbocharger with the proposed elements. As a result, we manage to avoid semidry and dry friction to extend the turbocharger life, with the rotor slowing time being reduced on average up to 30 – 35 % as compared with the normal (load-free) rotor slowing time. Thus, a hydraulic accumulator combined with a <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> can reduce turbocharger failures up to 10 – 15 %...|$|R

50|$|Dynamic ropes {{used for}} rock {{climbing}} {{come in a}} variety of lengths and diameters, with the most common lengths being 50, 60, and 70 meters (approximately 165, 200, and 230 feet, respectively). Lengths will vary depending on rope maintenance and age, and there are even ropes as long as 80 meters for specialized ascents on routes that would normally require a multi-pitch climbing attempt due to being only slightly longer than a standard rope length. Rope diameters are generally between 8.3mm and 11.5mm, with the different diameters used for slightly different purposes. Sport and multi-pitch trad climbers often value thinner ropes because they are lighter, and have less rope drag. Thinner ropes also run more smoothly through belay <b>devices,</b> especially assisted <b>braking</b> <b>devices</b> or 'tube-style' devices operated in 'guide mode', which can be tedious to pull thicker or stiffer rope through. Lighter, thinner ropes, however, have less strength than a thicker rope and will sustain fewer hard falls. Note that some belay devices are better suited for different rope diameters. This is particularly relevant with assisted <b>braking</b> <b>devices,</b> such as the Petzl Grigri (which, for example, works best with a 9.4-10.3 mm thick line) or the Faders SUM.
