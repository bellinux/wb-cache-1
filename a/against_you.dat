5|$|If {{you do not}} {{hurry to}} fight at sea, but keep your ships here and stay near land, or even advance into the Peloponnese, then, my lord, you will easily {{accomplish}} what you had in mind on coming here. The Hellenes {{are not able to}} hold out <b>against</b> <b>you</b> for a long time, but you will scatter them, and they will each flee to their own cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs <b>against</b> <b>you,</b> seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

500|$|Razz {{is a form}} of stud poker that is {{normally}} played for ace-to-five low (lowball poker). [...] The object of Razz is to make the lowest five-card possible hand from the seven cards you are dealt. [...] In Razz, straights and flushes do not count <b>against</b> <b>you</b> for low, and the ace always plays low. [...] The best possible Razz hand is 5-4-3-2-A, or 5 high, also known as [...] "the wheel" [...] or [...] "the bicycle". Deuce-to-seven Razz is also sometimes played.|$|E

500|$|Sarah Conlon won huge admiration in Ireland for {{her quiet}} dignity and refusal to feel bitterness. During {{the years that}} her husband and son were in jail, she sent weekly parcels of cigarettes, sweets, and Irish {{newspaper}} clippings to them, and saved up her prison visits for the two weeks of her annual holiday. Her regular letters to them always ended the same way: [...] "Pray for them ones who told lies <b>against</b> <b>you...</b> It's them who needs help as well as yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Once he {{was back}} in London Gordon-Cumming {{received}} a response to the letter he had written to Williams. Signed by the prince, Coventry and Williams, the note advised him that [...] "you must clearly understand that {{in the face of the}} overwhelming evidence <b>against</b> <b>you,</b> it is useless to attempt to deny the accusations". Gordon-Cumming wrote to Edward with a [...] "final appeal to show how utterly it remains in your power to utterly damn, morally and physically, one who has ever been a loyal and devoted subject": it went unanswered by prince and courtiers.|$|E
500|$|O'Brien {{claimed that}} all of the {{evidence}} given against him was false, and that as an American citizen he ought not to be facing trial in a UK court. He then went on at length to condemn the British government, the [...] "imbecile and tyrannical rulers" [...] of Ireland, until he was interrupted by the judge, who appealed to him to cease his remarks: [...] "The only effect of your observations must be to tell <b>against</b> <b>you</b> with those who have to consider the sentence. I advise you to say nothing more of that sort. I do so entirely for your own sake." ...|$|E

Gardiner calls the music [...] "a vivid pen-portrait of Satan and his wiles, {{delivered}} with typically Lutheran relish". The rhythm alternates between 6/8 and 3/4 one measure to the next, but {{the change is}} irregular and unpredictable. The bass line (marked [...] "") is [...] "extravagantly animated and angular. Albert Schweitzer likens it to the contortions of a huge dragon".|$|E
500|$|Jesus calls {{people to}} repent their sins and to devote {{themselves}} completely to God. Jesus tells {{his followers to}} adhere to Jewish law, although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself, for example regarding the Sabbath. When asked what the greatest commandment is, Jesus replies: [...] "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind... And a second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself" [...] (...) [...] Other ethical teachings of Jesus include , refraining from hatred and lust, turning the other cheek, and forgiving people who have sinned <b>against</b> <b>you</b> (Matthew 5–7).|$|E
500|$|Kraft could, however, {{be a tough}} taskmaster, {{making it}} clear that there was no place in the flight {{operations}} division for those who {{failed to live up to}} his exacting standards. [...] "To err is human," [...] went one of his favorite sayings, [...] "but to do so more than once is contrary to Flight Operations Directorate policy." [...] Subordinates who seriously displeased Kraft could find themselves deprived of the opportunity to make it up to him. Kraft possessed the power to end careers at Johnson Space Center; as mission controller Sy Liebergot recalled, [...] "if he was behind you, you had as much leverage as you needed; if he was <b>against</b> <b>you,</b> you were dead meat." ...|$|E

You should clearly have faced up like {{a man at the}} overwhelming nature of the Crown's case <b>against</b> <b>you</b> but you chose to put the victims' families through misery which you compounded by this trial." [...] The motive for Smith's actions remained unclear after the trial, but police believed a [...] "lack of permanent sexual relations" [...] had been a contributing factor.|$|E
500|$|One of the crew, Louie (an uncredited Lawrence Tierney), {{tells the}} captain he should pull in to port {{and take on}} new crew. The captain says [...] "You know, there are captains who might hold this <b>against</b> <b>you,</b> Louie." [...] Shortly after, the captain closes the hatch to the chain locker with Louie inside, and Louie is crushed to death by the chain. Merriam {{believes}} that Captain Stone, who is obsessed with authority, did it intentionally. When they dock at the fictional Caribbean island of [...] "San Sebastian" [...] (which had appeared in RKO's I Walked with a Zombie—another Lewton production—and later in RKO's Zombies on Broadway), Merriam attempts to expose the Captain's madness at a board of inquiry. The crew all speak favorably of the captain, including the Greek, who credits the captain with saving his life. Merriam states his intention to leave the Altair.|$|E
500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, I never get the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually when you say 'no,' they hold it <b>against</b> <b>you</b> for the rest of your career. I've experienced that." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{research}} concluded upon Inside the Third Reich, Speer had {{donated the}} edited Chronik to the German Federal Archives in Koblenz in July 1969. [...] David Irving compared the donated Chronik {{with a copy}} of the Chronik for 1943 in the Imperial War Museum in London, and discovered discrepancies. [...] Irving asked the Archives and Speer the reason for the differences (which were minor compared with previous years). [...] Speer requested an explanation from Wolters, and Wolters admitted the censorship by letter in January 1970, saying, [...] "I wouldn't have put it past the Ludwigsbergern [...] to launch an additional prosecution <b>against</b> <b>you</b> on the pretext that this charge [...] {{was not included in the}} Nuremberg Indictment." [...] Speer suggested that the pages of the Chronik dealing with the Jews should not exist, and informed the Archives that the original of the Chronik, from which the copy given to the Archives had been made, had disappeared. [...] Wolters did not destroy the original as Speer had hinted.|$|E
500|$|That August, Brownlee {{received}} a letter from MacLean reading in part [...] "We have been instructed to commence action <b>against</b> <b>you</b> for damages for the seduction of Miss Vivian MacMillan." [...] Later that month, he took advantage of a recess in the federal Royal Commission on Banking and Currency, of which he was a member, to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson. [...] He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan, who initially refused to let him into the house and asked him to leave. [...] She eventually relented and let him in; he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian's future, to which she responded [...] "what about you?" [...] Concluding that the meeting was pointless, Brownlee parted by announcing [...] "I am not asking you to refrain from your action, but I {{want to tell you that}} the allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ... If its money you are after, I haven't got it." ...|$|E
500|$|Braun {{collected}} several awards at season's end. He won the 2007 NL Rookie of the Year Award in a vote by 32 {{members of}} the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He beat out Troy Tulowitzki by 2 points in the closest NL vote since the system was revised in 1980. Of all prior NL Rookies of the Year, only Pujols and Willie McCovey hit for higher batting averages in their rookie year. Braun was voted the 2007 NL Sporting News Rookie of the Year by 488 major league players and 30 managers. Braun also received the 2007 Players Choice NL Most Outstanding Rookie in a vote by his fellow major league players. [...] "When your peers recognize you with an award, that's great", he said. [...] "Those are the guys {{out there on the}} field with you, competing <b>against</b> <b>you.</b> Their opinion counts the most, for a player." [...] In voting for the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, Braun received two 10th-place votes and finished 24th overall.|$|E
