These software may be flexible enough to be upgraded according {{to the needs of}} the user. AutoMan implements the high level programming language, so that users can make automated decisions at any step of the process. The GAL implementation in AutoMan allows the user to insert high-level language-interpreted code into exit points in the operating systems process.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} note down {{small pieces of}} information, quickly and ubiquitously, can be useful. This paper proposes a system called PhonePoint Pen that uses the in-built {{accelerometer}} in mobile phones to recognize human writing. By holding the phone like <b>a</b> pen, <b>an</b> <b>user</b> <b>should</b> {{be able to write}} short messages or even draw simple diagrams in air. The acceleration due to hand gestures can be converted into an image, and sent to the user’s Internet email address for future reference. We motivate the utility of such a system through simple use-cases and applications, and present the design and implementation challenges towards a functional prototype. Our early results show that the PhonePoint Pen is feasible if the user is restricted to a few simple constraints...|$|R

50|$|A partial tang {{knife or}} sword is {{generally}} not able to leverage as much force against the resistance of material being cut as a full tang design would allow. This limits the amount of force which <b>a</b> <b>user</b> <b>should</b> apply to the handle of such a weapon. Such designs may be optimal in light-weight knives or swords designed to be kept extremely sharp and used to cut less-resistant materials. Scalpels and Japanese samurai swords {{are perhaps the most}} well-known examples of such tools.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{desirable}} characteristics of an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) is the capability of interacting with <b>users</b> in <b>a</b> human-like manner.

In this work we propose an improvement of our previous system to generate multimodal backchannel signals on visual and acoustic modalities. A perceptual study has been performed to understand how context-free multimodal backchannels are interpreted by users. ...|$|R
