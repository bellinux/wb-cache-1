40|$|Recently, an {{oxygenator}} with {{an integrated}} centrifugal blood pump (IP) {{was designed to}} minimize priming volume and to reduce blood foreign surface contact even further. The use of this oxygenator with or without integrated <b>arterial</b> <b>filter</b> was compared with a conventional oxygenator and nonintegrated centrifugal pump. To compare the air removal characteristics 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were alternately assigned into one of three groups to be perfused with a minimized extracorporeal circuit either with the conventional oxygenator, the oxygenator with IP, or the oxygenator with IP plus integrated <b>arterial</b> <b>filter</b> (IAF). Air entering and leaving the three devices was measured accurately with a bubble counter during cardiopulmonary bypass. No significant differences between all groups were detected, considering air entering the devices. Our major finding was that in both integrated devices groups incidental spontaneous release of air into the arterial line in approximately 40 % of the patients was observed. Here, detectable bolus air (> 500 µm) was shown in the arterial line, whereas in the minimal extracorporeal circulation circuit (MECC) group this phenomenon was not present. We decided to conduct an amendment of the initial design with METC-approval. Ten patients were assigned to be perfused with an oxygenator with IP and IAF. Importantly, the integrated perfusion systems used in these patients were flushed with carbon dioxide (CO 2) prior to priming of the systems. In the group with CO 2 flush no spontaneous air release was observed in all cases and this was {{significantly different from the}} initial study with the group with the integrated device and IAF. This suggests that air spilling may be caused by residual air in the integrated device. In conclusion, integration of a blood pump may cause spontaneous release of large air bubbles (> 500 µm) into the arterial line, despite the presence of an integrated <b>arterial</b> <b>filter.</b> CO 2 flushing of an integrated cardiopulmonary bypass system prior to priming may prevent spontaneous air release and is strongly recommended to secure patient safet...|$|E

Recently, <b>arterial</b> <b>filters</b> were integrated in two neonatal oxygenators to reduce volume and foreign surface area. In this study a clinical CPB scenario was simulated. The oxygenators, the corresponding venous reservoirs and the complete CPB circuits were compared regarding air removal and bubble size distribution after the introduction of an air bolus or GME. During a GME challenge, the Capiox FX 05 oxygenator removed a significantly higher volume of GME than the QUADROX-i Neonatal oxygenator (97 % vs. 86 %). Detailed air removal characteristics showed that more GME {{in the range of}} 20 - 50 mu m were leaving the devices than were entering. This phenomenon seems to be more present in the Capiox FX 05. The circuits were also challenged with an air bolus. Each individual component tested removed 99. 9 %, which resulted in an air volume reduction of 99. 99 % by either complete CBP circuit. Overall, we conclude that both CPB systems were very adequate in removing GME and gross air. The air removal properties of both systems are considered safe and reliable.

We evaluated the role of leukocyte filtration on hospital outcome and postoperative morbidity. Methods Eighty-two consecutive patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive leukocyte <b>filters</b> on both <b>arterial</b> and cardioplegia lines or standard <b>arterial</b> <b>filters</b> during cardiopulmonary bypass. Hospital outcome, postoperative markers of morbidity, and biochemical assays were compared. Data were collected preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. Costs for patients receiving intraoperative leukofiltration were compared with control patients getting standard <b>arterial</b> <b>filters.</b> Results Hospital mortality and intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were similar. Although duration of ventilation and incidence of pneumonia were comparable, leukocyte-depleted patients showed a higher ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (p = 0. 008) and lower need for postoperative noninvasive ventilation (p = 0. 041). Control patients showed higher need for continuous furosemide infusion (p = 0. 013) and for renal replacement therapy (p = 0. 014), in association with higher serum creatinine (p = 0. 038) and blood urea (p = 0. 18) and lower glomerular filtration rate (p = 0. 038). Leukocyte-depleted patients required lower doses of inotropic agents (p = 0. 56), whereas troponin I leakage and incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation were comparable. No differences were found in terms of postoperative cerebral dysfunction or neutrophil and platelet counts, as well as postoperative bleeding and need for transfusions. Finally, leukodepletion proved significantly cost-beneficial, with a 37 % cost reduction. Conclusions Although hospital outcomes were similar in terms of mortality and length of stay, the improvements in pulmonary, renal, and myocardial function, in association with the cost benefit, justify the use of leukocyte-depletion filters in the clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCardiopulmonary bypass {{circuits}} cause morbidity during cardiac operations. Plasma {{proteins and}} cellular components are stimulated by {{contact with the}} cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and can cause bleeding and postperfusion syndrome. This {{is especially true in}} patients undergoing reoperative cardiac procedures, which carries a higher risk of postoperative bleeding and prolonged ventilation compared with primary cardiac surgical procedures. Recently, cardiopulmonary bypass circuit surfaces have been coated with antithrombotic agents to improve their biocompatibility. This study evaluated the effect of a heparin-coated cardiopulmonary bypass system (Duraflo II, Baxter Bentley Healthcare Systems, Irvine, Calif.) on thrombin formation, platelet stimulation, and leukocyte activation in patients undergoing reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting or valve operation. Fifty patients were selected and randomly assigned to a standard noncoated control system (n = 26) or the Duraflo heparin-coated system (n = 24). Similar heparin doses were used in both groups (3 mg/kg). The heparin-coated group used a completely heparin-coated bypass circuit including the cardiotomy reservoir; <b>arterial</b> <b>filters</b> were heparin-coated in both groups. Samples were obtained before cardiopulmonary bypass, 30 minutes into cardiopulmonary bypass, 5 minutes after crossclamp removal, and 5 minutes after protamine administration. Thrombin formation (thrombin-antithrombin III by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) and platelet activation (β-thromboglobulin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; P-selectin expression by flow cytometry) were assayed. Leukocyte activation was determined by quantitative and qualitative analysis of <b>arterial</b> <b>filters</b> by scanning electron microscopy in six patients from each group. In both circuits, thrombin values increased markedly 30 minutes into cardiopulmonary bypass compared with baseline values (p < 0. 001) (heparin-coated, 7 ± 5 to 96 ± 115 ng/ml; noncoated, 10 ± 9 to 115 ± 125 ng/ml). Platelet activation as measured by β-thromboglobulin (heparin-coated, 104 ± 100 to 284 ± 166 IU/ml; noncoated, 81 ± 74 to 288 ± 277 IU/ml) and P-selectin expression (heparin-coated, 1. 5 % ± 1. 5 % to 6. 4 % ± 6. 1 %; noncoated, 1. 4 % ± 1. 1 % to 6. 2 % ± 4. 3 %) also significantly increased 30 minutes into cardiopulmonary bypass compared with baseline values (p < 0. 001). Platelet activation and thrombin generation did not differ between the two circuits at any time. Granulocyte activation and platelet deposition did not differ between the two circuits when <b>arterial</b> <b>filters</b> were evaluated. Both groups had similar heparin and protamine administration, blood transfusions, postoperative alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, time to extubation, length of intensive care unit stay, and overall morbidity and mortality. Clinical outcome and blood loss did not differ between the groups. We conclude that heparin-coated cardiopulmonary bypass circuits did not improve biochemical or clinical markers of biocompatibility in a reoperative patient population.

Gaseous microemboli {{may contribute to the}} adverse outcome after cardiac surgery. Recently, two oxygenator models with or without integrated <b>arterial</b> <b>filter</b> (IAF) were designed and only differ in size, leading to a change of 20 % in surface area of the hollow fibers and 25 % in blood velocities. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the air removal characteristics of the inspire oxygenators with or without IAF. Sixty-eight patients were randomly assigned to four different groups: optimized adult and full adult and an additional IAF. Gaseous microemboli reduction rates were measured with a bubble counter. The number of GME reduction rates showed no differences. However, both models reduced significantly less volume of GME (optimized adult: 40. 6 % and full adult: 50. 3 %) compared with both models with IAF (88. 7 % and 88. 5 %, respectively). No significant differences of reduction rates were found between both devices without IAF and also not between both models with IAF. In conclusion, the larger inspire oxygenator tends to remove more GME. No effect from size of oxygenator device with integrated screen filter on GME reduction was observed.

40|$|At present, air {{handling}} of a membrane oxygenator is generally studied {{by using an}} ultrasonic sound bubble counter. However, {{this is not a}} quantitative method and it does not give any information on where air was entrapped in the oxygenator and if it eventually was removed through the membrane for gas exchange. The study presented here gives a novel technique for the determination of the air-handling characteristics of a membrane oxygenator. The study aimed at defining not only the amount of air released by the oxygenator, but also the amount of air trapped within the oxygenator and/or removed through the gas exchange membrane. Two neonatal membrane oxygenators without the use of an <b>arterial</b> <b>filter</b> were investigated: the Polystan Microsafe and the Dideco Lilliput. Although the air trap function of both oxygenators when challenged with a bolus of air was similar, the Microsafe obtained this effect mainly by capturing the air in the heat exchanger compartment while the Lilliput did remove a large amount of air through the membrane. In conclusion, the difference in trap function was most striking during continuous infusion of air. Immediate contact with a microporous membrane, avoidance of high velocities within the oxygenator, pressure drop, transit time and construction of the fibre mat all contribute to the air-handling characteristics of a membrane oxygenator...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{myocardial}} reperfusion injury is exacerbated by free radicals when pure oxygen is used during cardiopulmonary bypass. Partial replacement of the oxygenator gas mixture with nitrogen, however, such as has already been adopted clinically in many centers, could {{increase the risk of}} gaseous nitrogen microembolus formation and therefore of brain damage because of the low solubility of nitrogen, particularly under conditions of hypothermia. Methods: Ten 7 - to 10 -kg piglets were cooled for 30 minutes to 15 °C on cardiopulmonary bypass and then rewarmed for 40 minutes to 37 °C. In 5 piglets cardiopulmonary bypass was normoxic and in 5 it was hyperoxic. In each group 3 bubble oxygenators without <b>arterial</b> <b>filters</b> and 2 membrane oxygenators with filters were used. Cerebral microemboli were monitored continuously by carotid Doppler ultrasonography (8 MHz) and intermittently by fluorescence retinography. Results: Embolus count was greater with lower rectal temperature (P <. 001), use of a bubble oxygenator (P <. 001), and lower oxygen concentration (P =. 021) but was not affected by the temperature gradient between blood and body during cooling or rewarming. Conclusions: Gaseous microemboli are increased with normoxic perfusion, but this is only important if a bubble oxygenator without a filter is used.

The primary outcome was the procedural phase-related rate of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) on transcranial Doppler ultrasound. HITS rate {{was used as a}} surrogate of cerebral microembolism in pre-defined procedural phases in SAVR using MiECC or CECC with (+F) or without (-F) an oxygenator with integrated <b>arterial</b> <b>filter.</b> Forty-eight patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to MiECC or CECC. Due to intraprocedural Doppler signal loss (n[*]=[*] 3), 45 patients were included in final analysis. MiECC perfusion regimen showed a significantly increased HITS rate compared to CECC (by a factor of 1. 75; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 19 - 2. 56). This was due to different HITS rates in procedural phases from aortic cross-clamping until declamping [phase 4] (P[*]=[*] 0. 01), and from aortic declamping until stop of extracorporeal perfusion [phase 5] (P[*]=[*] 0. 05). Post hoc analysis revealed that MiECC-F generated a higher HITS rate than CECC+F (P[*]=[*] 0. 005), CECC-F (P[*]=[*] 0. 05) in phase 4, and CECC-F (P[*]=[*] 0. 03) in phase 5, respectively. In open-heart surgery, MiECC is not superior to CECC with regard to gaseous cerebral microembolism. When using MiECC for SAVR, the use of oxygenators with integrated arterial line filter appears highly advisable. Only with this precaution, MiECC confers a cerebral microembolic load comparable to CECC during this type of open heart surgery...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives: The {{proliferation}} of minimally invasive cardiac surgery has increased dependence on augmented venous return techniques for cardiopulmonary bypass. Such augmented techniques {{have the potential}} to introduce venous air emboli, which can pass to the patient. We examined the potential for the transmission of air emboli with different augmented venous return techniques. Methods: In vitro bypass systems with augmented venous drainage were created with either kinetically augmented or vacuum-augmented venous return. Roller or centrifugal pumps were used for arterial perfusion in combination with a hollow fiber oxygenator and a 40 -μm <b>arterial</b> <b>filter.</b> Air was introduced into the venous line via an open 25 -gauge needle. Test conditions involved varying the amount of negative venous pressure, the augmented venous return technique, and the arterial pump type. Measurements were recorded at the following sites: pre-arterial pump, post-arterial pump, post-oxygenator, and patient side. Results: Kinetically augmented venous return quickly filled the centrifugal venous pump with macrobubbles requiring continuous manual clearing; a steady state to test for air embolism could not be achieved. Vacuum-augmented venous return handled the air leakage satisfactorily and microbubbles per minute were measured. Higher vacuum pressures resulted in delivery of significantly more microbubbles to the “patient” (P <. 001). The use of an arterial centrifugal pump was associated with fewer microbubbles (P =. 02). Conclusions: Some augmented venous return configurations permit a significant quantity of microbubbles to reach the patient despite filtration. A centrifugal pump has air-handling disadvantages when used for kinetic venous drainage, but when used as an arterial pump in combination with vacuum-assisted venous drainage it aids in clearing air emboli.

All patients had a 40 micron (Pall) filter in the coronary suction line. Significant changes in cerebral blood flow occurred during extracorporeal circulation (p less than 0. 0001). For all patients cerebral blood flow increased from a resting prebypass level of 30 to 46 and 57 ml/ 100 g a minute during initial and stable hypothermic extracorporeal circulation respectively. Both measurements were obtained at 26 degrees C and the recordings were made on average 12 and 55 minutes after the extracorporeal circulation was started. During rewarming cerebral blood flow increased to 64, 53, 41, and 36 ml/g a minute at 31 degrees, 33 degrees, 35 degrees, and 37 degrees C respectively, and when measured four and 16 minutes on average after bypass it was 44 and 41 ml/ 100 g a minute. This general brain hyperperfusion was noticed in all patients with a high enough mean blood pressure to produce hyperaemia. Interposing 20 and 40 micron arterial filters reduced cerebral blood flow but did not prevent this hyperaemia.

Methods: Sixteen 1 -week-old piglets underwent cardiopulmonary bypass, were cooled to 18 °C, and underwent 60 minutes of circulatory arrest, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion and rewarming. Global and regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygen metabolism, and renal blood flow were determined before cardiopulmonary bypass, after the institution of cardiopulmonary bypass, and at 1 hour of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. In the study group (n = 8 piglets), a leukocyte-depleting arterial blood filter was placed in the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. Results: With cardiopulmonary bypass, no detectable change occurred in the cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygen metabolism, and renal blood flow in either group, compared with before cardiopulmonary bypass. In control animals, after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, blood flow was reduced to all regions of the brain (P. 1). The cerebral oxygen metabolism fell to 66. 0 % ± 22. 3 % of the level before deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, which was greater than the recovery in the control animals but not significantly so (P =. 5). After deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, the renal blood flow fell to 81. 0 % ± 29. 5 % of the value before deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (P =. 06). Improvement in renal blood flow in the leukocyte filter group was not significantly greater than the recovery to 70. 2 % ± 26. 3 % in control animals (P =. 47). Conclusions: After a period of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, there is a significant reduction in cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygen metabolism, and renal blood flow. Leukocyte depletion with an in-line <b>arterial</b> <b>filter</b> does not appear to significantly improve these findings in the neonatal piglet. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2000; 119 : 1262 - 9...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) {{has been}} shown to induce a {{systemic}} inflammatory response similar to the local reaction seen after tissue damage [1]. This leads to the release of toxic substances, such as elastase, which cause endothelial damage and may adversely affect outcome [2]. Use of a leucocyte depleting <b>arterial</b> line <b>filter</b> is one of many anti-inflammatory strategies that are undergoing evaluation. Leucocyte depleting filters may be capable of selectively removing activated white cells [3], but this has not been proved in vivo. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare sequential total and activated white cells during CPB, using either a leucocyte depleting or standard <b>arterial</b> line <b>filter.</b> Materials and methods After local ethical committee approval, 20 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting using CPB were prospectively randomly allocated to have either a Leukogard LG– 6 (Pall Biomedical, Portsmouth, UK) or a nonleucocyte depleting filter inserted into the arterial line of the CPB circuit. Arterial limb blood samples were taken immediately after institution of CPB (0 min) and at 10 –min intervals throughout the bypass period. Activated white cells were identified using nitroblue tetrazolium, then both total and activated white cell numbers counted after staining with Leucoplate. Results Table 1 shows the number of white cells counted/ 1. 25 ? l (volume of a single channel of Nageotte counting chamber) using light microscopy (× 25). Conclusion The LG 6 leucocyte filter reduces the total white cell count and is capable of selectively removing activated white cells during CPB. The exact relationship between leucocyte depletion and improved patient outcome still remains unclear...|$|R
40|$|Background There is some {{evidence}} for the benefits of leukodepletion in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. Its effectiveness in higher risk patients, such as those undergoing heart valve surgery, particularly in terms of overall clinical outcomes, is currently unclear. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of leukodepletion on clinical, patient-reported and economic outcomes in patients undergoing heart valve surgery. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 3 of 12) in The Cochrane Library, the NHS Economic Evaluations Database (1960 to April 2013), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to April week 2 2013), EMBASE Ovid (1947 to Week 15 2013), CINAHL (1982 to April 2013) and Web of Science (1970 to 17 April 2013) on 19 April 2013. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trials database and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN) in April 2013 for ongoing studies. No language or time period restrictions were applied. We examined the reference lists of all included randomised controlled trials and contacted authors of identified trials. We searched the 'grey' literature at OpenGrey and handsearched relevant conference proceedings. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing a leukocyte-depleting <b>arterial</b> line <b>filter</b> with a standard <b>arterial</b> line <b>filter,</b> on the <b>arterial</b> outflow of the heart-lung bypass circuit, in elective patients undergoing heart valve surgery. Data collection and analysis Data were collected on the study characteristics, three primary outcomes (1. post-operative in-hospital all-cause mortality within three months, 2. post-operative all-cause mortality excluding inpatient mortality < 30 days, 3. length of stay in hospital, 4. adverse events and serious adverse events) and seven secondary outcomes (1. tubular or glomerular kidney injury, 2. validated health-related quality of life scales, 3. validated renal injury scales, 4. use of continuous veno-venous haemo-filtration, 5. length of stay in intensive care, 6. costs of care). Data were extracted by one author and verified by a second author. Insufficient data were available to perform a meta-analysis or sensitivity analysis. Main results Eight studies were eligible {{for inclusion in the}} review but data on prespecified review outcomes were available from only one, modestly powered (24 participants) study (Hurst 1997). There were no differences between a leuko-depleting versus standard filter in length of stay {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) (mean difference (MD) 0. 80 days; 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 24 to 1. 84) or length of hospital stay (MD 0. 20 days; 95 % CI - 1. 78 to 2. 18). Authors' conclusions There are currently insufficient good quality trials with valve surgery patients to inform recommendations for changes in clinical practice. A future National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) -funded feasibility study (recruiting mid-year 2013) comparing leukodepletion with a standard <b>arterial</b> line <b>filter</b> in patients undergoing elective heart valve surgery (the ROLO trial) will be the largest study to date and will make a significant contribution to future updates of this review...|$|R
40|$|Neurologic {{complications}} after {{cardiac surgery}} are of growing importance for an aging surgical population. In this review, we provide a critical {{appraisal of the}} impact of current cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) management strategies on neurologic complications. Other than the use of 20 – 40 �m <b>arterial</b> line <b>filters</b> and membrane oxygenators, newer modifications of the basic CPB apparatus or the use of specialized equipment or procedures (including hypothermia and “tight” glucose control) have unproven benefit on neurologic outcomes. Epiaortic ultrasound can be considered for ascending aorta manipulations to avoid atheroma, although available clinical trials assessing this maneuver are limited. Current approaches for managing flow, arterial blood pressure, and pH during CPB are supported by data from clinical investigations, but these studies included few elderly or high-risk patients and predated many other contemporary practices. Although there are promising data on the benefits of some drugs blocking excitatory amino acid signaling pathways and inflammation, there are currently no drugs that can be recommended for neuroprotection during CPB. Together, th...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: Laboratory {{studies suggest}} that {{myocardial}} reperfusion injury is exacerbated by free radicals when pure oxygen is used during cardiopulmonary bypass. In phase I of this study we demonstrated that normoxic perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass does not {{increase the risk of}} microembolic brain injury so long as a membrane oxygenator with an <b>arterial</b> <b>filter</b> is used. In phase II of this study we studied the hypothesis that normoxic perfusion increases the risk of hypoxic brain injury after deep hypothermia with circulatory arrest. Methods: With membrane oxygenators with arterial filters, 10 piglets (8 - 10 kg) underwent 120 minutes of deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest at 15 °C, were rewarmed to 37 °C, and were weaned from bypass. In 5 piglets normoxia (PaO 2 64 - 181 mm Hg) was used during cardiopulmonary bypass and in 5 hyperoxia (PaO 2 400 - 900 mm Hg) was used. After 6 hours of reperfusion the brain was fixed for histologic evaluation. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor cerebral oxyhemoglobin and oxidized cytochrome a,a 3 concentrations. Results: Histologic examination revealed a significant increase in brain damage in the normoxia group (score 12. 4 versus 8. 6, P =. 01), especially in the neocortex and hippocampal regions. Cytochrome a,a 3 and oxyhemoglobin concentrations tended to be lower during deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest in the normoxia group (P =. 16). Conclusions: In the setting of prolonged deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest with membrane oxygenators, normoxic cardiopulmonary bypass significantly increases histologically graded brain damage with respect to hyperoxic cardiopulmonary bypass. Near-infrared spectroscopy suggests that the mechanism is hypoxic injury, which presumably overwhelms any injury caused by increased oxygen free radicals.

40|$|Left heart bypass (LHBP) with heparin coated {{perfusion}} equipment {{including an}} <b>arterial</b> <b>filter</b> (pore size: 40 microns) {{was performed in}} five canine experiments after full systemic heparinization (heparin 300 IU/kg; activated coagulation time [ACT] > 480 sec). The heparin coated filter was replaced after 45 min with a second heparin coated filter. Protamine (1 : 1) was added after 45 min and perfusion was continued for another 45 min before the second filter was replaced with an uncoated control filter. In addition to continuous hemodynamic monitoring, all filters were disassembled and analyzed morphometrically with a scanning electron microscope (deposits on screens were expressed as percent of surface covered with fibrin or number of cells/ 100 micron 2, respectively). For the first heparin coated filter (ACT > 480), 0. 3 +/- 0. 5 % of the surface was covered with fibrin, 0. 7 +/- 0. 7 % with platelets, and 0. 02 +/- 0. 0 % with red cells. For the second heparin coated filter exposed to neutralization of heparin with protamine, surface coverage was fibrin in 22 +/- 15 %, platelets in 3. 2 +/- 0. 8 %, and red cells in 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 % (p < 0. 05 for all comparisons with filter 1). For uncoated control filters (ACT = 120), surface coverage was fibrin in 31 +/- 33 %, platelets in 3. 7 +/- 2. 9 %, and red cells in 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 % (not significant [NS] for all comparisons with filter 2). Although all arterial filters {{used in this study}} remained patent throughout the scheduled period, it became clear that protamine given during perfusion reduces the antithrombotic activity of bonded heparin. Hence, protaminization during perfusion with heparin coated equipment cannot be recommended...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveNeuropsychologic {{disorders}} are common after {{coronary artery bypass}} operations. Air microbubbles are identified as a contributing factor. A dynamic bubble trap might {{reduce the number of}} gaseous microemboli. MethodsA total of 50 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operation were recruited for this study. In 26 patients a dynamic bubble trap was placed between the <b>arterial</b> <b>filter</b> and the aortic cannula (group 1), and in 24 patients a placebo dynamic bubble trap was used (group 2). The number of high-intensity transient signals within the proximal middle cerebral artery was continuously measured on both sides during bypass, which was separated into 4 periods: phase 1, start of bypass until aortic clamping; phase 2, aortic clamping until rewarming; phase 3, rewarming until clamp removal; and phase 4, clamp removal until end of bypass. S 100 β values were measured before, immediately after, and 6 and 48 hours after the operation and before hospital discharge. ResultsThe bubble elimination rate during bypass was 77 % in group 1 and 28 % in group 2 (P <. 0001). The number of high-intensity signals was lower in group 1 during phase 1 (5. 8 ± 7. 3 vs 16 ± 15. 4, P <. 05 vs group 2) and phase 2 (6. 9 ± 7. 3 vs 24. 2 ± 27. 3, P <. 05 vs group 2) but not during phases 3 and 4. Serum S 100 β values were equally increased in both groups immediately after the operation. Group 2 patients had higher S 100 β values 6 hours after the operation and significantly higher S 100 β values 48 hours after the operation (0. 06 ± 0. 14 vs 0. 18 ± 0. 24, P =. 0133 vs group 2). Age and S 100 β values were correlated in group 2 but not in group 1. ConclusionGaseous microemboli can be removed with a dynamic bubble trap.

40|$|The {{activated}} {{clotting time}} (ACT) with a Hemochron system for determining heparin requirements during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, (CPB) accompanied by hemodilution and hypothermia was evaluated using plasma heparin levels as a standard. In 28 {{patients who were}} administered a standard heparin regimen (300 units/kg prebypass, 8000 units in the pump prime and 100 units/kg hourly during CPB) mean prebypass plasma heparin was 4 units/ml, and ACT was 493 seconds. During CPB mean plasma heparin decreased significantly (p < 0. 001) to 3. 1 units/ml, whereas mean ACT increased significantly (p < 0. 001) to 674 seconds. The mean protamine requirement predicted from ACT was significantly higher (43 %) than predicted from plasma heparin levels or actual protamine administered. The ACT neither accurately reflected plasma heparin during CPB nor predicted protamine requirements. The fixed-dose regimen employed, however, prevented both intraoperative thrombosis, assessed clinically in all patients, and clotting on six <b>arterial</b> line <b>filters,</b> as determined by scanning EM, despite wide variations in ACT and plasma heparin levels during surgery...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to reduce the {{negative}} sequelae of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), {{a variety of new}} technologies have been created. This study investigates variations in the application of these technologies throughout Great Britain and Ireland (GB and I). All perfusion departments within GB and I were surveyed about equipment and technologies used in CPB. Eighty-five percent of units use a standard <b>arterial</b> line <b>filter</b> in all cases. Forty percent of units occasionally use leukocyte-depleting filters in various sites within the circuit. Sixteen percent always use some element of heparin-bonded circuit, but 62 % never use them. Twenty-five percent use solely rotary pumps, 18 % use solely centrifugal pumps, and 56 % use both. Finally, 20 % are now using minimal extracorporeal circulation in certain clinical scenarios. These decisions are most frequently affected by clinician preference and cost. This survey has highlighted significant variation in the utilization of various technologies used in CPB. While some variation between centers is to be expected, as innovative technologies are adopted at varying rates, surveys such as this are useful for alerting clinicians to gaps between evidence-based knowledge and clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveCardiopulmonary bypass elicits {{systemic}} inflammation. Depletion of circulating leukocytes might alleviate inflammatory response. We {{studied the}} effects of a leukocyte-depleting filter on phagocyte activation during cardiopulmonary bypass. MethodsFifty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly allocated into an <b>arterial</b> line leukocyte <b>filter</b> group (n = 25) with a Pall LeukoGuard 6 leukocyte-depleting filter (LG 6; Pall Biomedical, Portsmouth, United Kingdom) and a control group without any filter (n = 25). Blood sampling took place from arterial line at predetermined time points. In the filter group, the sample was taken immediately before the filter; to evaluate activation at the site, an additional sample was taken immediately after the filter. CD 11 b/CD 18 and L-selectin expressions and basal production of hydrogen peroxide were determined with whole-blood flow cytometry, and plasma lactoferrin level was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ResultsNeutrophil CD 11 b expression was higher in the filter group than in the control group (P <. 001). Likewise, monocyte CD 11 b expression, neutrophil hydrogen peroxide production, and lactoferrin plasma levels were all significantly higher, whereas neutrophil and monocyte counts and neutrophil L-selectin expression were all significantly lower in the filter group (all P <. 001). At 5 minutes of CPB, CD 11 b expression increased across the filter on neutrophils (median difference 197 relative fluorescence units, range 45 – 431 relative fluorescence units, P <. 001) and monocytes (median difference 26 relative fluorescence units, range − 68 – 111 relative fluorescence units, P <. 001).

40|$|Endotoxaemia {{is thought}} to occur in cardiac surgery using extracorporeal {{circulation}} (ECC) and a positive correlation has been proposed between the magnitude of endotoxaemia and risk for postoperative complications. We studied {{the effects of a}} new endotoxin adsorber device (Alteco(R) LPS adsorber) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with ECC, with special reference to safety and ease of use. Fifteen patients undergoing coronary artery bypass and/or valvular surgery were studied. In 9 patients, the LPS Adsorber was included in the bypass circuit between the <b>arterial</b> <b>filter</b> and the venous reservoir. Flow through the adsorber was started when the aorta was clamped and stopped at the end of perfusion. Flow rate was kept at 150 ml/min. Six patients served as controls with no adsorber in the circuit. Samples were taken for analysis of endotoxin, TNFalpha, IL- 1 ss and IL- 6 as well as complement factors C 3, C 4 and C 1 q. Whole blood coagulation status was evaluated using thromboelastograpy (TEG) and platelet count. No adverse events were encountered when the adsorber was used in the circuit. Blood flow through the device was easily monitored and kept at the desired level. Platelet count decreased in both groups during surgery. TEG data revealed a decrease in whole blood clot strength in the control group while it was preserved in the adsorber group. Endotoxin was detected in only 2 patients and IL- 1 ss in 4 patients. IL- 6 decreased in both groups whereas no change in TNF concentrations was found. C 3 fell in both groups, but no changes wer found in C 4 and C 1 q. The Alteco(R) LPS adsorber can be used safely and is easy to handle in the bypass circuit. No complications related {{to the use of the}} adsorber were noted. The intended effects of the adsorber, i. e. removal of endotoxin from the blood stream could not be evaluated in this study, presumably due to the small number of patients and the relatively short perfusion times...|$|E
40|$|Multichannel Blind Deconvolution (MBD) is a {{powerful}} tool particularly for the identification and estimation of dynamical systems in which a sensor, for measuring the input, is difficult to place.

40|$|Spencer et al 1 {{recently}} {{described the}} use of transcranial Doppler sonography to record the passage of emboli through the middle cerebral artery (MCA) during carotid endarterectomy. They re-corded transient signals {{at the time of}} releasing common carotid cross clamps and inferred that these were due to microbubbles. Similar signals at other times were assumed also to be indicative of emboli, although of unproven constitution. They suggested that the usefulness of this technique might be extended to cardiac sources of embolism. We have recently concluded such a study. 2 Transcranial Doppler (TC 2 - 64 EME) was used to record middle cerebral artery flow velocity before, during, and immediately after bypass during coronary artery surgery. Continuously recorded velocities from the right MCA were averaged over 30 seconds and stored on an Apple 2 e micro-computer. The software also detected high-amplitude transients (more than twice the amplitude under steady-flow conditions) and recorded their number over each 30 -second period. High-amplitude signals were common at the time of aortic cannulation and at the inception of bypass, but were also recorded during stable bypass. In vitro studies by ourselves 3 and others 4 using model extracorporeal circulations show that the signal characteristic recorded during surgery can be attributed to microemboli. This interpretation is strengthened by the results of a randomized study of the effect of an additional <b>arterial</b> line <b>filter</b> on the incidence of "emboli " and on the neuropsychological sequelae of coronary artery bypass surgery...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to find whether muscle compartment pressure was affected by the addition of albumin and mannitol to the pump prime, heparin coating or leukocyte depletion. Additionally, we studied the relationship between intraocular pressure and lower leg muscle compartment pressure. Edema during and following cardiac surgery is due to hemodynamic, osmotic and inflammatory changes, according to Starling's Law. We attempted to influence the osmotic balance and reduce the inflammatory response in order to reduce the edema. METHODS: Thirty-six patients who underwent cardiac surgery were randomly allocated into four groups. Group A received albumin and mannitol into the pump prime. Group B had an, heparin-coated perfusion system, Group C had a leukocyte-depletion <b>arterial</b> line <b>filter</b> and Group D was the control group, where intraocular pressure was also measured. RESULTS: Lower leg muscle compartment pressure increased significantly during and after cardiac surgery in all groups, but this increase was significantly less in Group A than in the control group 24 h after surgery. No correlation was found between muscular compartment pressure and intraocular pressure. The intraocular pressure profile is different from the muscular compartment pressure and recovers much faster. CONCLUSION: Lower leg muscle compartment pressure and intraocular pressure behave differently during and after cardiac surgery. Albumin and mannitol added to the pump prime decreases muscle compartment pressure after cardiac surgery...|$|R

Animal studies have demonstrated that the elimination of leukocytes from the circulation reduces postoperative lung injury and improves postoperative pulmonary function. We conducted a prospective randomized clinical study to evaluate whether postoperative lung function could be improved by use of a leukocyte filter during cardiopulmonary bypass. Elective coronary artery bypass grafting was done with a leukocyte-depleting <b>arterial</b> blood <b>filter</b> incorporated in the extracorporeal circuit (14 patients, leukocyte filter group) or without the filter (18 patients, control group). Blood samples collected at intervals before, during, and after operation were used for analysis of blood cell counts, elastase concentrations, and arterial blood gases. The use of the leukocyte filter caused no significant reduction in leukocyte count (p = 0. 86). There were no differences in postoperative lung function between the groups, as assessed through (1) oxygenation index (290 for leukocyte filter group compared with 329 for control group, 95 % confidence interval, 286 to 372, p = 0. 21), (2) pulmonary vascular resistance (p = 0. 10), and (3) intubation time (16. 6 hours for leukocyte filter group versus 15. 7 hours for control group, 95 % confidence interval, 12. 1 to 19. 1 hours, p = 0. 72).
