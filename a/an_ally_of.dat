5|$|Hugo Spadafora was a {{physician}} and political activist who had first clashed with Noriega {{when they were both}} members of Torrijo's government. Though <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Torrijos, he and Noriega had been personal enemies for a long time. Despite not {{being a member of the}} opposition, he became a vocal critic of Noriega after returning to Panama from Guatemala in 1981. Spadafora amassed evidence of corruption within the government by using his position as <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Torrijos to question Noriega's allies, including Rodriquez and Carlton. This included a lengthy conversation with Carlton in mid-1985 after his drug operations had collapsed due to conflicts over a missing shipment, and he had received negative publicity in the Panamanian press. In September 1985 he accused Noriega of having connections to drug trafficking and announced his intent to return to Panama to oppose him. The drug trafficking charges threatened Noriega's support among his own constituency of middle class individuals who had benefited under his and Torrijos' government.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ptolemy III of Egypt, who {{had been}} <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> the Achaean League in their wars against Macedon, shifted his {{financial}} support to Sparta. Ptolemy made this decision after calculating that a resurgent Sparta {{would be a more}} valuable ally against Macedon than a failing Achaean League.|$|E

5|$|Shashthi's Bengali legends {{appear in}} the Mangal-Kavya texts, {{especially}} in the Shashthi-mangal section of this work. The Mangal-Kavya and Bengali folk tales describe Shashthi as closely related to Manasa, the serpent goddess. Shashthi furthermore appears as <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Manasa in a famous Bengali folk-tale describing Shashthi's activities during the Nag Panchami festival of Manasa.|$|E

5|$|After the Cold War, the {{conflict}} in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.|$|E

5|$|Baird held ministerial {{responsibilities}} for the Toronto Harbourfront Centre and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation. He developed a {{working relationship with}} Toronto Mayor David Miller soon after his appointment, and was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in June 2006. Ontario cabinet minister David Caplan described Baird {{as a champion of}} waterfront renewal and Miller described him as <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> the city. Baird spent Christmas 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Denmark was <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire, and it {{was evident}} that Sweden {{was on the verge of}} yet another war with that country. A remedy was {{attempted}} by chancellor Nils Brahe, who traveled to Copenhagen in the spring of 1675 to try to get the Danish princess Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark engaged to the Swedish king. In mid-June 1675, the engagement was officially proclaimed. However, when news arrived of the Swedish defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin, Danish king Christian V declared war on Sweden that September.|$|E
5|$|It {{may be that}} Óengus was {{involved}} in wars in Ireland, perhaps fighting with Áed Allán, or against him as <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Cathal mac Finguine. The evidence for such involvement is limited. There {{is the presence of}} Óengus's son Bridei at Tory Island, on the north-west coast of Donegal in 733, close to the lands of Áed Allán's enemy Flaithbertach mac Loingsig. Less certainly, the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland report the presence of a Pictish fleet from Fortriu fighting for Flaithbertach in 733 rather than against him.|$|E

5|$|Mackandal has expert {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} the forest, using its herbs and fungi as weapons against the planters. The ecological landscape of Haiti is used to represent the wreckage of the Revolution, being initially described as fertile and bountiful with the plantations, but later as worn down and bare. The powerful climate of the Caribbean is more similar to Africa than Europe, making nature <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> the slaves. Natural elements also act on their own, with Henri Christophe's Citadel being attacked by fungi and thunderstorms before its completion.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about everybody in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Cuba, and <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid sultan, Al-Adil I, stormed {{into the}} County of Tripoli, {{creating}} {{an opportunity for}} Leo to plunder the land around Antioch in 1208. Bohemond persuaded Kaykaus I, Sultan of Rum, to invade Cilicia, forcing Leo to withdraw from Antioch. Pope Innocent tasked Albert Avogadro, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to mediate a peace. Avogadro, who was <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> the Knights Templar, urged Leo to return Bagras to them. In an attempt to renew the truce, Leo obeyed the legate's demand, promising to withdraw from Bagras.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban Revolution {{led to the}} {{overthrow}} of Fulgencio Batista, <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> the United States, in 1959. Fidel Castro severed Cuba's formerly strong ties with the United States. The United States soon instituted a embargo against Cuba, which has made it illegal for United States corporations to enter into business with Cuba. The Baltimore Orioles, who were slated to hold an 1960 exhibition series against the Cincinnati Reds in Havana, moved the games to Miami, Florida.|$|E
5|$|The DLM won {{its first}} {{parliamentary}} seat in Lebanon's 2005 elections representing the Tripoli district. On 2 June 2005, amid election rounds, Samir Kassir, {{a founder of}} the movement, was assassinated in a car bombing. Less than one month later, George Hawi, a former secretary general of the Lebanese Communist Party and <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> the DLM, was killed in a similar car bombing in Beirut. In the 2009 elections, the party again won a single seat, instead representing the West Bekaa district. It {{is a member of the}} March 14 Alliance parliamentary coalition.|$|E
5|$|The Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Robert I, died in January 1228. His brother Baldwin II succeeded him, but a regent {{was needed}} to rule the Latin Empire since Baldwin was ten years old. Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria was {{willing to accept the}} regency, but the barons of the Latin Empire {{suspected}} that he wanted to unite the Latin Empire with Bulgaria. They offered the imperial crown instead to John, <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> the Holy See.|$|E

5|$|The planned Pecheneg {{attack from}} the north also failed, as the Pechenegs quarrelled with admiral Lekapenos, who refused to {{transport}} them across the Danube to aid the main Byzantine army. The Byzantines were not aided by Serbs and Magyars either: the Magyars were engaged in Western Europe as Frankish allies, and the Serbs under Petar Gojniković were reluctant to attack Bulgaria because Michael of Zahumlje, <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Bulgaria, had notified Simeon of their plans.|$|E
5|$|Truman's other appointees to the Court {{provided}} consistent conservative votes, {{and during}} Minton's first {{years on the}} Court it was returned to the conservatism of the William Howard Taft era. While on the Court, Minton transformed from a New Deal senator into an almost reactionary judge as <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Justice Felix Frankfurter. Empirical coding of votes shows that Minton was the most conservative justice on the Court during his first year, and remained in the conservative half of the court {{for the duration of}} his career.|$|E
5|$|After Morta's {{death in}} 1262, Mindaugas took her sister (name unknown) {{as his wife}} despite her being married to Daumantas. This cruel act {{motivated}} Daumantas to become <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Treniota and assassinate Mindaugas {{with two of his}} sons. Treniota was Mindaugas' nephew. It is believed that he was son of Duke of Samogitia, either Vykintas or Erdvilas. If it really was Vykintas, then there was a double marriage: Vykintas' sister married Dausprungas and Dausprungas' (and Mindaugas') sister married Vykintas. Erdvilas is mentioned only once in the 1219 treaty. The other nephew, Lengvenis, played a role in Lithuanian state in 1242–1260.|$|E
