40|$|Abstract-This paper {{presents}} a new approach, called adaptive <b>autocentering,</b> that compensates for transmitted force due to imbalance in an {{active magnetic bearing}} system. Under the proposed control law, a rigid rotor achieves rotation about the mass center and principal axis of inertia. The basic principle {{of this approach is}} to perform on-line identification of the physical characteristics of rotor imbalance and to use the identification results to tune a stabilizing controller. This approach differs from the usual strategy of adaptive feedforward compensation, which models the effect of imbalance as an external disturbance or measurement noise, and then cancels this effect by generating a synchronous reference signal. Unlike adaptive feedforward compensation, adaptive <b>autocentering</b> control is frequency inde-pendent and works under varying rotor speed. Performance of the control algorithm is demonstrated in simulation examples for the case of rigid rotors with static or dynamic imbalance. I...|$|R
40|$|Panel {{discussion}} at 'Educating Artists?' - a two-day symposium dealing with {{recent developments in}} artist education. Addressing different educational models, the relationship between artist, tutor & student, between theory and skills, while approaching the subject from an ‘outside’ and ‘inside’-perspective, the symposium attempts to reach for new and alternative methods in artist education. The question about a new art academy in Berlin has caused a vigorous debate this year; in Amsterdam its most famous ‘second-phase’ institutions, being the Rijksakademie and De Ateliers, have faced dramatic subsidy-cuts. Meanwhile residency programs DAAD and De Ateliers both celebrate their 50 th birthday this year and new educational models like <b>Autocenter’s</b> Summer Academy and UdK’s Institut für Raumexperimente are offering alternative programs. In light of the growing discussion, the symposium offers a creative platform to reflect upon these educational developments. The symposium is divided into four panels spread over two days, each day concluded with a specifically arranged performance. Questions that will be addressed are: In what way do structural hierarchies in education systems influence the relation between tutor and student? How do educational institutions respond to the increased professionalization of {{the job of the}} artist? How is the quest for alternative models symptomatic for broader transformations in education/culture? How do theory and practice come together in artist education? In which way does the academy or the post-academic institution partake in the contemporary art world? 15. 30 - 17. 00 Forth Panel on What do Artists Want with Kirsty Bell, AA Bronson, Verina Gfader, Bojan Sarcevic, Uwe Schwarzer Speakers include: Jennifer Allen, Adriana Arroyo, Kirsty Bell, Jurriaan Benschop Ariane Beyn, Dominic van den Boogerd, AA Bronson, Angela Bulloch, Eric Ellingsen, Verina Gfader, Natasha Ginwala, Marie Haff, Joep van Liefland, Els van Odijk, Esper Postma, Vivian Sky Rehberg, Willem de Rooij, Karin Sander, Bojan Sarcevic, Uwe Schwarzer and Nadine Zeidler...|$|R

His work depicts naked people in a [...] "world they didn't make", reflecting on philosophy and art history. His influences include Jack Kirby, Martin Heidegger, Caspar David Friedrich, Hölderlin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jess Franco, Gary Panter, and Joe D´Amato. He has had exhibitions in places like <b>Autocenter,</b> Berlin, Daniel Hug Gallery, Los Angeles, Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna, and Baronian Francey, Brussels.|$|E
