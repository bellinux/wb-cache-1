NEXIM Bank under the leadership of Orya as MD/CEO seeks to help sustain Nigeria's role as a leader on the continent, particularly by harmonizing commerce in the West African region. Orya's vision (at NEXIM) is to see a significant reduction in the high transportation costs, which taken alongside reduction in the present excessive transit time, would place West African products in a vantage position to compete with goods from other markets.Under his leadership the bank now focused on sectors that have high job-creation and high export potentials in the non-oil sectors.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2011 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the role of the North West Department of Education in the {{induction}} of primary school principals. This study was,guided by four primary research questions namely: What constitutes the nature and characteristics of induction? What are the induction strategies that the Department of Education employs in this exercise? How effective are the induction programmes in the North West Province? What are the challenges of induction in the North West Province? The review of the literature focused on the recruitment of principals, the various models of the induction programme for principals and how these impacted on the preparation of principals in the management, the governance, the administration and the instructional leadership within the school. Questionnaire served as the sole data collection instrument, and it comprised 44 items. The sample population consisted of two hundred (200) primary school principals selected randomly from the four districts of the North West Province. The data was collected using a Lickert 5 point scale. The following areas were covered in the questionnaire: The nature and characteristics of the induction The challenges of the induction The strategies of the induction The effectiveness of the induction. The findings revealed that the Department of Education does make efforts to ensure that novice and seasoned principals in the North West Province are not faced with the 'swim or sink' dilemma in the management of schools. The data further revealed that new principals are trained upon <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> However, data revealed that quality assurance mechanisms are seriously lacking and that there is no variety in the strategies that are being followed in the induction of school principals. In conclusion, the study recommended further research into the implementation of the induction system as well as a further benchmarking of the best practices beyond the province to establish how the North West compares with other provinces.

40|$|Spectrum sensing {{optimisation}} techniques maximise {{the efficiency}} of spectrum sensing while satisfying a number of constraints. Many optimisation models consider {{the possibility of the}} primary user changing activity state during the secondary user's transmission period. However, most ignore the possibility of activity change during the sensing period. The observed primary user signal during sensing can exhibit a duty cycle which has been shown to severely degrade detection performance. This paper shows that (a) the probability of state change during sensing cannot be neglected and (b) the true detection performance obtained when incorporating the <b>duty</b> cycle <b>of</b> the primary user signal can deviate significantly from the results expected with the <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> no such <b>duty</b> cycle...|$|R

40|$|Spectrum sensing is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important tasks in cognitive radio. One <b>of</b> the common <b>assumption</b> among current spectrum sensing detectors is the full presence or complete absence of the primary user within the sensing period. In reality, there are many situations where the primary user signal only occupies a portion of the observed signal and the <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> primary user <b>duty</b> cycle not necessarily fulfilled. In this paper we show that the true detection performance can degrade from the assumed achievable values when the observed primary user exhibits a certain duty cycle. Therefore, a two-stage detection method incorporating primary user duty cycle that enhances the detection performance is proposed. The proposed detector can improve the probability of detection under low duty cycle at the expense of a small decrease in performance at high duty cycle...|$|R
