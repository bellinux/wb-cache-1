40|$|A rocket-borne {{experiment}} {{to study the}} currents associated with a system of multiple auroral arcs was conducted at Poker Flat, Alaska, at 1122 UT on Feb. 2, 1972. The magnetic field {{in the vicinity of}} the auroral system was measured with a cesium vector magnetometer. Possible configurations were inferred by constructing model current systems that reproduced the magnetic field variations measured along the flight path. The data are interpreted in terms of a model current system consisting of two eastward electrojets and one westward electrojet and three pairs of oppositely directed Birkeland sheet currents, all lying in a plane approximately parallel to the auroral <b>arcs.</b> <b>Sheet</b> thicknesses ranged from 20 to 60 km and current densities from 10 to 45 microampere/sq m; the electrojet currents ranged from 1000 to 2000 A. A possible alternate model consisted of four pairs of sheets whose thicknesses range from 10 to 40 km with current densities from 10 to 90 microampere/sq m. There was quite good agreement between the locations of the visual arcs and the upward current sheets. The overall current configuration is discussed in view of the theoretical models constructed by Atkinson and Sato and Holzer and of other observations...|$|R
40|$|We present here a brief {{survey of}} vortex-dynamical {{simulations}} {{of the plane}} mixing layer using different forms of vortex elements. Points and blobs, which {{have been widely used}} in the past, suffer from irregular evolution of the vortex sheet approximating the shear layer, and the rather long time-averaging required to obtain meaningful statistics. A technique recently proposed by the authors, using vortex <b>arcs</b> or <b>sheet</b> elements, {{has been found to be}} helpful in avoiding these difficulties. In particular, this technique avoids the singularity in induced velocity associated with point vortex techniques, and is therefore in no need of any form of the amp;ldquo;desingularizationamp;rdquo; that is often introduced in the latter. New results for excited mixing layers using the vortex sheet element model are presented, and are shown to be in good agreement with experimental observations 13...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} alpha-regularization of the Birkhoff-Rott equation, {{induced by the}} {{two-dimensional}} Euler-alpha equations, for the vortex sheet dynamics. We show the convergence of the solutions of Euler-alpha equations to a weak solution of the Euler equations for initial vorticity being a finite Radon measure of fixed sign, which includes the vortex sheets case. We also show that, provided the initial density of vorticity is an integrable function over the curve {{with respect to the}} arc-length measure, (i) an initially Lipschitz chord <b>arc</b> vortex <b>sheet</b> (curve), evolving under the BR-alpha equation, remains Lipschitz for all times, (ii) an initially Holder C^{ 1,beta}, 0 <= beta < 1, chord arc curve remains in C^{ 1,beta} for all times, and finally, (iii) an initially Holder C^{n,beta}, n <= 1, 0 < beta < 1, closed chord arc curve remains so for all times. In all these cases the weak Euler-alpha and the BR-alpha descriptions of the vortex sheet motion are equivalent.

40|$|A {{model of}} oval and polar cap arc {{configurations}} has been formulated {{by combining the}} theory of antiparallel magnetic merging and theories of the evening discrete arc and of the morningside arc systems. Aside from incorporating the verified and yet-to-be-verified predictions of the individual component theories this unified model leads to definite predictions of not only arc configurations but also characteristics of the plasmas that produce {{the various types of}} arcs. The model predicts two types of polar cap arcs characterized by the plasma sources: the magnetosheath arc and the plasma <b>sheet</b> <b>arc.</b> Their occurrence should be governed by the By component of the interplanetary magnetic field, and the same type should not occur simultaneously in both hemispheres...|$|R
40|$|A {{plasma arc}} and a low-power/high beam quality laser beam were {{coaxially}} combined into one process {{in order to}} obtain a more efficient and stable <b>arc</b> for thin <b>sheet</b> welding applications. Theoretical discussion of interaction mechanisms between the laser beam and the plasma arc and results of bead-on-plate welding trials carried out on AISI 304 stainless steel will be presented. Measurements were made of electrical and geometrical arc properties with and without assistance from the laser beam. Additionally, the impact of the laser beam on the weld seam geometry was evaluated. The results showed that the use of the additional low-power laser beam is capable of producing significant process improvements in comparison to the individual plasma arc process alone with respect to arc stability and welding performance...|$|R
40|$|It {{is noted}} that, {{in the distant}} plasma sheet, {{it is likely that}} {{curvature}} drift is the most important source of drift parallel to the electric field, leading to what is commonly called Fermi acceleration of the particles. The energization mechanism here is proportional to the neutral sheet current density. It is a form of field-aligned acceleration, with rapid lowering of mirror points, caused by the transverse electric field in the plasma sheet. It is noted that the process will work for both negative and positive particles. A filamentation of the neutral current sheet is postulated. Here, the maximum energization by curvature drift and the accompanying intense precipitation will form an auroral band or <b>arc</b> along the <b>sheet</b> of magnetic field lines that maps out to the local enhancement of the crosstail current, explaining inverted V events...|$|R
30|$|A {{short arc}} is suited to {{applications}} that require low heat input, {{and it allows}} the joining of thin materials and sheet metals in any position. It {{is a good choice}} when distortion of the construction needs to be minimized. It is suitable for grooved welds as the root pass or for filling the gaps of joints, {{as well as for the}} root pass of open groove joints and plate groove welds. The short arc mode is widely used in the pipe industry and very applicable to root pass welds in pipes. It can be utilized with carbon steel with 100 % carbon dioxide shielding gas or a blend of a maximum of 25 % CO 2 and a balance of argon. The short arc mode is also applicable to low carbon steel, low alloy steel, and stainless steel with thicknesses between 0.5 and 2.6 Â mm. However, it is unable to perform welding of aluminium (Deruntz 2003). Although, conventional short arc is used in many applications, its use is limited by high potential excessive spatter generation, fume generation, lack of fusion, lower gap bridgability, and arc instability (Hermans and Ouden 1999; Jenkins et al. 2005). The poor performance of conventional short arc results from the limited ability of the power source to control every sequence of the short circuiting metal transfer mode (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Althouse et al. 2004; Laren 2004; Goecke 2005 a, b; Jeffus and Bower 2010). As a consequence of this limitation, conventional short arc is being progressively replaced by controlled short <b>arc</b> in root-pass <b>sheet</b> metal welding.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In recent years, substantia! efforts among icc core {{researchers}} have been directed IOward understanding microphysical processes occuning in icc sheets, because they could affect significantly the paleoclimatic and paleoatmospheric signals recorded in icc cores. For example, a very large fractionation of N 2 and O 2 found in the transition zone from air bubbles to air hydrates was successfully {{explained in terms of}} molecular diffusion in icc [1 - 4]. More recently, we found very many water-soluble micropartic 1 cs, of which distributions and behavior must be a key to understand the chemical processes in ice sheets [5 - 9].

Moreovcr, thc anisotropic defonllation of icc crystals is taken into consideration in recent rescarch on ice sheet flow dynamics (1 0 - 13]. Although a very large anisotropy in plasticity of icc was well established in the 1960 's by labomlOry experiments, almost all icc sheet flow models developed so far have assumed isotropic ice because of difficulty in modeling the anisotropic deformation. As you wil! sec in this vol ume, this difficulty can be surmounted by the new models [12, 13]. In the present paper, I wil! discuss the fundamental dislocation processes in icc to bener understand why and how icc defonns in di ITcrent orientations.

40|$|Increasing {{regulatory}} {{pressure to}} reduce fuel consumption of new vehicles has prompted {{the automotive industry}} to seek ways to reduce the weight of their automobiles. The use of steel tailor welded blanks has been successful in reducing vehicle weight while simultaneously reducing manufacturing costs; however, further weight reductions are possible if steel alloys are substituted with aluminum alloys. This has created a need to identify and develop welding techniques that would enable the production of high-quality welds between aluminum sheets of different thicknesses at rates compatible with the demands of the automotive industry. A relatively new welding technique that has been shown to have potential for joining aluminum sheet for tailor welded blank applications is the double-sided arc welding (DSAW) process. In DSAW, an arc is struck between two welding torches situated {{on either side of the}} sheets to be welded allowing the aluminum surface oxide to be electrically cleaned simultaneously from both sides of the joint. The demonstrated potential for welding aluminum sheet and the low capital cost compared to conventional laser welding systems typically used for fabricating TWBs makes DSAW an excellent candidate for welding aluminum TWBs. The objective of the research described in this thesis was to assess the feasibility and merits of using a DSAW system to manufacture aluminum TWBs. In this study, a DSAW system comprised of a plasma arc welding (PAW) torch above the work piece and a gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) torch below the work piece was applied to the high speed welding of 1. 0 to 1. 5 mm thick AA 5182 -O aluminum alloy sheets in the butt-joint configuration. A series of conduction-mode DSAW welds were made in the horizontal position to identify the welding conditions that produced good quality welds using visual acceptance criteria and with minimal geometric discontinuity across the weld. Further studies were conducted to determine the influence of the welding process parameters on the hardness, strength, ductility, formability and internal flaws of DSAW welds. DSAW welds were made using a series of welding torch-to-work piece distances, between 1. 5 and 6. 0 mm, to investigate the influence of varying the relative arc forces acting on the top and bottom of the weld pool on the resulting weld bead dimensions including weld metal drop through. It was found that increasing the torch-to-work piece distance decreased the process efficiency when a constant welding power was used resulting in narrower welds being produced. Weld metal sag or drop through was not observed to be affected by varying the welding torch-to-work piece distance; however, decreasing the PAW torch-to-work piece distance to 1. 5 mm was found to produce a pronounced surface ripple pattern on the top surface of the weld. A series of DSAW welds were made to investigate the range of welding speeds and powers that produced visually acceptable welds on 1. 0 to 1. 5 mm thick AA 5182 aluminum sheets. Welding powers ranging from 1. 4 to 4. 6 kW were found to produce acceptable welds at travel speeds between 10 and 70 mm/s when the net heat input per unit distance was between 60 and 110 J/mm. Above these speeds, unacceptable weld bead quality and lack of fusion defects were observed due to incomplete cathodic etching of the oxide from the surfaces and inconsistent coupling between the welding <b>arcs</b> the <b>sheets.</b> It was found that the visual appearance of the weld was improved and travel speeds could be increased for a given welding power when welding specimens were stainless steel wire brushed prior to welding to break-up and remove most of the pre-existing hydrated aluminum surface oxide. Significant reductions in hydrogen gas porosity were also observed when stainless steel wire brushing was used. The strength, ductility and formability of DSAW welds were found to vary significantly depending on the welding parameters used and the occurrence of porosity defects in the welds. Welds made using welding speeds greater than 30 mm/s were found to exhibit solidification shrinkage micro-porosity and a corresponding degradation in mechanical properties, especially ductility and formability. As the welding speed was further increased, degradation of the material properties continued to increase due to an increase in the quantity of micro-porosity defects in the weld. These defects caused significant strain localization resulting in a marked decrease in ductility and formability. The severity of solidification shrinkage micro-porosity present in the weld metal was found to correspond to the relative length-to-width ratio of the weld pool for all the welding conditions examined. Welds produced at high welding speeds resulted in large length-to-width ratios, a relatively large distance between the liquidus and non-equilibrium solidus and low thermal gradients in the mushy zone at the tail of the weld. These conditions are known to promote micro-porosity in alloys with a wide freezing range. Visually acceptable DSAW welds produced using welding speeds below 25 mm/s were found to have excellent material properties that were nearly indistinguishable from the base metal with excellent ductility and formability. These welds had relatively small length-to-width ratios and little or no evidence of solidification micro-porosity, because the length of the mushy zone at the tail of the weld was much smaller and the thermal gradients were much higher. These conditions are known to prevent solidification micro-porosity during solidification of alloys with a wide freezing range. They also provide more time and opportunity for any hydrogen bubbles that may form during solidification to float up and escape through the top surface of the weld pool thereby further reducing the propensity for hydrogen porosity. The DSAW process has been shown to be capable of successfully producing tailor-welded blanks in 5182 aluminum alloy sheets with excellent ductility and formability provided that all sources of porosity are eliminated. This includes careful cleaning and removal of preexisting hydrated oxides using stainless steel wire brushing prior to welding to minimize hydrogen porosity and welding at slow enough speeds to prevent the formation of solidification micro-porosity at the tail of the weld pool...|$|R
