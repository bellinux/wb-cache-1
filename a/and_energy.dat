5|$|Some of {{the energy}} thus {{captured}} produces biomass <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> that is available for growth and development of other life forms. The majority {{of the rest of}} this biomass <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> are lost as waste molecules and heat. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism and cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|A tantric {{interpretation}} sees Shiva as {{consciousness and}} Kali as power or energy. Consciousness <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> are dependent upon each other, since Shiva depends on Shakti, or energy, {{in order to}} fulfill his role in creation, preservation, and destruction. In this view, without Shakti, Shiva is a corpse — unable to act.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may also benefit their factions through social engineering, probe teams, and diplomacy. Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties {{forced by the}} player's choice of faction. Probe teams can sabotage and steal information, units, technology, <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> from enemy bases, while diplomacy lets the player create coalitions with other factions. It also allows the trade or transfer of units, bases, technology <b>and</b> <b>energy.</b> The Planetary Council, similar to the United Nations Security Council, takes Planet-wide actions and determines population victories.|$|E

The Paul Robeson Performing Arts Company and the Community Folk Art Center will also be located downtown. On March 31, 2006, {{the university and the}} city announced an initiative to connect the main campus of the university with the arts and culture areas of downtown Syracuse and The Warehouse. Using natural gas, the Green Data Center generates its own electricity on site, providing cooling for servers and for a neighboring building.|$|E

5|$|The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis is a 2010 non-fiction {{book written}} by Jeremy Rifkin. It connects the {{evolution}} of communication <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> development in civilizations with psychological and economic development in humans. Rifkin considers the latest phase of communication <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> regimes—that of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction—as bringing people together on the nation-state level based on democratic capitalism, {{but at the same}} time creating global problems, like climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation. Rifkin extrapolates the observed trend into the future, predicting that Internet and mobile technology along with small-scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage the new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems.|$|E
