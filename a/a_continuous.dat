5000|$|Thus, {{a linear}} {{operator}} A is the infinitesimal generator of <b>a</b> uniformly <b>continuous</b> semigroup if {{and only if}} A is a bounded linear operator. If X is a finite-dimensional Banach space, then any strongly <b>continuous</b> semigroup is <b>a</b> uniformly <b>continuous</b> semigroup.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>continuous</b> map {{between two}} topological spaces induces a group {{homomorphism}} between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E

5|$|Any general {{property}} of Banach spaces {{continues to hold}} for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> and bijective linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E

The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> blip on the centreline.
