5|$|Roguelike is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a subgenre of role-playing video games that are characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated game levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player-character. Most roguelikes <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> high fantasy narrative, reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons.|$|E

5|$|Both entrances {{will feature}} the glass canopy design, {{the first of}} their kind in the subway system. They are {{intended}} to stand out aesthetically. The entrances are interweaved with the Hudson Yards developments, with the main entrance wedged between 50 Hudson Yards {{to the east and}} 55 Hudson Yards to the west. The rest of the Hudson Yards development is located very close to the south of the station. Both entrances <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> design by architect Toshiko Mori, which itself is based on the design of smaller station entrances in the Paris Métro.|$|E

5|$|Fares on {{the network}} <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> zone tariff set between two {{specified}} points by GO Transit, {{and the type of}} passenger using the ticket. Passenger categories exist for adults, students, seniors, children, and groups. Tickets are also sold for single trip, or passes for one day or one month. Tickets can be used on a GO train, bus, or a combination of both. They can be purchased at train stations, bus terminals, ticket agencies, or on GO buses.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory has}} been rebuffed {{medically}} as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, {{many of whom were}} not noted to drink blood. Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires. In any case, Dolphin did not go on to publish his work more widely. Despite being dismissed by experts, the link gained media attention and entered popular modern folklore.|$|E
5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 1979 {{design by}} Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due {{to the complexity of}} the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E

5|$|Girih are {{elaborate}} interlacing patterns formed of five standardized shapes. The {{style is}} used in Persian Islamic architecture and also in decorative woodwork. Girih designs are traditionally made in different media including cut brickwork, stucco, and mosaic faience tilework. In woodwork, especially in the Safavid period, it could be applied either as lattice frames, left plain or inset with panels such as of coloured glass; or as mosaic panels used to decorate walls and ceilings, whether sacred or secular. In architecture, girih forms decorative interlaced strapwork surfaces from the 15thcentury to the 20thcentury. Most designs <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> partially hidden geometric grid which provides a regular array of points; this is made into a pattern using 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries which can fill the plane. The visible pattern superimposed on the grid is also geometric, with 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-pointed stars {{and a variety of}} convex polygons, joined by straps which typically seem to weave over and under each other. The visible pattern does not coincide with the underlying tiling.|$|E
5|$|Metrorail begins {{service at}} 5 am Monday through Friday, 7 am on Saturdays, and 8 am Sundays; it ends service at 11:30 pm Monday through Thursday, 1:00 am Friday and Saturday, and 11:00 pm on Sundays, {{although}} the last trains leave the end stations inbound {{about half an}} hour before these times. Trains run more frequently during rush hours on all lines, with scheduled peak hour headways of 4 minutes on the Red Line and 9 minutes on all other lines. Headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and all weekend. The midday six-minute headways <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> combination of two Metrorail lines (Orange/Blue and Yellow/Green) as each route can run every 12 minutes; {{in the case of the}} Red Line, every other train bound for Glenmont terminates at Silver Spring instead. Night and weekend service varies between 8 and 24 minutes, with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag of Ecuador, {{which consists of}} horizontal bands of yellow (double width), blue and red, was first adopted by law in 1835 and later on 26 September 1860. The design of the current flag was finalized in 1900 {{with the addition of}} the coat of arms {{in the center of the}} flag. Before using the yellow, blue and red tricolor, Ecuador used white and blue flags that contained stars for each province of the country. The design of the flag is very similar to those of Colombia and Venezuela, which are also former constituent territories of Gran Colombia. All three <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> proposal by Venezuelan General Francisco de Miranda, which was adopted by Venezuela in 1811 and later Gran Colombia with some modifications. There is a variant of the flag that does not contain the coat of arms that is used by the merchant marine. This flag matches Colombia's in every aspect, but Colombia uses a different design when her merchant marine ships are at sail.|$|E

5|$|The rankings <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} factors such as {{standardized}} test scores of students, salary of recent graduates, survey results of graduates and/or recruiters, the specific schools that choose {{to participate in a}} market survey, the number of top companies recruiting at the school and a variety of attributes. The ratings vary significantly by method used to determine the success of each program. For instance, the Forbes and Financial Times results are based on long-term graduate career progress concerns, the Bloomberg Businessweek and Economist polls evaluate short-term experiences of the students with their program, U.S. News & World Report consider the recent experiences of recruiters with the program, and other rankings like the Aspen Institute Beyond Grey Pinstripes measure integration of sustainability material into business programs.|$|E
