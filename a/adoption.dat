5|$|On 5 May 2016, James Reilly, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, {{announced}} that the Irish Government had approved {{the publication of the}} <b>Adoption</b> (Amendment) Bill 2016. The bill would amend the <b>Adoption</b> Act 2010 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill are to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they have cared for the child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless of marital status to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. The bill also allows for the <b>adoption</b> of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in the <b>adoption</b> process, among many other reforms to the <b>adoption</b> system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill was signed into law by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming the <b>Adoption</b> (Amendment) Act 2017.

5|$|Germanicus was a {{favorite}} of his great-uncle Augustus who for some time considered him heir to the Empire. In AD 4, persuaded by his wife Livia, Augustus decided in favor of Tiberius, his stepson from Livia's first marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero. As a condition of Tiberius' own <b>adoption</b> by Augustus, Tiberius was to adopt Germanicus as a son and to name him as his heir. If Tiberius had not adopted Germanicus before his own <b>adoption,</b> and had Augustus adopted Tiberius first, then Tiberius would have lost sui iuris, which included the legal authority to adopt.
