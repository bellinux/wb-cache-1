5000|$|Gas stoves {{became less}} {{unwieldy}} when the oven was {{integrated into the}} base and the size was reduced to fit in better {{with the rest of}} the kitchen furniture. By the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning. Ignition of the gas was originally by match and this was followed by the more convenient pilot light. This had the disadvantage of a continual consumption of gas. The oven still needed to be lit by match, and accidentally turning on the gas without igniting it could lead to an explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for gas hobs and ovens. Most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, <b>automatic</b> <b>timers</b> for the oven and extractor hoods to remove fumes.|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{sampling}} of end-tidal 133 Xe {{has a number}} of distinct advantages over manual or computer analysis of continuously sampled curves. Because the sample remains within the radiation-counting cell for a finite period of time, counts can be accumulated between breaths. This results in higher count rates, improved counting statistics, and a possi-ble reduction in the isotope dose needed to achieve a statistically reasonable number of counts. Also, automated sampling provides on-line computation of rCBF and renders editing of "bad " points a rather simple process. While com-puter programs can be written to select samples from a con-tinuous curve, the programming may be quite cumbersome. Our <b>automatic</b> sampling <b>timer</b> can be easily constructed for approximately $ 100. A detailed circuit diagram is presented in figure 5.

40|$|Consumption of {{supplements}} and energy drinks is common among athletes; however, {{there is a}} lack of research on the efficacy of energy drink consumption before and during short-duration, intense exercise. The purpose of this research was to investigate the acute effects of a low-calorie, caffeine-taurine, energy drink (AdvoCare Spark®) on repeated sprint performance and anaerobic power in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I football players. Twenty well-trained Division I football players (age: 19. 7 ± 1. 8 years, height: 184. 9 ± 5. 3 cm, weight: 100. 3 ± 21. 7 kg) participated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study in which they received the energy drink or an isoenergetic, isovolumetric, noncaffeinated placebo. The two trials were separated by 7 days. The Running Based Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST), consisting of six 35 -m sprints with 10 s of rest between each sprint, was used to assess anaerobic power. Sprint times were recorded with an <b>automatic</b> electronic <b>timer.</b> On average, there iv was no statistically significant difference between the placebo (15. 06 ± 3. 80 W·s- 1) and beverage (15. 3 ± 4. 18 W·s- 1) measurements of fatigue index.

Twenty-seven patients were initially resuscitated and 17 were discharged from hospital. The median time to connect the monitor after recognition of a cardiac arrest was 127 s (range 0 - 277) for survivors and 132 - 5 s (range 0 - 620) for non-survivors.

The "Typical" landscape had a cool-season fescue and was irrigated by an <b>automatic</b> <b>timer.</b> The "Alternative 1 " landscape had a warm-season paspalum and a "smart" soil moisture sensor-based irrigation system. The "Alternative 2 " landscape had a cool-season native sedge and a "smart" weather station-based drip irrigation system. ET {{was measured with}} a portable closed chamber and modeled using a Penman-Monteith approach, and the two methods agreed well. The water applied to the Alternative 1 was 54 % less than the water applied to the Typical landscape, and the water applied to the Alternative 2 was 24 % less. Soil moisture was similar in the Typical and Alternative 2, while Alternative 1 was drier in spring. The stomatal conductance of sedge was lower {{than the other two}} species, but its ET was not lower due to higher leaf area. Irrigation efficiencies (ET/applied irrigation) were 57 - 58 %, 86 - 97 %, and 78 - 80 % for the Typical, Alternative 1, and Alternative 2 landscapes, respectively. Runoff was less than 2 % in each landscape, and excess irrigation primarily drained below the root zone. Differences in irrigation efficiency between landscapes were due mainly to irrigation application, which varied more than species water use. Smart irrigation systems provided substantial water savings relative to a timer-based system, and prevented significant drainage losses. The utilization of smart sensors was more important than the choice of turfgrass species for irrigation efficiency. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, we are {{surrounded}} by artifacts {{that are capable of}} adaptive behavior, such as electric pots, boiler <b>timers,</b> <b>automatic</b> doors, and robots. The literature concerning human beings’ conceptions of “traditional” artifacts is vast, however, little is known about our conceptions of behaving artifacts, nor of the influence of the interaction with such artifacts on cognitive development, especially among children. Since these artifacts are provided with an artificial “mind,” it is of interest to assess whether and how children develop a Theory of Artificial Mind (ToAM) which is distinct from their Theory of Mind (ToM). The study examined a new theoretical scheme named ToAM (Theory of Artificial Mind) by means of qualitative and quantitative methodology among twenty four 5 - 7 year old children from central Israel. It also examined the effects of interacting with behaving artifacts (constructing versus observing the robot’s behavior) using the “RoboGan” interface on children’s development of ToAM and their ToM and looked for conceptions that evolve among children while interacting with behaving artifacts which are indicative of the acquisition of ToAM. In the quantitative analysis {{it was found that the}} interaction with behaving artifacts, whether as observers or constructors and for both age groups, brought into awareness children’s ToM as well as influenced their ability to understand that robots can behave independently and based on external and environmental conditions. In the qualitative analysis it was found that participating in the intervention influenced the children’s ToAM for both constructors and for the younger observer. Engaging in building the robot’s behavior influenced the children’s ability to explain several of the robots’ behaviors, their understanding of the robot’s script-based behavior and rule-based behavior and the children’s metacognitive development.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of the phenomenon of “laterality” in a wide spectrum of parameters of the physical condition of the lower limbs in tennis, as well as to study the influence of 3 different methods on the same parameters, through examining variations in performance. The sample consisted of 64 sport science students at Serres, aged between 21. 05 ± 1. 33. Data were collected by means of laboratory measurements in the Department’s Laboratory of Biomechanics. Initially, their dominant and non-dominant side was examined and ascertained during lateral movement with side steps. Based on a specific measurement protocol which included: a) jumping attempts, b) races, c) strength tests, d) reaction to a visual stimulus and e) a speed check of cycle ergometer, the performance of both sides was registered when they were brought into action either one at time or both simultaneously. Following recommendations by Baumann, a single axis dynamometer (AMD Co. Ltd., typ LC 4204 -K 600, 1 -D, Load cell) was used to assess all the vertical jumps, performances in body side displacements and in reaction speed to optical stimulus. The dynamometer was placed in parallel with the ground on which there was a special steel platform. To assess the maximal isometric strength of the lower limbs (Fmaxiso), a second identical dynamometer was used, placed vertically on the ground, on a special closed device to facilitate its transfer. To assess the maximal speed on a cycle-ergometer (UEmax), a MONARK Ergomedic cycle-ergometer (814 E, classe A, din 32932) was used without an additional brake resistance. The speed at the distance of 11. 885 m. was measured (a) using two photocell fences consisted of two bands with two pairs of photocells each, and (b) with an <b>automatic</b> digital <b>timer</b> with minimal time measurement set to 0. 01 sec. Then, the subjects were divided into 4 subgroups (3 experimental groups and one control group). The training protocols that were applied to improve the non-dominant side, included jumping exercises for group A, tennis-specific racing exercises for group B, and an equal combination (50 % - 50 %) of the two previous types of exercise for group C. The volume of the training load during each training session comprised of 4 exercises from a program of six exercises in total, that were executed in various combinations across training sessions. Each exercise was repeated between 6 and 8 times in two sets in each training session. There was an interval of two minutes between sets. There was also a time break of 3 to 4 minutes between each type of exercise. To examine the influence of the various training methods the tests used were the Paired t-test, and the one-way ANOVA followed by the Scheffee post-hoc test. It was concluded, that the training of group A was as a whole more efficient in dealing with laterality, followed by group C, and then by group B. The non-dominant limb performances were improved as follows: The time of the body side displacement at 4. 115 m. and the sprint time at 11. 885 m. were decreased. Also, the height of the vertical jump and the speed at the cycle ergometer test were increased. Finally, the reaction time at the optical stimulus was decreased while the maximal isometric strength was increased. The practical application of the research results would be particularly useful in diagnosing laterality and would mainly contribute to the improvement speed and strength of lower limbs in tennis. ...|$|R

It is available at: [URL] this paper, panel methods are applied in new and innovative ways to predict daily mean internal temperature demand across a heterogeneous domestic building stock over time. This research not only exploits a rich new dataset but presents new methodological insights and offers important linkages for connecting bottom-up building stock models to human behaviour. It represents the first time a panel model has been used to estimate the dynamics of internal temperature demand from the natural daily fluctuations of external temperature combined with important behavioural, socio-demographic and building efficiency variables. The model is able to predict internal temperatures across a heterogeneous building stock to within 0. 71 C at 95 % confidence and explain 45 % of the variance of internal temperature between dwellings. The model confirms hypothesis from sociology and psychology that habitual behaviours are important drivers of home energy consumption. In addition, the model offers the possibility to quantify take-back (direct rebound effect) owing to increased internal temperatures from the installation of energy efficiency measures. The presence of thermostats or thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) are shown to reduce average internal temperatures, however, the use of an <b>automatic</b> <b>timer</b> is shown to be statistically insignificant. The number of occupants, household income and occupant age are all important factors that explain a quantifiable increase in internal temperature demand. Households with children or retired occupants are shown to have higher average internal temperatures than households who do not. As expected, building typology, building age, roof insulation thickness, wall U-value and the proportion of double glazing all have positive and statistically significant effects on daily mean internal temperature. In summary, the model can be either used to make statistical inferences about the importance of different factors for explaining internal temperatures or as a predictive tool. However, a key contribution of this research is the possibility to use this model to calibrate existing building stock behaviour and socio-demographic effects leading to improved estimations of domestic energy demand...|$|E
