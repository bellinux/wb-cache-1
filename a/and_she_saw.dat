5|$|It is {{possible}} that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence that she was not Jewish; alternatively, she may have been influenced by Ezra Pound's anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States. By {{the end of the war}} her sympathies had again changed, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the Allies as liberators.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin {{had been}} {{completed}} three years earlier and first occupied by Governor Elisha M. Pease, whose wife played hostess to anyone who stopped by for a visit. The Houston family and their retinue of slaves moved into the mansion during a political climate that grew increasingly hostile over the secession debate. The family furniture had been moved from Independence by Joshua, since the state government had no budget for staffing, furnishing or maintaining the governor's residence. That financial burden fell {{on the shoulders of}} the incumbent, and the state partially defaulted on Houston's salary. Margaret feared for the family's safety, as her husband worked towards defeating passage of the state's Ordinance of Secession. There had been a botched assassination attempt on Houston, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> throngs of angry malcontents gathering in the city. Margaret closed the mansion doors to all but those with an invitation from the Houstons.|$|E
5|$|She {{thereafter}} conducted {{sea trials}} until October, after {{which she was}} deployed to Norway. On 11 November, Nürnberg left Gotenhafen, bound for Trondheim. She arrived there on 18 November, and remained there until she was transferred to Bogen Bay outside Narvik on 2 December. There, she joined the fleet in being, which was, again, centered on Tirpitz. Nürnberg saw no action during this period. On 27 April 1943, Nürnberg left Narvik for German waters via Trondheim. After arriving in Kiel on 3 May, she had her machinery overhauled. After the work was completed in late May, she {{was assigned to the}} Training Squadron in the Baltic. Frequent crew changes kept the ship at a very low state of readiness. She remained in this duty through 1944, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> no action. She was not assigned to the shore bombardment units that supported the retreating German Army on the Eastern Front, unlike most of the other ships of the Training Squadron.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912, Feth-i Bülend was assigned to the Reserve Division, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> no action during the conflict. Instead, she was disarmed and most of her weaponsincluding all four 15cm guns, and four each of the 75mm and 57mm gunswere used to bolster the defenses of Thessaloniki's harbor. The guns were manned by 90 of the ship's crew. The ship itself was converted to a barracks ship. At the time of {{the outbreak}} of the First Balkan War on 18 October 1912, the ship's commander was Captain (Binbaşi) Aziz Mahmut Bey, who also functioned as the naval garrison commander. On the night of 31 October, the Greek torpedo boat No. 11 passed by the shore batteries and searchlights and through the mine barrages at 22:20. She launched three torpedoes at 23:30 against Feth-i Bülend. One torpedo missed, hitting the quay, but the two others hit the ship, causing her to capsize and sink. Seven of its crew, including the ship's imam, were killed in the sinking, while the Greek vessel exited the harbor by the same route without further incident.|$|E
25|$|Viewing {{the scene}} from a {{distance}} of from sixty to eighty feet, she saw a man previously unknown to her in a car traveling at the rate of from fifteen to eighteen miles per hour, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> him only for a distance of about thirty feet—that is to say, for from one and a half to three seconds.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Heap {{was asked}} to perform at POP!Tech in Camden, Maine (US). There she {{performed}} selections from her then forthcoming album Ellipse. After her set and an encouraging plea for another performance later in the conference by the audience and organisers, Heap agreed. Having nothing else prepared though, she decided to improvise a song on the spot with parameters (tempo, key) suggested by the audience. After the show, Heap was asked by a Poptech attendee if she would give the newly created piece of music to his charity. A ‘lightbulb’ moment occurred in Heap’s head <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the potential in doing these improvised pieces for local charities at each show during the tour she would soon begin.|$|E

500|$|Imperator Aleksandr III (Emperor Alexander III) was the third, and last, ship of the [...] dreadnoughts of the Imperial Russian Navy. She {{was begun}} before World War I, {{completed}} in 1917 and saw service with the Black Sea Fleet. She was renamed [...] Volia or Volya ( [...] , Freedom) before her completion and then General Alekseyev (...) in 1920. The ship {{did not take}} part in operations during World War I because her sister ships were given a higher priority for completion. She was delivered in 1917, but the disruptions of the February Revolution rendered the Black Sea Fleet ineffective <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> no combat.|$|E
500|$|Tubman's {{religious}} faith was another important resource as she ventured repeatedly into Maryland. The visions from her childhood head injury continued, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> them as divine premonitions. She spoke of [...] "consulting with God", and trusted that He {{would keep her}} safe. Thomas Garrett once said of her, [...] "I never met with any person of any color who had more confidence {{in the voice of}} God, as spoken direct to her soul." [...] Her faith in the divine also provided immediate assistance. She used spirituals as coded messages, warning fellow travelers of danger or to signal a clear path.|$|E
500|$|By June 1917 the Russian Revolution had {{strengthened}} the Bolsheviks, who urged {{an end to}} the war. Pankhurst's translated autobiography had been read widely in Russia, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> an opportunity to put pressure on the Russian people. She hoped to convince them not to accept Germany's conditions for peace, which she saw as a potential defeat for Britain and Russia. UK Prime Minister David Lloyd George agreed to sponsor her trip to Russia, which she took in June. She told one crowd: [...] "I came to Petrograd with a prayer from the English nation to the Russian nation, that you may continue the war on which depends the face of civilisation and freedom." [...] Press response was divided between left and right wings; the former depicted her as a tool of capitalism, while the latter praised her devout patriotism.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Bloomfield was quick-witted, intelligent, {{cultivated}} <b>and</b> shrewd. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> {{the motive}} at a glance, <b>and,</b> notwithstanding <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>and</b> felt all its abuses, strongly {{attached to the}} governing principle of her country's social organization, as is almost universally {{the case with the}} strongest minds and most generous hearts of the nation, she was not disposed to let a stranger carry away a false impression of her sentiments on such a point.|$|R
500|$|In 1914, her {{armament}} was reduced; the 15cm {{guns were}} removed and two additional 12cm guns were installed in their place. Two of the 5.7cm guns and {{six of the}} 3.7cm guns were also removed. The ship took a diplomatic mission from Massawa across the Red Sea to visit Hussein bin Ali, the recently-proclaimed King of Hejaz, in Mecca in July 1917. Calabria returned to East African waters in January 1918 on another mission to show the flag, particularly {{off the coast of}} Somalia. Stops included Aden and Djibouti. Calabria was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> her armament modified again; a 15cm gun was reinstalled, as were two of the 5.7cm guns. A [...] L/39 autocannon was also added at this time. She served in this role for only a short time, and was reduced to a training ship for naval gunners in early 1924. This duty ended quickly, and she was sold for scrap on 13 November 1924.|$|E
500|$|In Gorgona, Seacole briefly ran a woman-only hotel. In late 1852, she {{travelled}} home to Jamaica. The {{journey was}} delayed and difficult when she encountered racial discrimination {{while trying to}} book passage on an American ship. She was forced {{to wait for a}} later British boat. [...] In 1853, soon after arriving home, Seacole was asked by the Jamaican medical authorities to minister to victims of a severe outbreak of yellow fever. [...] She found that she could do little, because the epidemic was so severe. Her memoirs state that her own boarding house was full of sufferers <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> many of them die. Although she wrote, [...] "I was sent for by the medical authorities to provide nurses for the sick at Up-Park Camp," [...] she did not claim to bring nurses with her when she went. She left her sister with some nurses at her house, went to the camp (about a mile, or 1.6km, from Kingston), [...] "and did my best, but it was little we could do to mitigate the severity of the epidemic." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{police and}} {{prosecution}} maintained that he cable tied her hands {{behind her back}} in the bedroom in preparation for rape, and then used a cable tie as a ligature to murder her when her blindfold slipped <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> his face. When asked why he had abducted Tiernan, he replied: [...] "I have no idea". When police challenged his version of taking the body to Lindley Woods soon after the murder, he claimed that he had first kept the body hidden underneath pallets in his back garden, and then stored her inside his sofa.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a nod to}} the [...] "Did Clay see the card?" [...] {{controversy}} in the second season, Ryan Seacrest was instructed to memorize the winner's name and the vote margin and was given a blank card to hold while reporting the results. [...] However, in a post-show interview with USA Today, Diana DeGarmo admitted that she had figured out that she had not won when the contestants were going over the schedule for the finale <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> she would be singing [...] "I Believe" [...] (the winner's single) before the results were announced. [...] Realizing that she would not be scheduled to sing a song she would have to sing again minutes later if she were announced as the winner, she correctly deduced that she had lost and Fantasia had won.|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E

2500|$|Hutchinson took Cotton's doctrines {{concerning}} the Holy Ghost far beyond his teachings, and she [...] "saw {{herself as a}} mystic participant in the transcendent power of the Almighty." [...] Her theology of direct personal revelation opposed {{the belief that the}} Bible was the final authority concerning divine revelation, which was basic to the Reformed doctrines held by the majority of English settlers at that time. She also adopted Cotton's minority view that works, behavior, and personal growth are not valid demonstrations of a person's salvation. [...] She went beyond this, however, and espoused some views that were more radical, devaluing the material world and suggesting that a person can become one with the Holy Spirit. [...] She also embraced the heterodox teaching of mortalism, the belief that the soul dies when the body dies, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> herself as a prophetess. [...] She had prophesied that God was going to destroy England, and she prophesied during her trial that God would destroy Boston.|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Mullin leader Patrick Nee, Paul McGonagle was {{thoroughly}} livid over {{the murder of}} his brother and, believing that O'Sullivan was responsible, received permission to kill him. On March 28, 1971, after having dinner with his wife at Jimmy's Harborside Restaurant, O'Sullivan dropped his wife off at their home and told her that he had an errand to do and that he would be back in an hour. Shortly after midnight, Mary noticed that his car was parked in the driveway in front of their house at the bottom of their driveway, it was surrounded by a group of neighbors. She went out to see what her neighbors were looking at <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> her husband's bullet riddled body.

2500|$|Emperor Wen died in 604—a {{death that}} {{traditional}} historians generally believe was a murder ordered by Yang Guang, although they admit {{a lack of}} direct evidence—and Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang.

[...] He soon {{turned away from the}} virtuous living style he engaged in to please his parents, and he lived luxuriously, {{with tens of thousands of}} women filling his palaces. [...] He still maintained respect for Empress Xiao, and he made many of her relatives, including her older brother Xiao Cong the Duke of Liang (Western Liang's final emperor) officials in his government. [...] However, Yang Zhao, who became crown prince, died in 606, and Yang Jian lost Emperor Yang's favor in 608 over his use of witchcraft against Yang Zhao's sons. [...] Empress Xiao often accompanied Emperor Yang on his tours around the empire, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> that he had lost his virtues.
