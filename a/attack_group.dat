5|$|The plans {{called for}} two {{simultaneous}} attacks against Allied naval {{vessels in the}} Indian and South Pacific oceans. These attacks were intended as diversions ahead {{of the attack on}} Midway Island in the North Pacific, with the Japanese hoping to convince the Allies that they intended to attack to the south or west of their conquests. Eleven submarines of the 8th Submarine Squadron were to carry out the two attacks, the five submarines of the Western <b>Attack</b> <b>Group</b> in the Indian Ocean, and the six submarines of the Eastern <b>Attack</b> <b>Group</b> in the Pacific Ocean. The submarine groups were to select a suitable port of attack, based on their own reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|A {{military}} facility by the US Army Coastal Artillery on Galveston Island {{was established}} in the late 1890s and construction, which was disrupted by the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, was completed in the early 1900s, with the facility being named Fort Crockett in 1903. During the First World War, Fort Crockett served as a US Army artillery training center. Troops bound for France were trained in the use of several types of artillery. During the 1920s and early 1930s, Fort Crockett housed the United States Army Air Corps' (USAAC) 3rd <b>Attack</b> <b>Group</b> (an ancestor to USAF's 3rd Wing). At this time, the 3rd <b>Attack</b> <b>Group</b> was the only USAAC group devoted solely to attack aircraft. During the Second World War, focus was placed on defense against German U-boats, and the fort also served as a prisoner of war camp. Following the war, Fort Crockett served for several years as an army recreational center.|$|E
5|$|After {{three days}} and nights of this battle, C Company of the 35th Infantry and A Company of the 29th Infantry moved up astride the Komam-ni road during the morning of August 20 to bolster A and B Companies on Sibidang. A large {{concentration}} of North Koreans advanced to renew the attack. The US troops directed artillery fire on this force and called in an air strike. Observers estimated that the artillery fire and the air strike killed about 350 North Korean troops, half the <b>attack</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

As the Beaufighters and B-25s had expended their munitions, some USAAF A-20 Havocs of the 3rd <b>Attack</b> <b>Group</b> joined in. Another five hits were claimed by B-17s of the 43rd Bombardment Group from higher altitudes. During the afternoon, further attacks from USAAF B-25s and Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF followed.|$|E
5|$|As the Giro left Austria, {{the race}} began {{to enter the}} Dolomites during stage fourteen. The {{eventual}} stage winner Marco Pantani was in a chasing group on the final climb of the stage, the Passo di Monte Giovo. He attacked, bridged the gap to the leading group, and left them behind to claim his first professional victory of his career. The next stage saw Pantani win again after he rode away from the <b>attack</b> <b>group</b> on the last climb of the Valico di Santa Cristina and he then soloed to the finish in Stradella. Pantani's efforts on the day moved him up to second overall in the race. The race's sixteenth stage took {{a break from the}} mountains with the stage being primarily fled, which ultimately led to the sprint finish that was won by Italian Maximilian Sciandri. Ján Svorada won the next day's stage after attacking from the breakaway group in the closing seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} for four troops (A, B, C and F), {{headquarters}} and attached specialists, {{to be divided}} into two groups. Group one under the command of Major Mills-Roberts would land at Orange One and consisted of C Troop, a section from ATroop, the mortar detachment and some of the specialists. They would scale the cliffs and form a fire base in the woods in front of the battery to support the assault. Group two commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Lovat would land at Orange Two and take out the beach defences. B and F Troops would then advance move along the river and assault the battery from the rear. The rest of ATroop would be the reserve, positioned between the two beaches. After the <b>attack</b> <b>Group</b> two would withdraw through Group one and be picked up by the waiting LCAs on Orange One beach.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} a light group, the 3rd <b>Attack</b> <b>Group,</b> {{equipped}} {{with a mixture of}} Douglas A-20 Havocs and B-25 Mitchells. This group was not just short of aircraft; it was critically short of aircrew as well. To make up the numbers the USAAF turned to the RAAF for help. Australian aircrew were assigned to most of the group’s aircraft, serving in every role except aircraft commander. In addition to the RAAF aircrew with the USAAF squadrons, there were RAAF units in the Port Moresby area. No. 30 Squadron RAAF, which had arrived in Port Moresby in September 1942, was equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter. Both the aircraft and the squadron proved adept at low level attacks. Also in the Port Moresby area were the 35th and 49th Fighter Groups, both equipped with Bell P-400, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters, but only the last were suitable for long range escort missions.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October, Task Force 38 {{provided}} {{air cover}} for {{the invasion of the}} Treasury Islands, part of the preliminary operations for the invasion of Bougainville Island scheduled a few days later. On the morning of 1 November, Saratogas aircraft neutralized Japanese airfields at the northern end of the island and on Buka Island. They destroyed 15 Japanese aircraft while losing three Hellcats, one Dauntless, and two Avengers to all causes. While the task force was refuelling on 3–4 November, reconnaissance aircraft discovered Japanese cruisers massing at Rabaul and Admiral Halsey ordered Task Force 38 to attack them with maximal force before they could engage the transports at Bougainville. This translated into an <b>attack</b> <b>group</b> of 23 Avengers and 22 Dauntlesses, escorted by every available fighter on board the two carriers on 5 November; CAP over the carriers was provided by fighters flying from New Georgia. The attack caught the Japanese by surprise and badly damaged four heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and a destroyer for the loss of only nine aircraft to all causes.|$|E
5|$|Race leader Hinault and his team, , {{allowed a}} {{breakaway}} to get almost a twenty-minute {{advantage over the}} peloton during the race's seventeenth stage, before other general classification contenders' teams stepped in {{to help with the}} chase. The <b>attack</b> <b>group</b> reached the finish line around ten minutes faster than the peloton. Swiss rider Daniel Gisiger won the stage ahead of Giovanni Mantovani. Paolo Rosola won his second stage of the event as the eighteenth stage resulted in a bunch sprint. The following day's race route was altered the night before by Torriani, which removed six kilometers off the climb of Great St Bernard Pass, while it still contained the full climb of the Cima Coppi, the Simplon Pass. The stage saw a large group of fifty-three riders cross the finish line together, with Moser at the head, taking his second stage victory of the event. Former race leader Visentini, after losing a significant amount of time during the stage 16 individual time trial, abandoned the race during the nineteenth stage.|$|E

5|$|The sixteenth leg was a {{downhill}} stage from the Swiss Alps. A breakaway did form but was caught before the {{run into the}} finish as the peloton prepared for a sprint finish. The stage was initially won by Giovanni Lombardi, but he was deemed by race judges to have had an irregular sprint and the victory was awarded to the second placed rider Giuseppe Citterio. The next day consisted of a climbing time trial to Selvino. Rominger extended his advantage over all his competitors by winning the stage {{by a margin of}} one minute and thirty-nine seconds over Berzin. The eighteenth stage was plagued by rainy conditions throughout the undulating course. The day's breakaway consisted of sixteen riders, which Tony Rominger's Mapei team chose not to chase down. Denis Zanette and Giuseppe Guerini formed an <b>attack</b> <b>group</b> from the breakaway and rode into the finish where Zanette managed to edge out Guerini for the win. The main contenders did not have any time gaps during the stage, leaving the general classification unchanged.|$|E
5|$|At 3:00 AM on October 15, the {{reinforced}} company (less one platoon) {{began moving}} out of Port Said in preparation for its landing. At 3:30, the fire preparation began against the fort. It {{was carried out by}} the 135th Brigade's artillery and an additional artillery battalion. At 4:00, the attack began. The secondary attack force approaching from the west opened fire to draw the garrison's attention. The main force advanced towards the fort, spearheaded by the Sa'iqa company. The Egyptians managed to reach the fort and surprise its garrison. Soon the company {{was on the verge of}} entering the fort. The naval force however, due to bad sea conditions (sea state 4) arrived at 4:30, half an hour late, and then was forced to land one kilometer west of the fort. It joined the secondary <b>attack</b> <b>group</b> in its advance against the fortification. The mixed force came under heavy fire, and the battalion commander, Ali al-Mezahi was killed. The Sa'iqa company east of the fort finally succeeded in breaching the fort's defenses under heavy fire; the company commander was hit several times but continued to lead his men. The secondary force also managed to reach the fort's northern sand embankment. The fighting became intense, and the Egyptians picked up a radio signal sent by the garrison commander in which he detailed his men's precarious position and requested immediate assistance, especially air support. Despite the initial success achieved, Salah did not have his reserves on either side of the fort join the attack. With sunrise, Israeli aircraft began attacking Egyptian troops. Two F-4 Phantoms strafed the secondary force and made several bombing runs against it, while helicopters attacked the main force.|$|E
