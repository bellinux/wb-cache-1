Ramón y Cajal then proposed that dendritic spines could serve as contacting sites between neurons. This was demonstrated more than 50 years later thanks to the emergence of electron microscopy. Until the development of confocal microscopy on living tissues, it was commonly admitted that spines were formed during embryonic development and then would remain stable after birth. In this paradigm, variations of synaptic weight were considered as sufficient to explain memory processes at the cellular level. But since <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> new techniques of confocal microscopy demonstrated that dendritic spines are indeed motile and dynamic structures that undergo a constant turnover, even after birth.|$|E

Even though the cutting wit of the first decade lost its edge a bit, I still find 'The Simpsons' an extremely enjoyable way to spend my time. There aren't many things that are better than sitting down with a new season of 'The Simpsons' on Blu-ray and watching every episode back to back as fast as I possibly can. While the episodes sort of blend together, the humor is still there, and I still end up having quite a few genuine laughs".

40|$|The {{innovative}} {{process of}} Friction Stir Welding (FSW) has generated tremendous interest {{since its inception}} <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> or so <b>ago</b> since the first patent in 1991 by TWI of Cambridge, England.

Still the process needs both intensive basic study of deformation mechanisms during this FSW process and analysis and feasibility study to evaluate production methods that will yield high quality strong welds from the stirring action of the appropriate pin tool into the weld plate materials. Development of production processes is a complex task that involves effects of material thickness, materials weldability, pin tool design, pin height, and pin shoulder diameter and related control conditions. The frictional heating with rotational speeds of the pin tool as it plunges into the material and the ensuing plastic flow arising during the traverse of the welding faying surfaces provide the known special advantages of the FSW process {{in the area of}} this new advanced joining technology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractModern {{cryptography}} {{is based}} on various building blocks such as one way functions with or without trapdoors, pseudo-random functions, one way permutations with or without trapdoors, etc. In a quantum world {{some of the main}} candidates for these building blocks are broken. For instance, the security of the most popular public-key cryptosystem—RSA—is related to the difficulty of factoring large numbers, and is broken (in principle) by a quantum computer. We investigate some of the remaining candidates, and discuss the resulting “Post-Quantum Cryptography” (namely, the resulting “modern cryptography in <b>a</b> quantum environment”). <b>About</b> half <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago</b> Ajtai and Dwork (and later on, also Goldreich, Goldwasser and Halevi) proposed a public key cryptosystem that has a proven security under a plausible complexity assumption. The plausible assumption is that the so-called unique shortest vector problem (u-SVP) is hard on the worst case. This problem is potentially still hard also in a quantum environment. Recently, Regev introduced a new (and much simpler) public key cryptosystem, based on the same u-SVP hardness assumption, but with improved parameters. In this paper we present chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA) against all three cryptosystems. Our attack shows that these cryptosystems are totally insecure against CCA, because the private keys can be recovered in polynomial time. We then discuss the possibility of making public key encryption (PKE) secure against CCA, without adding stronger assumptions than the assumption that u-SVP is hard. We conclude that the current understanding of modern cryptography in a quantum environment can only suggest CCA-secure interactive-PKE, which is obviously weaker than CCA-secure PKE. Finally, we discuss the relation of our attack to the reaction attack of Hall, Goldberg and Schneier, which we only recently became aware of...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{reported}} that despite high health expenditure and a myriad of policies in place, South Africa’s health outcomes are worse than those in many lower income countries. The adverse health outcomes are even more pronounced in a rural province such as the Eastern Cape Province. Consequently, the Eastern Cape Department of Health (ECDOH) had turned to Private Public Partnerships (PPP) {{with the hope of}} mitigating some of the challenges beleaguering the health system in the province. This study evaluated the impact of the implementation of one of the PPP models at an Eastern Cape Hospital on key employee job outcomes. This is crucial as there had not yet, been this type of scientific assessment {{of the impact of the}} PPP model since the inception of the PPP <b>about</b> half <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago.</b> Theoretical guidance of the study was provided by the Job Characteristics Theory (JCT) of Oldham and Hackman (1975), which predicted that changes in five core characteristics of a job will affect three critical psychological states which will in turn impact on key employee job outcomes. Uniquely, this study veered away from the traditional quantitative approach to the application of the JCT but rather adopted a qualitative case study approach. There is historical evidence that cross cultural validation of a theory in a new setting (a South African PPP hospital in this instance) benefits from an initial qualitative study. Data collection and analysis were guided by the JCT. Primary data collection was by semi-structured, face to face, one on one interviews. The analyses of the data specifically employed pattern matching and explanation building techniques, all underpinned by the JCT. Validity of interview data was strongly contributed to by available relevant case study documents. This study found that indeed, the implementation of this PPP model brought about changes in all five (JCT) core job characteristics of clinical staff, but to varying degrees in the three unique shared service areas. Interestingly, the three psychological states were found to have been impacted upon by changes in the JCT core job characteristics but also by factors related to the context of the job, such as quality of supervision and co-worker relationship. In contrast to the predictions of the JCT, this study also found that the key job outcomes were impacted directly by such contextual factors as the recent availability of specialists and staff shortages, among others. It also emerged that the PPP implementation has directly evoked a perception of inequity and breach of psychological contract among clinical staff working at the shared service areas. Among the three shared areas, the accident and emergency unit was discovered to have had the worst overall impact. Due to the importance of contextual factors at this PPP setting, key recommendations were directed towards improved management of the jobs. It is also recommended that a follow-up quantitative study be commissioned to further explore the main themes that emerged from this study. This research report is presented in three sections. Section 1 is the evaluative report itself, structured as an academic paper. Section 2 expands on the literature that was briefly reviewed in Section 1 while Section 3 outlines, in greater details, the research methods followed during the conduct of the research and the justifications thereof...|$|R
