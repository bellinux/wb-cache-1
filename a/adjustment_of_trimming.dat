Methods: The expression levels <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 11 were examined by real-time PCR, Western blot and Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. TRIM 11 knockdown cells were produced by lentivirus infection, and functional assays, such as MTT, colony formation assay, migration and invasion assays and a xenograft tumor model were used to investigate the role <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 11 in HCC. We also determined the effect <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 11 on p 53 signaling and its downstream molecules. Results: We found that TRIM 11 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in HCC tissues as compared with normal tissues; increased levels correlated with poor patient survival.
