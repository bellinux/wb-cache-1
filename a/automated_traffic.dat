IETF has developed new protocols and techniques to meet the emerging traffic requirements and to manage and control the network and its services.

In this paper, an efficient dynamic link-coloring algorithm is proposed to engineer QoS paths within a Diffserv aware MPLS domain.

50|$|One {{example of}} SCP in {{practice}} is <b>automated</b> <b>traffic</b> enforcement. <b>Automated</b> <b>traffic</b> enforcement systems (ATES) use automated cameras {{on the roads}} to catch drivers who are speeding and those who run red lights. Such systems enjoy use all over the world. These systems have been installed and are advertised {{as an attempt to}} keep illegal driving incidences down. As a potential criminal, someone who is about to speed or run a red light knows that their risk of getting caught is nearly 100% with these systems. This completely disincentivizes the person from speeding or running red lights in areas in which they know ATES are set up. Though not conclusive, evidence shows that these type of systems work. In a Philadelphia study, some of the city's most dangerous intersections had a reduction of 96% in red light violations after the installation and advertisement of an ATES system.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{management}} {{has become increasingly}} important with growth in vehicle numbers unmatched by investment in infrastructure. A large part of management is measuring traffic flow. Video footage of traffic flow is normally manually checked to determine key traffic metrics, consuming many human hours. Moreover, installation and maintenance cost of recording equipment and supporting infrastructure is substantial, especially in the Sub-Saharan context. This paper proposes a novel solution to <b>automate</b> <b>traffic</b> flow estimation, using computer vision. The paper also introduces the notion of making the recording equipment mobile by using drone-based equipment, negating the need for fixed recording installations. The results demonstrate measurement accuracies of 100 % down to 81 % from ideal to worst case conditions, and successful implementation of drone control algorithms.

5000|$|These TMC's are square shaped {{boxes that}} have buttons for each {{direction}} of traffic flow. For example, east bound traffic entering an intersection has a button for those vehicles that turn, left, right or continue straight. Furthermore, an additional button is used for each direction to add the number of pedestrian and bicyclist movement. Typically <b>automated</b> <b>traffic</b> counters assess traffic flows, however, due to the differing angles of vehicles entering an intersection the present technology available {{is not able to}} quantify the traffic without major error. Traditional <b>automated</b> <b>traffic</b> counters have rubber tubes which are laid out across the road generally in a straight portion in order to have the wheels on the same axle hit at about the same time. When turning in an intersection the tires hit individually and the amount of error in the counter is increased. This means that TMC's are the only present option for quantifying traffic flows. They are used manually by an individual pressing the correlating button for every vehicle that enters and moves through the intersection.|$|E
