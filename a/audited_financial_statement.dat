But on 12 July 2005, during the defamation case the NKF had launched against SPH, the court was shown how the NKF in fact spent far less on dialysis than the public had been led to believe. According to its 2003 <b>audited</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement,</b> the NKF spent S$31.6 million that year on dialysis and transplantation. Of that amount, S$22.9 million came from dialysis fees it collected from patients and a further S$1.5 million came from other related income. So NKF was out-of-pocket by only S$7.2 million.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2010 the School Board of the East Ramapo Central School District {{voted to}} sell its Hillcrest Elementary School—closed due to budget cuts—to Yeshiva Avir Yakov of New Square. In an {{official}} response to {{an investigation of the}} sale, New York State Education Commissioner David Steiner stated the East Ramapo board “abused its discretion by hastily approving the sale.” The 12 acre campus, assessed at $10.2 million (market value) by the Assessor’s Office of Clarkstown was given only a $3.2 million appraisal by the school board's own attorney, Albert D’Agostino. On June 8, 2011 the commissioner of the NY State Education Department halted the sale of the building stating the board failed its fiduciary responsibility to the district when it approved the $3.2 million deal.{citation-needed} The sale eventually went through for $4.9 million. [...] In July, the new state Education Commissioner John King put a hold on the district's sale of Colton Elementary to Congregation Bais Malka/Hebrew Academy for Special Children with similar questions over the appraisal and bidding process as dogged the blocked sale of the Hillcrest school. On August 31, 2011, New York State Office of the Comptroller released an audit of the Board, for the period July 1, 2008 to April 13, 2010. The report criticizes the district for a number of serious lapses including failing to put $2.4 million in professional services contracts out to bid, allowing three senior school board members to receive health care through the school district's insurance pool after they failed to make $15,672 in payments, and failing to maintain proper inventory controls over $2.4 million in textbooks purchased for students not attending public schools, as required under state law. Most unsettling, the audit found that District officials inaccurately projected a June 30, 2010 fund balance of $13 million when preparing District's 2010-11 austerity budget that was presented to the electorate and on which cutbacks and layoffs were based. In fact, the District's <b>audited</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> showed a June 30, 2010, fund balance of $17,793,047, substantially higher than public estimates. The report states: [...] "The board, along with district officials, failed to fulfill its stewardship, oversight and leadership responsibilities when it failed to establish a proper control environment, implement its own adopted policy and establish policies and procedures required by sound business practices." [...] The report concludes. [...] "The deficiencies exposed district funds and assets to abuse, waste and/or loss." [...] The local paper headline was [...] "East Ramapo bungled millions," [...] and in a scathing editorial, the paper called for a thorough investigation of the board. During the year 2011, an article titled [...] "Regions Aging Schools Crumble as Finances Falter" [...] by Cathey O'Donnell and Gary Stern, was featured in a local newspaper, The Journal News, which is well known throughout the Lower Hudson Valley of Westchester County, New York. The article was about several old school buildings within the region that were in a current state of disrepair, how much it would cost to fix them and which if any might need to be demolished. One of the school districts mentioned was East Ramapo.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop a management framework for internal logistics in the Department of Education in Gauteng. For the purpose of this study internal logistics was defined as the complete process of obtaining goods and services from the compiling and processing of requisitions to the payment of invoices and the record keeping of all transactions to achieve organisational objectives. Internal logistics entails purchase planning, specification development, supplier research, contract administration and quotations, ordering and inventory control. The management of internal logistics can enhance productivity and performance within the value chain, improving service delivery, the outcome of the <b>audited</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> and ultimately the optimal spending of the allocated budget per financial year. For three consecutive financial years (2006 / 2007, 2007 / 2008, 2008 / 2009) GDE received a qualified <b>audited</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement.</b> For financial years 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011 GDE succeeded to receive an unqualified <b>audited</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement.</b> To maintain this achievement and ultimately receive a clean audit financial statement, it is necessary to evaluate all the business processes, specifically within supply chain management, contributing to the audit findings. Supply Chain Management (SCM) is in some way the completion of the circle of financial management. It is important for GDE to develop a uniform internal logistics framework that would enable them to also gain the maximum from its annual allocated budget. It is also critical that the internal logistics are attended to as soon as possible to have a positive input towards the <b>audited</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement.</b> A literature study was done on the concepts of the value chain, supply chain management and the management of knowledge. A questionnaire was designed, based on the findings in the literature, and used to measure the efficiency of the internal logistics in the District offices. The state of the internal logistics at the District offices was assessed through survey questionnaires to extract the data. It became evident that certain gaps and problems exist in relation to internal logistics at the District offices and that knowledge management is related to these gaps and problems. Internal logistics has a link with the elements of supply chain management as investigated in the literature study. The elements of supply chain management can to be broken down into clear activities for the management of internal logistics. The key area of concern is that the internal logistics within SCM are not acknowledged and therefore not properly managed in the District offices. The result of this is that the allocated budget is not optimally utilised and also receives qualifications from the <b>audited</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement.</b> A practical framework to manage internal logistics is proposed for the Department of Education to assist with the problems, and to bridge the gaps found after analysing the questionnaires. The findings of the empirical study were used as the basis of the framework. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are drawn and rendered in order to improve the logistics management of the Department of Education in Gauteng. Master...|$|E
