500|$|The song's lyrics {{delve into}} Lo's hedonistic {{attempts}} to forget her former boyfriend. According to Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal, the narrator describes her attempts {{to overcome a}} failed relationship through binge eating and alcohol, as indicated in the lyrics about having the munchies, eating Twinkies, and throwing up during the first verse. In the chorus, she sings about drug abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / All the time, to keep you off my mind". According to Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, in the bridge, Lo approaches the theme of [...] "knowing—at some level—just how empty and self-obliterating her choices really are", <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about needing to take someone home in order to relieve her suffering. The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her {{favorite part of the}} track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D. Larson considered the song's message untrue because [...] "staying high does not keep anyone off your mind".|$|E

She mocks tears during a political speech <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about her late husband and in the next scene curses the insurance company for not giving her the due money.

In Boomerang (1974), Serra taped Nancy Holt <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> and hears her words played back to her after they have been delayed electronically.

2500|$|... "Telephone" [...] was {{originally}} written by Gaga for singer Britney Spears's sixth studio album, Circus (2008), but Spears's label rejected it. Later, Gaga recorded the song as a collaboration with Beyoncé for The Fame Monster. The song {{talks about the}} singer preferring the dance floor rather than answering her lover's call with the verses sung in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats. Gaga explained that the song deals with her fear of suffocation, [...] "fear [...] never being able to enjoy myself. 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it really hard {{to go out and}} have a good time." [...] In [...] "So Happy I Could Die", Gaga presents an ode to sexual feeling and actions, stating, [...] "I love that lavender blonde, The way she moves the way she walks, I touch myself, can't get enough." [...] Essentially a love song, the object of affection in [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] becomes Gaga herself <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about drinking, dancing, observing, and touching herself. Gaga's voice sounds sedated in the song. The song also uses Auto-Tune in the singer's vocals. The last song on The Fame Monster is [...] "Teeth", which contains gospel music and S style music composition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final section}} is [...] "The Pain" [...] which explores the {{difficulty}} piecing together one's {{life after the}} destruction and demise of a relationship through [...] "distraught" [...] lyricism and melancholic pop. The section opens with the [...] "thunderous" [...] electropop power-ballad [...] "Thousand Miles", which lyrically depicts Lo's obsession with reuniting with her lost love at all costs, {{even if it means}} running [...] "a thousand miles". Musically, the mid-tempo track tells a story of a girl [...] "struggling to forget a rocky relationship with an ex," [...] and is sonically amped up by the singer’s [...] "emotionally distraught" [...] vocals and [...] "thundering" [...] drum rhythms. The following song, [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] sees her emotionally unravel even more, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about self-medicating by smoking marijuana to cope to live without her lover. It's [...] "snappy" [...] verses are filled with [...] "quietly distinct, often strange imagery", including Lo eating her dinner in the bathtub, getting drunken munchies, and seducing dads on the playground. Musically, it is a Purity Ring-inspired song, and creates a calming atmosphere compared to that of morphine. [...] "This Time Around" [...] is a dark Charli XCX-inspired track which reflects on the lessons learned from a heartbreak. Lo's vocal performance on the song has been described as particularly yearning and broken. The final song of the section and album is [...] "Run on Love", an [...] "easy-going" [...] reworked nu-disco dance collaboration with EDM producer Lucas Nord. Lyrically, Lo sings of picking up her heart and choosing to no longer be a victim by living in the moment enjoy time with her lover before it runs out.|$|E

"You're {{certainly}} not fortunate in your intimates; I wish you {{might make a}} new collection," [...] {{he said to her}} one morning in reference to nothing visible at the moment, but in a tone of ripe reflection which deprived the remark of all brutal abruptness. [...] "It's as if you had taken the trouble to pick out the people in the world that I have least in common with. Your cousin I have always thought a conceited ass--besides his being the most ill-favoured animal I know. Then it's insufferably tiresome that one can't tell him so; one must spare him on account of his health. His health seems to me the best part of him; it gives him privileges enjoyed by no one else. If he's so desperately ill there's only one way to prove it; but he seems to have no mind for that. I can't say much more for the great Warburton. When one really thinks of it, the cool insolence of that performance was something rare! He comes and looks at one's daughter {{as if she were a}} suite of apartments; he tries the door-handles and looks out of the windows, raps on the walls and almost thinks he'll take the place. Will you be so good as to draw up a lease? Then, on the whole, he decides that the rooms are too small; he doesn't think he could live on a third floor; he must look out for a piano nobile. And he goes away after having got a month's lodging in the poor little apartment for nothing. Miss Stackpole, however, is your most wonderful invention. She strikes me as a kind of monster. One hasn't a nerve in one's body that she doesn't set quivering. You know I never have admitted that she's a woman. Do you know what she reminds me of? Of a new steel pen--the most odious thing in nature. She talks as a steel pen writes; aren't her letters, by the way, on ruled paper? She thinks and moves and walks and looks exactly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks.</b> You may say that she doesn't hurt me, inasmuch as I don't see her. I don't see her, but I hear her; I hear her all day long. Her voice is in my ears; I can't get rid of it. I know exactly what she says, and every inflexion of the tone in which she says it. She says charming things about me, and they give you great comfort. I don't like at all to think she talks about me--I feel as I should feel if I knew the footman were wearing my hat." ...|$|E
