2500|$|The Machine {{features}} a large ram-air intake hood scoop that was painted Electric Blue (code B6) {{with a large}} tachometer visible to the driver integrated into a raised fairing {{at the rear of}} the scoop. This hood-mounted tach came from the same vendor as used on competing makes with only different dial faces. Early production hood scoops were fiberglass layups, while those installed on Machines after 1 January 1970 were injection molded and of higher quality. The heavy-duty suspension was augmented by station wagon springs in the rear (with higher load rating) giving the car a raked look.

The rear <b>axle</b> <b>gear</b> ratio was increased from 4.22:1 to 3.9:1, giving 16.5 mph for every 1000 rpm.

The M1008 trucks used open Dana 60 front axles, with the M1028 and M1031 variations often having a Trac-Lok limited slip.

50|$|Hypoid gears {{are still}} common in larger trucks {{because they can}} {{transmit}} higher torque. A higher hypoid offset allows the gear to transmit higher torque. However increasing the hypoid offset results in reduction of mechanical efficiency and a consequent reduction in fuel economy. For practical purposes, it is often impossible to replace low efficiency hypoid gears with more efficient spiral bevel gears in automotive use because the spiral bevel gear would need a much larger diameter to transmit the same torque.

50|$|The impetus is to {{minimize}} overdrive use {{and provide a}} higher ratio first gear, which means more gears {{between the first and}} the last to keep the engine at its most efficient speed. This {{is part of the reason}} that modern automobiles tend to have larger numbers of gears in their transmissions. It is also why more than one overdrive gear is seldom seen in a vehicle except in special circumstances i.e. where high (numerical) differential gear is required to get the vehicle moving as in trucks or performance cars though double overdrive transmissions are common in other vehicles, often with a small number on the <b>axle</b> <b>gear</b> reduction, but usually only engage at speeds exceeding 100 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|Freedom Drive II {{uses the}} same {{hardware}} as the FDI system but adds a lower <b>axle</b> <b>gear</b> ratio {{in conjunction with the}} CVT to simulate the benefits of a 19:1 (s/b 1.9:1 not 19:1)low-range transfer case for off-road use. This function is an alternate program in the CVT and is not a transfer case function. FDII also adds hill descent control system, off-road tuned traction control, and electronic stability program. The Patriot with FDII also feature longer suspension travel (all 4x4, post 2011 models have the same suspension), skid plates, tow hooks, and a full-size spare tire.

This change was made to maintain acceptable in-town performance with taller final-drive ratios in the rear axle — 2.76:1 rear <b>axle</b> <b>gears</b> were being furnished in applications previously equipped with 2.93:1 or 3.23:1 gearsets.
