5|$|Heading {{into the}} eighth and final game, each team had three wins and three losses and one tie, but the Soviets were ahead in goal {{differential}} by two goals. In Canada, {{much of the}} country enjoyed an unofficial 'half a day' holiday, with many students in Toronto being sent home the afternoon of the game (which began at 1pm Eastern Time), while many others watched the game <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>or</b> school. In Montreal's Central Station, 5,000 fans gathered around ten TV sets to watch the game, which was simulcast in English on CBC Television and CTV, and in French by Radio-Canada. Until the men's hockey gold-medal game of the 2010 Winter Olympics, it was the most-watched sporting event in the history of Canadian television.|$|E

25|$|The {{biological}} thinning {{mechanism is}} not entirely understood, but DDE {{appears to be more}} potent than DDT, and strong evidence indicates that p,p'-DDE inhibits calcium ATPase in the membrane of the shell gland and reduces the transport of calcium carbonate from blood into the eggshell gland.

The national qualifications framework has five CoC levels which industries accept as effective for performance at work. CoC levels 1 and 2 provide entry to an industry or occupation.

A CoC can be awarded to anyone passing the occupational assessment for each level, {{regardless of the}} way the skill was obtained.

25|$|In early Western medieval art {{interest}} in landscape disappears almost entirely, kept alive only in copies of Late Antique {{works such as}} the Utrecht Psalter; the last reworking of this source, in an early Gothic version, reduces the previously extensive landscapes to a few trees filling gaps in the composition, with no sense of overall space. A revival in {{interest in}} nature initially mainly manifested itself in depictions of small gardens such as the Hortus Conclusus or those in millefleur tapestries. The frescos of figures <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>or</b> play {{in front of a}} background of dense trees in the Palace of the Popes, Avignon are probably a unique survival of what was a common subject.

25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder usually develops in adolescence or during early adulthood. It {{is not uncommon}} for children and adolescents to display some traits similar to those of NPD, but such occurrences usually are transient, and do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of NPD. True symptoms of NPD are pervasive, apparent in varied situations, and rigid, remaining consistent over time. The NPD symptoms must be sufficiently severe to the degree that significantly impairs the person's capabilities to develop meaningful human relationships. Generally, the symptoms of NPD also impair the person's psychological abilities to function, either <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> <b>or</b> school, or important social settings. The DSM-5 indicates that the traits manifested by the person must substantially differ from cultural norms, in order to qualify as symptoms of NPD.|$|E
25|$|Retaliation has {{occurred}} when {{a sexual harassment}} victim suffers a negative action {{as a result of}} the harassment.

Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also stalking and cyberstalking of the victim. Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, can use their power to see that a victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.|$|E

He proposed three possible explanations for nominative determinism: one's self-image and self-expectation being internally influenced by one's name; the name acting as a social stimulus, creating expectations in others that are then communicated to the individual; and genetics â€“ attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname.|$|E
