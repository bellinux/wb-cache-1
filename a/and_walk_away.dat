The convenience store becomes more profitable as a tourist trap, until the freezer's cooling system fails, causing Jasper to defrost <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a {{poker game}} show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as their coach and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round. In the second round, the amateur (with Negreanu now helping them from a sound proof booth, giving them advice through a listening device in the amateur's ear) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso, Barry Greenstein, Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker. If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to the trip to the Bahamas. At this point, the amateur has a decision to make. Keep the money <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs to keep) and play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but the trip to the Bahamas. In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E

25|$|This large stork has a dance-like display.

25|$|Although the {{freshwater}} crocodile {{does not}} attack humans as potential prey, it can deliver a nasty bite. There {{have been very}} few incidents where people have been bitten whilst swimming with freshwater crocodiles, and others incurred during scientific study. An attack by a freshwater crocodile on a human was recorded at Barramundi Gorge (also known as Maguk) in Kakadu National Park and resulted in minor injuries; the victim managed to swim <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> from the attack. He had apparently passed directly over the crocodile in the water. However, in general, it is still considered safe to swim with this species, {{so long as they}} are not aggravated.|$|E
25|$|I {{knew that}} the end of September was the last period (of time) before the explosion, but when Sharon reached the al-Aqsa Mosque, this was the most {{appropriate}} moment for the outbreak of the intifada.... The night prior to Sharon's visit, I participated in a panel on a local television station and I seized the opportunity to call on the public to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque in the morning, for it was not possible that Sharon would reach al-Haram al-Sharif just so, <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> peacefully. I finished and went to al-Aqsa in the morning.... We tried to create clashes without success because of the differences of opinion that emerged with others in the al-Aqsa compound at the time.... After Sharon left, I remained for two hours in the presence of other people, we discussed the manner of response and how it was possible to react in all the cities (bilad) and not just in Jerusalem. We contacted all (the Palestinian) factions.|$|E

500|$|Muntz {{developed}} a television chassis that produced an acceptable monochrome picture with 17tubes. He often carried {{a pair of}} wire clippers, and when he thought {{that one of his}} employees was [...] "overengineering" [...] a circuit, he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, he would tell the engineer [...] "Well, I guess you have to put that last part back in" [...] <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
500|$|Marmarosa {{continued}} {{to perform in}} Pittsburgh, albeit irregularly. Around 1963, DeFranco dropped by; he recalled that the pianist [...] "would play brilliantly for half a tune, then just stop <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away.</b> He didn't even know who I was". Marmarosa's last performance in public has been dated variously as occurring in 1968 or the early-to-mid 1970s. Diabetes contributed to his permanent retirement. [...] "Even the resurgence of interest in bebop in the 1970s and 80s did not {{bring him back to}} national attention", reported The New York Times.|$|E
500|$|Macrae {{credits the}} Australian army with {{developing}} {{the technique of}} slapping a sticky bomb directly onto a tank instead of throwing it from a relatively safe distance. Since the bomb used a blast effect, {{it was safe to}} do this <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> provided only that the bomb's handle was pointing away from the bomber – the handle would be shot away from the explosion [...] "like a bullet." [...] Macrae gives no date for the development of this tactic. Macrae confirmed that placing the bomb rather than throwing it gives better adhesion and allows thicker plates to be penetrated.|$|E

Logan regains consciousness but has lost his memory. He notices his dog tags read [...] "Logan" [...] on one side and [...] "Wolverine" [...] on the other.

500|$|Quesada sees Peter's {{making a}} [...] "deal with the Devil" [...] as a villain (Mephisto) taking {{advantage}} of someone at his weakest moment. This, he feels, is a better resolution than Peter and Mary Jane getting divorced, which would indicate [...] "they gave up on their love, that their life in love together was so awful, so stressful, so unfulfilling {{that they had to}} raise a red flag <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> from it. They quit on their marriage and even more tragic, (they) quit on each other. Instead, we had them make a deal with the devil. [...] 'Cause that isn't as bad." [...] Quesada went on to say, [...] "Peter and MJ didn't quit on their love, they sacrificed it to save a life, that to me is a pretty heroic story." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "You Make Me Wanna..." [...] {{was directed by}} Bille Woodruff. It starts with Usher sitting in an orange wall recess, reaching for a guitar, before cutting to a scene of him standing in a white-and-purple circular room, wearing an open shirt. It moves to a blue backdrop where Usher advances, flanked by four dancers. The scene is replaced by five clones of Usher dancing and sitting on chairs. The video continues with the singer performing dance routines throughout; interspersed are scenes of Usher singing the song on a background of blue pipes. Toward {{the end of the}} video, he takes off his shirt in the circular room, and finally Usher and his backup dancers step out of their shoes <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "Fading" [...] {{was written}} by Jamal Jones and Ester Dean, whilst {{production}} of the song was completed by Polow da Don and samples Enya's [...] "One by One" [...] from her album A Day Without Rain (2000). The song was recorded by Sandy Vee at The Bunker Studio's in Paris, France in 2010. Musically, the song features a piano and violin led instrumental whilst lyrically, [...] "Fading" [...] is about the female protagonist leaving her boyfriend because she feels that they have become distant and their relationship has faded. The lyrics of the song feature Rihanna adopting a vocal diction which urges her boyfriend to leave <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> from the relationship, [...] "Go on, be gone/ Bye bye so long/ Can't you see we're fading away". As noted by Emily Mackay of NME, the song is reminiscent {{of one of the}} singer's previous songs about a relationship gone awry, [...] "Take A Bow", in lyrical content and musicality.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Williams {{waiting for his}} laundry {{to be done in}} a store, before getting out for a walk. Meanwhile, Barlow is {{standing}} {{on the other side of}} the street. As the song starts the two of them start walking towards their cars whilst looking at each other. When they get inside, the scenes are intercut with the two of them dancing with their female partners. Later in the video, they are shown sitting at the bar having a drink whilst singing the song's words. As the second chorus starts, Williams and Barlow are at a pond, fishing and laughing. Scenes of them looking each other secretly are also shown. In the middle of [...] "Shame"'s bridge they start taking their shirts off. Shortly, they are shown climbing up a cliffs. After they get on the top they want to jump, however, they realize it's too high. Instead they hug each other <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> as the video finishes.|$|E

500|$|Giancarlo Esposito {{said that}} when he first read the script for [...] "Box Cutter", he was so shocked that he had to put it down <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> from it. Esposito said {{he did not want to}} [...] "take any of [...] home with me" [...] and had [...] "some deep concern about being able to do it and coming out of it unscathed, without really hurting my spirit and my soul". He worked through these {{concerns}} by justifying Gus' actions in that, by killing Victor, he was protecting everyone else who works for him. Nevertheless, he said it was [...] "a difficult moment for me" [...] to slit Victor's throat, and that during one take he tried to hush the character to make him die more calmly. That scene took two days to film, and Esposito remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to the others on set. The boots he was originally given were too large and he was concerned that he would slip, which would be out of character for Gus, who was otherwise completely calm and in control. A costume designer quickly procured the right-sized boots for him.|$|E
500|$|Zinta {{received}} further {{success in}} 2006, starring in Karan Johar's drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna with an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji and Kirron Kher. The film {{became one of}} the biggest box office hits in India, earning , and grossed over [...] abroad, the biggest Bollywood success of all-time in the overseas market up until then. It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years. The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor. She described the role as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image. The Indian Express concurred that this was successful: [...] "The lady has not just looked glamorous but she has walked with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoken with calmness. Who would have thought that the bubbly girl could so skilfully shed her age-old tag <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> as the don't-mess-with-me lass. So, all those who are in search of the peppy Preity, well, guys you've dialed the wrong number this time." ...|$|E
500|$|The part of Mason Verger, one of Lecter's two {{surviving}} victims, {{was originally}} offered to Christopher Reeve {{based on his}} work as a wheelchair-bound police officer in Above Suspicion (1995). Not having read the novel, Reeve showed initial interest in the role, but ultimately declined upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic, facially-disfigured child rapist. The part was later accepted by secondary choice Gary Oldman. Co-producer Martha De Laurentiis claimed they had a [...] "funny situation" [...] with Oldman wanting a prominent [...] "credit". She said: [...] "Now how can you have a prominent credit with Hannibal? The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling. So we really couldn't work something out (at first)." [...] Oldman was apparently [...] "out" [...] of the film for a while, but then came back in, asking to go [...] "unbilled". Oldman would become transformed and [...] "unrecognizable as himself" [...] to play the part of Verger. He would have no lips, cheeks or eyelids. Make-up artist Greg Cannom said: [...] "It's really disgusting... I've been showing people pictures , and they all just say 'Oh my God,' <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away,</b> which makes me very happy." [...] Oldman said that having his name completely removed from the billing and credits allowed him to [...] "do it anonymously" [...] under the heavy make-up. In home-release versions of the film, Oldman's name is included in the closing credits.|$|E
