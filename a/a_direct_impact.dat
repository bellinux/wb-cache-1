5|$|The 2003 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} season to feature no major hurricanes – storms of Category 3 intensity or higher – since 1977. It produced an unusually large number of tropical cyclones which affected Mexico. The most notable cyclones during the year were Hurricanes Ignacio and Marty, which killed 2 and 12people in Mexico, respectively, and were collectively responsible for about US$1billion (2003 USD) in damage. Three other Pacific storms, two of which were hurricanes, and three Atlantic storms also had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> on Mexico. The only other significant storm of the season was Hurricane Jimena, which passed just {{to the south of}} Hawaii, the first storm to directly threaten Hawaii for several years.|$|E
5|$|The Vaishnava {{movement}} in the Kannada-speaking regions found momentum after {{the arrival of the}} philosopher Ramanujacharya (1017–1137). Fleeing possible persecution from the Chola King (who was a Shaiva), Ramanujacharya sought refuge initially in Tondanur and later moved to Melkote. But this event had no impact on Vaishnava literature in Hoysala lands at that time. However, the teachings of Madhvacharya (1238–1317), propounder of the Dvaita philosophy, did have <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> on Vaishnava literature, in both the Sanskrit and Kannada languages. This body of writings is known as haridasa sahitya (haridasa literature).|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> on the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates {{at the same speed}} for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E

5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.|$|E
5|$|Tropical storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for the Florida Keys, the Florida Bay, {{and from the}} Jupiter Inlet coast southward to Cape Sable on September28. A tropical storm watch was {{in place for the}} mainland north from the Jupiter Inlet to the Sebastian Inlet and north of East Cape Sable to Chokoloskee. The warnings and watch were discontinued the next day, after <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> was no longer expected. At the time, a flood watch remained in effect for Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, Collier, and Monroe counties into September30. An airport weather warning was issued for Orlando International Airport and Executive Airport on September 28; arriving flights were put on hold, and pilots rerouted to other airports if possible. Eight Southwest Airlines flights were diverted to the airports of Tampa and Jacksonville, and one JetBlue flight to West Palm Beach. Though airport officials later reported normalized conditions, an additional 26 flights were canceled at Miami International Airport the next day.|$|E
5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship {{to move out of the}} way. The crew is cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster.|$|E

Stiff competition for market-access and ever-growing difficulties to retain market-shares in the global arena is impacting businesses {{who are unable to}} afford the sustained capital investment requirements for continuous product development, quicker time-to-market and superior customer management.

25|$|This {{reduction}} had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> upon Jackson's {{ability to}} defend the lower Shenandoah Valley, {{and led to the}} need to evacuate Winchester on March 9 in the face of superior forces advancing to Winchester under Union Maj. Gen. Banks. Therefore, despite having prevented Rosecrans's goal of taking Winchester in January or February 1862, the insurrection of Loring's Division and its subsequent reassignment led to the inevitable seizure of Winchester by General Banks in March. It was not until Jackson was able to be reinforced with more disciplined and seasoned troops from Major General Richard S. Ewell's Division that {{he would be able to}} retake the initiative in the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{models of}} belief, lack of education, and {{religious}} connotations {{of the disease}} continue to influence social perceptions of those afflicted {{in many parts of}} the world.

Socioeconomic factors also have <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact.</b> Lower-class domestic workers who are often employed by those in a higher socioeconomic class may find their employment in jeopardy as physical manifestations of the disease become apparent.

The trait 'positive urgency' has been shown to have a predictive relationship with increases in drinking quantity and alcohol-related problems in college, as well as drug use in college.

25|$|These {{new forms}} of {{monetary}} interdependence made possible huge capital flows. During the Bretton Woods era, countries were reluctant to alter exchange rates formally even in cases of structural disequilibria. Because such changes had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> on certain domestic economic groups, they {{came to be seen}} as political risks for leaders. As a result, official exchange rates often became unrealistic in market terms, providing a virtually risk-free temptation for speculators. They could move from a weak to a strong currency hoping to reap profits when a revaluation occurred. If, however, monetary authorities managed to avoid revaluation, they could return to other currencies with no loss. The combination of risk-free speculation with the availability of huge sums was highly destabilizing.|$|E
