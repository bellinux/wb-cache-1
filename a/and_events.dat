30|$|Configuration of <b>event</b> {{reputation}} threshold <b>and</b> <b>event</b> {{confidence threshold}} in an ERS {{are dependent on}} the sensor capability of a vehicle and the type characteristics of a traffic event. In general, there are some design criteria and guidelines to help vehicle manufacturers or drivers determine these two thresholds. For example, when instant notification of event occurrence {{is more important than}} <b>event</b> reliability <b>and</b> <b>event</b> continuity in situations such as emergency braking <b>event</b> <b>and</b> speed decrease <b>event,</b> both thresholds should be set to a lower value. On the contrary, if <b>event</b> reliability <b>and</b> <b>event</b> continuity are more important than instant notification of event occurrence in situations such as vehicle accident <b>event</b> <b>and</b> traffic jam <b>event,</b> both thresholds should be set to a higher value. Therefore, we suggest that different pairs of <b>event</b> reputation threshold <b>and</b> <b>event</b> confidence threshold should be preconfigured in an ERS based on various <b>event</b> types <b>and</b> sensor capability of vehicle.|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes {{the impacts}} of <b>event</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> actor {{alignment}} in English and Bengali phrase based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT) System. Initially, <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> actors are identified from English and Bengali parallel corpus. For <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> actor identification in English we proposed a hybrid technique and it was carried out within the TimeML framework. Events in Bengali are identified based {{on the concept of}} complex predicate structures. There can be one-to-one and one-to-many mappings between English <b>and</b> Bengali <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> actors. We preprocess the parallel corpus by single tokenizing the multiword <b>events</b> <b>and</b> event-actors which reflects some significant gain on the PB-SMT system. We represent a hybrid alignment approach of <b>events</b> <b>and</b> event-actors in both English-Bengali training corpus by defining a rule based aligner and a statistical hybrid aligner. The rule base aligner assumes a heuristic that the sequence of <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> actors on the source (English) side are also maintained in the target (Bengali) side. The performance of PB-SMT system could vary depending on the number of <b>events</b> <b>and</b> event-actors that are identified in the parallel training data. The proposed system achieves significant improvements (5. 79 BLEU points absolute, 53. 02 % relative improvement) over the baseline system on an English-Bengali translation task. ...|$|R

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{provide an}} advanced platform {{to observe the}} physical world. Different users may be in-terested in different events derived from a same spatial phe-nomenon. The constrained and noisy environment of sensor networks, however, challenges successful in-network solu-tions to monitor <b>and</b> detect <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> boundaries. This paper presents an efficient algorithm, named NED, to support <b>event</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> boundary detection in wireless sen-sor networks. NED encodes partial event estimation results into variable length messages exchanged locally among neighboring nodes. Sensor nodes estimate <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> boundaries based on moving averages to eliminate noise ef-fects. Thus, NED is resource-friendly to constrained sensor networks, and scales well to very large networks. Our ex-periment results illustrate that NED’s communication cost is flexible and moderate to different noise levels, and NED provides high quality estimation results of <b>event</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> boundary detection. ...|$|R

Concerning consecutive age groups, significant differences were observed between four- and five-year-olds in productivity <b>and</b> <b>event</b> content <b>and</b> between five- and six-year-olds in referential cohesion. Multiple regression analysis showed that the relationship between productivity <b>and</b> <b>event</b> content was important, and especially the number of different word tokens proved to be useful in explaining the event content, whereas the number of communication units did not. This suggests that some productivity measures should be interpreted with caution...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze and {{understand}} the impact of the global financial crisis during 2007 - 2009. Furthermore, the paper seeks to identiy critical impacts upon the festival <b>and</b> <b>event</b> industry as a result of this crisis and to identify strategies to help members of the industry positively advance in the future. Design/methodology/approach – Festival <b>and</b> <b>event</b> industry professionals were surveyed electronically about their business performance during the current global recession and about their potential strategies for coping in the short term and long term. Findings – It was found that about the half of respondents’ profit margins decreased during the recent financial crisis. The respondents indicated that primary factors that impacted the decrease were reduced available sponsorship funding and the general effects of economic recession on all other revenue sources. The festival <b>and</b> <b>event</b> professionals expected the industry to grow and perform at a very conservative pace over the two years (2011 and 2012) following the recession. The strategies that the festival <b>and</b> <b>event</b> professionals intended to use to build successful businesses following the recession were “increase marketing efforts,” “work to reduce expenses overall,” and “increase the use of technology”. Research limitations/implications – The findings of this study solely reflect the US festival <b>and</b> <b>event</b> industry. Practical implications – The significant contribution of this study is the analysis and understanding of the direct impact of the recent recession on the festival <b>and</b> <b>event</b> industry <b>and</b> also providing additional knowledge of changes being made by the industry in direct response to the economic recession of 2007 - 2009. Originality/value – The paper describes the first study of its kind to measure the direct impact of the global recession on the festival <b>and</b> <b>event</b> industry. The findings provide a guide to assist festival <b>and</b> <b>event</b> leaders to make better decisions to deal with both the current recession and future downturns. It also serves as a foundation to measure the performance of the festival <b>and</b> <b>event</b> industry in various economic environments...|$|R
