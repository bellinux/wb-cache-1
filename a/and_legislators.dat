5|$|Rodríguez Saá {{prepared}} a budget bill for 2002, which {{was sent to}} the Congress. It included an important decrease in the deficits, as requested by Anne Krueger from the International Monetary Fund. Krueger also requested a new coparticipation law, to determine the way the nation and the provinces manage tax revenues. Rodríguez Saá called for a meeting with governors in Chapadmalal, but only six governors out of twenty-three attended: Carlos Ruckauf, Juan Carlos Romero, Gildo Insfrán, Ángel Mazza, Carlos Rovira and Alicia Lemme. José Manuel de la Sota, governor of Córdoba, withdrew his support, suspecting that Rodríguez Saá had plans to cancel the elections and stay as president up to 2003. On December 30, he returned to San Luis with Daniel Scioli and resigned, alleging lack of support {{from the rest of the}} Justicialist Party. Insfrán, Maza and minister Rodolfo Gabrielli tried to convince him to stay as president; his brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá supported his decision. In announcing his resignation in a Cadena nacional, he recounted the achievements of his one-week administration and accused Justicialist governors <b>and</b> <b>legislators</b> of meanness and shortsightedness. He dispatched his resignation from San Luis to Buenos Aires, and the Congress accepted it on January 1, 2002. The Senate chairman Ramón Puerta would have been the interim president, but resigned as well, so Eduardo Camaño, president of the Chamber of Deputies, was appointed interim president instead. After new deliberations, they elected Eduardo Duhalde as president, this time with a mandate that would fill the remaining time of delaRúa's mandate.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 19 November, protesters broke into a side-entrance to the Legislative Council Complex, {{breaking}} glass panels with concrete tiles and metal barricades. Legislator Fernando Cheung and other suffragists tried to stop the radical activists, but were pushed aside. The break-in, which according to The Standard was instigated by Civic Passion, was criticised by the three main activist groups of the protests, <b>and</b> <b>legislators</b> from both the pan-democracy and pro-Beijing camps. Three police were injured and six men were arrested for criminal damage and assault.|$|E

The National Woman's Party sent valentines, designed by Allender, on February 14, 1917 to President Wilson <b>and</b> <b>legislators</b> as a softer appeal in the campaign to attain women's right to vote.|$|E
25|$|Temple Grandin began {{shooting}} in October 2008 at Austin Studios in Austin, Texas. The film was noted for filming in Texas {{at a time}} when TV and film production had grown scarce in the state, <b>and</b> <b>legislators</b> were seeking to expand financial incentives to draw more film crews. Grandin producer Scott Ferguson said that Arizona, New Mexico and Canada had all been considered before producers had chosen Texas, in part because different areas of the state could be used to represent the rural West and New England. Ferguson also credited the abundance of trained film crews in the Austin and Dallas regions as a significant benefit to {{shooting in}} the area.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, white Democrats in the South {{had created}} state constitutions that were hostile to {{industry}} and business development, with anti-industrial laws extensive from the time new constitutions were adopted in the 1890s. Banking was limited, as was access to credit. States persisted in agricultural economies. Especially in Alabama and Florida, rural minorities held control in many state legislatures long after population had shifted to industrializing cities, <b>and</b> <b>legislators</b> resisted business and modernising interests: Alabama refused to redistrict between 1901 and 1972, long after major population and economic shifts to cities. For decades Birmingham generated the majority of revenue for the state, for instance, but received little back in services or infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|On 24 December, the {{national}} legislature approved Sharmarke's nomination. According to Federal Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari, of the 224 MPs {{present at the}} parliamentary session, 218 {{voted in favor of}} the appointment, none rejected it or abstained, and six left the hall. The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, European Union, and US government all welcomed the endorsement and reaffirmed their support for the Somalian authorities. On 25 December, Sharmarke officially took office at a handover ceremony in Villa Somalia attended by President Mohamud, outgoing cabinet ministers, <b>and</b> <b>legislators,</b> among other guests. Former Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed therein urged the new administration and legislature to work together to implement the tasks within Vision 2016. Sharmarke and Mohamud in turn lauded Ahmed's administration, and noted its various achievements in terms of domestic and foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|More residences were built, {{primarily}} to be rented to lawyers <b>and</b> <b>legislators</b> {{working in the}} capitol and the courts. The city began to expand and annex surrounding land to handle its growth. The opening of the Erie Canal in the 1820s {{and the development of}} railroads in later decades made the city a transportation hub, and as its commercial power and the state's grew it assumed more political importance. Smaller buildings remained the norm along the side streets, with churches springing up next to them. Richard Upjohn's French Gothic St. Peter's Episcopal Church on State, finished in 1860, is considered one of his best churches. Another church, St. Mary's, by the local firm of Nicholls and Brown, became the focal point of a neighborhbood of small houses on and near Lodge Street. Richard Upjohn's French Gothic St. Peter's Episcopal Church on State, finished in 1860, is considered one of his best churches.|$|E

25|$|After {{his term}} as {{governor}} expired, Coles returned briefly to Virginia, {{where his mother}} had died that spring. Coles then returned to his farm outside of Edwardsville. He focused on agricultural and business pursuits, between continued trips to Virginia and Philadelphia to visit {{family and friends and}} to search for a wife. His friend Daniel Pope Cook was defeated by a proslavery opponent in 1826, <b>and</b> <b>legislators</b> had selected their pro-slavery speaker John McLean to fill unexpired U.S. Senate terms in 1824 and 1829 (voters ultimately electing Elias Kent Kane and John McCracken Robinson to those seats). Coles made his last run for public office in 1831. As candidate for Congress, running against eight candidates including pro-slavery Democrats Joseph Duncan (allied with Treasury Secretary William H. Crawford) and Sidney Breese (a Jacksonian Democrat), Coles polled a distant third. He had been out of public view for some years, and refused to align himself with any political party. Instead, Coles campaigned on his successful term as governor, proclaimed his association with the founding fathers, and criticized the Jacksonian platform. Still, Coles felt devastated by the political defeat, and moved back east. Nonetheless, in 1835, Illinois legislators authorized Coles to sell bonds to finance his canal project, but since they also refused to back the bonds with state credit, sales proved slow.|$|E
25|$|Coles’ {{inaugural address}} {{included}} a clear {{call for the}} end of slavery in Illinois and revision of the Black Code, as well as advocated internal improvements (especially a canal link to the Great Lakes) and aid to agriculture and education. Slavery was a very important topic at the time, because that first state constitution only permitted current practices using slave labor in the salines (salt evaporation factories) through 1825. A proslavery faction had hoped to eliminate the first constitution's anti-slavery clause and transform Illinois into a slave state like Missouri. Coles’ bold call for an end to slavery stiffened their resolve and led to a rancorous legislative effort which began with the Shaw-Hansen Affair (concerning whether to seat a pro-slavery candidate backed by voters who came from Missouri, or his anti-slavery opponent). Governor Edward Coles led the opposition to a bill approving a referendum to hold another constitutional convention, recognizing it as a dishonest attempt to more clearly legalize slavery in the state. After the bill passed, Coles committed his total pay as governor ($4000) to defeat the referendum, and led a committee of anti-slavery citizens, religious leaders, <b>and</b> <b>legislators</b> (who committed another $1000). The aristocratic, awkward Virginian and his allies then dispelled a plethora of false economic arguments spread by slavery proponents, while {{in the aftermath of the}} Panic of 1819 keeping secret their printing help from much-reviled Philadelphians (Nicholas Biddle and Roberts Vaux). The 18-month political struggle used committees in each county as well as traveling preachers.|$|E
