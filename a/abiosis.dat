5000|$|Andrew Craighan (born 18 July 1970) {{is one of}} My Dying Bride's {{founding}} guitarists. [...] Along with Aaron Stainthorpe, and now Calvin Robertshaw {{they are}} the only original members of the band still in the lineup. He played the guitar from 1989 to 1990 in the band <b>Abiosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|My Dying Bride {{were formed}} in Bradford {{in the north}} of England in June 1990 after guitarist Andrew Craighan and drummer Rick Miah co-formed the band after they had split from <b>Abiosis,</b> joining vocalist Aaron Stainthorpe and guitarist Calvin Robertshaw while ending <b>Abiosis.</b> After six months of rehearsing, the band {{recorded}} and released their demo, Towards the Sinister, which was produced by Tim Walker of Voltage Records. Its title was taken from a line in the song [...] "Symphonaire Infernus et Spera Empyrium". The band would soon release their first single, [...] "God Is Alone", on a small French label called Listenable. After the single had sold out almost immediately, they were picked up by Peaceville Records, and they could release their first EP, Symphonaire Infernus et Spera Empyrium, which also featured their latest recruit, bassist Adrian Jackson. The EP was soon followed by their first full-length album, As the Flower Withers.|$|E
40|$|The maize p 1 gene encodes an R 2 R 3 -MYB {{transcription}} factor {{that controls the}} biosynthesis of red flavonoid pigments in floral tissues of the maize plant. Genetic and quantitative trait locus analyses have also associated the p 1 gene with the synthesis of maysin, a flavone glycoside from maize silks that confers natural resistance to corn earworm. Here, we show directly that the p 1 gene induces maysin accumulation in silk tissues. Transformation of maize plants that had low or no silk maysin with p 1 transgenes elevated silk maysin concentrations to levels sufficient for corn earworm <b>abiosis.</b> The p 1 transgenes also conferred red pigment to pericarp, cob, husk and tassel tissues, as expected; however, different subsets of these tissues were pigmented within individual transgenic plants. Statistical analysis shows that the pigmentation patterns observed amongst the p 1 transgenic plants conform to a hierarchy {{that is similar to}} the temporal ordering of floral organ initiation. We propose that the observed hierarchy of pigmentation patterns is conferred by variation due to epigenetic control of the p 1 transgenes. The production of plants with improved traits through genetic engineering can depend in large part on the achievement of tight organ-specific expression of the introduced transgenes. Our results demonstrate that the production of transgenic plants using a promoter with well-defined tissue specificity, such as the p 1 promoter, can result in unexpected variation in tissue specificity amongst the resulting transgenic plants...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the enigmatic, circular, barren patches {{on the edge of}} the pro-Namib Desert in Namibia. An aerial {{photograph}} of the Wolwedans area (25 ° 4. 5 ′S, 15 ° 59. 5 ′E) showed that the patches had an average diameter of 6. 1 m and an ordered distribution with an R-value of 1. 68, suggesting a termite-associated origin. We postulate that there is an active evolutionary process of circular patch formation, involving genesis, growth, maturation and extinction. Stipagrostis uniplumis seedlings growing in the moist inner soil of barren patches, after rains, appeared to lack root side-hairs when compared to similar plants growing outside the patch and these seedlings invariably died when the rains subsided. Growth experiments with Cynodon dactylon in inner and outer soil samples showed that these grass seedlings could survive cycles of dehydration and hydration only when growing in outer soil. Seedlings in the inner soil collapsed and died under similar conditions. This suggested that there is a biological factor in the inner soil, which inhibits resistance to dehydration, possibly through inhibition of side-root growth and/or maintenance. We postulate that termites are linked to this biological factor in some unknown manner and that the barren patches have an evolutionary advantage for the termites by acting as water traps. Direct experiments showed five-fold more water in soil samples from the barren patches than between them. Preliminary attempts to indicate or isolate the putative <b>abiosis</b> factor with HPLC were not successful and more sophisticated analytical techniques are called for. Articl...|$|E
