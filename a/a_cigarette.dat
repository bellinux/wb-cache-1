5|$|In {{the court}} of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe asked for <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> to smoke {{in the middle of}} reading a kvitel, it was a sign that the petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a {{follower}} of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe on behalf of a Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe asked for <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.|$|E

50|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{popularity}} is the price. <b>A</b> typical <b>cigarette</b> contains less than 1 gram of tobacco. A pouch of 40-42.5 grams {{is about the same}} price as a box of 19-20 cigarettes, so the cost of <b>a</b> self-rolled <b>cigarette</b> is half the price of <b>a</b> ready-made <b>cigarette.</b> Many people also put much less tobacco in <b>a</b> self-rolled <b>cigarette.</b> The taxes on tobacco, however, are mainly based on the weight of tobacco, so the margins for the producer are lower on shag than on ready-made cigarettes.|$|R

5|$|Some {{time after}} 7:00pm, a Woodsville, New Hampshire {{resident}} {{heard a loud}} thump outside of her house. Through her window she could see a car up against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. The car pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. She telephoned the Grafton County Sheriff's Department at 7:27pm to report the accident. According to the 911 log, the woman claimed to have seen a man smoking <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> inside the car. However, the woman later stated {{that she had not}} seen a man nor a person smoking <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> but rather had seen {{what appeared to be a}} red light glowing from inside the car, potentially from a cell phone. At about the same time another neighbor saw the car as well as someone walking around the vehicle. She witnessed a third neighbor pull up alongside the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results {{on the influence of}} cigarette moisture content to the chemical composition of particulate phase smoke. Seventy-five selected compounds were monitored for the comparison of particulate phase smoke of a commercial full-flavored (FF) cigarette with three different moisture contents at 7. 8 %, 14. 5 % and 20. 4 %, respectively. It was demonstrated that the smoke of <b>a</b> dry <b>cigarette</b> is richer in lower molecular mass compounds than <b>a</b> regular <b>cigarette.</b> On the other hand, the smoke of <b>a</b> moist <b>cigarette</b> is richer in higher molecular mass compounds than <b>a</b> regular <b>cigarette.</b> To maximize the influence of cigarette moisture to the chemical composition, a separate set of measurements were done using only the first three puffs of smoke. The accumulation of moisture in the tobacco column of <b>a</b> burning <b>cigarette</b> may influence the smoke composition, as generated during burning. The differences between dry, regular and moist cigarettes were more obvious for the first three puffs...|$|R

40|$|Background—Cigarette {{smoking is}} a {{well-known}} risk factor {{for the development of}} cardiovascular disease, yet the mechanism of action involved is not completely understood. Because cigarette smoke contains superoxide and other reactive oxygen species, it has been hypothesized that some of the adverse effects of smoking may result from oxidative damage to endothelial cells, which results in nitric oxide (NO) shortage. However, little information is available regarding the acute effects of smoking on plasma concentrations of NO and antioxidants. We measured the changes in the combined plasma concentrations of nitrate and nitrite as an index of NO concentration, as well as changes in concentrations of major serum antioxidants (ascorbic acid, cysteine, methionine, and uric acid) in smokers after smoking <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette.</b> Methods and Results—A randomized crossover study of the effects of smoking <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette</b> was performed in 20 smokers. Smoking <b>a</b> sham <b>cigarette</b> induced no significant changes in all assayed parameters. However, smoking <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette</b> significantly decreased nitrate and nitrite plasma concentrations by 3. 51. 2 and 3. 41. 1 mol/L, compared with plasma concentrations at presmoking and sham smoking, respectively. The concentrations of ascorbic acid and other antioxidants were also significantly lower after smoking <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette.</b> These parameters returned to preexperimental levels 60 minutes after smoking cessation. Conclusion—The present findings indicate that smoking <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette</b> temporarily decreases nitrate, nitrite, and seru...|$|R

5|$|During a hailstorm in Washington state, {{university}} students run to find shelter. One girl, Lauren (Kristi Angus), {{stands in the}} rain, lights <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> and goes up in flames. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question—Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring {{about the end of}} the world. Hoffman believes that this cataclysm will be preceded by strange events and weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|During the {{suspension}} of competitive football in the First World War, Hyde Road was used to stable 300horses. Later in the wartime period the club became the sole leaseholder of the ground, no longer dependent upon support from Chesters brewery. At this point the annual rent was £500. In 1920, the ground became the first football venue outside London to be visited by a reigning monarch; King George V attended the ground to watch a match between Manchester City and Liverpool. In November a fire caused by <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> end destroyed the Main Stand, and Manchester City began to seek a new home. Initial discussions {{raised the possibility of}} sharing Old Trafford with neighbours Manchester United, but United's proposed rent was prohibitive, so repair work was undertaken and Manchester City continued to play at Hyde Road.|$|E

In 2004, the Yu Yu Hakusho manga serialization sparked a controversy when a Florida grade school teacher issued a complaint about material found in an issue of the American Shonen Jump magazine purchased by a fifth-grade student at a Scholastic Book Fair. The complaint centered around portions of the manga containing violence, mild profanity, a character wearing a swastika, and another character smoking <b>a</b> <b>cigarette.</b> About 18,000 copies of the publication (out of 120,000) were returned from the fairs {{as a result of}} the matter.
