25|$|Before the Apple reissues, {{the album}} was re-released as Goddess of Fortune on the Spiritual Sky label in 1973, and in other editions, {{including}} through Prabhupada's Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in 1991. The cover of Goddess of Fortune replaced Kosh's 1971 artwork with a photo by Clive Arrowsmith and a design credited to Peter Hawkins. Another title during the early 1990s was Chant <b>and</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Happy!,</b> a release that combined the original album with a ten-minute recording of Harrison, Lennon and Ono discussing Krishna Consciousness with Prabhupada.|$|E
500|$|In his AllMusic {{article on}} the song, Lindsay Planer views it as [...] "somewhat of a sacred rocker" [...] with [...] "ample lead guitar", and {{comments}} that Harrison's lyrics [...] "cleverly [...] upon an array of disparate imagery to convey a conversely simple spiritual revelation". Harrison biographer Alan Clayson considers the track [...] "more uplifting" [...] than [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and remarks on the aptness of Harrison's subject matter in 1970–71, when religious texts such as the Bible, the Koran and ISKCON's Chant <b>and</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Happy</b> [...] "now had discreet places on hip bookshelves". Former Mojo editor Mat Snow describes the song as [...] "glorious white gospel", in which Harrison [...] "rejects the Catholicism of his Liverpool upbringing".|$|E
500|$|The Boultons {{had three}} daughters {{in the early}} 1750s, but all died in infancy. [...] Mary Boulton's health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. [...] Marriage with a {{deceased}} wife's sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. Nonetheless, they married on 25 June 1760 at St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. [...] Eric Delieb, who wrote a book on Boulton's silver, with a biographical sketch, suggests that the marriage celebrant, Rev. James Penfold, an impoverished curate, was probably bribed. [...] Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife's sister: [...] "I advise you {{to say nothing of}} your intentions but to go quickly and snugly to Scotland or some obscure corner of London, suppose Wapping, and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner. [...] When the month is expired and the Law fulfilled, live <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy...</b> I recommend silence, secrecy, and Scotland." ...|$|E

500|$|Rodman {{experienced}} a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, {{whom he had}} admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–1993 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, {{the mother of his}} daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography As Bad As I Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life the way I want to live it <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E

Einstein goes along with Marić's wish for a daughter, and referred to the unborn child as [...] "Lieserl" [...] as well, but with a sense of humour as in letter 45 of 12 December 1901 [...] "... <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> about our Lieserl, whom I secretly (so Dollie doesn't notice) prefer to imagine a Hanserl." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing the 2010 remastered album, Joe Marchese of The Second Disc {{writes that}} The Radha Krsna Temple has [...] "a spellbinding quality, and remains a {{fascinating}} artifact {{of a special}} place and time for Harrison and Apple Records". In a review for AllMusic, music critic Ken Hunt writes of the devotees' eponymous album: [...] "this reissue reinstates their ecstatic music to disc. Its slightly Westernized but appealing arrangements betray Harrison's handiwork … For a season it turned into the popular face of Hinduism." [...] In his appraisal of Harrison's solo career for Blender magazine in 2004, Paul Du Noyer included the Chant <b>and</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Happy!</b> version in the category [...] "For fans only" [...] and highlighted [...] "Govinda Jai Jai" [...] as the [...] "standout track".|$|E
2500|$|... is {{too hard}} and stony; it must have love-scenes, and a happy ending. It is not enough that Cordelia is a daughter, she must shine as a lover too. Tate has put his hook in the {{nostrils}} of this Leviathan, for Garrick and his followers, the showmen of scene, to draw the mighty beast about more easily. A happy ending!—as if the living martyrdom that Lear had gone through,—the flaying of his feelings alive, {{did not make a}} fair dismissal from the stage of life the only decorous thing for him. If he is to live <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> after, if he could sustain this world's burden after, why all this pudder and preparation,—why torment us with all this unnecessary sympathy? As if the childish pleasure of getting his gilt-robes and sceptre again could tempt him to act over again his misused station,—as if at his years, and with his experience, anything was left but to die.|$|E

He also grew up with two younger brothers, Ross and Brett. Hunter remembered, [...] "We got guitars for Christmas one year, I broke mine but Todd played his. He was {{two years older than}} me and always more interested in music. I only saw it as a way of wagging school." [...] He described his home town, [...] " [...] was a great place to grow up in, and a great place to run away from, because you always knew you could go back to it and nothing much would have changed. It was the place where our parents always told us to 'Do what you want to do, just try <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> doing it.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{fragment}} (fragment 583) {{appears to}} be a lament by Procne about the status of married women. [...] In the Lloyd-Jones translation, this passage begins [...] "But now I am nothing on my own. [...] But I have often regarded the nature of women in this way, seeing that we amount to nothing." [...] The passage goes on to note that as children living with their father girls [...] "live the happiest life." [...] But then they are [...] "pushed out and sold, away from our paternal gods and from our parents, some to foreign husbands, some to barbarians, some to joyless homes, and some to homes that are opprobrious." [...] But regardless, they must approve <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with their lot. [...] Fitzpatrick believes that the tension between husband and wife was one of the themes of the play. [...] The tension between families by marriage and families by birth may also be a theme, as by raping Philomela, Tereus betrays the trust of Procne's and Philomela's father Pandion.|$|E

Dawson said that Darren is relieved that the wedding goes ahead as he worries that Nancy is [...] "too good for him". On how marriage will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "the only way it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves {{to both of them}} how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Commenting on the couple's future Dawson said that children are [...] "definitely something that they both want, as everything's going well [...] Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future". Fox said that Nancy's life is going well and she has a [...] "got this big family that care about her, having had no-one for so long". She added that her character [...] "loves Darren to pieces" [...] and she wanted to get married and then [...] "have babies <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy.</b> I think that's what she really wants". She teased that Nancy may not immediately want children but she may not have a choice in the matter.|$|E
2500|$|Zhen Shan Mei (Ariel Lin) {{is a poor}} {{but very}} loving, caring, and hard working girl. She has a boyfriend, but he moves to {{mainland}} China for university and promises that they will get married after he graduates. Shan Mei goes after him to China {{in the hope that}} they will finally get married. Shan Mei's family is against her decision because they need her to support them, but her father literally holds off {{the rest of the family}} while yelling to Shan Mei that she should go <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy.</b> She meets Frank while he's running from the gangsters who loaned him the money—in the ladies bathroom. Thinking that he's a pervert, she reports him to the police and he gets arrested. The ring fell out of Frank's pocket in the girls' bathroom and the policeman stuck it into Shan Mei's bag. He meets Shan Mei once more, this time on the road. He tries to get his ring back from her but she has no idea what he's talking about and she still thinks that he's a pervert. He doesn't get his ring, but he does get to drive her to the airport. When she reaches her destination, she meets her boyfriend and casually mentions [...] "Xiao Bo", his best guy friend. Eventually, her boyfriend cannot take the guilt and admits to Shan Mei that he betrayed her and fell for Xiao Bo, who is actually a girl.|$|E

2500|$|JR is {{eventually}} informed of Babe's one-night stand with Josh {{by her father}} (David Hayward). Not believing it, even when Josh confirms the encounter, viewers saw JR try {{to move on with}} his life <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with Babe. Once his suspicion gets the better of him, however, he confronts Babe about the matter. Babe tells the truth, and, in a dramatic fashion, JR later throws himself out a two-story window while drunk. While recovering, he insists that he no longer loves Babe. To add further conflict, Babe is written as thoroughly determined to win JR back; she undermines his wishes not to live with her. [...] "Babe is at the Chandler mansion. JR is home from the hospital and Babe isn't letting up," [...] said Havins. [...] "She's very dedicated to getting through to him. She's not saying, 'Let's get back together and forget anything ever happened.' It's more like, 'Let's try to move forward.' They aren't having an 'I love you' moment or anything like that, but she breaks the ice a little bit." [...] In addition, Babe's refusal to let JR go is happening during a serial killer arc, where Babe's life is in danger and one of her good friends (Erin Lavery) has just been murdered by the killer. In a moment where Babe confides to JR about this, viewers again witnessed the couple's star-crossed theme. [...] "He's sleeping and she is crying at his bedside and says, 'I need you so much.' Not only is she going through this, but she doesn't have her rock and best friend to lean on," [...] stated Havins. [...] "It's a lonely place to be. He opens his eyes and almost makes the move to connect — but then he doesn't." ...|$|E
