The F-111A variant first flew on 21 December 1964 from Carswell AFB, Texas. It was followed by the F-111B, which first flew on 18 May 1965.|$|E

5|$|All {{of these}} {{positions}} were nominally {{appointed by the}} Emperor and their holders were answerable directly to him.

5|$|As CAS, Williams had {{to contend}} with serious {{challenges}} to the RAAF's continued existence from the Army <b>and</b> <b>Navy</b> in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression.

Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to air vice marshal on 1January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army <b>and</b> <b>Navy.</b> He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June that year.|$|E
