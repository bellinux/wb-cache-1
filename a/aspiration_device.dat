This study evaluated and compared the resultant arterial damage from these devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wall damage after 4 wall-contact devices (the Merci retriever, Catch thromboembolectomy system, and Solitaire FR revascularization devices of 4 and 6 mm) and 1 <b>aspiration</b> <b>device</b> (the Penumbra System) was evaluated in the superficial femoral arteries of 20 male swine. Each device was tested {{with and without}} intraluminal clot. Twenty control vessels were not subjected to any intervention. Acute histopathologic changes were evaluated. RESULTS: In the device samples, endothelial denudation (72. 8 29. 4 % versus 0. 9 1. 9 %, P. 0001), medial layer edema (52 35. 9 % versus 18. 1 27. 8 %, P. 004), and mural thrombus (5. 3 14. 2 % versus 0 %, P. 05) were found {{to a greater extent}} compared with the control samples.

40|$|International audienceMaxillo-facial {{surgeries}} have {{a direct}} impact on the face shape and appearance. The anatomical variations in the face soft tissues (skin thickness, skin or muscle material parameters…) make it hard to predict the face final shape accurately. Biomechanical modeling could help in this prediction by simulating the soft tissue displacement following the bone remodeling and therefore the patient's face visible outcome. Measuring the variation of the skin properties across a range of subjects could help to build accurate patient-specific biomechanical simulations. In this study, a specifically designed <b>aspiration</b> <b>device,</b> called LASTIC (Light <b>Aspiration</b> <b>device</b> for in vivo Soft TIssue Characterization), is used to characterize the elastic modulus of the face soft tissues at four different locations (cheek, cheekbone, forehead, and lower lip) on 16 subjects.

Significant intra-subject differences in tissue stiffnesses between the cheek and forehead and between the lower lip and forehead are highlighted by these estimations. They also show important inter-subject variabilities for some locations even when mean value stiffness show no statistical difference.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention (PCI), dislodgement of atherothrombotic {{material from}} coronary lesions {{can result in}} distal embolization, and may lead to increased {{major adverse cardiovascular events}} (MACE) and mortality. We sought to systematically review the comparative effectiveness of adjunctive devices to remove thrombi or protect against distal embolization in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing PCI of native vessels. Methods We conducted a systematic literature search of Medline, the Cochrane Database, and Web of Science (January 1996 -March 2011), [URL], abstracts from major cardiology meetings, TCTMD, and CardioSource Plus. Two investigators independently screened citations and extracted data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of adjunctive devices plus PCI to PCI alone, evaluated patients with STEMI, enrolled a population with 95 % of target lesion(s) in native vessels, and reported data on at least one pre-specified outcome. Quality was graded as good, fair or poor and the strength of evidence was rated as high, moderate, low or insufficient. Disagreement was resolved through consensus. Results 37 trials met inclusion criteria. At the maximal duration of follow-up, catheter <b>aspiration</b> <b>devices</b> plus PCI significantly decreased the risk of MACE by 27 % compared to PCI alone. Catheter <b>aspiration</b> <b>devices</b> also significantly increased the achievement of ST-segment resolution by 49 %, myocardial blush grade of 3 (MBG- 3) by 39 %, and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 flow by 8 %, while reducing the risk of distal embolization by 44 %, no reflow by 48 % and coronary dissection by 70 % versus standard PCI alone. In a majority of trials, the use of catheter <b>aspiration</b> <b>devices</b> increased procedural time upon qualitative assessment. Distal filter embolic protection devices significantly increased the risk of target revascularization by 39 % although the use of mechanical thrombectomy or embolic protection devices did not significantly impact other final health outcomes. Distal balloon or any embolic protection device increased the achievement of MBG- 3 by 61 % and 20 % and TIMI 3 flow by 11 % and 6 % but did not significantly impact other intermediate outcomes versus control. Upon qualitative analysis, all device categories, with exception of catheter <b>aspiration</b> <b>devices,</b> appear to significantly prolong procedure time compared to PCI alone while none appear to significantly impact ejection fraction. Many of the final health outcome and adverse event evaluations were underpowered and the safety of devices overall is unclear due to insufficient amounts of data. Conclusions In patients with STEMI, for most devices, few RCTs evaluated final health outcomes {{over a long period of}} follow-up.

40|$|BACKGROUND AIMS: Bone marrow (BM) transplantations are an {{accepted}} therapeutic strategy for hematologic conditions. In the past decades, interest for BM-derived cell therapy has extended toward {{the field of}} regenerative medicine. Irrespective of the treatment strategy, its success depends {{on the amount of}} cells available for transplantation. Both patient and procedural factors have been shown to influence the cell density of the BM aspirate. In the present study, the influence of core diameter of the BM <b>aspiration</b> <b>device</b> on cell density of the BM aspirate is studied. METHODS: BM harvesting procedures performed in a clinical trial investigating the effect of BM cell therapy in patients with severe peripheral artery disease were retrospectively studied (clinicaltrials. govNCT 00371371). Patients underwent BM harvesting through the use of either a 15 -gauge (n = 85) or an 8 -gauge (n = 75) needle. The numbers of harvested white blood cells (WBC) and CD 34 (+) hematopoietic cells (HPC) were quantified. RESULTS: The amount of WBC per milliliter of BM aspirate was significantly higher when the 8 -gauge needle (27. 8 × 10 (6) WBC/mL [95 %CI 25. 4 - 30. 5 × 10 (6) ]) was used compared with the smaller 15 -gauge core needle (20. 1 × 10 (6) WBC/mL [95 % confidence interval (CI), 18. 7 - 21. 7 × 10 (6) ], P < 0. 001). For the amount of CD 34 (+) HPC, a similar pattern was observed (185 × 10 (3) HPC/mL [95 % CI, 161 - 213 × 10 (3) ]; 114 × 10 (3) HPC/mL [95 % CI, 96 - 134 × 10 (3) ]; P < 0. 001).

Materials and Methods: Endometrial biopsies were collected using the GDP-Tao from fresh uteri hysterectomy specimens after completion of surgery. Results of the GDP-Tao were compared to final hysterectomy pathology. Specificity and sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Result: Based on a sample size calculation, 42 patients were included in this study. Endometrial tissue adequate for diagnosis was obtained in 93 % (39 / 42) biopsies. Classifying atypia as a positive result, the sensitivity of the new device was 96 % (23 / 24) with specificity of 87 % (13 / 15).

40|$|Management of {{a patient}} with acute {{coronary}} syndrome after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is challenging. Increasing age, associated co-morbidities, and progressive deterioration in left ventricular function make the scenario even worse. The escalation of ongoing medical treatment is usually the first step. Re-CABG is often not an option. Then, this becomes a compelling situation for an interventional cardiologist to perform an intervention to relieve the symptoms and sometimes repeated interventions. Conventionally, two types of interventions are described in this situation, either the intervention on native coronaries or intervention on graft vessels. Percutaneous revascularization is associated with higher rates of in-stent restenosis, target vessel revascularization, myocardial infarction, and death compared with native coronary arteries. Use of embolic protection devices is a Class I indication to decrease the risk of distal embolization. Nonetheless, these devices are underused.

Statements by the IARC, along with other USA agencies (CalEPA, RoC/NTP) on the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde for humans renders its substitution in Pathology Departments necessary since the annual use of formalin may exceed 3, 500 liters for a medium-large laboratory. To achieve a “formalin-free laboratory” we tested straightforward-to-make fixatives along with registered reagents offered as formalin substitutes. Methods More than two hundreds specimens were fixed in parallel with in-laboratory made fixatives PAGA (Polyethylenglycol, ethyl Alcohol, Glycerol, Acetic acid), two zinc-based fixatives (ZBF, Z 7), and commercially-available alternatives (RCL 2 and CellBlock). Tissue micro arrays were used for morphological and immunohistochemical comparison. Extraction of RNA was carried out to evaluate preservation of nucleic acids. Results Differences compared to formalin fixation were evident in alcohol-based fixatives, mainly restricted to higher stain affinity and considerable tissue shrinkage. Conversely, nuclear detail was superior with these alcohol-based formulas compared to formalin or glyoxale-based recipes. RNA extraction was superior for Z 7, PAGA and RCL 2 with regard to concentration but relatively comparable regarding quality. Conclusions Abolition of the human carcinogen formaldehyde from pathology laboratories is possible even in contexts whereby commercial alternatives to formalin are unavailable or are too expensive for routine use, and <b>aspiration</b> <b>devices</b> are lacking or not adequately serviced. The use of known formulations, possibly with simple and not-noxious (“alimentary grade”) constituents, comparable with registered proprietary products, may expand the search for the ideal fixative combining satisfactory morphology with improved preservation of nucleic acids and proteins as well as being easy and safe to dispose of. </p...|$|R
40|$|No-reflow {{has been}} defined as “inadequate {{myocardial}} perfusion through a given segment of coronary circulation without angiographic evidence of a mechanical obstruction”. Important components of the process are thought to include endothelial ischemic injury producing “blebs” of tissue that directly obstruct the microvasculature, leukocyte plugging of capillaries, and the vascular effects of reactive oxygen species. No-reflow can complicate any percutaneous intervention (PCI), though it is more common following acute myocardial infarctions (MI), particularly with prolonged occlusion times. A 59 -year-old woman presented to the hospital after two hours of continuous chest pain. Because of acute myocardial infarction of the inferior and lateral wall, she underwent direct stenting to an occlusion in the right coronary artery. Despite successful implantation of stents revascularization failed. In absence of <b>aspiration</b> <b>devices</b> and other pharmacological agent we decide to apply 30 mg (6000 IU) tenecteplase intracoronary. Three min after administration TIMI flow grade improved from TIMI 0 to TIMI 3. Managing no-reflow can be approached {{in a number of different}} ways and needs to be tailored to the type of intervention being performed. As confirmed in practice, prevention is better than cure and both mechanical and pharmacological approaches can be employed in high risk cases. In the setting of acute myocardial infarction the most effective preventative measure is the rapid opening of the vessel and as such the development of a robust and efficient primary PCI service is integral to the avoidance of this complication. Managing no-reflow will become increasingly important with the wider development of primary PCI. Within the setting of acute myocardial infarctions with no reflow as primary percutaneous intervention complication, there are potential important future pharmacological regimens that may become established and one of them can be tenecteplase...|$|R
