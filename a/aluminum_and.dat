5|$|Inexpensive {{hydropower}} {{supported the}} location of a large aluminum industry in the region, because its reduction from bauxite requires large amounts of electricity. Until 2000, the Northwestern United States produced up to 17percent of the world's <b>aluminum</b> <b>and</b> 40percent of the aluminum produced in the United States. The commoditization of power in the early 21st century, coupled with drought that reduced the generation capacity of the river, damaged the industry and by 2001, Columbia River aluminum producers had idled 80percent of its production capacity. By 2003, the entire United States produced only 15percent of the world's <b>aluminum,</b> <b>and</b> many smelters along the Columbia had gone dormant or out of business.|$|E

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, but even in the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as <b>aluminum</b> <b>and</b> magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding magnesium.|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as <b>aluminum</b> <b>and</b> magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the Hardanger Line used Class 64 {{electric}} multiple units. On 28 March 1940, NSB sent {{an invitation}} to tender for two multiple units which {{would be similar to}} Class 64.

5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of <b>aluminum</b> <b>and</b> magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental <b>aluminum</b> <b>and</b> chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E

5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding <b>aluminum</b> <b>and</b> magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of <b>aluminum,</b> <b>and</b> also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, major {{advances}} {{were made}} in welding technology, including the introduction of automatic welding in 1920, in which electrode wire was fed continuously. Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention, as scientists attempted to protect welds {{from the effects of}} oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Porosity and brittleness were the primary problems, and the solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres. During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals like <b>aluminum</b> <b>and</b> magnesium. This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II. In 1930, the first all-welded merchant vessel, M/S Carolinian, was launched.|$|E
