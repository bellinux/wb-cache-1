5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game <b>and</b> <b>choose</b> differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{was among}} 12 {{nominated}} at the 1944 Democratic National Convention {{to serve as}} Roosevelt's running mate {{in the presidential election}} that year, receiving six votes.

Instead, he took the recommendation of Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan <b>and</b> <b>choose</b> Harry S. Truman. Despite his differences with Roosevelt, Barkley faced no serious challengers in the 1944 Democratic primary and defeated his Republican challenger, Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney James Park, by a vote of 464,053 to 380,425.|$|E
5|$|Every so often, {{the player}} {{will come to}} a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer.

There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot <b>and</b> <b>choose</b> different decisions.|$|E

Fabric reached active distribution across 1 billion mobile devices just 8 months after its launch.|$|E
5|$|New Line {{believed}} Freddy vs. Jason {{needed a}} fresh start, <b>and</b> <b>choose</b> a new actor for Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing Hodder {{was the best}} choice for the role. Hodder did receive the script for Freddy vs. Jason, and had a meeting with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. According to Hodder, New Line failed to provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films. Yu and development executive Jeff Katz recognized the outcry among fans over the replacement of Hodder as Jason, but stood by their choice in recasting.|$|E
