5|$|If any motion exists without <b>a</b> <b>cause,</b> {{then not}} every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without <b>a</b> <b>cause.</b> And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E

5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, which became <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> of ongoing {{friction between the}} British and French, especially on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. Jean, and Cape Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E
5|$|Advanced COPD {{leads to}} high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart.

5|$|After {{becoming}} <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> célèbre {{from the}} late 1960s to the 1980s, the mythical Priory of Sion was exposed as a ludibrium created by Plantard {{as a framework for}} his claim of being the Great Monarch prophesied by Nostradamus. Evidence presented in support of its historical existence and activities before 1956 was discovered to have been forged and then planted in various locations around France by Plantard and his accomplices. Nevertheless, many conspiracy theorists still persist in believing that the Priory of Sion is an age-old cabal that conceals a subversive secret.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} end-of-life care, Brady died of restrictive {{pulmonary disease}} in Ashworth Hospital on 15 May 2017. On 21 September 2017, the inquest {{found that he}} {{died of natural causes}} and his hunger strike had not been a contributory factor. Brady had refused food and fluids for more than 48 hours on various occasions, causing him to be fitted with a nasogastric tube, although his inquest noted that his body mass index was not <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> for concern. Brady was cremated on 25 October 2017 and his ashes were disposed of at sea.|$|E
5|$|American {{broadcaster}} NBC Sports, {{who also}} owns the broadcast {{rights to the}} Olympics, has been criticised by athletes and IPC officials for airing too little coverage of the Paralympics; the lack of coverage from NBC in Athens was <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> for concern from senior IPC officials, especially given that the United States was bidding for the 2012 Games. In 2012 NBC only produced around 5 hours of tape delayed highlights from the Games, airing on the pay TV channel NBC Sports Network, and did not cover the ceremonies at all.|$|E

5|$|Another issue confronting both Patton and the {{legislature}} {{was how to}} spend federal funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky's share of the settlement totaled $3.5billion over 25years. Because tobacco was a major cash crop in Kentucky, Patton proposed {{that half of the}} settlement be used to diversify the state's farmers' crops. One-fourth of the money would support health care and anti-smoking efforts. The remaining one-fourth would address early-childhood care and education, <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> important to Patton's daughter, Nicki, an early-childhood educator.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidant dietary {{supplements}} do not improve health {{nor are they}} effective in preventing diseases as shown by randomized clinical trials including supplements of beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E singly or in different combinations having no effect on mortality rate or cancer risk.

Oxidative stress can be considered as either <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> or consequence of some diseases, an area of research stimulating drug development for antioxidant compounds for use as potential therapies.|$|E
5|$|British mycologist Donald Dring, in his 1980 {{monograph}} on {{the family}} Clathraceae, wrote that C.ruber was not regarded highly in southern European folklore. He mentions a case of poisoning following its ingestion, reported by Barla in 1858, and notes that Ciro Pollini reported finding it growing on a human skull in a tomb in a deserted church. According to John Ramsbottom, Gascons consider the mushroom <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> of cancer; they will usually bury specimens they find. In other parts of France it has been reputed to produce skin rashes or cause convulsions.|$|E

5|$|DPB has {{its highest}} {{prevalence}} among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals {{with the disease}} have been reported as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. The disease {{is more common in}} males, with the male to female ratio at 1.42:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be <b>a</b> <b>cause.</b> The presence of HLA-Bw54 increases the risk of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.|$|E

5|$|In 1949-1950, Tzara {{answered}} Aragon's {{call and}} become {{active in the}} international campaign to liberate Nazım Hikmet, a Turkish poet whose 1938 arrest for communist activities had created <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> célèbre for the pro-Soviet public opinion. Tzara chaired the Committee for the Liberation of Nazım Hikmet, which issued petitions to national governments and commissioned works in honor of Hikmet (including musical pieces by Louis Durey and Serge Nigg). Hikmet was eventually released in July 1950, and publicly thanked Tzara during his subsequent visit to Paris.|$|E

5|$|In March 2013, {{two studies}} were {{published}} showing that neonicotinoids affect bee long-term and short-term memory, suggesting <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> of action resulting in failure {{to return to}} the hive. In another study done in 2013, scientists reported that experiments suggested that exposure to the neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin and imidicloprid results in increased levels of a particular protein in bees that inhibits a key molecule involved in the immune response, making the insects more susceptible to attack by harmful viruses.|$|E
50|$|From Newton, {{force can}} be defined as an {{exertion}} or pressure which can <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> object to accelerate. The concept of force is used to describe <b>an</b> influence which <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> free body (object) to accelerate. It can be a push or <b>a</b> pull, which <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object to change direction, have new velocity, or to deform temporarily or permanently. Generally speaking, force <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object's state of motion to change.|$|R
