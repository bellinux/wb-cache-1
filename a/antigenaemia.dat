40|$|BACKGROUND [...] New rapid {{diagnostic}} techniques {{offer the}} opportunity of early diagnosis of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in immunocompromised patients at risk of developing CMV disease. The use of human CMV <b>antigenaemia</b> {{as a predictor of}} clinical CMV infection and disease in lung and heart transplant recipients was studied prospectively. METHODS [...] Twenty three heart and nine lung transplant recipients who survived 40 days were observed by standard CMV surveillance with serological testing, culture, and by sequential testing for CMV <b>antigenaemia.</b> CMV <b>antigenaemia</b> testing is a rapid and quantifiable technique in which a viral lower matrix protein is detected in cytospin preparations of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNLs) by immunofluorescent staining. RESULTS [...] Eleven patients developed CMV infection and five developed CMV disease (four pneumonitis, one duodenitis). These clinical events occurred at a median of 65 days following transplantation. CMV <b>antigenaemia</b> occurred in 17 patients at a median of 35 days following transplantation. Detection of CMV <b>antigenaemia</b> had a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 93. 7 %, and a positive predictive value of 94. 1 % for CMV related illness. CMV <b>antigenaemia</b> was positive at a significant interval before the clinical event. High levels of CMV <b>antigenaemia</b> (> 50 CMV antigen positive cells/ 2 x 10 (5) PMNLs) occurred in 11 patients and five of these developed disease. CMV <b>antigenaemia</b> of > 50 CMV antigen positive cells/ 2 x 10 (5) PMNLs had a positive predictive value of 45. 5 % for disease but a negative predictive value of 100 %. Patients with disease had higher levels of <b>antigenaemia</b> than those without disease. CONCLUSIONS [...] CMV <b>antigenaemia</b> is a rapid diagnostic technique which can identify patients likely to develop CMV disease, potentially allowing early treatment...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 276 {{sequential}} serum samples from 34 men with antibodies {{to the human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) followed up for two to seven years were analysed for HIV antigen and antibodies to the viral core and envelope proteins. Results were correlated with clinical outcome and CD 4 T lymphocyte count. Both <b>antigenaemia</b> and the disappearance of antibodies to the core protein were associated with development of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS related complex and depletion of CD 4 cells. Thus AIDS or AIDS related complex developed in eight out of 16 patients with <b>antigenaemia</b> compared with one out of 18 patients without <b>antigenaemia.</b> Low counts of CD 4 cells (less than 0. 5 X 10 (9) /l) were found in 14 of the 16 patients with <b>antigenaemia</b> and five of the 18 without <b>antigenaemia.</b> Nine patients seroconverted to HIV during the study; two of these developed <b>antigenaemia</b> 14 and 16 months after the estimated time of seroconversion. These {{results show that the}} late stages of HIV infection are characterised by increased production of antigen and a decrease in antibodies directed against the core protein. <b>Antigenaemia</b> indicates a poor prognosis; and as the antigen test is simple to do and interpret, it may therefore be useful for selecting patients for antiviral treatment...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: pp 65 <b>antigenaemia</b> and {{real-time}} PCR are {{two methods}} {{that are used}} to diagnose CMV infection in its early stages and, thereby, to facilitate initiation of pre-emptive therapy. OBJECTIVES: Firstly, to compare PCR with <b>antigenaemia</b> and clinical outcome in order to define a clinical threshold for starting pre-emptive therapy. Secondly, to study the impact of the transplant recipient's serological status on the viral load and on the cut-offs. STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-two patients were analysed using <b>antigenaemia</b> (APAAP method) and real-time PCR. ROC curves were established with <b>antigenaemia</b> or clinical outcome as reference. Patients were divided into primo-infection or reactivation {{on the basis of the}} serological status. RESULTS: PCR correlated better with the clinical data (AUC closer to 1 and best sensitivity, PPV and NPV) than <b>antigenaemia.</b> Furthermore, the performance of qPCR was even better in the reactivation patients. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that transplant recipients should be divided according to their serological status. Indeed, replacing <b>antigenaemia</b> by real-time PCR for decisions regarding initiation of pre-emptive therapy is of particular appeal in patients with positive serology. As a result of this work, we have set our clinical threshold at 1500 copies/ml for reactivation...|$|E

40|$|An antigen-capture ELISA (Ag-ELISA) was {{developed}} to detect bluetongue virus (BTV) antigen directly from blood samples. Four blood preparations [whole blood, buffy coat, washed red blood cells (RBC) and plasma] taken pre-inoculation and on days 6 to 9 post-inoculation (PI) {{were used in the}} ELISA to study <b>antigenaemia</b> in forty sheep, each experimentally infected with one of 20 South African BTV serotypes. Seventeen of the 20 serotypes were detected and 27 of the 40 sheep were at some stage Ag-ELISA positive. Over the period of sampling, Ag-ELISA positive results were most frequently returned from whole blood taken on days 6 and 7 PI. However in some instances the quantity and/or duration of BTV <b>antigenaemia</b> was greater in buffy coat and washed RBC preparations. In a selection of samples examined, positive Ag-ELISA results were generally obtained when samples had an infectious virus titre in eggs of > 10 (3. 2) egg lethal doses (ELD 50 /ml). The appearance and duration of detectable <b>antigenaemia</b> was compared with the development of clinical signs and antibody responses of infected sheep. On days 6 and 7 PI the presence of fever (> 40 degrees C) was indicative to the likelihood of detectable <b>antigenaemia.</b> After day 5 PI <b>antigenaemia</b> declined and clinical signs of swollen face and inflamed feet appeared together with the first detectable antibody response.

40|$|Objectives: Although Aspergillus {{galactomannan}} (GM) antigen detection {{is widely}} {{applied in the}} diag-nosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA), false-positive reactions with fungus-derived antibiotics, other fungal genera or the passage of dietary GM through injured mucosa are a matter of concern. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the cumulative incidence and risk factors for false-positive GM antige-naemia. Patients and methods: The records of 157 adult allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients were retrospectively analysed. Episodes of positive GM <b>antigenaemia,</b> defined as two consecutive GM results with an optical density index above 0. 6, were classified into true, false and inconclusive GM <b>antigenaemia</b> by reviewing the clinical course. Results: Twenty-five patients developed proven or probable IA with a 1 year cumulative incidence of 12. 9 %, whereas 50 experienced positive GM <b>antigenaemia</b> with an incidence of 32. 2 %. Among the total 58 positive episodes of the 50 patients, 29 were considered false-positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) was lower during the first 100 days than beyond 100 days after HSCT (37. 5 % versus 58. 8 %). Gastrointestinal chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was identified as the only independent sig-nificant factor for the increased incidence of false-positive GM <b>antigenaemia</b> (PPV 0 % versus 66. 7 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was {{studied in the}} sera of 311 patients with various forms of primary glomerulonephritis and 43 patients with lupus nephritis. HBs anti-genaemia was detected in 69 of the 311 patients (22 per cent) with primary glomerulonephritis and this prevalence of HBsAg carrier {{was significantly higher than}} that in the general population (p< 0. 001). These patients had no clinical or biochemical findings to suggest acute or chronic liver disease. A higher HBs <b>antigenaemia</b> carrier rate was not observed in patients with lupus nephritis. Three glomerulopathological entities, membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, were found to be associated with a higher prevalence of HBs <b>antigenaemia</b> compared with the general population (p< 0. 001). Glomerular deposits of HBsAg and/or hepatitis core antigen (HBcAg) were detected in 41, 61, and 60 per cent of renal biopsy specimens from patients with membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis associated with persistent HBs <b>antigenaemia</b> respec-tively. During the mean study period of 40 months (range 12 - 180), 14 per cent of these patients with hepatitis-associated glomerulonephritis developed progressive renal failure, although none required maintenance dialysis.

40|$|Pulmonary {{infection}} with cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{is a well}} recognised complication of AIDS. It is often possible to detect CMV-infected cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens with monoclonal antibodies, but the clinical significance of their presence remains unclear. To investigate this, 24 AIDS patients were tested for CMV <b>antigenaemia</b> and viraemia, in addition to CMV detection in BAL. CMV was detected in the BAL of nine patients (38 %), five with clinical and laboratory evidence of pulmonary infection and four without pulmonary involvement. Blood samples positive for CMV antigen were observed in two patients with CMV-positive BAL specimens and, in both cases, <b>antigenaemia</b> resolved without therapy. No case of viraemia was detected. Pneumocystis carinii was detected concomitantly with CMV in the BAL of four of the patients with pulmonary involvement and in one without signs of pulmonary infection.

40|$|Using a {{modified}} immunoblot procedure {{we looked for}} early serological markers of disease progression in sequential serum samples from 30 initially symptomless HIV-infected homosexual men. Sixteen men who did not progress beyond persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and did not develop HIV <b>antigenaemia</b> showed persistent strong immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity to all initially recognized HIV proteins. Three out of four men who did not progress beyond PGL but did develop HIV <b>antigenaemia</b> showed declining or absent IgG reactivity to the outer HIV core protein p 17, whereas reactivity to other initially recognized HIV proteins persisted in all four; {{in one of these}} subjects a striking decline in anti-p 17 reactivity occurred 1 1 / 2 months after HIV antibody seroconversion and 7 1 / 2 months before HIV <b>antigenaemia</b> developed. In nine out of 10 men who developed constitutional disease [Centers for Disease Control (CDC) group IV A] or AIDS (CDC groups IV C 1 and IV D), a decline in anti-p 17 reactivity was seen preceding or at disease development; in two of these men a concomitant decline in anti-p 24 reactivity was seen. In the only individual without HIV <b>antigenaemia</b> who developed CDC group IV disease, anti-p 17 reactivity declined 10 months before disease development, whereas no similar decline in anti-p 24 reactivity was seen. Decline in IgG antibody reactivity to HIV core protein p 17 appears to be an earlier marker of disease progression than the previously reported decline in anti-p 24 reactivity, and may be of value in selecting individuals for secondary prevention of HIV-related disease developmen...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} indicators of response to zidovudine monotherapy in terms of progression to AIDS and death in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconverters. From a larger observational epidemiological cohort of 1, 024 HIV seroconverters we identified 315 persons on zidovudine monotherapy. In this treated cohort, age, sex, risk group, constitutional symptoms, CD 4 cell count, and p 24 antigen levels at initiation of treatment and 6 months later were examined separately for two outcomes, AIDS and death, using standard survival methods. The variables measured at the visit at which zidovudine monotherapy was initiated that predicted more rapid progression to AIDS were CD 4 cell count (RH = 2. 61); constitutional symptoms (RH = 2. 56); p 24 <b>antigenaemia</b> level (RH = 2. 17); and subsequent change in CD 4 cell count (> 30 % decline) contributed additional predictive information (RH = 2. 70). Results were similar for mortality, and did not vary significantly by risk group. In a tested subset of patients, p 24 <b>antigenaemia</b> was associated with high levels of plasma RNA viral load. The median number of HIV RNA copies was about 28, 000 copies/ml among p 24 antigen-positive individuals and about 7, 700 copies/ml among participants who were persistently negative for p 24 <b>antigenaemia.</b> CD 4 cell count, symptoms and p 24 <b>antigenaemia</b> at the start of therapy and CD 4 cell decline after initiation of treatment are early indicators of disease progression in zidovudine-treated patients.

40|$|The IgG {{response}} to HIV- 1 p 17 gag protein was studied {{for up to}} 6 years in 12 HIV- 1 -infected patients with haemophilia, who had seroconverted between 1982 and 1985. To assess any prognostic value, p 17 IgG titres were compared with p 24 IgG titres, CD 4 cell counts and p 24 <b>antigenaemia.</b> p 17 IgG avidity index was also examined. A strong similarity {{was found between the}} IgG titre to HIV- 1 p 17 and that to p 24. In patients who developed AIDS the decline in p 17 IgG titres could precede by several years the drop in CD 4 cells to under 200 cells/microliters; whereas some long-term asymptomatic patients (CDCII) had increasing p 17 IgG titres and stable CD 4 cell counts. Declining p 17 and p 24 IgG titres were not always associated with an increase in p 24 <b>antigenaemia.</b> IgG titres were found to be better predictors of disease progression than CD 4 cell counts or p 24 <b>antigenaemia.</b> Patients who developed AIDS during the study were also characterized by a lower p 17 IgG avidity than patients who remained asymptomatic.

40|$|Abstract Background Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is a {{pathogen}} causing fatal {{illness in}} cats worldwide, {{and as such}} {{there is a high}} demand for products to protect against disease. The duration of immunity provided by an inactivated FeLV vaccine, Versifel FeLV, when administered to cats of the target age was determined. Kittens received two vaccinations when aged 7 to 9 weeks old, and were subsequently challenged up to 36 months later with the FeLV-A Glasgow isolate. Results In all studies, all of the younger aged control kittens showed persistent FeLV p 27 <b>antigenaemia</b> confirming that the challenge virus was severe and efficacious. In contrast, the control cats did not show the required level of persistent <b>antigenaemia,</b> with a maximum of 45 % cats affected in the middle duration study and only 10 % in the longer study. However, apart from one animal in the short duration study, all of the cats vaccinated with Versifel FeLV were negative for persistent <b>antigenaemia</b> and can be considered treatment successes. Conclusion In conclusion, we have shown that although age-related resistance to infection with a virulent FeLV challenge is evident from as early as 10 months of age, vaccination with Versifel FeLV may aid in the protection of cats from FeLV related disease up to three years after primary vaccination as kittens. </p...|$|E
40|$|Sequential serum {{samples from}} 13 {{homosexual}} men who seroconverted for antibodies to {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) were tested for HIV antigen. In one of these men, who developed the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), HIV <b>antigenaemia</b> preceded the onset of AIDS {{by more than a}} year and persisted throughout the course of the disease. This <b>antigenaemia</b> was accompanied by the disappearance of IgG antibody reactivity to the major HIV core protein p 24. In none of the 12 others, who all remained without serious disease, were serum concentrations of HIV antigen detected, except on one occasion in one man.

40|$|A {{problem with}} rapid Plasmodium falciparum-specific antigen histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP 2) {{detection}} tests for malaria is {{the persistence of}} antigen in blood after the disappearance of asexual-stage parasitaemia and clinical symptoms, resulting in false-positive (FP) test results following treatment. The ICT P. f/P. v immunochromatographic test detects both HRP 2 and a panmalarial antigen (PMA) found in both P. falciparum and P. vivax. To examine posttreatment antigen persistence with this test and whether persistent sexual-stage forms (gametocytes) are a cause of FP tests after treatment, we compared serial antigen test results with microscopy results from patients symptomatic with P. falciparum malaria in Indonesia for 28 days following treatment with chloroquine (CQ; n = 66), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP; n = 36), and artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (ART + SP; n = 15) [date not given]. Persistent FP <b>antigenaemia</b> following SP treatment occurred in 29 % (HRP 2) and 42 % (PMA) of the patients on day 7 and in 10 % (HRP 2) and 23 % (PMA) on day 14. The high rates of persistent HRP 2 and PMA <b>antigenaemia</b> following CQ and SP treatment were strongly associated {{with the presence of}} gametocytaemia, with the proportion with gametocytes on day 7 posttreatment being significantly greater in those with FP results than in those with true-negative PMA and HRP 2 results. Gametocyte frequency on day 14 post-SP treatment was also greater in those with FP PMA results. Following SP treatment, PMA persisted longer than HRP 2, giving an FP diagnosis of P. vivax in up to 16 % of patients on day 14, with all FP P. vivax diagnoses having gametocytaemia. In contrast, PMA was rapidly cleared following ART + SP treatment in association with rapid clearance of gametocytaemia.

40|$|The use of {{sensitive}} and specific methods for rapid and reliable diagnosis is required {{due to the}} considerable impact of human cytomegalo-virus (HCMV) in organ transplant recipients. For this purpose the demonstration {{of the presence of}} viral antigens in peripheral blood leukocytes (PMNLs) and of viral nucleic acids in the same cells or in sera would seem to be of valid support. The present study was designed to test pp 65 antigen, HCMV DNA and HCMV late mRNA in order to provide clinical information for the management of the infection. Fifty solid organ recipients were monitored for six months after transplant. The data obtained from the various tests were analysed from the first evidence of HCMV infection revealed by positive <b>antigenaemia</b> and/or DNA-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In 3 asymptomatic and in 7 symptomatic patients, PCR became positive 1 - 2 weeks before <b>antigenaemia</b> but PCR did not discriminate the clinical evolution of HCMV infection. The <b>antigenaemia</b> test well correlated to the development of viral infection being positive in all symptomatics and in 31, 2 % of asymptomatics. The antigenic load > 100 / 2 x 10 (5) positive cells was always associated with clinical signs of illness. The detection of late mRNA was more indicative of the virus replicative status in the follow-up of patients treated with ganciclovir. In some cases there was evidence, prior to the other two tests, the block of viral replication due to the antiviral therapy and in others the onset of HCMV infection relapse.

40|$|Lymphatic {{filariasis}} is endemic in {{the coastal}} areas of Kenya, with four major foci identified in the early 1970 s. The prevalence and intensity of Wuchereria bancrofti infection, together with antifilarial antibody responses, were assessed in a historically highly endemic focus along the River Sabaki, in Malindi district. The prevalences of microfilaraemia and <b>antigenaemia</b> (detected by Og 4 C 3 ELISA) were > 20...|$|E

40|$|Objectives The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} analysis {{was to determine the}} seroprevalence of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) <b>antigenaemia</b> among owned cats in Vienna and the surrounding area. Methods Samples were tested between 1996 and 2011 by the Department of Clinical Virology at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. All samples were sent to the university as part of routine diagnostic procedures, either to determine infection in clinically symptomatic individuals or to rule out infection prior to vaccination. To allow for statistical comparison, samples analysed between 2008 and 2011 were pooled into one population (n = 444) and evaluated against samples tested in 1996 (n = 840). Furthermore, analyses of subgroups were undertaken to determine the effect of sex and age on the prevalence of FeLV <b>antigenaemia.</b> Results With respect to the samples tested at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, it was determined that the level of FeLV <b>antigenaemia</b> in eastern Austria between 1996 and 2011 was 5. 6 %. The proportion of FeLV antigenaemic cats was highly variable and has not fallen significantly over this period, despite advances in vaccination, and the education of pet owners and animal welfare charities. Conclusions and relevance This study confirms the importance of continued and regular vaccination against FeLV among Austrian cats, particularly those allowed access to the outdoors. Within the remit of this retrospective study, {{it was not possible to}} follow-up results of repeat testing or of other assays (PCR) of individual cats. As a result of this, no conclusions can be drawn as to the possibility of transient antigenaemic cats or false-positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{survey and}} {{elucidate}} the clinical characteristics of CMV infection in rheumatic disease patients. Methods. A detailed questionnaire survey on CMV infection {{was carried out}} against rheumatic disease patients hospitalized in member hospitals, and the obtained clinical and/or laboratory data were analysed. Results. Out of 7377 patients, 151 were diagnosed as having CMV infection. The underlying diseases ranged broadly, but SLE, microscopic polyangiitis, and dermatomyositis were the most common. Four were diagnosed histopathologically, and the others via positive CMV <b>antigenaemia.</b> In addition to oral corticosteroid for all but one patient, 81 were treated with pulsed methylprednisolone (MPSL), 64 with cyclophosphamide (CYC) and 36 with other immunosuppressants. Forty-four had a fatal outcome, for which presence of clinical symptoms, other infectious complications, lymphopenia, an older age (> 59. 3 yrs) {{and the use of}} pulsed MPSL were significant risk factors (P< 0. 05) by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis retained the first three (P< 0. 05). The CMV <b>antigenaemia</b> count was significantly higher for the symptomatic than asymptomatic [10. 1 (0. 0 â€“ 2998. 0) vs 4. 0 (1. 3 â€“ 1144. 4) / 105 PMNs, respectively, P< 0. 05; threshold count: 5. 6 / 105 PMNs]. No treatment benefit by anti-viral agent was observed as for survival. Conclusion. CMV infection was mostly diagnosed by <b>antigenaemia,</b> and occurred among patients under strong immunosuppressive therapy using pulsed MPSL and/or immunosuppressants. Lymphopenia, presence of symptoms and other infections are significant risk factors for a poor outcome and pulsed MPSL and an older age may predict it. Patients were prone to be symptomatic with anti-genaemia count over 5. 6 / 105 PMNs...|$|E
