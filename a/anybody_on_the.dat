5|$|After {{his time}} on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hines {{returned}} to practicing law in Frankfort, Kentucky. In 1886, Hines began writing a series of four articles discussing the Northwest Conspiracy for Basil W. Duke's Southern Bivouac magazine. The magazine was dedicated {{to the memory of}} the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, but was less adversarial than similar Southern magazines, gaining a larger Northern readership than similar journals. The first of the articles was printed in the December 1886 issue. However, after consulting with former Confederate president Jefferson Davis at Davis' home in Mississippi, Hines did not name <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Northern side who assisted in the conspiracy. After writing the first article, Hines was attacked for not being more forthcoming regarding all the participants from both newspapers' reviewers (particularly from the Louisville Times) and Southern readers, which discouraged Hines from publishing any more accounts of the Northwest Conspiracy.|$|E
500|$|After {{giving his}} team the news, McKechnie had the Reds {{dedicate}} themselves to winning the World Series [...] "for Hershie". His number was retired {{for the season}} by the team as a tribute. McKechnie never publicly revealed what Willard Hershberger said to him during their meeting the day before: [...] "It {{had nothing to do}} with <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team", he told reporters. [...] "He told it to me in confidence, and I will not utter it to anyone". The Cincinnati Reds would go on to defeat the American League champion Detroit Tigers in seven games to win the 1940 World Series. Reds players decided to share a portion of their championship money, totaling $5,803, with Hershberger's mother, Maude. Hershberger was buried at Visalia Public Cemetery in Visalia, California.|$|E
500|$|On the November 1 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Ziggler's first {{successful}} title defense was against Curt Hawkins, who he defeated with a Superkick in seven seconds, {{he also made}} a Survivor Series challenge to <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Raw roster. On the following episode of Raw, Sami Zayn defeated Rusev to challenge for the title; however, Ziggler defended his championship against Miz on the 900th episode of SmackDown, and was defeated after a distraction by Maryse, ending his reign at 37 days. On the November 22nd edition of SmackDown, {{it was announced that}} Ziggler would face Miz in a Ladder match at the [...] event for the Intercontinental Championship in what was advertised as their final match, where Ziggler was defeated. On the December 13 edition of SmackDown, Ziggler pinned Dean Ambrose in a fatal four-way elimination match also involving The Miz and Luke Harper, to become the number one contender to AJ Styles' WWE Championship. The following week, Baron Corbin confronted Ziggler, and the two had a match with Ziggler's number one contender's spot on the line. The match ended in a double count-out and Daniel Bryan made the December 27 episode's WWE Championship match a triple-threat between Styles, Ziggler, and Corbin. In that match, Styles retained the WWE Championship after pinning Ziggler.|$|E

500|$|Upon taking power Castillo Armas, {{worried that}} he lacked popular support, {{attempted}} to eliminate all opposition. He quickly arrested many thousands of opposition leaders, branding them communists. Detention camps were built to hold the prisoners when the jails exceeded their capacity. Historians have estimated that more than 3,000 people were arrested following the coup, and that approximately 1,000 agricultural workers were killed by Castillo Armas's troops {{in the province of}} Tiquisate. Acting on the advice of Dulles, Castillo Armas also detained a number of citizens trying to flee the country. He also created a National Committee of Defense Against Communism (CDNCC), with sweeping powers of arrest, detention, and deportation. Over the next few years, the committee investigated nearly 70,000 people. Many were imprisoned, executed, or [...] "disappeared", frequently without trial. In August, the government passed Decree59, which permitted the security forces to detain <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> blacklist of the CDNCC for six months without trial. The eventual list of suspected communists compiled by the CDNCC included one in every ten adults in the country. Attempts were also made to eliminate from government positions people who had gained them under Árbenz. All political parties, labor unions, and peasant organizations were outlawed. In histories of the period, Castillo Armas has been referred to as a dictator.|$|E
500|$|A {{report about}} the concert at issue {{released}} on May 26, 2010 by topzine.cz stated that [...] "one {{of the things that}} was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe, who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage." [...] The article also contains pictures, one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground. Meanwhile, another report released two days after the concert by metalopolis.net alleged that [...] "Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an impertinent fan, who has climbed the podium several times. The front-man clearly showed that it is his territory, he struck the intruder down, punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium, without even stopping singing (!)" [...] On May 28, 2010, the report by marastmusic.com stated that [...] "some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage", [...] while abysszine.com stated that [...] "the only negative thing about the concert was, to say it mildly, disputable approach of the band towards the stage-divers ... when somebody tried to climb the stage, he was brutally swept down." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{soon as the}} {{deadline}} for Mayweather's response expired, Arum held a conference call. Arum revealed to the media that the negotiations he had been referring to consisted {{of a series of}} conversations with HBO Sports President Ross Greenburg. He also revealed that there was no actual direct communication with any representative from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions. [...] "I had a couple of conversations with Ross [...] and I laid out all the terms that would be acceptable to our side and I also informed him about the concession that Manny had made regarding drug testing. He got back to me {{in a couple of weeks}} and told me that he had had discussions with Al Haymon, representing Floyd Mayweather, and that everything looked good and we were nearing a resolution," [...] Arum explained.

5000|$|In 2004, Nichols {{was cast}} as J.D., an {{intelligent}} rich kid and romantic rival to Jake Gyllenhaal's main {{character in the}} environmental blockbuster, The Day After Tomorrow. The film received negative reviews but was a box office success. Also in 2004, he appeared in Wimbledon, opposite Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany. The film was well received by critics, {{though it was only}} a mild success at the U.S. box office. Nichols' acting as Jake Hammond, an arrogant tennis pro, was described as [...] "effectively unlikeable". For the role, Nichols had to learn tennis from scratch; he was trained to look professional by Pat Cash, who was taken aback by Nichols' skill. Cash observed, [...] "It's absolutely as good as <b>anybody's</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> circuit. I swear to God. He hits it like a bullet. He's our star pupil." [...] By the end of their training, Nichols and Bettany were able to have rallies and play points, although some of their more intricate exchanges were computer generated.|$|R
