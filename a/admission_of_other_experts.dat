40|$|The article {{investigates the}} problem of the {{attitude}} of the Russian authorities to the “Greek” migration. The author tracks the general and specific features of the Orthodox christians’ migration from the Ottoman Empire and from its vassal states. It was revealed that the “Greeks”, like other foreigners, were willingly turned to the Russian citizenship. However, in peacetime the need for foreigners sharply decreased. The <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> military and <b>other</b> <b>experts</b> to Russia who provoked doubts concerning their allegiance was banned. These prohibitions referred mainly to the immigrants from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, not the “Greeks”. The authorities had always been ready to engage the “Greeks” in the service. The precedent effort of the migration of Greek jeweler Alexander Dmitriev changed the situation for a short period. All the “Creeks” were allowed to cross the border without coordination with Moscow departments (Diplomatic or Internal Affair). But then the master asked a too large sum for his services. The authorities were extremely disappointed and refused to employ him in the Royal workshops. This was the only example {{during the first half of}} the 17 th century when a “Greek” was rejected from the Russian citizenship. However, the incident of Alexandr Dmitriev had not changed the authorities’ politics, he became the reason for moving back to the old rules of coordination before allowing the “Greeks” to cross the Russian border. Besides, it was forbidden to hire foreigners, including the “Greeks”, who had violated the oath and fled from Russia. After that they had no chance to return...|$|R

40|$|The smorgasbord ploy {{probably}} plays {{only a minor}} role in the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> crimes evidence. But {{it offers}} us a nice window into the uses and abuses of Rule 404 (b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (“the Rules”) and its state clones. Rule 404 (b) ’s drafters may have supposed that trial judges would look among the illustrative uses in Rule 404 (b) and select {{the one or two}} that seem most apropos to the case before them. However, the practitioners of smorgasbordism do not make any choices but instead list all (or most) of the illustrative uses to support the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> the <b>other</b> crimes. We can surmise the judge calculates that this will avoid appellate reversal by giving appellate judges more grounds for affirming a decision to admit other crimes evidence. Moreover, it saves work; the judge need not put in as much effort to use the ploy as she would have to in deciding which of the adversaries has analyzed admissibility correctly...|$|R
