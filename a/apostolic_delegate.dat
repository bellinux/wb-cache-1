5|$|In 1958 Pope Pius XII {{died and}} was succeeded by Pope John XXIII, who, in 1959, after giving Lefebvre {{the choice between}} {{remaining}} either as <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate</b> or as Archbishop of Dakar, appointed another to the post of <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate</b> for French Africa. Lefebvre continued as Archbishop of Dakar until 23 January 1962, when he {{was transferred to the}} diocese of Tulle in France, retaining his personal title of archbishop. Shortly after his appointment as Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers (see below), he resigned from the diocese of Tulle on 7 August, 1962.|$|E
5|$|Ordained a diocesan {{priest in}} 1929, {{he joined the}} Holy Ghost Fathers for missionary work and was {{assigned}} to teach at a seminary in Gabon in 1932. In 1947, he was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Dakar, Senegal, {{and the next year}} as the <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate</b> for West Africa.|$|E
5|$|As <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate,</b> Lefebvre's chief {{duty was}} the {{building}} {{up of the}} ecclesiastical structure in French Africa. Pope Pius XII wanted to move quickly towards a proper hierarchy (with bishops instead of vicariates and apostolic prefectures). Lefebvre was responsible for selecting these new bishops, {{increasing the number of}} priests and religious sisters, as well as the number of churches in the various dioceses.|$|E

25|$|Pius {{protested the}} deportations of Slovakian Jews to the Bratislava {{government}} from 1942. Giuseppe Burzio, the <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate</b> to Bratislava, protested the anti-Semitic and totalitarianism of the Tiso regime.|$|E
25|$|Important titles or {{functions}} usually, but not necessarily, held by (arch)bishops {{who are not}} {{in charge}} of a diocese or an equivalent community include those of <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate,</b> Apostolic Nuncio, Papal Legate, Patriarchal Vicar, Pontifical Delegate.|$|E
25|$|The {{fathers of}} the Seventh Provincial Council of Baltimore {{requested}} the Holy See to sanction the holding of a plenary council. The petition was granted and the pope appointed Archbishop Francis Kenrick of Baltimore as <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate</b> to convene and preside over the council.|$|E
5000|$|Nuncios, <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegates</b> {{and other}} dignitaries of the Curia, {{unless they were}} already diocesan bishops, and under the 1920 custom they were, in that case, {{translated}} to titular archbishoprics.|$|R
50|$|Apostolic {{visitors}} are church officials whom canonists commonly class with papal legates. Visitors differ from other <b>Apostolic</b> <b>delegates,</b> principally in this, that their mission is only transient and of comparatively short duration.|$|R
50|$|So far, all Nuncios of Israel {{were also}} {{simultaneously}} appointed Nuncios to Cyprus and <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegates</b> to Jerusalem and Palestine (now {{responsible for the}} relationship with the local church in the Palestinian territories).|$|R
25|$|At {{the death}} of Archbishop Spalding of Baltimore he was promoted, on July 30, 1872, to succeed that prelate. He left Newark with much reluctance. In 1875 as <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate</b> he imposed the cardinal's biretta on Archbishop John McCloskey of New York. In May, 1876, he consecrated the Baltimore cathedral, having freed it from debt.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Apostolic</b> <b>delegate</b> to Turkey, Angelo Roncalli, saved {{a number}} of Croatian Jews - as well as Bulgarian and Hungarian Jews - by {{assisting}} their migration to Palestine. Roncalli succeeded Pius XII as Pope John XXIII, and always {{said that he had}} been acting on the orders of Pius XII in his actions to rescue Jews.|$|E
25|$|The Third Plenary Council was {{presided over}} by the <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate,</b> Archbishop James Gibbons of Baltimore. Its decrees were signed by {{fourteen}} archbishops, sixty-one bishops or their representatives, six abbots, and one general of a religious congregation. The first solemn session was held 9 November, and the last 7 December 1884. Its decrees are divided into twelve titles, approved by Pope Leo XIII.|$|E
50|$|All Latin Rite metropolitans are archbishops; however, some archbishops are not metropolitans, {{as there}} are a few {{instances}} where an archdiocese has no suffragans or is itself suffragan to another archdiocese. Titular archbishops (i.e. ordained bishops who are given an honorary title to a now-defunct archdiocese; e.g. many Vatican officials and papal nuncios and <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegates</b> are titular archbishops) are never metropolitans.|$|R
50|$|<b>Apostolic</b> <b>delegates</b> {{are also}} sent to regions {{such as the}} West Indies and the islands of the Pacific. These delegates are also {{appointed}} nuncio to {{at least some of}} the many states covered by their delegation, but the area entrusted to them also contains one or more territories that either are not independent states or are states that do not have diplomatic relations with the Holy See.|$|R
50|$|Thus, Pius XIi {{maintained}} {{only eight}} wartime nunciatures to European nations, in: France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and Switzerland. These were supplemented by <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegates</b> in Albania, Bulgaria, Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States. A chargé d'affaires was created {{during the war}} to represent the newly created Slovak Republic, and an apostolic visitor {{was sent to the}} Nazi puppet state of Croatia.|$|R
25|$|Ratti, {{after his}} {{election}} as pope in 1922 appointed Orsenigo {{to the rank}} of titular archbishop of Ptolemais and made him a nuncio to the Netherlands, effective June 23, 1922. Orsengio, aged 49 at his appointment, had no formal diplomatic training, but rather had been a friend of Ratti in Milan. Ratti overruled Orsenigo's objections that he lacked experience, noting that he himself had spent decades as a librarian before being appointed <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegate</b> to Poland.|$|E
25|$|The Holy See {{additionally}} maintains some apostolic {{delegates to}} local Catholic Church communities {{which are not}} accredited to {{the governments of the}} respective states and work only in an unofficial, non-diplomatic capacity. The regions and states where such non-diplomatic delegates operate are: Brunei, Comoros, Laos, Somalia, Vietnam, Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories (Palestine), Pacific Ocean (Tuvalu, dependent territories), Arabian Peninsula (Oman, foreigners in Saudi Arabia), Antilles (dependent territories), <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegate</b> to Kosovo (Republic of Kosovo) and the apostolic prefecture of Western Sahara (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic).|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of the Scandinavian Episcopal Conference followed only two months after that of the Apostolic Delegation. Convoked by the <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate,</b> the entire hierarchy of the five countries met in Bergen (South Norway) on May 1, 1960, with the prime purpose of founding a proper bishops' conference. Some participants were still {{the same as in}} 1951 (Bishops Cobben, Mangers, Suhr, and Wember). Newcomers were Bishops Ansgar Nelson, O.S.B., of Stockholm (b. 1906), Johannes Gunnarson, S.M.M., of Iceland (1897-1972), and Johannes Rüth, SS.CC., of Central Norway (1899 - 1978).|$|E
50|$|These prelates may not, however, without special {{permission}} of the Holy See, convoke a synod or institute synodal examiners. Neither may they confer parochial benefices. They {{are not allowed to}} grant indulgences, or absolve from the reserved cases and secret irregularities whose absolution is restricted to the pope ordinarily, but allowed to bishops by the Council of Trent, nor promote secular clerics to orders, nor grant dimissory letters for ordination, nor exercise jurisdiction over regulars as <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegates.</b>|$|R
50|$|An Apostolic Nuncio at Cologne was {{appointed}} in 1584 on the instigation of Emperor Rudolph II of the Holy Roman Empire. Following the Council of Trient, <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegates</b> had already earlier been appointed at Cologne {{in order to}} contain the spreading of Protestantism in the Empire. The Archbishop-Electorate of Cologne was chosen for being a stronghold of Catholicism in the northwest of the Empire in vicinity to areas, where Calvinism (Bremen, Dutch Republic, East Frisia, Lippe) and Lutheranism (elsewhere in Northern Germany) were gaining more and more support. The Rhenish Archbishop-Electorates were further important as providing already three of the then seven votes within the election body for the imperial successors.|$|R
50|$|A titular bishop (or titular archbishop) is {{a bishop}} {{assigned}} to a titular see, which is usually {{the name of a}} city or area that used to be the seat of a diocese, but whose episcopal see (diocese) is no longer functioning as such. Titular bishops often serve as auxiliary bishops, as officials in the Roman Curia, in the Patriarchal Curias of Eastern Churches, as papal diplomatic envoys (notably apostolic nuncios or <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegates),</b> or head certain missionary pre-diocesan jurisdictions (notably as apostolic vicar). Since 1970, a coadjutor bishop (or archbishop) uses the title of the see he is assigned to, and a bishop (or archbishop) emeritus uses the title of his last residential see.|$|R
25|$|Under Pius XI, Papal {{relations}} with East Asia {{were marked by}} the rise of the Japanese Empire to prominence, as well as the unification of China under Chiang Kai-shek. In 1922 he established the position of <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate</b> to China, and the first person in that capacity was Celso Benigno Luigi Costantini. On 1 August 1928, the Pope addressed a message of support for the political unification of China. Following the Japanese invasion of North China in 1931 and the creation of Manchukuo, the Holy See recognized the new state. On 10 September 1938, the Pope held a reception at Castel Gandolfo for an official delegation from Manchukuo, headed by Manchukuoan Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Yun.|$|E
25|$|Slovakia was a rump state {{formed by}} Hitler when Germany annexed the western half of Czechoslovakia. The small {{agricultural}} region had a predominantly Catholic population, {{and became a}} nominally independent state, with a Catholic priest, Jozef Tiso as president and the extreme-nationalist Vojtech Tuka Tuka as Prime Minister. Slovakia, under Tiso and Tuka had power over 90,000 Jews. Like the Nazis other main allies, Petain, Mussolini, and Horthy - Tiso did not share the racist hardline on Jews held by Hitler and radicals within his own government, but held a more traditional, conservative antisemitism. His regime was nonetheless highly antisemitic. Giuseppe Burzio, the <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate</b> to Bratislava, protested against the anti-Semitic and totalitarianism of the Tiso regime.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} April 1939, Pius XII {{announced}} {{a plan for}} peace, hoping to mediate a negotiation between the major European powers {{on the brink of}} war. The first leader contacted was Benito Mussolini, via Pius XII's usual go-between, Jesuit Father Tacchi Venturi. With Mussolini's approval, the next day Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione contacted the nuncios in Paris (Valerio Valeri), Warsaw (Filippo Cortesi), and Berlin (Cesare Orsenigo) and the <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate</b> in London (William Godfrey). The proposed Vatican meeting accomplished very little of substance: if there was any coherent position espoused by the Vatican among its various communications, it was that of appeasement. In particular, the Pope attempted to get Poland to accept the secession of the Free City of Danzig to Nazi Germany, a position Polish ambassador Kazimierz Papée (the former High Commissioner of Danzig) and the Polish government could not accept.|$|E
50|$|From 1990 to 2017, the Holy See had <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegates</b> {{who were}} {{representatives of the}} Holy See to the Catholics of Myanmar, but not formal representatives to the government. In March 2017 the Parliament of Myanmar {{approved}} a proposal by the Holy See in February {{of the same year}} to establish diplomatic relations. Myanmar and the Holy See announced in May 2017 that they will establish formal diplomatic relations. The announcement was made after a meeting between Pope Francis and Aung San Suu Kyi at the Vatican. This was the second visit of the Myanmar leader to Pope Francis after her first one in 2013. Myanmar thus becomes the 183rd country to establish diplomatic relations with the Holy See.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, he {{had become}} engaged in a second {{controversy}} with the same author, and, in his confutation of a book entitled an [...] "Apologie of the Church of England" [...] (Antwerp, 1565), he attacked an anonymous work, the authorship of which Jewel admitted in his [...] "Defence of the Apologie of the Churche of Englande". Harding retorted with [...] "A Detection of Sundrie Foule Errours, Lies, Sclaunders, corruptions, and other false Dealinges, touching Doctrine and other matters uttered and practized by M. Jewel" [...] (Louvain, 1568). In 1566 Pope Pius V appointed Harding and Dr. Sander (Nicholas Sanders) <b>Apostolic</b> <b>delegates</b> to England, with special powers of giving faculties to priests and of forbidding Catholics to frequent Protestant services.|$|R
50|$|Local {{governments were}} divided into those of the first class ("di primo ordine"), which were the larger cities, {{and those of the}} second ("di secondo"), which were all other comuni (municipalities). Each {{municipality}} was governed by a mayor called a governor (governatore) appointed by the pope through the secretary of state. Governors of the first class were appointed by papal brief, while those of the second class merely by letters patent. Governors were not necessarily ecclesiastics, and they had to be neither native to nor resident in their municipalities. They were under the authority of the <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegates.</b> The governors held judicial authority in cases involving less than 100 scudi, in property disputes and in some other cases. They were charged with policing fairs and festivals.|$|R
25|$|Like the Traditionalist Catholic {{movement}} in general, the SSPX was {{born out of}} opposition to changes in the Catholic Church that followed the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). The founder and central figure of the society was the French prelate Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who had previously served the Catholic Church as <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegate</b> to French-speaking Africa, Archbishop of Dakar, and superior general of the Holy Ghost Fathers, a missionary order of priests. In May 1970, shortly after his retirement as Vicar General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by 11 French seminarians in Rome, who were criticized for their adherence to the traditional doctrines of the Catholic Church. They sought Lefebvre's advice on a conservative seminary where they could complete their studies. He directed them to the still conservative University of Fribourg, in Switzerland. But soon, the University had become as liberal as anywhere else.|$|E
500|$|On 22 September 1948, Lefebvre, while {{continuing}} as Vicar Apostolic of Dakar, received additional responsibilities: Pope Pius XII appointed him <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Delegate</b> to French Africa. In this capacity {{he was the}} papal representative to the Church authorities in 46 dioceses [...] "in continental and insular Africa subject to the French Government, {{with the addition of}} the Diocese of Reunion, the whole of the island of Madagascar and the other neighbouring islands under French rule, but excluding the dioceses of North Africa, namely those of Carthage, Constantine, Algiers and Oran." [...] With this new responsibility he was appointed Archbishop of the titular see of Arcadiopolis in Europa.|$|E
500|$|Pre-Code films {{began to}} draw the ire of various {{religious}} groups, some Protestant but mostly a contingent of Roman Catholic crusaders. Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegate</b> to the Catholic Church in the United States, called upon Roman Catholics in the United States to unite against the surging immorality of films. As a result, in 1933 the Catholic Legion of Decency, headed by the Reverend John T. McNicholas (later renamed the National Legion of Decency), was established to control and enforce decency standards and boycott films they deemed offensive. They created a rating system for films that started at [...] "harmless" [...] and ended at [...] "condemned", with the latter denoting a film that was a sin to watch.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the various sinecures, Diego von Bergen was a high-ranking member of the German diplomatic service, who twice turned down the office of Foreign Secretary to remain in Rome. According to Morley, [...] "when Pius XII became Pope, there were papal nuncios in, among other capitals, Belgrade, Berlin, Berne, Brussels, Bucharest, Budapest, the Hague, Paris, Prague, Rome, and Warsaw. The circumstances of war reduced this number and changed the location and level {{of some of the}} diplomatic representatives. The end-result of these modifications was that during the years 1939-1943, the Secretariat of State was in diplomatic contact with its emissaries in Berlin, Rome, Vichy, Berne, Bratislava, Zagreb, Bucharest, and Budapest. In addition, active communications were maintained with the <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegates</b> in London, Washington, and Ankara".|$|R
50|$|After nearly 95 {{years of}} {{planning}} and building, the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart was finally dedicated by Thomas Aloysius Boland, Archbisop of Newark, on October 19, 1954. During the ceremony, Boland received the pallium from then-Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, <b>Apostolic</b> Nuncio (<b>delegate)</b> to the United States.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{there was not}} yet a formal union between the two patriarchal lines that professed to be in communion with the Holy See. The ancient monastery of Rabban Hormizd, that for many centuries was the see of the Mama patriarchal family {{supported}} {{by most of the}} East Syrian Christians, in 1808 recognized as own patriarch Mar Augustine Hindi, the leader of patriarchal line started by Mar Joseph I in 1681 in union with Rome. This was fiercely opposed by the last descended of the Mama family, Yohannan Hormizd, he too in communion with Rome. Joseph Audo was a partisan of Mar Augustine Hindi and thus became an active opponent of Yohannan Hormizd: the strong conflict came to an end only for the direct intervention of two <b>apostolic</b> <b>delegates</b> sent by Rome in 1828-1829.|$|R
