25|$|Avermectins {{belong to}} the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as in-feed {{treatments}} to kill sea lice. The first <b>avermectin</b> used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and flaccid paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E
2500|$|Infections with Trypanosoma {{species are}} treated, either prophylactically or to treat acute cases with {{synthetic}} chemical {{drugs such as}} diminazine. Infections with nematode worms causing filariosis may be treated with the <b>avermectin</b> class of biologically derived drugs (macrocyclic lactones) such as ivermectin, doramectin, moxidectin. There are commercially available vaccines to protect animals against bluetongue, and African horse sickness ...|$|E
50|$|The {{gene cluster}} for {{biosynthesis}} of <b>avermectin</b> from S. avermitilis has been sequenced. The <b>avermectin</b> biosynthesis gene cluster encodes enzymes responsible for four steps of <b>avermectin</b> production: 1) {{production of the}} <b>avermectin</b> aglycon by polyketide synthases, 2) modification of the aglycon, 3) synthesis of modified sugars, and 4) glycosylation of the modified <b>avermectin</b> aglycon. This gene cluster can produce eight avermectins which have minor structural differences.|$|E
5000|$|Emamectin, {{like other}} <b>avermectins,</b> is a {{hydrophobic}} 16-membered macrocyclic lactone. [...] Emamectin differs from <b>avermectins</b> B1a and B1b {{by the presence}} of a hydroxyl group at the 4”-epimethylamino group rather than the 4”-position. <b>Avermectins</b> are pentacyclic polyketide-derived compounds linked to a disaccharide of the methylated deoxysugar oleandrose.|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} by <b>avermectins</b> led to increasing susceptibility of Colorado potato beetle larvae to the fungal infection (Metarhizium robertsii). Application of entomopathogenic fungi and complex of natural <b>avermectins</b> together caused synergetic effect. Changes of insect’s immune status and impairment of pathological process during mycosis have been registered in presence of toxicogenic half-lethal concentrations of <b>avermectins...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>avermectins</b> are {{a series}} of drugs used to treat {{parasitic}} worms. They are a 16-membered macrocyclic lactone derivatives with potent anthelmintic and insecticidal properties. These naturally occurring compounds are generated as fermentation products by Streptomyces avermitilis, a soil actinomycete. Eight different <b>avermectins</b> were isolated in four pairs of homologue compounds, with a major (a-component) and minor (b-component) component usually in ratios of 80:20 to 90:10. [...] Other anthelmintics derived from the <b>avermectins</b> include ivermectin, selamectin, doramectin, and abamectin.|$|R
50|$|<b>Avermectin</b> {{biosynthesis}} {{is classified}} into three stages: {{the formation of}} the polyketide-derived initial aglycone, modification of the initial aglycone to produce <b>avermectin</b> aglycones, and glycosylation of <b>avermectin</b> aglycones to generate avermectins.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>avermectin</b> initial aglycon {{is further}} {{modified}} by other enzymes in the <b>avermectin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster. AveE has cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity and facilitates the furan ring formation between C6 and C8. [...] AveF has NAD(P)H-dependent ketoreductase activity which reduces the C5 keto group to a hydroxyl. AveC influences the dehydratase activity in module two (affecting C22-C23), although the {{mechanism by which}} it does this is not clear. [...] AveD has SAM-dependant C5 O-methyltransferase activity. Whether AveC or AveD acts on the aglycon determines whether the resulting <b>avermectin</b> aglycon will produce <b>avermectin</b> series “A” or “B” and series 1 or 2, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of the <b>avermectin</b> family of compounds, from which ivermectin is chemically derived, was made by Satoshi Ōmura of Kitasato University, Tokyo and William C. Campbell of the Merck Institute for Therapeutic research. Ōmura identified <b>avermectin</b> from the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis. Campbell purified <b>avermectin</b> from cultures obtained from Ōmura and led efforts leading to the {{discovery of}} ivermectin, a derivative of greater potency and lower toxicity. Ivermectin was introduced in 1981. Half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Campbell and Ōmura for discovering <b>avermectin,</b> [...] "the derivatives of which have radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases".|$|E

50|$|Emamectin, {{produced}} by the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis, belongs to the <b>avermectin</b> family of compounds all of which exhibit toxicity for nematodes, arthropods, and several other pests. The benzoate salt of emamectin in particular has found widespread use as an insecticide and is approved by the EPA for use in prevention of emerald ash borer in ash trees.Emamectin is derived from <b>avermectin</b> B1, also known as abamectin, a mixture of the natural <b>avermectin</b> B1a and B1b. Emamectin has also shown promising applications in the eradication of fish lice and in fish farming.|$|E
50|$|Abamectin is {{a mixture}} of {{avermectins}} containing more than 80% <b>avermectin</b> B1a and less than 20% <b>avermectin</b> B1b. These two components, B1a and B1b have very similar biological and toxicological properties. The avermectins are insecticidal and antihelmintic compounds derived from various laboratory broths fermented by the soil bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis. Abamectin is a natural fermentation product of this bacterium.|$|E
50|$|Nine open reading frames (orf1 and aveBI-BVIII) are {{downstream}} of aveA4, {{which are}} known involved with glycosylation and sugar synthesis. AveBII-BVIII {{are responsible for}} synthesis of dTDP-L-oleandrose and AveBI is responsible for glycosylation of the <b>avermectin</b> aglycon with the dTDP-sugar. The sequence of orf1 suggests that its product will have reductase activity, but this functionality {{does not appear to}} be necessary for <b>avermectin</b> synthesis.|$|E
50|$|In {{arthropods}} and nematodes, glutamate stimulates glutamate-gated chloride channels. The β subunits of the receptor {{respond with}} very high affinity to glutamate and glycine. Targeting these receptors {{has been the}} therapeutic goal of anthelmintic therapy using <b>avermectins.</b> <b>Avermectins</b> target the alpha subunit of glutamate-gated chloride channels with high affinity. These receptors have also been described in arthropods, such as Drosophila melanogaster and Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Irreversible activation of these receptors with <b>avermectins</b> results in hyperpolarization at synapses and neuromuscular junctions resulting in flaccid paralysis and death of nematodes and arthropods.|$|R

50|$|Like <b>avermectins,</b> milbemycins are {{products}} of fermentation by Streptomyces species. They have a similar mechanism of action, but a longer half-life than the <b>avermectins.</b> Milbemycin oxime is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus aureolacrimosus. It opens glutamate sensitive chloride channels in neurons and myocytes of invertebrates, leading to hyperpolarisation of these cells and blocking of signal transfer.|$|R
50|$|The <b>avermectin</b> initial aglycon is {{synthesized}} by the polyketide synthase {{activity of}} four proteins (AVES 1, AVES 2, AVES 3, and AVES 4). The activity of this enzyme complex {{is similar to}} type I polyketide synthases.
