40|$|The present {{research}} examined how actionversus state-oriented individuals (Kuhl & Beckmann, 1994) utilize their working memory capacity under varying situational demands. Participants visualized either <b>a</b> <b>demanding</b> or <b>an</b> accepting person, after which their working memory capacity was assessed. Among action-oriented participants, visualizing <b>a</b> <b>demanding</b> person led to greater operation spans (Study 1) and superior memory for intention-related information (Study 2) than visualizing an accepting person. State-oriented participants displayed the opposite pattern, such that visualizing an accepting person led to greater operation spans (Study 1) and superior memory for intentions (Study 2) than visualizing <b>a</b> <b>demanding</b> person. These {{findings indicate that}} action versus state orientation moderates the impact of situational demands on working memory capacity. © 2006 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc...|$|R
