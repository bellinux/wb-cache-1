5|$|The All Blacks' record test try scorer is Doug Howlett with 49 tries, who overtook Christian Cullen's 46 {{during the}} 2007 World Cup. The world record for tries in a {{calendar}} year {{is held by}} Joe Rokocoko, with 17 tries in 2003; he also became the first <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> to score ten tries in his first five tests, {{as well as the}} first <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> to score at least two tries in each of four consecutive tests. In test matches, the most capped <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> is Richie McCaw with 148 caps. The record for most tests as captain is held by Richie McCaw with 110. The youngest <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> in a test match was Jonah Lomu, capped at age 19 years, 45 days, whilst the oldest test player was Ned Hughes at 40 years, 123 days.|$|E
50|$|Donnelly was on {{the fringes}} of the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> for several years, first being {{selected}} to the Junior <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> in 2006.

5|$|After the {{kick-off}} {{there was}} soon a scrum ordered The <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> were repeatedly penalised by the referee whenever {{they had a}} scrum. The reason for this was the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> 2–3–2 scrum formation where they had only two front-rowers. The Welsh team used a three-man front row, and had studied the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> scrummaging technique. The Welsh countered the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> 2–3–2 scrum formation by setting their front row after the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks,</b> and hence preventing the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> from gaining the loosehead. Consequently, every time the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> tried to hook the ball they were penalised, and this prompted their captain Gallaher to order his team not to contest the scrums, and to instead let the Welsh win the ball.|$|R
5|$|The <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> {{travelled}} to Paris on New Year's Eve and on 1 January faced France at Parc des Princes. The {{match was}} France's first Test ever. French captain Henri Amand gave the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> choice of {{ends and the}} kick off. Although the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> dominated, France scored a try to Noel Cessieux in the first half; the half ended 18–3 to the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks.</b> Georges Jérôme then scored for France after the break to make it 18–8 for the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks.</b> The <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> ended up scoring another six tries {{for a total of}} ten, and a 38–8 win. The eight points, and two tries scored by France were as many as any team in the British Isles had against the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Crusaders {{finished}} as runner-ups in the 2004 Super 12 season, {{losing the}} final to the Brumbies. Following the World Cup, John Mitchell was dropped as <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> coach {{and replaced by}} Graham Henry. McCaw was selected as first choice openside flanker and made vice captain. In the first test against England he was escorted off the field after suffering concussion following a clash of heads with fellow <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> Xavier Rush. He was a late withdrawal from the second England test and then played 70 minutes against Argentina before again leaving the field due to dizziness.|$|E

5|$|France {{achieved}} {{only their}} second Test {{victory over the}} <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> in 1973 at Parc des Princes, Paris. The <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> had defeated England, Scotland and Wales, and drawn with Ireland on their 1973 tour and France was their last Test. France won 136, and scored two tries to nil, with two penalties the only points from the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks.</b> In 1977 the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> made their first-ever full tour of France. France won the first Test in Toulouse and the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> the second in Paris. France then reciprocated and toured New Zealand in 1979. This time, neutral referees were appointed for the first time. The <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> won the first Test 239 at Lancaster Park. However, in the second Test, France upset the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> by winning 2419 on Bastille Day at Eden Park. The victory was France's first win in New Zealand over the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Five Percenter {{membership}} plunged after Clarence13X's death, but rebounded in 1970 {{after new}} leadership emerged and revitalized the group. After his death, {{the group was}} not dominated by a single leader. This {{may have been a}} result of their teaching that <b>all</b> <b>black</b> men are gods, which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the most capped test <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> was Sean Fitzpatrick, with 92 appearances. He {{played in the}} 1987 World Cup after {{incumbent}} Andy Dalton was injured, and was appointed All Blacks captain in 1992, continuing in the role {{until his retirement in}} 1997. He played 346 first class rugby matches.|$|E
5|$|Hammett's 2001 Super 12 {{season was}} marred by a {{shoulder}} injury, and the Crusaders eventually finished tenth. Due to injury, Hammett only played one game for the All Blacks, as a substitute against Argentina in June. He missed the entire NPC campaign due to injury: an ankle problem which required surgery and causes him to also miss the 2001 end-of-year <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> tour.|$|E

50|$|The <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> {{partnership}} with Adidas is again an accurate example. Any form of media the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> {{are in it}} is always made apparent that they are wearing Adidas. Adidas benefits from its alliance with the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> because of the <b>All</b> <b>Black's</b> high reputation {{and the fact that}} they use only the best equipment. The <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> are constantly followed on every form of media. This concludes the reason as to why Adidas is their main sponsor- they want to be a part of the 'All Blacks' fame and success.|$|R
50|$|Oliver {{created the}} first father and son captain {{combination}} for the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> when he was appointed as <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> captain in 2001. Father Frank Oliver captained the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> in 1978 {{and was one of}} the hardmen of New Zealand rugby.|$|R
5|$|In 2005 {{members of}} the All Blacks {{witnessed}} the unveiling of a plaque at Gallaher's birthplace in Ramelton, which was presented {{in conjunction with the}} renaming of Letterkenny RFC's home ground to Dave Gallaher Memorial Park. Gallaher's name is also incorporated into the club's crest. The ground was upgraded following its renaming, and in 2012 the Letterkenny section of the ground was opened by former <b>All</b> <b>Black,</b> and Ponsonby stalwart, Bryan Williams. An Ireland-produced documentary about Gallaher's life, The Donegal <b>All</b> <b>Black,</b> was aired in 2015. Later that year, a jersey worn by Gallaher during the 1905 British Isles tour was sold at auction in Cardiff for £180,000—nearly 10 times the previous record auction price for a rugby jersey.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the NZRU {{took the}} {{controversial}} step of allowing American insurance {{and financial services}} company, AIG, to promote themselves on the centre-front of the <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> jersey. In return, the NZRU would receive direct financial sponsorship that was not revealed; the deal {{was estimated to be}} worth approximately $80 million over five years.|$|E
5|$|McCaw was {{the first}} <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> to reach 100 caps, and the first rugby union player to win 100 tests. He is the most-capped player in rugby union history with 148 caps, having {{overtaken}} Brian O'Driscoll's record in 2015. McCaw has also equaled the record for most appearances at the Rugby World Cup with Jason Leonard.|$|E
50|$|Nonu was {{selected}} for the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> 2011 Rugby World Cup. He scored the final try the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> opening match. On 23 October 2011, {{he played in the}} final against France, which the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> won by 8-7 to become world champions.|$|R

5|$|The American crow is <b>all</b> <b>black,</b> with {{iridescent}} feathers. It {{looks much}} like other all-black corvids. They {{can be distinguished}} from the common raven (C. corax) because American crows are smaller and from the fish crow (C. ossifragus) because American crows do not hunch and fluff their throat feathers when they call.|$|E
5|$|The male of the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{which is}} found {{throughout most of}} Europe, is <b>all</b> <b>black</b> except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich, melodious song; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage. This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is omnivorous, eating {{a wide range of}} insects, earthworms, berries, and fruits.|$|E
5|$|These {{factors may}} have contributed to the gap between <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> tours of the British Islesthey next toured in 1924. The NZRFU was denied {{representation}} on the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB)composed exclusively of English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh membersuntil 1948. After complaining about the wing-forward for years, the Home Nations-administered IRFB made a series of law changes that effectively outlawed the position in 1931.|$|E
50|$|Gopperth {{has never}} played for his {{national}} team, the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks,</b> but has made one appearance {{for the second}} string team the Junior <b>All</b> <b>Blacks.</b> His appearance was during the Pacific Nations Cup, which the Junior <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> won. Gopperth scored 6 points, kicking two penalties.|$|R
50|$|In 2002 Levi was standby for the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> Tri Nations team. An {{injury in}} the <b>All</b> <b>Blacks</b> gave an {{opportunity}} for Levi to play the Springboks in Wellington.

5|$|Wearing either <b>all</b> <b>black</b> or {{all white}} dresses ordered from Paris, Marrash hosted the mixed evening get-togethers in which {{literary}} topics {{as varied as}} the Mu`allaqat—a cycle of seven pre-Islamic poems—or the work of Rabelais were discussed. Chess and card games were played, and complicated poetry competitions took place; wine and 'araq flowed freely; participants sang, danced, and listened to records played on a phonograph.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> tour of Australia, in {{the game}} against Metropolitan Union in Sydney on 5 August 1914, the news was posted on the {{scoreboard}} that the British Empire – and therefore New Zealand and Australia – had declared war.

Three of them were killed, including Downing at Gallipoli, Bobby Black at the Somme and Jim McNeece at Messines.|$|E
5|$|Former <b>All</b> <b>Black</b> Jamie Joseph {{was hired}} as coach for the 2011 Super Rugby season, while Jamie Mackintosh {{replaced}} Cowan as team captain.
