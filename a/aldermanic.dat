5|$|Missoula's {{system of}} {{government}} has changed four times since 1883 when an <b>aldermanic</b> form of government was approved with the town charter. The city adopted a commission-council form of government in 1911 {{with the opening of}} new City Hall and a council–manager government in 1954 before returning to an <b>aldermanic</b> form of government in 1959. Since January 1, 1997, Missoula has been governed in accordance with the Missoula City Charter, which calls for a mayor-council {{system of government}}.|$|E
5|$|Harold Washington, {{the subject}} of the portrait, was elected in 1965 to the Illinois House of Representatives. After the death of Richard J. Daley in late 1976, Washington won Chicago's 1983 Democratic mayoral primary election. He was elected mayor, {{prevailing}} over Bernard Epton in a racially polarizing general election. His first four-year term was characterized by the Council Wars, a period of political conflict with the mostly white <b>aldermanic</b> majority in City Council. Seven Washington-backed <b>aldermanic</b> challengers prevailed in the April, 1986 special municipal election, facilitating progress with Washington's agenda. Washington died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} his office. His death was followed by a period of mourning by Chicagoans, particularly in the African-American community.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{her second}} year as alderman, Jackson {{directed}} more than $32,000 in payments from her <b>aldermanic</b> expense account to her American Express account. Jackson said she used an AmEx account to launch her office during her freshman term.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Sandra Reed, a black {{high school}} English teacher, {{and two other}} women opposed Shiller, the first all-female field in an <b>aldermanic</b> race in Chicago history. The Chicago Tribune again {{endorsed}} Shiller. Shiller prevailed with 55% {{of the vote in}} a runoff. Shiller was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community in 2000.|$|E

Towns are limited to town board type of municipal government. Cities may choose among <b>aldermanic,</b> mayoral, council-manager, and home-rule charter types of government. Cities may also petition to incorporate as towns.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle was re-elected as 4th Ward Democratic committeeman on March 19, 1996, running unopposed on {{the ballot}} after her {{successful}} challenges to the nominating petitions of Charles S. Williams and her 1995 and 1999 <b>aldermanic</b> challenger Kwame Raoul, who were both just a few dozen signatures short of the number required to earn a place {{on the ballot}}.|$|E
5|$|They {{hold that}} we are guilty of murder, and with their <b>aldermanic</b> jury's verdict to back them, they would hold a court of Judge Lynch and hang the unfortunate one of us who got into their {{clutches}} without an hour's delay, providing they didn't first tear him to pieces...|$|E
5|$|In 1985 and 1986 Preckwinkle was President of the Disabled Adult Residential Enterprises (DARE). Preckwinkle {{has been}} a member of the Board of Directors of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence, Political Action Director of the Near South Chapter of the Independent Voters of Illinois (IVI-IPO). During and after her 1987 <b>aldermanic</b> {{election}} campaign, she worked as a planner for the Chicago Department of Economic Development. By 1990, she had become executive director of the Chicago Jobs Council, and become allied with civil rights attorney R. Eugene Pincham.|$|E
5|$|The first {{election}} in Delta County occurred on October 6, 1870, to establish {{control in the}} newly formed county. Cooper held its first {{election in}} 1881, establishing an <b>aldermanic</b> government. Around that time, the first county courthouse was built in Cooper. Delta County, in addition to Cooper, voted for the Democratic Party in every presidential election from its incorporation in 1870 until 1968. However, the Populist Party won numerous local and county government positions during the 1890s and the early 1900s. In the 1970s, politics in Delta County shifted, {{and most of the}} county began voting for the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher first sought {{public office}} in 1893, {{when he was}} elected to Edmonton Town Council. In an <b>aldermanic</b> race in which the top six {{candidates}} were elected, he gained the final spot. On his first term on council he sat on the Licensing, and Health & Relief committees. He was re-elected in 1894, again placing sixth of nine candidates. Once this term expired in 1896, Gallagher stayed out of politics for several months until mayor Herbert Charles Wilson resigned over a dispute involving town funds. It fell to the council to fill the mayor's position. Gallagher was nominated by John Cameron and John Kelly; as there were no rival candidates, he won by acclamation. He was the first mayor of Edmonton never to be elected to that position; (Frederick John Mitchell and Terry Cavanagh would later join him in that distinction). He was sworn in at the town council meeting on October 27, 1896.|$|E
5|$|In Edmonton he {{established}} the developing town's largest meat packing business, upon land atop {{the banks of}} the North Saskatchewan River, overlooking the river valley. He would also get involved with the city's local politics, sitting on the Edmonton Town Council in the 1890s and early 1900s. In 1896, after the incumbent mayor had resigned, the town council selected Gallagher to briefly be the interim mayor until an election was held later that year. He served one more <b>aldermanic</b> term, but retired after defeat in the 1903 and 1907 elections. In 1911, he would also retire from his meat business. In retirement, Gallagher lived on a lavish estate on land he owned atop the Edmonton River Valley until his death in 1932.|$|E
5|$|In Edmonton {{he would}} rise {{to be one}} of the city's most {{prominent}} contractors, constructing many of the city's landmark buildings, as well as houses for its prominent residents. Long interested in municipal affairs, he entered civic politics with his election to the Edmonton Town Council in 1903. After an <b>aldermanic</b> term that saw the inclusion of Alberta as a province in Canada, in 1905 he was elected as mayor of the newly incorporated city; during his term he would oversee many improvements and advances to the city. Retiring after one term in office and returning to his contracting firm, he would eventually leave Edmonton in 1922 for Vancouver where he would live for 10 years leading up to his death in 1932. An active community man, May also founded and oversaw many local organizations. A Liberal in politics, he is remembered as a progressive mayor whose policies helped the accelerate development of city of Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party charging that Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund <b>aldermanic</b> service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007 {{the city}} {{eliminated}} the preschool {{program as a}} cost-saving measure. Mayor Morgan voted against the preschool the next month when a second <b>aldermanic</b> vote came down to a tie.|$|E
25|$|Reimer also {{supported}} increases in <b>aldermanic</b> salaries, {{suggesting that they}} had to work harder than members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, since aldermen need to learn issues themselves and can't fall back on a party platform.|$|E
25|$|The {{city council}} {{consists}} of eight alderpersons, {{who along with}} the mayor, make up the Common Council. There are four <b>aldermanic</b> districts, with two alderpersons per district, each serving for two-year terms over alternating years. The council manages the city's budget and financial operations and determines the salaries of all officers and employees of the city.|$|E
25|$|McKeag resumed {{political}} activity {{at a local}} level after losing his Parliamentary seat. He resumed {{his status as a}} Liberal without prefix or suffix and was elected to Newcastle City Council in 1936. He remained a member of the Council for 25 years, during which time he was raised to the <b>Aldermanic</b> Bench, Deputy Mayor and was Mayor of the City twice, in 1951–52 and in 1953–54. In 1966, he was declared an Honorary Freeman of Newcastle.|$|E
25|$|Automobile {{parking is}} {{at a premium}} in Lakeview, {{especially}} during special events such as Chicago Cubs home games at Wrigley Field. Special residential parking permits are required for parking on some Lakeview streets; in commercial areas, limited metered parking is available. High-priced public parking lots are available for visitors and baseball fans but {{are hard to come}} by. Lakeview residents on blocks with parking restrictions may purchase temporary parking permit slips, available at <b>aldermanic</b> constituent offices, for guests invited to private residences.|$|E
25|$|Starting with Governor Deval Patrick's tax {{initiative}} program, Melrose {{has become}} a popular place to shoot films. In the fall of 2009, the Ben Affleck movie The Town captured many key scenes in a historic bank on Main Street downtown, while around the same time, Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise's movie Knight & Day shot scenes on the Fellsway. The same month, a documentary for PBS about the Scopes Trial was also shot in the <b>Aldermanic</b> Chamber of Melrose City Hall.|$|E
25|$|Clegg was {{considered}} to be on the right of the Liberal Party and was associated with the Liberal League. He was opposed to socialism and was hostile to the Labour Party. From 1909, he began co-operating closely with the Conservative Party group on the council, and in 1920 the two parties formed the Citizens' Association, Clegg being its first leader. He pursued low-tax policies at the expense of cutting services and running up debts. He was an opponent of David Lloyd George's policies. The Association lost control of the council to Labour in 1926, who removed him from the <b>aldermanic</b> bench.|$|E
25|$|While the {{election}} was still pending, the death of Alderman Nathaniel Pearson in May 1749 caused a second vacancy in the representation, and Lucas and La Touche became partly reconciled in opposing Cooke and the second <b>aldermanic</b> candidate, Charles Burton. Shortly afterwards, the corporation having resolved to farm the revenues {{of the city to}} a certain Alderman, Lucas denounced the affair as a job, and the council in which the resolution had been passed as packed. The corporation voted the charge false and malicious, and refused to hear Lucas in his defence. The censure was confirmed at a subsequent meeting, and a vote of thanks passed to the author of a pamphlet entitled Lucas Detected, conjectured to have been Edmund Burke, at that time a student at Trinity College. But an appeal by Lucas to the corporation secured fifteen votes out of the twenty-five in his favour.|$|E
500|$|He {{ran in the}} 1904 Edmonton {{municipal}} election to elect the first Edmonton City Council (Edmonton had hitherto been a town). [...] He finished second of seventeen candidates in the <b>aldermanic</b> race, and was elected to a two-year term. [...] He resigned in 1906, before the completion of his term.|$|E
500|$|In {{the ensuing}} election, Gallagher chose {{to run for}} {{alderman}} rather than seeking a full term as mayor. [...] This remains {{the only time in}} the city's history that a sitting mayor has run for alderman. [...] He was elected, placing fifth of nine candidates. During this term he sat on committees involved in issues relating to finance, police and utilities (fire, water and light). He did not seek re-election in the election in December 1897. [...] In December 1898 Gallagher ran for mayor, but was defeated by William S. Edmiston. [...] He stayed out of politics until 1901, when he was elected to a two-year term as alderman. [...] He was defeated in his re-election bid in 1903, placing fifth of nine candidates (the staggered two year <b>aldermanic</b> terms meant that only three of the council's six aldermen were elected each election). [...] His last bid for office took place during the 1907 election, when he placed eleventh of twelve candidates in the <b>aldermanic</b> race.|$|E
500|$|Burke's {{corrections}} of his voting history were {{criticized by}} other aldermen and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. Daley suggested Burke {{was involved in}} conflicts of interest that merited investigation by the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission and the City Board of Ethics, and Daley advocated more stringent regulation regarding <b>aldermanic</b> conflicts of interest. Burke's conflicts of interest inspired a strengthening of the City's ethics laws in October 1998. The Council passed the ordinance, 40-9. Burke voted [...] "no" [...] in a voice vote, then switched to [...] "yes" [...] for the record.|$|E
500|$|During the Reconstruction Era, when {{economic}} conditions made impractical the growing of cotton, lumbering and tobacco growing (which pioneers found profitable commercially), grain farming by crop rotation, dairying, reforestation, merchandising and manufacturing, and Coal mining especially, began {{to occupy the}} city. In 1889, {{with a population of}} 1,500, Harrisburg became a city, with an <b>aldermanic</b> form of government. It adopted the commission form in 1915. Despite these early industrial advantages over other cities in the region, the Sanborn Map company still referred to the water facilities and road conditions within the city limits, [...] "Not good, and not paved" [...] up to 1900.|$|E
500|$|Her first {{political}} statement as an alderman was disappointment in Mayor Daley's decision to force his affordable housing ordinance through the council with nine lame duck councilmen {{during the week}} before the new class was sworn in because new alderman would be [...] "forced to live by" [...] the new ordinance. [...] Meanwhile, her husband propounded a 10-point ethics reform that would give the city's inspector general power to investigate aldermen; reduce the number of City Council committees to 10; limit municipal campaign contributions for each election cycle; and strip the mayor of the authority to appoint replacements for <b>aldermanic</b> vacancies.|$|E
500|$|Leeds {{was among}} the 178 boroughs {{reformed}} by the act, becoming the [...] "Municipal Borough of Leeds". The reformed borough was initially unchanged in area, and was divided into 12 wards, with a town council of 16 aldermen and 48 councillors, headed by a mayor. Each ward was represented by either three or six directly elected councillors. One third of the councillors retired annually. Aldermen were additional members of the council, there being one alderman for every three councillors: they had a six-year term of office, {{with half of the}} <b>aldermanic</b> bench elected by the council itself every three years.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's <b>aldermanic</b> {{career began}} inauspiciously when she {{complained to the}} Chicago Sun-Times, one of Chicago's major daily newspapers, that she was caught off-guard {{by the need to}} pay office {{start-up}} expenses up front. [...] This provided fodder for a columnist in the Chicago Tribune, the other major daily, and anonymous on-line commenters on the Chicago Sun-Times web site made light of the issue. At the time, Jackson was considered by one local political writer as the most closely watched of the nine newly elected aldermen that were sworn in on May 21, 2007 and by another as the [...] "star" [...] of the incoming class of nine freshman aldermen.|$|E
500|$|Burke's long-time <b>aldermanic</b> {{secretary}} worked full-time out of {{the downtown}} office of Burke's law firm, even though her salary was paid by the city. The secretary was subpoenaed by the Operation Haunted Hall grand jury. Alderman Joe Moore asked, [...] "Why is she over at the law firm? It looks bad. It raises the appearance that she's possibly doing not only city work but law firm work." [...] An attorney for the Finance Committee said, [...] "I don't have to explain why she's at the law firm. [...] doesn't have to explain. It makes no difference where she sits...She's a city employee and she does city work." [...] The secretary was transferred to City Hall.|$|E
500|$|Burke is {{the only}} Chicago {{alderman}} who has Chicago police officers assigned to him as bodyguards. In 1986, Mayor Harold Washington's acting Chicago police commissioner Fred Rice tried {{to reduce the number}} of Burke's bodyguards from four to two, on the basis that the manpower was no longer necessary. Burke sued the city, arguing that the move was a political retaliation. The court sided with Burke. Rice removed nearly all the <b>aldermanic</b> bodyguards, but was blocked by court orders from taking away the Vrdolyak and Burke contingents. For nine months in 2005, the police details assigned to the city clerk, city treasurer and Burke did not file any police reports. Andy Shaw, president and chief executive of the watchdog group Better Government Association, asked, ...|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 1842, {{the city}} {{received}} a [...] parcel that was {{donated by the}} members of the American Land Company for use as a public park. [...] The property had once been a cow path with a well for farmers to water their cattle. The donors stipulated the name Washington Square. [...] Between 1869 and the 1890s, the city improved Washington Square with lawn, trees, bisecting diagonal walks, limestone coping, picket fencing, and an attractive Victorian fountain. By the time Alderman McCormick became President of Drainage Board in 1906, the fountain had been razed and the park had deteriorated. Alderman McCormick devoted his <b>aldermanic</b> salary to improving the park. He donated a $600 fountain, and the city allocated an additional $10,000 to rehabilitate the park. By the 1910s, the neighborhood surrounding Washington Square had become more diverse.|$|E
500|$|In 1895, Edmiston was {{nominated}} for and subsequently elected to Edmonton Town Council, finishing first in the <b>aldermanic</b> race {{in a field of}} nine candidates, with 175 votes. [...] He was re-elected in 1896, finishing second of eight candidates. During this term, Edmiston sat as the chair of the board of works. He also sat on the council's finance, public works and market committees. He did not seek re-election in the next election. In early 1897, {{he was a member of}} a planning committee for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations within the town. In the ensuing December 1897 election, having been nominated for mayor by Colin Strang and George Roy, he was the only candidate put forth for the position, and thus was acclaimed to the position. In 1898, in response to getting nominated for re-election as mayor, Edmiston responded by purchasing an advertisement in the Edmonton Bulletin, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1961 Bessie's <b>aldermanic</b> term on Liverpool's council expired. That year, the Conservatives briefly {{took control}} of the council, and used their {{majority}} to block her reappointment. This ended 31 years' service on the council. In 1963, when Labour regained control, she did not seek re-instatement. The year 1963 saw the publication of The Braddocks, [...] in which Bessie made a sustained attack on communism and Trotskyism: [...] "The purpose of this book is to bring home to the rank and file how wide that influence is... unless positive steps are taken by the workers themselves... democracy will be dead". Reviewing the book for the Socialist Standard, Lawrence Weidberg thought it gave a useful picture of early 20th century working-class life in Liverpool, but concluded that [...] "from the evidence of this book the Braddocks qualified fully for the role of blind leaders of the blind".|$|E
500|$|The 14th Ward Democrats slated {{the young}} Burke as the Democratic {{candidate}} {{in a special}} election called for on March 11, 1969 to fill vacancies in City Council, including the 14th Ward. Burke faced six opponents, but won with a majority of 11,204 votes, while the next highest candidate received 1460 votes. [...] Following the 1971 <b>aldermanic</b> elections, the Council approved the appointment of Burke, {{who was at the}} time a police sergeant on leave, as chairman of the Police and Fire Committee. In 1972 and 1973, Burke joined Alderman Edward Vrdolyak in a dissident caucus of aldermen demanding a greater voice in city affairs from Mayor Richard J. Daley and finance committee chairman Thomas Keane. The dissident aldermen were labelled the [...] "Young Turks," [...] and their caucus was called the [...] "coffee rebellion" [...] after the beverage served at their morning meetings. In the backroom of the City Council chamber, Burke once threatened to punch Alderman Leon Despres in the nose if Despres were not so old.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, William Beavers {{announced}} that he would resign his 7th ward <b>aldermanic</b> seat to pursue the Cook County Board seat being vacated by John Stroger, after Stroger was forced to resign following a stroke. Beavers requested that Mayor Daley appoint his daughter to replace him, in order for her to have the incumbency advantage in the February 27, 2007 municipal elections. [...] The deal also allowed for Todd Stroger to replace his father John {{as the president of the}} County Board and Beavers to surrender his ward seat after presiding over Mayor Daley's 2007 City Council budget hearings. In July 2007, when it first became public that Sandi Jackson was considering running for the 7th ward alderman seat, which would disrupt all the backroom dealings between the Strogers and the Beavers with Daley's approval, Jackson, Jr. encouraged her to run. [...] In the November 2006 elections, William Beavers won the County Board seat while Stroger won the County Board President's office that had been part of the dealings. On December 5, 2006, Jackson officially filed paperwork with state election officials. [...] On December 12, Mayor Daley appointed Darcel Beavers to succeed her father until the Spring municipal elections. [...] Then, on December 18, which is the filing deadline for petitions, Jackson filed 5,000 petition signatures to run for alderman.|$|E
