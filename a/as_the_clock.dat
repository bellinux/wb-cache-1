5|$|The {{third quarter}} {{came to a}} close as Virginia Tech {{struggled}} to answer the two Georgia scores. Tech quarterback Sean Glennon connected on a 29-yard pass to Eddie Royal, driving the Hokies to the Bulldog 47-yardline <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> hit zero.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the stadium {{consisted}} of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clock</b> End) at the ends of the field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and are two of the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its marble halls (though the floors were actually terrazzo) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road. The East Stand is considered architecturally significant enough to have been designated a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Narissa {{attempts}} to escape with Giselle's body but is stopped by Edward. Nathaniel, realizing Narissa was using him and never loved him, reveals her plot. Robert realizes that true love's kiss {{is the only}} force powerful enough to break the apple's spell. After Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, he prompts Robert to do so instead. When Robert kisses her just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> strikes twelve, Giselle awakens and the whole crowd cheers. Narissa furiously transforms into a giant blue dragon and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa {{to the top of}} the building. Pip, who was freed by Edward, helps Giselle send Narissa falling to her death.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Rashad Carmichael intercepted a pass by Jonathan Crompton {{leading to a}} Williams third-down run from the 1 to give the Hokies a 7-0 lead. Williams scored again, this time from the 3, to push the lead to 14-0 in the second quarter. Tennessee then took the momentum. Montario Hardesty ran through 301-pound {{defensive}} tackle Cordarrow Thompson’s tackle for a 4-yard run to cap an 80-yard drive. Janzen Jackson’s interception set up Crompton’s 2-yard touchdown pass to Moore with 18 seconds remaining in the first half. Instead of running out the clock, Taylor threw from his 33 to Jarrett Boykin, who was stopped inside the Volunteers’ 5 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> apparently expired. Tennessee players left the field but were summoned back and reluctantly returned as a video review showed that Boykin’s knee hit the ground with 2 seconds remaining. Matt Waldron kicked a 21-yard field goal as the first half ran out to give Virginia Tech a 17-14 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|With a firm {{lead and}} now in {{possession}} of the ball, Virginia Tech began to run out the clock by executing short rushing plays up {{the center of the}} field. Since the game clock does not stop in American college football if a player remains in bounds short of the first down marker, the Hokies could hasten {{the end of the game}} and preserve their lead by following this strategy. From their one-yard line, Taylor ran the ball for a one-yard gain, followed by two rushes by Evans for another four yards. The Hokies prepared to punt the ball, but during the kick, Cincinnati committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty by tackling Tech punter Brent Bowden. The penalty gave Virginia Tech a first down and kept their drive going. From the Tech 21-yard line, Evans was stopped for a loss of one yard, but broke free for an 11-yard gain and a first down on the next play. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> continued to tick down, Cincinnati began to use its timeouts in an effort to stop the clock after each play. This strategy was partially successful, as Tech was denied another first down and punted with 2:31 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Madonna {{coming to a}} ballet studio {{carrying}} a boombox. She switches it on <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> ticking sound of the music starts. Wearing a pink leotard, Madonna starts gyrating to the music while doing warm up exercises. The scene interchanges {{with a group of}} people on the street who start dancing to the music while listening to a similar boombox. They also display aspects of the physical discipline Parkour, while climbing over buildings and jumping from staircases. As the song starts, Madonna dances to the music in the ballet studio. The second verse shows her continuing dancing while the people from the street take their boombox and board a taxi. Scenes are interspersed with people dancing in a Chinese restaurant and Parisian streets. In the meantime, Madonna finishes her workout in the ballet studio, drops her towel, changes her clothes and comes out on the street. The people on the taxi, leave it and take the Underground instead. After another round of dancing in the train, the intermediate music starts. Madonna is shown mingling with some dancers on a dance floor and riding on a boombox. As the song starts again, Madonna and the people from the street, who act as her background dancers, all dance on a Dance Dance Revolution machine in a gaming parlor. The video ends showing Madonna lying on the ballet studio floor. The video was nominated for five awards at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards including Best Female Video, Dance Video, Pop Video, Best Choreography and the Video of the Year award although it did not win any of them.|$|E

25|$|PLLs are ubiquitous—they tune clocks {{in systems}} several feet across, {{as well as}} clocks in small {{portions}} of individual chips. Sometimes the reference clock may not actually be a pure clock at all, but rather a data stream with enough transitions that the PLL is able to recover a regular clock from that stream. Sometimes the reference clock is the same frequency <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> driven through the clock distribution, other times the distributed clock may be some rational multiple of the reference.|$|E

25|$|In the {{discussion}} of special relativity, forces played {{no more than a}} background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run at the same rate <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> at the origin. Is this really possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a global inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, local inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half, the Cowboys scored their only {{touchdown}} {{in the third quarter}} with a two-yard touchdown run by Marion Barber. Finally in the fourth quarter New Orleans got a touchdown when running back Mike Bell scored from one yard out to make a 24–10 Dallas lead. Drew Brees also made a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lance Moore. After that, Nick Folk attempted a 24-yard field goal, but the kick was no good. With a big advantage to take the lead <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> was expiring, the Saints were driving for the game-tying score, but DeMarcus Ware made his second sack on Drew Brees, which again caused the ball to be fumbled. This time the ball was recovered by nose guard Jay Ratliff. With the ball in possession, Dallas took a knee to conclude the game.|$|E

25|$|The play most {{directly}} {{analogous to the}} Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On Thanksgiving Day 1993, the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in sleet. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, {{waiting for it to}} come to rest in order to down it {{as close as possible to}} the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end Leon Lett sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface and touched the ball. His touch meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16–14 victory.|$|E
25|$|WVU {{entered the}} game against Pitt as 28 point {{favorites}} {{to win the}} 100th Backyard Brawl and earn a berth in the BCS championship game. The Mountaineers, however, could never get their high-powered offense going against the Panthers and were hurt by fumbles, missed field goals, and ineffective performances by Steve Slaton and Pat White, the latter of whom missed {{part of the game}} with a thumb injury. Pittsburgh, starting their backup QB Pat Bostick, was equally ineffective at moving the ball outside of the play of LeSean McCoy. Trailing by one possession late in the fourth quarter, West Virginia twice had the ball in Pitt territory, with both drives ending in Pat White being stopped on downs. The final Pitt possession saw the Panthers run the ball {{out of the back of}} the end zone for a safety <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> expired, ending WVU's National Championship hopes.|$|E
25|$|Om a Tuesday {{night at}} Memphis, the Cougars {{initially}} looked like their offense was finally starting to click when Solawa {{drove down the}} field and crossed a pass into the box, where Jambga slotted it past the Tigers' keeper for the season's first SIUE score {{from the field and}} the 1–0 lead in the 12th minute. After falling behind, the hosts from the American Athletic Conference shifted into a higher attack gear. Memphis took shot after shot, nut the Cougar defense and keeper Dal Santo held firm well into the second half. Although Memphis committed more fouls and was given four second-half yellow cards, it was SIUE who was called for a foul inside the box, setting up the penalty kick that tied the game in the 77th minute. Having never won at Memphis, the Cougars would have settled for a draw, but, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> wound down, the Tigers took a shot off a crossing pass, and the SIUE block was directed past Dal Santo with only nine seconds left in the game.|$|E
