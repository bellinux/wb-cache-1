5|$|Two of {{the five}} species are {{considered}} at risk. In 2003, {{a survey of the}} four colonies of the critically endangered Christmas Island frigatebirds counted 1200 breeding pairs. As frigatebirds normally breed every other year, the total adult population was estimated to lie between 1800 and 3600 pairs. Larger numbers formerly bred on the island, but the clearance of breeding habitat during World War II and dust pollution from phosphate mining have contributed to the decrease. The population of the vulnerable <b>Ascension</b> <b>frigatebird</b> has been estimated at around 12,500 individuals. The birds formerly bred on Ascension Island itself, but the colonies were exterminated by feral cats introduced in 1815. The birds continued to breed on a rocky outcrop just off the shore of the island. A program conducted between 2002 and 2004 eradicated the feral cats and a few birds have returned to nest on the island.|$|E
500|$|The type {{species of}} the genus is the [...] <b>Ascension</b> <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata aquila). For many years, the {{consensus}} was to recognise only two species of frigatebird, with larger birds as F. aquila and smaller as F. ariel. In 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews delineated five species, which remain valid. Analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA indicated that the five species had diverged from a common ancestor only recently—as little as 1.5 million years ago. There are two species pairs, the great and Christmas Island frigatebirds, and the magnificent and Ascension frigatebirds, while the fifth species, the lesser frigatebird, is an early offshoot of the common ancestor of the other four species. Three sub{{species of the}} lesser and five subspecies of the great frigatebird are recognised.|$|E
500|$|J.lagostoma {{is active}} {{at night and}} after rain, when it emerges from its burrows, which can be up to [...] deep. In 1915, H. A.

In the Wideawake Fairs, J.lagostoma feeds on chicks and eggs of the sooty tern, and they have been proposed as a limiting factor in the breeding of petrels on Ascension Island. In May, green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) hatch, and J.lagostoma is one of several predators to target the emerging hatchlings, alongside the <b>Ascension</b> <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata aquila) and feral cats. The crabs find water on and under rocks, especially after condensation has begun to form on their cool surfaces at night.|$|E

500|$|A {{subcommittee}} {{was set up}} in 1997 {{to undertake}} a review of rare bird records from the years immediately prior to BBRC's establishment. The purpose of the review was to ensure that all records from 1950 onwards (the cut-off date for Category A of the BOU British List of birds) have been subjected to a similar level of scrutiny. Not all of the 1,100 records of species considered to be rarities at that time were assessed, but only those related to species not recorded more than 100 times by 1997, as well as a few records of less rare species under particularly unusual circumstances, which were termed [...] "sore thumbs". Much of the original documentation was unavailable for the review, as it had been lost, and so for many records, the review was based solely on published accounts of the birds. The most notable outcome of this review was the reidentification of a frigatebird record from Tiree in 1953. Previously identified as a magnificent frigatebird, the BBRC review concluded that the bird was in fact an <b>Ascension</b> <b>frigatebird,</b> the only individual of this species ever identified in Europe (Walbridge, Small & McGowan 2003). The full results of the review were published in 2006. Of the 126 records reviewed, 37 were rejected as unacceptable. These included a claimed white-tailed eagle, which broke into a chicken-run in a garden and stole a chicken, three little crakes, three European scops owls, the only late December record of tawny pipit, three black-eared wheatears, a record of two White's thrushes together in April, a spring lanceolated warbler, two moustached warblers and a pine grosbeak. Furthermore, issues were found with the identification of Britain's first western sandpiper, on Fair Isle in 1956, and these led the BOURC to reject this record. The western sandpiper has been recorded several times subsequently in Britain however, and remains on the national list. The subcommittee's final report also hints at the prospect that some records from immediately prior to 1950 may be incorrect; because these fell outside the timeframes of the review they were not reassessed.|$|E

Three of the five extant species of frigatebirds are widespread, (the magnificent, great and lesser frigatebirds) while two are endangered (the Christmas Island and <b>Ascension</b> Island <b>frigatebirds)</b> and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each. The oldest fossils date to the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. Classified in the genus Limnofregata, the three species had shorter, less-hooked bills and longer legs, and lived in a freshwater environment.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Ascension</b> <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata aquila) is a seabird of the frigatebird family Fregatidae which breeds on Boatswain Bird Island and Ascension Island in the {{tropical}} Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ascension</b> <b>frigatebird</b> was {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Pelecanus aquilus. His specimen had been collected from the Ascension Island by the Swedish explorer Pehr Osbeck.|$|E
50|$|A {{juvenile}} frigatebird found {{dying in}} 1953 in Tiree, Scotland was identified {{at the time}} as magnificent frigatebird but the specimen was re-examined in 2002 and found to be an <b>Ascension</b> <b>frigatebird.</b> In July 2013 a juvenile was photographed at Bowmore on the island of Islay in Scotland.|$|E

50|$|The {{lesser frigatebird}} was first {{described}} as Atagen ariel by the English zoologist George Gray in 1845 from a specimen collected on Raine Island, Queensland, Australia. The lesser frigatebird {{is one of}} five closely related species belonging to the genus Fregata. The other four are: the great frigatebird (Fregata minor), the Christmas frigatebird (Frigata andrewsi), the magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) and the <b>Ascension</b> <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata aquila). The genus is {{the only member of the}} Fregatidae family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ascension</b> <b>frigatebird</b> {{is a large}} lightly built seabird with brownish-black plumage and {{a deeply}} forked tail. It has a {{wingspan}} of around 2 m. The male has a striking red gular sac which it inflates to attract a mate. The female is slightly larger than the male and has a brown breast-band and sometimes a white belly. They feed on fish taken in flight from the ocean's surface (mostly flying fish), and sometimes indulge in kleptoparasitism, harassing other birds {{to force them to}} regurgitate their food.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Status== A {{census of}} the <b>Ascension</b> <b>frigatebird</b> {{population}} on the islet of Boatswain conducted in 2001-2002 recorded around 6,250 breeding females.

This number is similar to an earlier estimate of between 8,000 and 10,000 birds obtained in a study conducted in 1957-1959.
