5|$|The House {{resolution}} did {{not pass}} the Senate, nor did the Senate pass a resolution of their own, {{so there was no}} 2012 budget of record. The actual <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> for Fiscal Year 2012 included four continuing resolutions and three full-year <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> enacted in November and December 2011, in accordance with the United States budget process. These appropriations were greatly affected by the Budget Control Act of 2011, passed in August 2011 as a resolution to the debt-ceiling crisis; it mandated budget cuts over a ten-year period beginning with Fiscal Year 2012.|$|E
5|$|While the Democrats {{were in the}} minority, Randall {{spent much}} of his time scrutinizing the Republicans' <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills.</b> During the Grant administration, he {{questioned}} thousands of items in the appropriation bills, often gaining the support of Republicans in excising expenditures that were in excess of the departments' needs. He proposed a bill that would end the practice, common at the time, of executive departments spending beyond what they had been appropriated, then petitioning Congress to retroactively approve the spending with a supplemental appropriation; the legislation passed and became law. The supplemental appropriations were typically rushed through {{at the end of a}} session with little debate. Reacting to the large grants of land given to railroads, he also sought unsuccessfully to ban all land grants to private corporations.|$|E
5|$|Pennington {{assigned}} Sherman {{to serve}} {{as chairman of the}} Committee on Ways and Means, where he spent much of his time on <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills,</b> while cooperating with his colleague Justin Smith Morrill on the passage of {{what became known as the}} Morrill Tariff. The Morrill Tariff raised duties on imports to close the deficit that had resulted from falling revenues. It also had the effect of encouraging domestic industries, which appealed to the former Whigs in the Republican party. Sherman spoke in favor of the bill, and it passed the House by a vote of 105 to 64. The tariff bill would likely have died in the Senate, but the withdrawal of Southern members at the start of the Civil War allowed the rump Senate to pass the bill in the 36th Congress's final session, and President Buchanan signed it into law in February 1861. Likewise, Sherman supported a bill admitting Kansas as a free state that passed in 1861.|$|E

25|$|During 1962 Hayden came to {{national}} attention {{due to a}} dispute over procedural issues between the Senate Appropriations committee and House Appropriations Committee. Billed in the press as a feud between two octogenarian chairmen, Hayden and Representative Clarence Cannon, the dispute began {{over the issue of}} where conference committees to resolve appropriation issues would meet. The Constitution required that all <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> must originate in the House while long-standing tradition of the time held that conference committee meetings occurred on the Senate side of the United States Capitol with a senator chairing the committee. The dispute began in January 1962 when members of the House appropriations committee passed a resolution calling for the meeting location of the conference committee to be evenly split between the House and Senate side of the Capitol building. In response to this, the Senate appropriations committee passed a resolution calling for half of all <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> to originate in the Senate. By April, Hayden had arranged for a meeting room located midway between the two chambers but House members refused to discuss the issue face-to-face until July, when US$55billion in unapproved appropriations bill threatened to force a government shutdown.|$|E

25|$|The bridge {{authorization}} faced a {{far more}} difficult time in the U.S. House of Representatives. The House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds speedily approved the bill and reported it on January 27, 1925, {{less than a month}} after receiving it from the Senate. But with a legislative logjam in the House and only about 30 days left in the legislative session, the bill's chances for approval seemed slim. Floor managers helping to guide the bill through the final approval process tried to bring the bill up for approval on January 30, believing they had the necessary two-thirds majority to suspend the rules to allow the bill to be considered. Instead, the House voted to suspend the legislative calendar — blocking all legislative except for <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Royal Assent {{ceremony}} {{takes place}} in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the members of parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills).</b> Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: [...] "in Her Majesty's name, His [...] Excellency the Governor General [...] doth assent to these bills." [...] If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites [...] "in Her Majesty's name, His [...] Excellency the Governor General [...] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills." [...] The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament.|$|E

50|$|In New Zealand, an <b>Appropriation</b> <b>Bill</b> is {{the formal}} {{name for the}} annual act of Parliament which gives legal effect to the Budget, that is, the Government's taxing and {{spending}} policies for the forthcoming year (from 1 July to 30 June). Like other bills, it is enacted, following debate, by the House of Representatives, and assented to by the Governor-General. The main <b>Appropriation</b> <b>Bill</b> is traditionally placed before the House for its first reading in May amid considerable media interest, an event known as {{the introduction of the}} Budget. An <b>Appropriation</b> <b>Bill</b> is not sent to a select committee, a lengthy process undergone by most bills during which they are scrutinised in detail by the committee, which also receives public submissions relating to the bill. Instead, an expedited process is followed in which the <b>Appropriation</b> <b>Bill</b> essentially goes directly to its second reading for consideration by the committee of the whole House.
