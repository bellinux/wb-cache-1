5|$|Frank Elgyn (Michael Wincott), the Betty captain, is Sabra Hillard's lover. Elgyn has {{an illegal}} {{partnership}} with General Martin Perez {{in which he}} delivers materials off the books to expedite the Auriga research and other activities. Elgyn delivers a shipment of humans in cryostasis, which are used as incubators for the Aliens. Elgyn and Perez maintain <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> {{there will be no}} disruptive activity aboard the station. This agreement is later compromised by Call by her contact with Ripley 8. Shortly after the Aliens escape captivity, Elgyn is killed when one of them pulls him through floor grates and impales him.|$|E

5|$|Ecologists {{study and}} measure {{nutrient}} budgets {{to understand how}} these materials are regulated, flow, and recycled through the environment. This research has led to <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{had been}} a firm {{supporter}} of Kennedy in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, Fidel Castro. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding; despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process {{had not yet been}} completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.|$|E
5|$|The French {{efforts to}} hide the frigate's mission and {{departure}} were initially successful: the British ships in the area were unaware of Thétiss intentions before she sailed. They were however prepared for any French movement and were launching regular patrols, in particular two ships {{under the command of}} captains Michael Seymour and Frederick Lewis Maitland, HMS Amethyst and HMS Emerald respectively. Both captains were experienced and veteran officers: Seymour had lost an arm at the Glorious First of June 15 years earlier, and they had agreed to hunt together, communicating regularly and with <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> all prize money won would be shared equally across both crews. After several weeks sailing in tandem, the frigates separated in early November.|$|E

5|$|Militarily {{weaker than}} NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear {{missiles}} on Cuba {{to even the}} power balance. Although conflicted, Castro agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause of socialism. Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, Dorticós and security chief Ramiro Valdés knew the full plan. Upon discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the U.S. implemented an island-wide quarantine to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. saw the missiles as offensive; Castro insisted they were for defense only. Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a nuclear strike on the U.S. should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid nuclear war. Castro was {{left out of the}} negotiations, in which Khruschev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba and <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. would remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy. Feeling betrayed by Khruschev, Castro was furious and soon fell ill. Proposing a five-point plan, Castro demanded that the U.S. end its embargo, withdraw from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, cease supporting dissidents, and stop violating Cuban air space and territorial waters. Presenting these demands to U Thant, visiting Secretary-General of the United Nations, the U.S. ignored them, and in turn Castro refused to allow the U.N.'s inspection team into Cuba.|$|E

25|$|The issues {{surrounding}} body image can be examined through, body negativity, and body positivity. Negative body image {{consists of a}} disoriented view of one’s shape; whereby they often feel self-conscious or feel ashamed, and assume others are more attractive. Aside from having low self-esteems, suffers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of eating disorders, isolation, and mental illnesses. Positive body image on the other hand, {{is described as a}} clear true perception of one’s figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also requires <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> an individual’s appearance does not reflect their character or self worth.|$|E

25|$|After {{the early}} studies that {{reported}} that PCE {{children would be}} severely disabled came studies that purported to show that cocaine exposure in utero has no important effects. Almost every prenatal complication originally thought to be due directly to PCE was found to result from confounding factors such as poor maternal nutrition, use of other drugs, depression, and lack of prenatal care. More recently the scientific community has begun to reach <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> PCE does have some important effects but {{that they are not}} severe as was predicted in the early studies. The effects of PCE are subtle but they exist. Most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero are normal or close to it.|$|E
25|$|Half-hearted {{inquiries}} {{that began}} {{at the request of}} foreign aid donors never amounted to anything substantial during Moi's presidency. Although it appears that the peaceful transfer of power to Mwai Kibaki may have involved <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> Moi would not stand trial for offences committed during his presidency, foreign aid donors reiterated their requests, and Kibaki reopened the inquiry. As the inquiry has progressed, Moi, his two sons, Philip and Gideon (now a member of Parliament), and his daughter, June, as well as a host of high-ranking Kenyans, have been implicated. In testimony delivered in late July 2003, Treasury Permanent Secretary Joseph Magari recounted that, in 1991, Moi ordered him to pay Ksh34.5million ($460,000) to Goldenberg, contrary to the laws then in force.|$|E
