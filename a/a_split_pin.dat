2500|$|The non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 8 May 1951. It involved a Hunting Air Travel Vickers 639 Viking 1 (registration: G-AHPD) operating an international scheduled passenger flight from Bordeaux Mérignac to RAF Bovingdon. Following an uneventful takeoff from Mérignac, the no. 1 engine suddenly {{began to lose}} power when the aircraft climbed through [...] and the pilot in command throttled down to initial climbing speed. The pilot then shut down the malfunctioning engine, feathered the propeller and applied full power to the no. 2 engine {{to compensate for the}} loss of engine no. 1. However, this was insufficient to maintain altitude and led to the flightdeck crew's decision to execute a gear-up landing. When the aircraft touched the ground, it slid for about [...] before coming to a halt. There were no fatalities among the 32 occupants (five crew and 27 passengers). Accident investigators established the probable cause as the disconnecting of the articulated control rod of the propeller governor {{due to the lack of}} <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> on the governor spindle, and due to the nut of the ball joint of the control spindle having been unscrewed by force.|$|E

The nut is torqued properly and then, if the slot is not aligned with {{the hole in the}} fastener, the nut is rotated forward to the nearest slot. The nut is then secured with <b>a</b> <b>split</b> pin/cotter <b>pin,</b> R-clip or safety wire. It is a positive locking device.|$|R
5000|$|The EKG is a 3.7 L V6 version {{built in}} Detroit, Michigan. It {{displaces}} 226.0 cubic inches (3701 cc). The bore is 3.66 in and stroke is 3.57 in. It is a 90° V engine like the V8, with SOHC 2-valve heads. It utilizes a counter-rotating balance shaft mounted between the cylinder banks {{to deal with}} vibration problems of the 90-degree V6 design, as well as use <b>a</b> 30-degree <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> crankshaft to fire the cylinders every 120 degrees.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin,</b> {{also known}} in the United States as a cotter pin or cotter key, is a metal {{fastener}} with two tines that are bent during installation, similar to a staple or rivet. Typically made of thick wire with a half-circular cross section, split pins come in multiple sizes and types.|$|E
5000|$|The British {{definition}} of [...] "cotter pin" [...] {{is equivalent to}} U.S. term [...] "cotter", {{which can be a}} cause for confusion when companies of both countries work together. There are signs that manufacturers and stockists are increasingly listing both names together to avoid confusion; this led to the term split cotter sometimes being used for <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
50|$|This split {{is similar}} to the Big five, but is made {{slightly}} harder because there is another pin in the back row, creating <b>a</b> <b>split</b> with two <b>pins</b> on one side and four pins on the other. The split should be made with a drastic curve on the back end of the lane, so that the ball can convert the four pins and have the frontmost pin take the two remaining pins out.|$|R
500|$|Swiftsures {{bombardment}} of Moen was particularly unsuccessful. The initial rounds fired by her guns landed {{well away from}} their targets, and attempts to correct her gunfire led to a further deterioration in accuracy. Her gunnery officer judged that the ship's fire control equipment was defective, and ordered the [...] gun turrets to fire under local control. This also proved unsuccessful as the gunners were unable to sight targets on the shore. After sailing closer to Moen, the ship attempted to engage Japanese positions with several of her [...] guns. However, the ammunition for these weapons was fitted with proximity fuses intended for use against aircraft, and exploded in the palm trees above her targets. As the fallen foliage camouflaged the Japanese positions further attacks were ineffective. A subsequent investigation found that <b>a</b> faulty <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> {{had fallen out of}} Swiftsures Admiralty Fire Control Table, most likely due to concussion from the initial shots, causing it to provide greatly inaccurate results to the guns. After the bombardment ended at 11:10 am, the ships involved rejoined the carriers.|$|R
25|$|Brake pads are {{available}} with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting, or brake shoe, with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are {{held in place by}} <b>a</b> metal <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim. The rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim. Larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force, but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.|$|R

The 5.2 V10 used in the S6 and S8 is different in several important aspects, namely a less robust crankshaft with <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> design, cast aluminum pistons, and a traditional wet-sump oiling system, as well as differences in the valvetrain - all of which, combined, result in the much higher RPM red line and specific power output of the Gallardo and R8) ...|$|E
50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|E
50|$|The No. 5 Mk. 1 was {{the first}} version. The {{explosive}} was filled through a small circular plug on the upper half, the detonator assembly was inserted into the centertube of the mills through {{the bottom of the}} grenade body via the baseplug, the striker and spring is held in tension through the middle by the lever that was held down on the lugs (ears) located {{on the top of the}} grenade body via <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> and ring called the safety pin/ pullring. It was first issued in May 1915 and entered general issue when mass production caught up a year later in 1916.|$|E
50|$|Most recently, 817 Squadron has {{provided}} aircraft for Operation Sumatra Assist and Operation Sumatra Assist II, which were Australia's {{contribution to the}} humanitarian effort in Indonesia {{as a result of}} the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the subsequent 2005 Nias-Simeulue earthquake. During the latter operation, one of the two Seakings (Shark 02) embarked on HMAS Kanimbla, crashed on the Island of Nias with the loss of nine personnel. The accident occurred as a result of a series of maintenance errors, specifically the incorrect re-fitting of <b>a</b> nut and <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> during maintenance performed on the aircraft some two months before the crash. Deficiencies in maintenance practices, training, support and logistics operations within the Navy were also identified as contributing factors. Following the accident, several major changes were made to maintenance and safety management practices at 817 Squadron.|$|R

5000|$|A clevis {{fastener}} is a three-piece fastener system {{consisting of}} a clevis, clevis pin, and tang. The clevis is a U-shaped piece that has holes {{at the end of}} the prongs to accept the clevis pin. The clevis pin is similar to a bolt, but is only partially threaded or unthreaded with a cross-hole for <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin.</b> The tang is a piece that fits in the space within the clevis and is held in place by the clevis pin. [...] The combination of a simple clevis fitted with a pin is commonly called a shackle, although a clevis and pin is only one of the many forms a shackle may take.|$|E
50|$|Overalls, Denim were {{a version}} of Battle Dress {{intended}} for working clothing, and were produced from khaki coloured cotton denim, with several manufacturer's variants. It was issued a size larger as {{it was intended to}} be worn over the regular uniform. Buttons were fixed through small holes in the denim material and kept in place by <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin.</b> The buttons could be easily removed for laundering which, due to denim overalls being workwear, was more frequent than for serge battledress. 90,000 sets of denim overalls were issued to the Local Defence Volunteers (later the Home Guard) as their main uniform, in the weeks following their establishment in May 1940. Three months later, supplies of overalls were so depleted that the standard serge Battledress began to be issued to the Home Guard instead and in December, it was announced that Battledress would fully replace Home Guard overalls as soon as supplies were available.|$|E
5000|$|... 1962 saw the {{introduction}} of the Buick Special, which offered a new 90° V6 with uneven firing intervals that was derived from—and shared some parts commonality with—a small Buick V8 engine of the period. To save design time and expense, it was built much like a V8 that had two cylinders chopped off. The combination of a 90° V-angle with only three crank pins—set at 120° apart, with opposing cylinders sharing a crank pin as most V8 engines do—the cylinders fired alternatively at 90 and 150° of crankshaft rotation. This uneven firing caused harmonic vibrations in the drive train that were perceived as a rough-running engine by the buyers. GM sold the engine tooling to Kaiser-Jeep in 1967; later, {{as a result of the}} 1973 oil crisis, GM repurchased the tooling in 1974. In 1977, Buick introduced <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> crankshaft to implement an even-fire version of this engine in which cylinders fired consistently every 120°.|$|E
50|$|The low {{aspect ratio}} wings were {{parallel}} edged and almost square tipped, with the thin airfoil section {{typical of the}} time. They were built around two spars, each a spruce-ash-spruce sandwich, and the profile was formed with mixed spruce and ash ribs. Both spars fitted into sockets formed by two transverse fuselage struts, but the rear socket was made oversize and the spar attached with <b>a</b> bolt and <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> to allow movement, as the Dyott was laterally controlled by wing warping. The main in-flight aerodynamic forces on each wing were carried by pairs of cables to the front spar from the forward skid mounting point, an arrangement that caused some concern over the transfer of landing loads to the wing. Each wing was braced from above with four wires, two to each spar, from an inverted V steel pylon {{just in front of}} the cockpit. A short vertical steel post below the rear of the cockpit carried pairs of wing warping wires to the rear spar.|$|R
50|$|Crow is a gold-colored puppet {{composed}} of, {{among other}} things, a soap dish eye cowl, ping pong ball eyes, <b>a</b> <b>split</b> plastic bowling <b>pin</b> mouth, a lacrosse face mask webbing, and Tupperware panels for the body. The original puppet for Crow {{was built by}} Joel Hodgson in a single night before filming the pilot episode. At the beginning of Season One, the puppet was redesigned and built by Trace Beaulieu, adding a second Tupperware tray to Crow's torso as well as movable eyes. Another version of Crow {{is used for the}} theater segments. This version is painted flat black. Of all the bots, Crow was the least changed from his KTMA incarnation to when the series became nationally broadcast. He {{is the only one who}} retained his general primary color.|$|R

50|$|A brass {{fastener}}, brad, paper fastener or {{split pin}} is a stationery item used for securing multiple {{sheets of paper}} together.A patent of the fastener was issued in 1866 to George W McGill.The fastener is inserted into punched holes in the stack of paper, and the leaves, or tines, of the legs are separated and bent over to secure the paper. This holds the pin in place and the sheets of paper together. For few sheets of paper, holes can be made using the sharp end of the fastener. <b>A</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> {{may be used in}} place of staples, but they are more commonly used in situations where rotation around the joint is desirable. This lends split pins to use in mobile paper and cardboard models.It is shaped somewhat like a nail with a round head and flat, split length. Brass fasteners are made of a soft metal such as brass and the tines are typically of two slightly different lengths. This allows easy separation of the tines.A brass fastener is similar in design and function to the mechanical counterpart split pins.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the results from the}} development process of a ceramic dental filling material based on calcium aluminate cement. The main focus of the work concerns dimensional changes during setting, hardening and curing and the understanding of the factors controlling the dimensional stability of the system. A range of compositions for research purposes and the composition of Doxadent – a dental product launched on the Swedish market in October 2000 – were evaluated. Furthermore hardness characteristics, flexural strength, porosity and microstructure studies are presented. The studies of dimensional changes led to a thorough investigation of the measuring devices used and their relevance. <b>A</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> expander technique, very simple in function, has been evaluated and improved. The technique is considered to be adequate for detecting dimensional stability in restrained samples, thus mimicking the case for real fillings in most tooth cavities. The dimensional changes in the calcium-aluminate based cement system are mainly controlled by the grain size, the exact composition and the compaction degree. The expansion of the calcium-aluminate cement system was in the early work decrease...|$|E

40|$|Bamboo {{is viewed}} as a {{sustainable}} and highly renewable material that may be grown in any temperate climate zone. Interest in the engineering properties of bamboo and the use of bamboo in engineered construction is growing. Although often having superior mechanical properties than readily available sawn timber, bamboo, being largely an unidirectional fibrous material, is very susceptible to longitudinal splitting. Despite being the dominant limit state in many applications, very little previous work has addressed the characterization of bamboo splitting failure. The present research focuses on the development of <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> test method for characterizing the splitting strength of bamboo culms. The proposed split pin test uses a full culm section test, thereby eliminating some of the complexities of partial culm tests. Results of a pilot study of the split pin test having similar specimens with different split pin diameters yielded consistent results and variations less than that of the previously standardized direct shear test. In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed test method, a series of tests was performed on samples of Tre Gai (Bambusa stenostachya Hackel) bamboo. © 2010 ASCE...|$|E

Tell tale marks on the inner surface of the fork of the link assembly suggest that the bolt connecting the lever and the link assembly of the control linkage port PFCU was present prior to the accident. Evidences also suggest that this joint has experienced compressive force due to impact leading to shearing off of the bolt and subsequent dislodgement of all the attaching parts. Certain damages were seen on the bolts and/or nuts of control linkage starboard PFCU and engine throttle control linkage in question, which probably have been caused by <b>split</b> <b>pins.</b> This means that <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> were present in these bolts at some given time during their service life.
