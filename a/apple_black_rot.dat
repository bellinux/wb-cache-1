Deep learning, the latest breakthrough in computer vision, is promising for fine-grained disease severity classification, as the method avoids the labor-intensive feature engineering and threshold-based segmentation. Using the <b>apple</b> <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> images in the PlantVillage dataset, which are further annotated by botanists with four severity stages as ground truth, a series of deep convolutional neural networks are trained to diagnose {{the severity of the}} disease.

The best model is the deep VGG 16 model trained with transfer learning, which yields an overall accuracy of 90. 4 % on the hold-out test set.

Since there is a dearth of availability of resistance to <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> disease in B. oleracea (C genome), therefore exploration of A and B genomes was inevitable as they have been reported to be potential reservoirs of gene(s) for resistance to <b>black</b> <b>rot.</b> To utilize these sources, interspecific hybrid and backcross progeny (B 1) were generated between cauliflower “Pusa Sharad” and Ethiopian mustard “NPC- 9 ” employing in vitro embryo rescue technique. Direct ovule culture method was better than siliqua culture under different temperature regime periods. Hybridity testing of F 1 inter-specific plants was carried out using co-dominant SSR marker and Brassica B and C genome-specific (DB and DC) primers. Meiosis in the di-genomic (BCC) interspecific hybrid of B. oleracea botrytis group (2 n = 18, CC) × B. carinata (2 n = 4 x = 34, BBCC) was higly disorganized and cytological analysis of pollen mother cells revealed chromosomes 2 n = 26 at metaphase-I.

However, there are no studies about the status (occurrence or absence) of these important diseases in KSA generally or in Taif region has been reported. Therefore, the resent study was aimed to use the modern molecular genetics tools to report the status of the Botryosphaeria spp and its associated diseases in Taif.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine if organic apple growers could minimize losses to summer diseases on apples by using cultural management strategies and/or regular sprays of liquid lime sulfur (LLS). LLS is an OMRI-approved fungicide. Diseases of concern were <b>black</b> <b>rot,</b> flyspeck, and sooty blotch. The latter two diseases appear as dark-colored blemishes on apple fruit surfaces. Although these blemishes do not directly impact edibility, apple with these surface blemishes are not acceptable to fresh fruit buyers. <b>Black</b> <b>rot</b> is a fruit decay that makes fruit inedible, and fruit with <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> can add off-flavors if they are use for juice. During 2010, field trials {{were conducted}} in a Jonamac orchard at the Geneva Experiment Station and in a block containing the cultivars Royal Court and Cameo at the Hudson Valley Lab in Highland. Trees in replicated plots received either cultural controls alone, treatment with LLS alone, {{or a combination of}} cultural controls and LLS treatments. Cultural controls included removal of fruitlet mummies that can harbor <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> inoculum and hand-thinning of fruit in June followed by light summer pruning to enhance rapid drying following rains and dews and to allow improved spray coverage. Apples were harvested at commercial maturity and evaluated for disease. Both LLS and cultural controls reduced disease incidence and severity of sooty blotch and flyspeck at both test locations, and both approaches reduced the incidence of <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> at Geneva. Neither LLS, cultural controls, nor the combination of the two approaches were consistently effective against <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> in the Hudson Valley where hot humid summers favor this disease. At Geneva, fruit treated with LLS alone or in combination with cultural controls had no more summer diseases than fruit treated with conventional fungicides. However, conventional fungicide programs generally out-performed LLS against summer diseases in the Hudson Valley. This experiment verifies that LLS sprays can be used to control flyspeck and sooty blotch on organic apple farms, but neither LLS nor the cultural controls that we tested will control <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> on cultivars such as Royal Court that are highly susceptible to this disease...|$|R

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>rot</b> {{caused by}} Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Pam.)

Since there are limited sources of resistance to <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> in B. oleracea (C genome Brassica), exploration of A and B genomes of Brassica was planned as these {{were thought to be}} potential reservoirs of <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> resistance gene(s). In our search for new gene(s) for <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> resistance, F 2 mapping population was developed in Brassica carinata (BBCC) by crossing NPC- 17, a susceptible genotype with NPC- 9, a resistant genotype. Out of 364 Intron length polymorphic markers and microsatellite primers used in this study, 41 distinguished the parental lines. However, resistant and susceptible bulks could be distinguished by three markers At 1 g 70610, SSR Na 14 -G 02 and At 1 g 71865 which were used for genotyping of F 2 mapping population. These markers were placed along the resistance gene, according to order, covering a distance of 36. 30 cM. Intron length polymorphic markers At 1 g 70610 and At 1 g 71865 were found to be linked to <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> resistance locus (Xca 1 bc) at 6. 2 and 12. 8 cM distance, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Black</b> <b>rot</b> is a {{destructive}} bacterial disease causing large yield and quality losses in Brassica oleracea. To detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> resistance, we performed whole-genome resequencing of two cabbage parental lines and genome-wide SNP identification using the recently published B. oleracea genome sequences as reference. RESULTS: Approximately 11. 5 Gb of sequencing data was produced from each parental line. Reference genome-guided mapping and SNP calling revealed 674, 521 SNPs {{between the two}} cabbage lines, {{with an average of}} one SNP per 662. 5 bp. Among 167 dCAPS markers derived from candidate SNPs, 117 (70. 1 %) were validated as bona fide SNPs showing polymorphism between the parental lines. We then improved the resolution of a previous genetic map by adding 103 markers including 87 SNP-based dCAPS markers. The new map composed of 368 markers and covers 1467. 3 cM with an average interval of 3. 88 cM between adjacent markers. We evaluated <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> resistance in the mapping population in three independent inoculation tests using F₂:₃ progenies and identified one major QTL and three minor QTLs. CONCLUSION: We report successful utilization of whole-genome resequencing for large-scale SNP identification and development of molecular markers for genetic map construction. In addition, we identified novel QTLs for <b>black</b> <b>rot</b> resistance.
