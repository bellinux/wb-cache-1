5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a drag and drop inventory.|$|E
5|$|Banished is a city-building {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed by Shining Rock Software. It was released for Microsoft Windows on February 18, 2014. The game focuses on careful resource management <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> as an isolated and growing society.

Banished received mixed reviews on release, with reviewers praising graphics and difficulty early in the game, but criticizing a lack of feedback for player actions and lower emphasis on survival as the city grows.|$|E

5|$|Dig Me Out is {{the third}} studio album by the American rock band Sleater-Kinney, {{released}} on April 8, 1997, by Kill Rock Stars. The album was produced by John Goodmanson and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. Dig Me Out marked the debut of Janet Weiss, who is the band's longest serving and current drummer. The music on the record was influenced by traditional rock and roll bands, while the lyrics deal with issues of heartbreak <b>and</b> <b>survival.</b> The album cover is an homage to The Kinks' 1965 album The Kink Kontroversy.|$|E
5|$|Global {{warming is}} {{expected}} to have a number of negative long-term ecological impacts on the region, including drought, increased forest fires, forest degradation to drought and disease, and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs. The distribution <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as animals that are specifically adapted to those environments, will also be adversely affected. Glaciers are also expected to recede due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation.

In Versus Mode, two players can fight against each other locally. The PlayStation port also features Training Mode, where players can practice moves and combos against non-aggressive computer opponents, <b>and</b> <b>Survival</b> Mode, where players fight against endless waves of teams.|$|E
5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable.

40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) {{is common}} in hemodialysis patients and predicts a poor prognosis. We conducted a prospective cohort study to identify risk factors for PAD including skin perfusion pressure (SPP) in hemodialysis patients. The cohort included 373 hemodialysis patients among 548 patients who received hemodialysis at Oyokyo Kidney Research Institute, Hirosaki, Japan from August 2008 to December 2010. The endpoints were lower limb survival (peripheral angioplasty or amputation events) <b>and</b> overall <b>survival</b> of 2 years. Our results showed that < 70 [*]mmHg SPP was a poor prognosis for the lower limb <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> overall <b>survival.</b> We also identified age, history of cardiovascular disease, presence of diabetes mellitus, smoking history, and SPP <[*] 70 [*]mmHg as independent risk factors for lower limb <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> overall <b>survival.</b> Then, we constructed risk criteria using the significantly independent risk factors. We can clearly stratify lower limb <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> overall <b>survival</b> of the hemodialysis patients into 3 groups. Although the observation period is short, we conclude that SPP value {{has the potential to}} be a risk factor that predicts both lower limb <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> the prognosis of hemodialysis patients...|$|R

40|$|Background In trials {{designed}} to evaluate new therapies for hematologic malignancies, end points such as leukemia-free survival {{are often used}} as surrogates for overall survival in acute leukemia. We aimed to assess whether leukemia-free survival is an acceptable statistical surrogate for overall survival when applied to remission maintenance therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. Design and Methods Data were analyzed from a randomized Phase III trial of remission maintenance immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride plus low-dose interleukin- 2 versus no treatment in adults with acute myeloid leukemia. A two-stage surrogate validation model was applied in which correlations between Kaplan-Meier estimates of leukemia-free <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> overall <b>survival,</b> <b>and</b> between log hazard ratios reflecting treatment effects were analyzed. Country of patient enrollment was the unit of analysis. Results Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 36, 48, and 60 months <b>and</b> leukemia-free <b>survival</b> at 24 months were reasonably correlated (R 2 ranging from 0. 44 to 0. 84) both for the overall (n= 320) and first complete remission (n= 261) populations. The effects of histamine dihydrochloride/ interleukin- 2 on log hazard ratios for leukemia-free <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> overall <b>survival</b> were well correlated (R 2 = 0. 88 - 0. 93). Conclusions The significant correlations between overall <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> the surrogate end point (leukemia-free <b>survival)</b> <b>and</b> between the effect of histamine dihydrochloride/interleukin- 2 on leukemia-free <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> overall <b>survival</b> satisfy the two-stage surrogate validation model. © 2011 Ferrata Storti Foundation.

5|$|Tomb Raider is {{presented}} in third-person perspective. Players {{take control of the}} series lead character Lara Croft. The game uses an interconnected hub-and-spoke model that combines action-adventure, exploration, <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> mechanics.

Many of the players moves are carried over from the previous games created by Crystal Dynamics, with some tweaks added, such as incorporating elements of stealth gameplay. Quick Time Events are scattered at regular intervals throughout the game, often appearing at crucial or fast-moving points in the game's plot, such as extracting a shard of metal, and escaping a collapsing cave.|$|E
