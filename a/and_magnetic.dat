The construction process was defined by: (1) a first stage using laterites with low Sr content <b>and</b> low <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility values; (2) a second stage using laterites with low Sr content <b>and</b> high <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility values; (3) a third stage using laterites with high Sr content <b>and</b> high <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility values; (4) a fourth stage using laterites with low Sr content <b>and</b> low <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility values; <b>and</b> (5) fifth stage using laterites with high Sr content <b>and</b> low <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility values (Figures 6 and 8). Almost all of the buildings in the Koh Ker monuments belong to the first three stages, with only three and two buildings belonging to the fourth and fifth stages, respectively. Buildings belonging to the fifth stage remained unfinished.|$|R

5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave {{as if they}} were free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, <b>and</b> <b>magnetic</b> moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E
