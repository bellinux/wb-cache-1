40|$|In 1988 I became {{interested}} in the relationship between the ideas of Confucius and those of Mencius. I noticed that what appeared in one form or other in discussions of this relationship was the unelucidated notion of ‘true succession’. 1 The relation has some interesting features. Nietzsche probably had no true successor and Wittgenstein was not his own true successor. Although Marx was <b>a</b> true <b>successor</b> of Hegel and Lenin was <b>a</b> true <b>successor</b> of Marx, Lenin was not <b>a</b> true <b>successor</b> of Hegel. Thus true succession is not transitive. Zeno was <b>a</b> true <b>successor</b> of Pythagoras, but so too was Parmenides. Thus true succession is a one-to-many relation. In Williams 1988 I argued that Mencius was not <b>a</b> true <b>successor</b> of Confucius. One argument I opposed is that the Ta Hsửeh (the authorship of which is obscure) and the Chung Yung are reliable expressions of the ideas of Confucius and since Mencius was <b>a</b> true <b>successor</b> of the author of these two works, it follows that Mencius was <b>a</b> true <b>successor</b> of Confucius (Lu 1983, 81). I observed that this argument is invalid becaus...|$|R

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} how the various paternalistic leadership styles practiced by predecessors influence the attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control of successors in family firms {{and the extent}} to which these factors influence <b>a</b> <b>successor’s</b> perceptions of the quality of the succession process. Stemming from the theory of planned behaviour, our conceptual model integrates previous findings into a comprehensive, two-sided analysis, capturing factors associated with the outgoing and incoming generation. We use the central construct of paternalism to formalise more accurate scenarios of <b>a</b> <b>successor’s</b> intentions and behaviours related to the transfer of leadership. This study serves as a foundation for future empirical studies investigating the effects of paternalism in the family business context...|$|R
