5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking.

5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among <b>African</b> <b>women.</b> By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{exploitation}} style documentaries {{purported to}} show actual events but were instead staged, elaborate ruses. The most prominent {{of which was}} Ingagi (1931), a film which claimed to show a ritual where <b>African</b> <b>women</b> were given over to gorillas as sex slaves, but instead was mostly filmed in Los Angeles using local blacks in place of natives. Douglas Fairbanks mocked the phoniness of many pre-Code documentaries in his parody Around the World in 80 Minutes with Douglas Fairbanks, in one scene of which he filmed himself wrestling a stuffed tiger doll, then a tiger-skin rug. Opposing these films was the travelogue which was shown before features {{and served as a}} short saccharine form of cinematic tourism.|$|E

In the first round, they were supposed to play Nigeria but withdrew from the tournament. They were supposed to compete in the 2010 <b>African</b> <b>Women</b> U-20 Championship Qualifying competition meeting Togo in the first round, but Togo earned a walk over win against Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone eventually withdrew from the competition. The announcement was made a week after the under-17 lost 0–3 to Gambia.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Florida was {{transferred}} back to Spain which lured Americans with cheap land. A former loyalist to Britain who left South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, a planter and slave trader named Zephaniah Kingsley {{seized the opportunity}} and built a plantation named Laurel Grove near what is now Doctors Lake, close {{to the west bank}} of the St. Johns River, south of where Orange Park is today. Three years later, Kingsley took a trip to Cuba and purchased a 13-year-old Wolof girl named Anna Madgigine Jai. She became his common-law wife, and managed Laurel Grove while Kingsley traveled and conducted business. The plantation grew citrus and sea island cotton (Gossypium barbadense). In 1814, they moved to a larger plantation on Fort George Island, where they lived for 25 years, and owned several other plantations and homesteads in what is today Jacksonville and another on Drayton Island at the north end of Lake George. Kingsley later married three other freed women in a polygamous relationship; Spanish-controlled Florida allowed interracial marriages, and white landowners such as James Erwin, George Clarke, Francisco Sánchez, John Fraser, and Francis Richard, Jr.—early settlers along the river—all were married to or in extramarital relationships with <b>African</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E

5|$|In total, South Africa {{have played}} 170 ODIs. Mignon du Preez {{is the most}} capped player, having {{appeared}} in 106 ODIs and the leading run-scorer with 2,767 runs, although her batting average is lower than a number of her compatriots. One of these players, Johmari Logtenberg, ended her career {{with an average of}} 38.54. Her total of 153 not out against the Netherlands in 2007 is the highest score in women ODI cricket by a South African, and the 13th-highest overall. Du Preez, Logtenberg and Laura Wolvaardt jointly hold the record for the most centuries scored by a South African woman with two. Dane van Niekerk has claimed more ODI wickets than any other South <b>African</b> <b>women,</b> having taken 120. Shabnim Ismail has the best return by a South African bowler, having claimed six wickets in an innings in a Women's World Cup qualifying match against the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Sierra Leone has a Sierra Leone women's {{national}} under-17 football team. They {{were supposed}} {{to compete in the}} <b>African</b> <b>Women</b> U-17 Championship Qualifying Tournament 2010. Togo won the first round because Sierra Leone withdrew from the competition. They competed in the CAF qualifiers for the FIFA U-17 World Cup that will be held in Azerbaijan in September 2012. They did not advance out of their region. The team was supposed to play the Gambia women's national under-17 football team in a qualifying match for the 2012 U-17 Qualifying Tournament. Sierra Leone lost the first leg in Banjul, Gambia 0–3. The return match was delayed for 24 hours. The team's head coach attributed the loss to poor refereeing. The game against Gambia was the country's first junior national international match. The second match was one by Sierra Leone 3–1. Gambia won the first match in 3-0 in a game played in Banjul. The return match was delayed in for 24 hours and played in Makeni. Gambia beat Sierra Leone to qualify for the final round with an aggregate score of 4-3.|$|E
5|$|The {{gender roles}} {{of men and}} women, as well as societies' conceptions of the {{associated}} concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success. As seen in Things Fall Apart, Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control ‘his’ women is inextricably connected to his dignity. Thus, women are automatically disenfranschised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society. It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers. Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity. Womanism is “an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women” that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of <b>African</b> <b>women.</b> As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably {{from the work of}} African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe’s women some agency and prominence.|$|E
