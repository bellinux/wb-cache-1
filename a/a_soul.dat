5|$|Enrichto's role in Pharsalia {{has often}} been {{discussed}} by classicists and literary scholars, with many arguing that she serves as a antithesis and counterpart to Virgil's Cumaean Sibyl, a pious prophetess who appears in his work the Aeneid.

During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed the way {{they looked at the}} songs they had initially written.

5|$|Roger Sale {{believes}} Andersen {{expressed his}} feelings {{of social and}} sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds.

Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply different. He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority.|$|E
