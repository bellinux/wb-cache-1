5|$|Literacy {{began to}} decline, perhaps dramatically, during the socio-political Crisis of the Third Century.

Julian, the only emperor after {{the conversion of}} Constantine to reject Christianity, banned Christians from teaching the Classical curriculum, {{on the grounds that}} they might corrupt the minds of youth.|$|E

5|$|Moonlight Madness is a {{video game}} for the ZX Spectrum home computer, {{published}} in 1986 by Bubble Bus Software. It is an arcade adventure game in which players control a boy scout.

This requires the player to traverse the mansion's rooms while avoiding hazards such <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> house servants and fatal falls.|$|E

5|$|The {{perception}} of sharks <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> animals has been popularized by publicity {{given to a}} few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the Jaws film series. Jaws author Peter Benchley, as well as Jaws director Steven Spielberg later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.|$|E

5|$|The {{populations of}} P. labiata in Los Baños and in Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{different}} environments: Los Baños is a low-lying tropical rainforest where there are many species of spiders, {{some of which are}} especially dangerous to P. labiata; and Sagada is at higher altitude, with pine-forest and fewer species of spiders, none of which are <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> to P. labiata. The Los Baños variant has a slightly wider repertoire of tactics.|$|E
5|$|After the Declaration of Independence, Congress {{continued}} {{to manage the}} war effort. Adams served on military committees, including an appointment to the Board of War in 1777. He advocated paying bonuses to Continental Army soldiers {{to encourage them to}} reenlist {{for the duration of the}} war. He called for harsh state legislation to punish Loyalists—Americans who {{continued to}} support the British crown—who Adams believed were <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> to American liberty as British soldiers. In Massachusetts, more than 300 Loyalists were banished and their property confiscated. After the war, Adams opposed allowing Loyalists to return to Massachusetts, fearing that they would work to undermine republican government.|$|E
5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a road crossing the Pennines, Snake Pass has several dangerous bends and blind summits.

5|$|Galapagos {{sharks are}} active predators often {{encountered}} in large groups. They feed mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods; larger individuals {{have a much}} more varied diet, consuming other sharks, marine iguanas, sea lions, and even garbage. As in other requiem sharks, reproduction is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 416 pups every 2 to 3 years. The juveniles tend to remain in shallow water to avoid predation by the adults. Galapagos sharks are bold and have behaved aggressively towards humans, and are thus regarded <b>as</b> <b>dangerous.</b> The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as near threatened, as it has a slow reproductive rate and there is heavy fishing pressure across its range.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of}} the Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Many Sunnis (who {{compromise}} {{a substantial}} minority) support {{the government and}} see the Thirteen <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> revolutionaries that would destabilize the country should they succeed in toppling the monarchy. Government hardliners and Sunni political groups often call for harsh and no compromise approach, including calling for no pardons and death sentences. To their many supporters (in Bahrain and abroad) however, the Thirteen are heroes and prisoners of conscience jailed unfairly for nothing more than calling for democracy. Their faces appear daily in banners during protests.|$|E

5|$|Most of Demosthenes' major orations were {{directed}} against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since 357BC, when Philip seized Amphipolis and Pydna, Athens had been formally {{at war with the}} Macedonians. In 352BC, Demosthenes characterised Philip as the very worst enemy of his city; his speech presaged the fierce attacks that Demosthenes would launch against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years. A year later he criticised those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned that he was <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> as the king of Persia.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{research}} on the Polish Underground State was restricted, largely because the communist People's Republic of Poland {{did not wish to}} fully acknowledge the role of the non-communist resistance. During the first postwar Stalinist years, efforts to explore this topic were regarded <b>as</b> <b>dangerous,</b> bordering on illegal. Research into the events occurring in the Soviet-annexed territories in the 1939–1941 period was particularly difficult. The limited research devoted to the Underground State that did take place was done mainly by Polish émigré historians living in the West. The communist state downplayed the importance of the non-communist resistance movements, while the communist movement (Armia Ludowa) was emphasized as being of primary importance; in fact, the opposite was true. The absence of research by Polish scholars, along with obstacles presented to foreign scholars seeking access to source material in communist Poland, contributed to a situation in which there was virtually no discussion by Western scholars of one of Europe's largest resistance movements—the non-communist Polish resistance movement. The bulk of Western research centred on the much smaller French Resistance (la Résistance).|$|E

Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left in a lab, where she is infected by an exocel.

5|$|In 1992, Boisselier {{converted}} to Raëlism, a UFO religion {{founded by the}} French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël, in 1973. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she felt strongly that he was completely honest and joined his movement. She had left her husband, alleging violent behavior, shortly before her conversion; afterwards, owing to her involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child. Boisselier believed that religious intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child's custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child converted. In the 1990s, Raëlism was seen <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> and viewed with disdain in France, resulting in loss of employment for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.|$|E
