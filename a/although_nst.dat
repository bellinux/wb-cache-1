40|$|ABSTRACT: LPG 2 (a gene {{involved}} in lipophosphoglycan assembly) encodes the Golgi GDP-Man transporter of the protozoan parasite Leishmania {{and is a}} defining member of a new family of eukaryotic nucleotide-sugar transporters (NSTs). <b>Although</b> <b>NST</b> activities are widespread, mammalian cells lack a GDP-Man NST, thereby providing an ideal heterologous system for probing the LPG 2 structure and activity. LPG 2 expression constructs introduced into either mammalian cells or a Leishmania lpg 2 - mutant conferred GDP-Man, GDP-Ara, and GDP-Fuc (in Leishmania only) uptake in isolated microsomes. LPG 2 is the first NST {{to be associated with}} multiple substrate specificities. Uptake activity showed latency, exhibited an antiport mechanism of transport with GMP, and was susceptible to the anion transport inhibitor DIDS. The apparent Km for GDP-Man uptake was similar in transfected mammalian cells (12. 2 íM) or Leishmania (6. 9 íM). Given the evolutionary distance between protozoans and vertebrates, these data suggest that LPG 2 functions autonomously to provide transporter activity. Using epitope-tagged LPG 2 proteins, we showed the existence of hexameric LPG 2 complexes by immunoprecipitation experiments, glycerol gradient centrifugation, pore-limited native gel electrophoresis, and cross-linking experiments. This provides strong biochemical evidence for a multimeric complex of NSTs, a finding with important implications to the structure and specificity of NSTs in both Leishmania and other organisms.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nocistatin (NST) is a neuropeptide {{generated}} from cleavage of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) precursor. Evidence {{has been presented}} that NST acts as a functional antagonist of N/OFQ, <b>although</b> <b>NST</b> receptor and transduction pathways {{have not yet been}} identified. We previously showed that N/OFQ inhibited [(3) H] 5 -hydroxytryptamine ([(3) H] 5 -HT) release from mouse cortical synaptosomes via activation of NOP receptors. We now investigate whether NST regulates [(3) H] 5 -HT release in the same preparation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mouse and rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes in superfusion, preloaded with [(3) H] 5 -HT and stimulated with 1 min pulses of 10 mM KCl, were used. KEY RESULTS: Bovine NST (b-NST) inhibited the K(+) -induced [(3) H] 5 -HT release, displaying similar efficacy but lower potency than N/OFQ. b-NST action underwent concentration-dependent and time-dependent desensitization, and was not prevented either by the NOP receptor antagonist [Nphe(1) Arg(14),Lys(15) ]N/OFQ(1 - 13) -NH(2) (UFP- 101) or by the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. Contrary to N/OFQ, b-NST reduced [(3) H] 5 -HT release from synaptosomes obtained from NOP receptor knockout mice. However, both N/OFQ and NST were ineffective in synaptosomes pre-treated with the G(i/o) protein inhibitor, Pertussis toxin. NST-N/OFQ interactions were also investigated. Co-application of maximal concentrations of both peptides did not result in additive effects, whereas pre-application of maximal b-NST concentrations partially attenuated N/OFQ inhibition. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that b-NST inhibits [(3) H] 5 -HT release via activation of G(i/o) protein linked pathways, not involving classical opioid receptors and the NOP receptor. The present data strengthen the view that b-NST is, per se, a biologically active peptide endowed with agonist activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of UCP 1 in vertebrates – a summary This thesis unravels the {{evolution of}} UCP 1, a crucial protein for heat generation recruited during adaptive NST. In eutherian mammals UCP 1 uncouples the respiratory chain from ATP synthesis to dissipate proton motive force as heat {{but the question of}} when the protein emerged during evolution and what its original function was, has not been resolved. In the initial studies we show that standard molecular techniques are insufficient to detect UCP 1 (Jastroch et al. 2004 a, Chapter I) but the phylogeny of UCPs suggests an ancient origin of UCP 1 (Jastroch et al. 2004 b, Chapter II). The presence of UCP 1 in fish demonstrates the emergence of UCP 1 before the divergence of ray-finned and lobe-finned vertebrate lineages 420 MYA (Jastroch et al. 2005, Chapter III). UCP 1 gene regulation in the common carp, Cyprinus carpio, indicates a physiological role other than heat production but biochemical studies suggests that carp UCP 1 is a functional uncoupling protein with broadly the same activatory and inhibitory characteristics as eutherian UCP 1 (Jastroch et al. 2007, Chapter IV). Studies in marsupials, which separated from eutherians 150 MYA, demonstrate that in these species transcriptional control targets UCP 1 expression to adipose tissue (Jastroch et al. in preparation, Chapter V). In the gray short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica, UCP 1 is transiently expressed and restricted to the early development, similar to observations in larger eutherian neonates. In the fat-tailed dunnart, Sminthopsis crassicaudata, UCP 1 is expressed during adulthood and is elevated in response to cold exposure. Although these experiments suggest the presence of UCP 1 -mediated NST, UCP 1 -dependent thermogenesis in the animal has yet to be shown in marsupials. However, the identification of a BAT-like tissue provides the molecular basis to reinvestigate adaptive NST in marsupials. In the phylogenetically ancient afrotherian rock elephant shrew, Elephantulus myurus, a species that diverged from modern eutherians about 100 MYA, we demonstrate the presence of functional BAT (Mzilikazi, Jastroch, Meyer, and Klingenspor, submitted, Chapter VI). <b>Although</b> <b>NST,</b> BAT and UCP 1 are found in E. myurus, NST {{does not appear to be}} adaptive as demonstrated in modern eutherians. While adaptivity of NST seems not to be required in our experiments, the significance of NST during the seasons of the mild natural habitats of South Africa remains to be investigated in further studies. The focus of the thesis is {{the evolution of}} UCP 1 but I also investigated if UCP 3 might have a thermogenic role in the yellow-footed Antechinus, Antechinus flavipes, a marsupial lacking BAT (Jastroch et al., in preparation, Chapter VII). A thermogenic function of UCP 3, as found for UCP 1, can be excluded by measurements of uncoupling activity in myotubular mitochondria. However, I found evidence that mild uncoupling mediated by the ANT (adenine nucleotide translocase) occurs in myotubular mitochondria of cold-acclimated A. flavipes and may play a role in protection from oxidative stress during cold exposure. The search for UCPs in vertebrates has resulted in the identification of UCP 2 and UCP 3 in different vertebrate groups and might assist to resolve their physiological roles. By comparing phylogenetic branch lengths and gene regulation, I suggest that in contrast to UCP 1, the function of UCP 2 and UCP 3 may be well conserved in all vertebrates. Finally, in order to compare different UCP orthologues and paralogues, we have established cell lines ectopically expressing mouse UCP 1. In isolated mitochondria of this cell system, we demonstrate native function of mouse UCP 1 (Jastroch et al. 2007, BBA, Chapter VIII and Results and Discussion). This cell system will serve in future studies to compare different UCPs in the presence of an identical mitochondrial and genetical background...|$|E
40|$|Nonmyeloablative {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (NST) is increasingly used with beneficial effects {{because it can}} be applied to older patients with hematological malignancies and those with various complications who are not suitable for conventional myeloablative stem cell transplantation (CST). Various conditioning regimens differ in their myeloablative and immunosuppressive intensity. Regardless of the type of conditioning regimen, graft-versus- host disease (GVHD) in NST occurs almost equally in CST, although a slightly delayed development of acute GVHD is observed in <b>NST.</b> <b>Although</b> graft-versus-hematological malignancy effects (i. e., graft-versus-leukemia effect, graft-versus-lymphoma effect, and graft-versus-myeloma effect) also occur in NST, completely eradicating residual malignant cells through allogeneic immune responses is insufficient in cases with rapidly growing disease or uncontrolled progressive disease. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is sometimes combined to support engraftment and to augment the graft-versus-hematological malignancy effect, such as the graft-versus-leukemia effect. DLI is especially effective for controlling relapse in the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia, but not so effective against other diseases. Indeed, NST is a beneficial procedure for expanding the opportunity of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to many patients with hematological malignancies. However, a more sophisticated improvement in separating graft-versus-hematological malignancy effects from GVHD is required in the future...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTIntroduction:Breast {{invasive}} carcinoma of no special type (NST) {{is characterized by}} great morphological heterogeneity, and accounts for about 70 %- 80 % of malignant breast tumors. The main prognostic factors are tumor size, degree of differentiation, and status of axillary lymph nodes. NST represents 15 %- 18 % of central nervous system metastases (CNSm), and generally the response to systemic treatment/chemotherapy is unsatisfactory. Objective:To estimate the association between clinical and pathological findings of NST with CNSm. Method:Clinical data of 171 specimens of lumpectomy/mastectomy with axillary dissection in NST were evaluated, {{as well as the}} following pathological variables: tumor size, histological grade, nodal status, expression of estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER- 2 /neu) oncogene (c-erb B 2), and presence of CNSm. The cases of CNSm in NST underwent resection, and the primary site was identified by immunohistochemistry. Results:The prevalence of CNSm was 9. 4 % (n = 16), and was related to age (p = 0. 01), and the expression of PR (p = 0. 004). <b>Although</b> cases of <b>NST</b> with CNSm showed correlation with greater tumor size, higher histological grade and nodal metastases, there was no statistical association (p = 0. 221, p = 0. 224 and p = 0. 99, respectively). Expression of ER and c-erb-B 2 was not significant between the two groups (p = 0. 072 and p = 0. 31, respectively). Conclusion:This study showed that younger patients and the expression of RP correlate with the presence of CNSm. The evaluation of specific pathological findings in NST can help establish risk factors and/or clinical parameters associated with the development of CNSm...|$|R
