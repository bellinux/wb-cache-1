5|$|In July 2007, {{a report}} by Waterman Environmental was publicised by Councillor Craig, which {{revealed}} that the land upon which the Abbey Mills Mosque would be built is considered to have a medium-to-high contamination risk. The site {{was used as a}} chemical works for at least 100years, and was decommissioned as such in the late 1980s. Craig was alleged to have obtained this information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and he called for the Environment Agency to be brought in and for the site to be shut down until an independent report was undertaken. According to Craig, the Waterman Report revealed that the original pre-remediation works had discovered soil and groundwater impact by mercury, lead, arsenic, oil, fuels, and <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres.</b> There were methane and carbon dioxide land gas readings as well. Mosque officials have stated that allowing the development to proceed would benefit the community, as decontamination of the site is part of their building plan.|$|E
25|$|The EPA {{report states}} that while {{undisturbed}} in the soil, the contamination poses {{no threat to}} public health but disturbing the site will result in airborne <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> and contamination from the soil. The EPA recommended a management plan for any disturbance of asbestos contamination to be conducted by the Town of Victoria Park. The Minister for Racing and Gaming {{is responsible for the}} site and the Burswood Peninsula will fall into new City of Perth boundaries created by the Local Council Mergers.|$|E
25|$|Small, stable {{specimens}} such as carbon nanotubes, diatom frustules {{and small}} mineral crystals (<b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres,</b> for example) require no special treatment before being {{examined in the}} electron microscope. Samples of hydrated materials, including almost all biological specimens {{have to be prepared}} in various ways to stabilize them, reduce their thickness (ultrathin sectioning) and increase their electron optical contrast (staining). These processes may result in artifacts, but these can usually be identified by comparing the results obtained by using radically different specimen preparation methods. Since the 1980s, analysis of cryofixed, vitrified specimens has also become increasingly used by scientists, further confirming the validity of this technique.|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of the <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> and dust content of samples from 96 surgically excised lungs; 42 necropsies on {{patients}} with lung cancer, 11 necropsies on patients with non-pulmonary malignancies, and 59 necropsies on patients without any malignant disease. The patients' ages ranged from 45 to 74 years {{at the time of}} study. None of the patients had asbestosis. The distribution of fibres and dust content of the lungs showed a log-normal distribution. There {{was no significant difference in}} fibre counts or dust content between men and women, and between lung cancer and non-cancer patients. The only group with an association with a high <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> count was four necropsy cases of pleural mesothelioma. There was no significant relationship between <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> count and dust content of the lung. The present data suggest that <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> counts below 100, 000 per gram of dried lung are not related to specific asbestos disease, although in the surgical cases who were closely questioned on their residential and occupational histories most of those with fibre counts above 30, 000 per gram dried lung had had occasions of definite or very likely asbestos exposure...|$|R

50|$|In March 2006 it was revealed, that <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> {{had been}} {{disturbed}} by contractors installing cabling for the Tcard {{project in the}} roof of the ticketing office at the station. The station offices were temporarily closed and replaced by a temporary booking office in the station carpark.|$|R
500|$|The {{tissue of}} the lungs can be {{affected}} {{by a number of}} diseases, including pneumonia and lung cancer. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes chronic bronchitis and previously termed emphysema, can be related to smoking or exposure to harmful substances such as coal dust, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> and crystalline silica dust. Diseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract. Medical terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-, from the Latin pulmonarius ({{of the lungs}}) as in pulmonology, or with pneumo- (from Greek πνεύμων [...] "lung") as in pneumonia.|$|E
2500|$|Many scare {{stories have}} {{originated}} from various Russian gas masks and their filters {{that are now}} common in surplus stores; the GP-5 was often considered to have an asbestos filter. In October 2013, an asbestos lab in Salt Lake City {{found out that the}} particle filter is made of 7.5% asbestos. [...] The filter is made so that the <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> cannot be breathed in, if the filter layer is not damaged.. [...] Nearly all Russian Cold War period masks contain asbestos, however, only the ones produced before 1972 pose a threat, and even then, the construction of the mask makes it impossible to breathe the asbestos in if not damaged.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2005 {{a second}} report {{commissioned}} by the developers, from Encia Environmental, revealed levels of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> in two soil samples from the site at 1.3% and 2.3%, [...] 13 and 23 times above the limit at which waste is deemed [...] "hazardous". A level of 3% is categorised as [...] "toxic". Regarding the developers earlier assertions {{that they had not}} intended to develop the controversial northern section, council planning officer Ken Smith claimed that the developers had been told they would have to submit a planning application for the whole of the [...] site, which would have to show any asbestos tests and plans for removal, and not just selected portions. [...] "They were clearly told remediation work must take place on the whole of the site," [...] he said. [...] "It's been quite clear it was 72 acres and not [...] part of that site." ...|$|E
50|$|Three formal Occupational Health and Safety {{investigations}} on Willis Island {{have been}} undertaken by independent assessors - GHD (2007 and 2011) and Parsons Brinkerhoff (April 2011 - after TC Yasi).

50|$|There {{continues}} to be a high usage of Friable or Dust based Asbestos in Compressed <b>Asbestos</b> <b>Fibre</b> (CAF) Gaskets, Ropes, Cloth, Gland Packings, Millboards, Insulation and Brake Liners in Factories and Industries within India as well as inadvertently exported by Equipment Manufacturers without adequate knowledge and information to the other countries.|$|R
50|$|The <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> count at {{the mine}} and other {{facilities}} was regularly measured at 1000 parts per cm3 or more. This is {{in stark contrast to}} the health department guidelines of the 1950s that required less than 176 parts per cm3. By 1967 the 'safe' level of asbestos was limited to 5 parts per cm3.|$|R
2500|$|Following the Corby ruling, Jason Addy stated: [...] "The Corby ruling {{could have}} huge {{implications}} for the actions and responsibilities of Rochdale Council for the Spodden Valley site. Environmental pollution {{has been a problem}} at the Rochdale factory with acknowledged cases of asbestos-related cancer caused by environmental exposure." [...] Laurie Kazan Allen, Editor of the British Asbestos Newsletter, said: [...] "This landmark decision has ramifications for Rochdale Council regarding the Spodden Valley asbestos factory site. There is now a clear legal principle that local authorities hold a duty of care to protect communities from the hazardous effects of disturbing contaminated land. Since at least the 1960s there has been clear evidence that the inhalation of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres,</b> even in low quantities, can cause terminal cancer decades after initial exposure. Rochdale Council must take heed of this historic decision and act to protect local people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hilda Palmer of the Greater Manchester Hazards Centre said: [...] "This {{has serious}} {{implications}} for Rochdale MBC in its {{management and control}} of the ex T site. The site is known to be extensively contaminated with the known carcinogen asbestos, which may be released into the air whenever the site is disturbed, and the invisible microscopic fibres spread in the air across the area to be inhaled by people, including children who are especially at risk of developing asbestos related terminal cancers such as mesothelioma years later. These facts are not in dispute and though the owner of the site is the responsible duty holder, the court judgment on Corby Council confirms the duty of care of a council as the planning authority and environmental health authority in terms of managing and controlling the risks to long term health presented by the airborne <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> from this site." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{manufacture}} of asbestos products {{began on the}} site in 1879, and by 1970 the factory had an annual output of 2,250,000 yards of asbestos cloth and [...] of asbestos yarn. The dangerous nature of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> had first been suspected in 1898, when Factory Inspector Lucy Deane reported: [...] "The evil effects of asbestos dust have also instigated a microscopic examination of the mineral dust by HM Medical Inspector [...] Clearly revealed was the sharp glass-like jagged nature of the particles, {{and where they are}} allowed to rise and to remain suspended in the air of the room in any quantity, the effects {{have been found to be}} injurious as might have been expected." [...] In 1924 a 33-year-old Turner's employee, Nellie Kershaw, became the first officially recognised victim of asbestosis but the firm refused to accept responsibility for her death, saying it would [...] "create a precedent". Her family received no compensation, and she was buried in a pauper's grave in Rochdale.|$|E
40|$|Collection, {{identification}} and data analyzing techniques are presented for airborne asbestos fibers. The limitations of thetechniques on the membrane filter method, X-ray diffraction method and infrared analysis are discussed. It was shown that any methods had some merits and demerits, {{and the most}} suitable technique shoud be adopted according to the concentration of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> in ambient air...|$|R
50|$|In March 2013, Bridge sued {{a number}} of parties for damages after being {{diagnosed}} with several asbestos-related conditions including mesothelioma, asbestosis, and pleural disease. Bridge {{said he had been}} exposed to <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> and dust while fulfilling his ministerial duties in the 1980s, and was suing the Western Australian government, the Shire of Ashburton, CSR Limited, Midalco, Gina Rinehart's company Hancock Prospecting and Angela Bennett's Wright Prospecting.|$|R
40|$|Lung {{asbestos}} burden {{was compared}} with exposure indices derived from job history interviews in 42 male subjects originating from the Montréal Case-Control Study project, 12 {{of whom had}} documented asbestos exposed job histories. Job interview data consisting of a chronological timetable of job histories were translated into detailed exposure indices by an expert group of hygienists and chemists. Total and individual <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> type concentrations were quantified by transmission electron microscopy with fibre identification by energy dispersive chi ray spectrometry after deparaffinisation of tissue blocks and low temperature plasma ashing. Geometric mean or median asbestos content was higher in subjects with an asbestos exposed job history than those without for retained dose of amosite, total commercial amphiboles, and total <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre.</b> Except for crocidolite fibre diameter, which was significantly less in the lungs of exposed workers, no consistent {{differences were found in}} measurements of fibre dimension for any fibre type. Subgroups of subjects exposed to silica, metals, or smokers and non-smokers without significant occupational exposure showed varying patterns of lung <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> type deficit compared with the asbestos exposed subgroup. There was an overall trend for higher lung asbestos content proportional to higher exposure indices for asbestos representing concentration, frequency, and reliability. These exposure indices as well as duration of exposure (in years) were independent predictors of total asbestos content in regression analyses when combined in a model with age. Stepwise regression indicated that exposure concentration was the most important variable, explaining 32 % of the total variation in total asbestos content. Smoking, whether expressed in ever or never smoked dichotomy or in smoked-years, had no relation to lung asbestos content in this model...|$|R
2500|$|In May 2005 the Save Spodden Valley group {{claimed that}} it had {{uncovered}} internal MMC correspondence which identified numerous sites where <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> {{had been found in}} September 2004, predating the planning application. The document stated: [...] "The audit undertaken was visual and no samples have been sent away for analysis. I enclose a site map where the asbestos has been located: Top section of road near hair pin bend, asbestos sheets and asbestos fibre found in tree stumps. Road leading to Healey Dell, asbestos cloth." [...] The developers responded that they had been aware of contamination in the northern portion of the site, but their testing report submitted to the council did not include this area as there had been no intention to develop there. Instead they had confined their testing only to those areas where they intended to develop and that there had been [...] "some misunderstanding of our intentions and the test result." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2005, {{following}} {{the confirmation of}} <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> found on tree roots, the council asked developers to provide more detailed information relating to their contaminated land surveys, and placed the application on hold. They also announced that they were considering appointing their own environmental consultants to examine the site. Jason Addy said: [...] "This {{is what we have}} been asking for since day one. The information handed in with the planning application was inaccurate, misleading and avoided many issues. As this site begins to reveal more of its murky secrets people are realising just how contaminated it is. We are very concerned about the asbestos contamination on the site. We are very worried about the way this is going, if it wasn't so serious it would be a farce." [...] Rochdale councillor William Hobhouse said: [...] "With no government regulations specifying safe levels of asbestos in soil, it is clear the council, working with outside consultants, will have to formulate what percentage of asbestos in the soil is safe." ...|$|E

50|$|Inhaled <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> {{enter the}} upper and lower {{respiratory}} tracts when asbestos is released into the air. Some of the inhaled fibers are cleared by the mucociliary clearance mechanism but long thin asbestos fibers may reach the lower airways and alveoli, and can be retained in the lungs for many years. Amphibole fibers are not cleared as effectively as serpentines and therefore accumulate more readily in the distal lung parenchyma. <b>Asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are recognised by the lungs as foreign bodies and cause the activation of the lung’s local immune system leading to inflammation, cell and tissue damage. In the long term, this can lead to fibrosis, or rarely to malignancy. From the lungs, some <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> (mainly short fibres) can also migrate to pleural and peritoneal spaces.|$|E
50|$|Fibre cement {{products}} were amongst the last materials available to have contained {{large quantities of}} asbestos. The <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are intimately bound to the cement matrix and {{were considered to be}} immobilized in the cement and therefore less prone to be released in the environment, suspended in the air, and inhaled in the lung than in other materials or applications, such as thermal insulation or flocking, in which loose <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> were used. However, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are inevitably released during machining of the fibre-cement products, and by long-term erosion of the material after it has been exposed to atmospheric weathering and wind, which causes the cement to degrade. Occupational health concerns and the protection of workers in the fibre-cement factories have finally led to the progressive elimination of asbestos from these products.|$|E

40|$|In {{using the}} {{standard}} alkali digestion method for pulmonary <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibre</b> count, {{it was found}} that carbonaceous particles often obscured the presence of <b>asbestos</b> bodies (coated <b>fibres)</b> rendering their quantification inaccurate, particularly in lungs with a high soot particle content and a low fibre count. We applied the chloroform-ethanol separation technique from the bleaching agent digestion method to the alkali digestion method to remove the carbonaceous particles. It was found that coated fibres are much easier to visualize and count. The uncoated fibre count was nevertheless more accurate with the original method. The coated and uncoated fibre counts from 21 lung specimens were compared using both methods. The total fibre count was considered better derived from using both techniques. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Fibre cement were {{probably}} amongst the latest materials {{on the market}} to have contained large quantities of asbestos. The {{reason is that the}} <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are intimately bound to the cement matrix and were first considered to be well immobilized in the cement and less prone to be released in the environment, suspended in the air, and inhaled in the lung than in other materials or applications such as thermal insulation or flocking in which bare <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> were used. However, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are inevitably released during machining operations of the objects made of fibre-cement and by long-term erosion of the materials exposed to atmospheric weathering and wind when cement degrades. Occupational health concerns and the protection of workers in the fibre-cement factories have finally led to the progressive elimination of asbestos from these products. For health reasons, it is recommended that existing fibre-cement products that are in good condition are left undisturbed and possibly encapsulated, to prevent fibre release.|$|E
