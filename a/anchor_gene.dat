40|$|Compositional spectra (CS) {{analysis}} {{based on}} k-mer scoring of DNA sequences was employed {{in this study}} for dot-plot comparison of human and primate genomes. The detection of extended conserved synteny regions was based on continuous fuzzy similarity rather than on chains of discrete <b>anchors</b> (<b>genes</b> or highly conserved noncoding elements). In addition to the high correspondence found in the comparisons of whole-genome sequences, a good similarity was also found after masking gene sequences, indicating that CS analysis manages to reveal phylogenetic signal {{in the organization of}} noncoding part of the genome sequences, including repetitive DNA and the genome "dark matter". Obviously, the possibility to reveal parallel ordering depends on the signal of common ancestor sequence organization varying locally along the corresponding segments of the compared genomes. We explored two sources contributing to this signal: sequence composition (GC content) and sequence organization (abundances of k-mers in the usual A,T,G,C or purine-pyrimidine alphabets). Whole-genome comparisons based on GC distribution along the analyzed sequences indeed gives reasonable results, but combining it with k-mer abundances dramatically improves the ordering quality, indicating that compositional and organizational heterogeneity comprise complementary sources of information on evolutionary conserved similarity of genome sequences...|$|R
50|$|After WDBB began {{deviating}} {{from the}} WTTO simulcast part-time, the station brought back news programming in 1993 under Abry ownership; the new news department, which branded its newscasts as WDBB 17 News, consisted of half-hour newscasts at 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. each weeknight and at 10:00 p.m. seven nights a week, which were targeted at Tuscaloosa and west-central Alabama; at the time, as Tuscaloosa {{was considered a}} separate market from Birmingham, it was the smallest Fox affiliate by market size that produced its newscasts in-house {{and one of the}} few news-producing Fox stations that did not carry a prime time newscast that followed the network's programming (the 9:00 p.m. hour was filled by syndicated programming instead). The newsroom and studio were housed at WDBB's original Jug Factory Road facility in Tuscaloosa.

40|$|Transcription {{activation}} of some Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes is paralleled by their repositioning {{to the nuclear}} periphery, but the mechanism underlying <b>gene</b> <b>anchoring</b> is poorly defined. We show that the nuclear pore complex-associated Mlp 1 p and the shuttling mRNA export receptor Mex 67 p contribute to the stable association of the activated GAL 10 and HSP 104 genes with the nuclear periphery. However, we find no obligatory link between gene positioning and gene expression. Furthermore, <b>gene</b> <b>anchoring</b> correlates with the cotranscriptional recruitment of Mex 67 p to transcribing genes. Notably, the association of Mex 67 p with chromatin is not mediated by RNA. Interestingly, a mutant GAL 2 gene lacking the coding region is still able to recruit Mex 67 p upon transcriptional activation and to relocate to the nuclear periphery. Together these data suggest that, at least for GAL 2, nascent messenger ribonucleoprotein does not {{play a major role}} in <b>gene</b> <b>anchoring</b> and that the early recruitment of Mex 67 p contributes to gene repositioning by virtue of an RNA-independent process.

We have previously demonstrated that inflammation-related gene expression after SCI occurs in two waves - an initial cluster that is acutely and transiently up-regulated within 24 hours, and a more delayed cluster that peaks between 72 hours and 7 days. Here we extend the microarray analysis of these gene clusters up to 6 months post-SCI. Methods Adult male rats were subjected to mild, moderate or severe spinal cord contusion injury at T 9 using a well-characterized weight-drop model. Tissue from the lesion epicenter was obtained 4 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 28 days, 3 months or 6 months post-injury and processed for microarray analysis and protein expression. Results <b>Anchor</b> <b>gene</b> analysis using C 1 qB revealed a cluster of genes that showed elevated expression through 6 months post-injury, including galectin- 3, p 22 PHOX, gp 91 PHOX, CD 53 and progranulin. The expression of these genes occurred primarily in microglia/macrophage cells and was confirmed at the protein level using both immunohistochemistry and western blotting. As p 22 PHOX and gp 91 PHOX are components of the NADPH oxidase enzyme, enzymatic activity and its role in SCI were assessed and NADPH oxidase activity was found to be significantly up-regulated through 6 months post-injury. Further, treating rats with the nonspecific, irreversible NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodinium (DPI) reduced both lesion volume and expression of chronic gene cluster proteins one month after trauma. Conclusions These data demonstrate that inflammation-related genes are chronically up-regulated after SCI and may contribute to further tissue loss. </p...|$|E

It has been utilized {{to address a}} broad range of bioinformatics problems. Limited by reliable output sequence length of next-generation sequencing technologies, we are confined to study gene fragments with 30 ~ 50 bps in general and it is relatively shorter than traditional <b>gene</b> fragment length. <b>Anchoring</b> <b>gene</b> fragments in long reference sequence is an essential and prerequisite step for further assembly and analysis works. Due to the sheer number of fragments produced by next-generation sequencing technologies and the huge size of reference sequences, anchoring would rapidly becoming a computational bottleneck. Results and discussion We compared algorithm efficiency on BLAT, SOAP and EMBF. The efficiency is defined as the count of total output results divided by time consumed to retrieve them. The data show that our algorithm EMBF have 3 ~ 4 times efficiency advantage over SOAP, and at least 150 times over BLAT. Moreover, when the reference sequence size is increased, the efficiency of SOAP will get degraded as far as 30 %, while EMBF have preferable increasing tendency. Conclusion In conclusion, we deem that EMBF is more suitable for short fragment anchoring problem where result completeness and accuracy is predominant and the reference sequences are relatively large. </p...|$|R

The emergence and breathtaking progress of next generation sequencing technologies has put this goal into focus and a clone based strategy combined with the 454 /Roche technology is conceivable. Results To test the feasibility, we sequenced 91 barcoded, pooled, gene containing barley BACs using the GS FLX platform and assembled the sequences under iterative change of parameters. The BAC assemblies were characterized by N 50 of ~ 50 kb (N 80 ~ 31 kb, N 90 ~ 21 kb) and a Q 40 of 94 %. For ~ 80 % of the clones, the best assemblies consisted of less than 10 contigs at 24 -fold mean sequence coverage. Moreover we show that gene containing regions seem to assemble completely and uninterrupted thus making the approach suitable for detecting complete and positionally <b>anchored</b> <b>genes.</b> By comparing the assemblies of four clones to their complete reference sequences generated by the Sanger method, we evaluated the distribution, quality and representativeness of the 454 sequences as well as the consistency and reliability of the assemblies. Conclusion The described multiplex 454 sequencing of barcoded BACs leads to sequence consensi highly representative for the clones. Assemblies are correct for the majority of contigs. Though the resolution of complex repetitive structures requires additional experimental efforts, our approach paves the way for a clone based strategy of sequencing the barley genome. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background. Worldwide, {{grapes and}} their derived {{products}} {{have a large}} market. The cultivated grape species Vitis vinifera has potential to become a model for fruit trees genetics. Like many plant species, it is highly heterozygous, which is an additional challenge to modern whole genome shotgun sequencing. In this paper a high quality draft genome sequence of a cultivated clone of V. vinifera Pinot Noir is presented. Principal Findings. We estimate the genome size of V. vinifera to be 504. 6 Mb. Genomic sequences corresponding to 477. 1 Mb were assembled in 2, 093 metacontigs and 435. 1 Mb were anchored to the 19 linkage groups (LGs). The number of predicted genes is 29, 585, of which 96. 1 % were assigned to LGs. This assembly of the grape genome provides candidate genes implicated in traits relevant to grapevine cultivation, such as those influencing wine quality, via secondary metabolites, and those connected with the extreme susceptibility of grape to pathogens. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distribution was consistent with a diffuse haplotype structure across the genome. Of around 2, 000, 000 SNPs, 1, 751, 176 were mapped to chromosomes and {{one or more of}} them were identified in 86. 7 % of <b>anchored</b> <b>genes.</b> The relative age of grape duplicated genes was estimated and this made possible to reveal a relatively recent Vitisspecific large scale duplication event concerning at least 10 chromosomes (duplication not reported before).

A consensus sequence of the genome and a set of mapped marker loci were generated. Homologous chromosomes of Pinot Noir differ by 11. 2 % of their DNA (hemizygous DNA plus chromosomal gaps).

Here we report the first six autosomal genes assigned to canine chromosomes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using cosmid DNA: adenine phosphoribosyl transferase on Chromosome (Chr) 3; creatine kinase muscle type on Chr 4; pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cell type on Chr 2; and colony-stimulating factor- 1 receptor, glucose transporter protein- 2, and tumor protein p 53 on Chr 5. These assignments are based on the karytotype proposed by Stone and associates (Genome 34, 407, 1991) using high-resolution techniques. In addition, we have assigned the Menkes gene to the X Chr of the dog...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays humans mainly rely on external, unnatural clocks such as of {{cell phones}} and alarm clocks – driven by circuit boards and electricity. Nevertheless, our body is {{under the control of}} another timer firmly <b>anchored</b> in our <b>genes.</b> This {{evolutionary}} very old biological clock drives most of our physiology and behavior. The genes that control our internal clock are conserved among most living beings. One organism that shares this ancient clock mechanism with us humans is the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Since it turned out that Drosophila is an excellent model, {{it is no surprise that}} its clock is very well and intensely investigated. In the following review we want to display an overview of the current understanding of Drosophila’s circadian clock...|$|R
