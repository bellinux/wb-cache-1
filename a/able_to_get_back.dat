5|$|Beckett grew up idolizing fellow Texans Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens. As a youth, he starred on Little League All-Star teams. He later {{attended}} Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He {{had trouble}} with grades and {{not paying attention to}} his coach during his freshman year. His coach was so frustrated with him he threw him off the team. He went through a growth spurt before his sophomore year and added speed to his fastball. He also raised his GPA and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> on the team, where he had a 9–3 record with a 1.18 earned run average (ERA) as a sophomore, tossing three no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|In 1637 Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania died. He was {{the last}} of the Slavic Griffins Dynasty of the Duchy of Pomerania. Sweden {{acquired}} the Pomeranian rule, while the Commonwealth was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> its fiefs, Bytów Land and Lębork Land. Słupsk Land was also sought by Władysław IV at the peace conference, but it ended up a part of Brandenburg, which after the Peace of Westphalia controlled all of Pomerania adjacent to the border of the Commonwealth, extending south to where it met with Habsburg lands. Portions of Pomerania were populated by the Slavic Kashubians and Slovincians.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{fell ill}} with {{diarrhoea}} during the Tour's tenth stage. He was {{under pressure from}} his personal manager {{to continue in the}} race, though members of his team encouraged him to quit. Near the summit of Mont Ventoux, Simpson fell off of his bike but was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> on it. After riding a short distance further, he collapsed. He was pronounced dead after being airlifted to a hospital. The post-mortem examination found that he had taken amphetamine and alcohol, a diuretic combination which proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and the stomach complaint.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, {{he was to}} have a fully {{sponsored}} effort, but {{the deal}} fell through weeks before the race. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>backing</b> from a St. Louis business (his hometown) and eventually Burger King. In order to qualify, he had to sweat out a possible qualification effort by Tony Stewart that never came to pass.|$|R

50|$|With pollings in June 2014 {{running as}} low as 29% and 24%, the {{requirement}} of 60% support Børre Rognlien previously had stated was called off. During the summer, the bid was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>backing</b> from key public figures: Leader of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, Gerd Kristiansen, {{as well as the}} leader of Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise, Kristin Skogen Lund, went public with their support of the bid. Oslo 2022 also got the support of Norwegian Young Conservatives. However, the youth division of the other seven major political parties opposed the bid.|$|R
5|$|Fast {{recorded}} two assists {{during his}} October 30 debut with the Rangers AHL team, {{now called the}} Hartford Wolf Pack. However, he suffered a high ankle sprain after going into the boards during a November 2 game at Springfield. He missed the next 14 games as a result, not returning until December 20, but was given enough minutes upon his return that he was quickly <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into shape. Fast scored his first goal of the season on December 26, notching the game winner on the power play against Bridgeport Sound Tigers goalie Anders Nilsson. The game {{was part of a}} four-game point streak (two goals, two assists) that stretched from December 21 to December 29. Fast also set a team record on January 24 for fastest goal to start a period, scoring in the first seven seconds of the game against Springfield, beating Hartford's previous record by two seconds.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{topped the}} time sheets {{in the second}} session, now {{switching}} to the soft compound tyres as well, with Nico Rosberg two and a half-tenths of a second clear of Kimi Räikkönen, while Lewis Hamilton was third fastest, more than seven tenths off Rosberg's time. Räikkönen's running was interrupted for a while when he was called back into the pitlane to investigate a fuel system problem, but was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> out. Fernando Alonso was seventh fastest for McLaren, but needed a replacement of his car's plank after running wide over artificial grass surrounding the track. His teammate, Jenson Button, also experienced problems, having {{to stop at the}} end of the pitlane early in the session with an electrical issue. Renault's problem from the first session continued: Jolyon Palmer, back in his car in place of Ocon, suffered a tyre failure on the start-finish straight, bringing out red flags in the process. Renault and tyre supplier Pirelli were left puzzled over the failure, as in this incident, no sign of a cut from debris was found.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Nico Rosberg {{got away}} well, fending off {{an attack by}} {{teammate}} Hamilton into the first corner. Behind them, Vettel had a bad getaway that saw him get {{in the midst of}} the Red Bull cars. In turn 5, he touched Daniel Ricciardo's car, suffering a puncture that forced him into the pit lane at the end of the first lap. While he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> out, Fernando Alonso ended his race after just one lap due to a loss of power. Therefore, the order after the first lap stood as: Rosberg, Hamilton, Kvyat and Ricciardo. The two Mercedes cars of Rosberg and Hamilton soon opened a gap on the Red Bull cars of Kvyat and Ricciardo, exchanging fastest laps in the process, while Felipe Massa and Max Verstappen got entangled in a fight for sixth place. Kimi Räikkönen, who was told early on to cool his brakes, made good progress up the field and was in 13th position by lap 8. One lap later, Valtteri Bottas became the first of the front runners to pit, putting on the medium compound, followed just a lap later by teammate Massa. While Räikkönen had moved up to eighth place by lap 12, Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz Jr. got into a fight for sixth place, with Pérez being asked by his team to stay out as long as possible.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea {{replaced}} midfielder Jiří Jarošík with striker Eiður Guðjohnsen at {{the start}} of the second half, and started the second half in the same manner that they finished the first, with Liverpool withholding the pressure on their penalty area. Cole passed the ball over the Liverpool defence to Drogba in the 54th minute, but defender Jamie Carragher was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> and clear the ball. The ball was played back into the penalty area and met by Guðjohnsen, whose header was saved by Dudek, the ball fell to Gallas and Dudek again saved the subsequent shot. Midfielder Antonio Núñez replaced Harry Kewell in the 56th minute. Against the run of play, Liverpool had an attack in the 64th minute. A counter-attack results in a Dietmar Hamann shot, but it was saved by Čech. Liverpool made another substitution following the attack as Igor Bišćan replaced an injured Djimi Traoré. Chelsea continued to push forward and were close to a goal in the 71st minute, but Riise cleared a Gallas after the ball was played to him by Makélélé. Both teams made substitutions in the following minutes. Striker Milan Baroš replaced Morientes for Liverpool while Chelsea substituted Gallas for striker Mateja Kežman.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} {{then moved}} to the penultimate round at the Swedish Grand Prix with Spencer holding a two-point lead over Roberts. Roberts led Spencer going into the last lap of the race. Heading down the back straight, Spencer placed his Honda right behind Roberts' Yamaha {{as they reached the}} second to the last corner, a ninety degree right-hander. As both riders applied their brakes, Spencer came out of Roberts' slipstream and managed to get inside of the Yamaha. As they exited the corner, both riders ran wide off the track and into the dirt. Spencer was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> on the track and back on the power first, crossing the finish line just ahead of Roberts for a crucial victory. Roberts considered Spencer's pass to be foolish and dangerous, and exchanged angry words with him on the podium. Roberts would have to win the final round at the San Marino Grand Prix with Spencer finishing no better than third place in order for Roberts to win his fourth world championship. In a fitting end to a great career, Roberts won his last-ever Grand Prix race, however Spencer was able to secure second place to claim the world championship. The two riders dominated the season with each claiming six victories in the 12 race series.|$|E

25|$|The {{threat to}} amateur rugby union was {{especially}} large in Australia where Super League {{was threatening to}} entice players to rugby league with large salaries. SANZAR was formed in 1995 by the New Zealand, Australian and South African Rugby Unions to try to counter the Super League threat. SANZAR proposed a provincial competition with teams from all three countries. This competition became the Super 12 and later the Super 14 before adopting its current identity as Super Rugby. The SANZAR proposals also included an annual competition between each country's Test teams, the Tri Nations Series. They were eventually <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>backing</b> for the competition from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, with a contract totalling $US 550 million for ten years of exclusive TV and radio broadcasting rights. The deal was signed during the 1995 Rugby World Cup and revealed {{at a press conference}} on the eve of World Cup final.|$|R

The loss of Robo put an end to extensive touring for a while. Emil Johnson of Twisted Roots filled in for one tour, but it was clear he was only temporary.|$|E

Barteau was so far behind in this stage, that Fignon became the new leader. Fignon won three more stages, {{for a total of}} five that year, and won the Tour with a ten-minute margin. With his air of indifference in interviews and his crushing dominance, he was hailed as France's newest superstar.|$|E

25|$|The landing party {{left the}} Endymion for the rock by boat. Whilst {{they were on}} the rock, the Endymion, which was taking depth {{measurements}} around Rockall, lost visual contact with the rock as a haze descended. The ship drifted away, leaving the landing party stranded. The expedition made a brief attempt to return to the ship, but could not find the frigate in the haze, and soon gave up and returned to Rockall. After the haze became a fog, the lookout sent to the top of Rockall spotted the ship again, but it turned away from Rockall before the expedition in their boats reached it. Finally, just before sunset, the frigate was again spotted from the top of Rockall, and the expedition was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> on board. The crew of the Endymion reported that they had been searching for five or six hours, firing their cannon every ten minutes. Hall related this experience and other adventures in a book entitled Fragment of Voyages and Travels Including Anecdotes of a Naval Life.|$|E
