5|$|The {{creation}} of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which {{in many cases}} meant European countries adopting US practices. The roughly 1300Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved.

40|$|AbstractSimulation-based {{training}} is a promising way to train a carrier flight deck crew {{because of the}} complex and dangerous working environment. Quantitative evaluation of simulation-based training quality is vital to make simulation-based training practical for <b>aircraft</b> carrier <b>marshalling.</b> This paper develops a personal computer-based <b>aircraft</b> carrier <b>marshalling</b> simulation system and a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE) -based immersive environment. In order to compare the training effectiveness of simulation-based training and paper-based training, a learning cubic model is proposed and a contrast experiment is carried out as well. The experimental data is analyzed based on a simplified Kirkpatrick’s model. The results show that simulation-based {{training is}} better than paper-based training by 26. 80 % after three rounds of testing, which prove the effectiveness of simulation-based <b>aircraft</b> carrier <b>marshalling</b> training...|$|R

50|$|Consisted of {{a runway}} and an <b>aircraft</b> <b>marshalling</b> area on {{each end of}} the runway. It was {{designed}} to provide an airfield near the front lines upon which aircraft based in rear areas could land, be refueled and rearmed, and take off again on a mission without having to return to their home field in the rear. Also could be used for dispersal or for when services other than refueling or rearming was required. These airfields could be expanded into advance landing grounds by the addition of dispersal and other station facilities. Generally if an R&R strip was built, it would be sited wherever possible with a view to further expand it later into an ALG.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} study {{about the relationship}} between the Safety Management System and the External Suppliers that works in Barcelona Airport - El Prat. Firstly, the concept of safety is defined and the different regulations of this relationship are shown, without going further into the issue. Following, it is described how the system watch over the activity of different External Suppliers through the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Marshalling</b> Team and, the different supervisions that are done. After that, the widespread opinion of platform workers is presented, where some of the workers decide to leave aside the security first concept to make the flight in time. Then, all the system explained above is analyzed. This analysis find out that the Airport Safety Level is acceptable but, there are certain deficiencies. The following deficiencies are highlighted: Safety is not punitive, the Safety Management System is excessively bureaucratic, the staff training process and the level of awareness of the platform workers is not ideal. Finally, some proposals are developed. These proposals seek to solve the deficiencies detected. The main proposals are highlighted for its ease in the implementation and for their improvement in efficiency. The outstanding proposals are: digitize all documentation of the Management System speeding up the paperwork adding digital signature, do not to tell the External Suppliers which flight will be the chosen one for turnaround supervision until moments before, do multiple turnaround supervisions at different suppliers at the same time and, {{the creation of a new}} formation supervision for platform workers...|$|E

25|$|Since China bordered Vietnam, it was {{an immensely}} {{important}} conduit of material on land, although the Soviets also delivered some of its aid by sea. Soviet aid outstripped that of China, averaging over {{half a billion dollars}} per year in the later stages of the war, with some $700million in 1967 alone. China provided an estimated $150 million to $200 million annually, along with such in-kind aid as the deployment of thousands of troops in road and railway construction in the border provinces. China also provided radar stations and airfields where North Vietnamese <b>aircraft</b> could <b>marshal</b> for attack, or flee to when in trouble against American air forces. These military airbases were off-limits to American retaliation.|$|R
50|$|A {{sky marshal}} (also known as air marshal, flight marshal, or, in the United States, FAM) is a covert law {{enforcement}} or counter terrorist agent {{on board a}} commercial aircraft to counter <b>aircraft</b> hijackings. Sky <b>marshals</b> may be provided by airlines such as El Al (who provide sky marshals on every flight), or by government {{agencies such as the}} Austrian Einsatzkommando Cobra, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, German Federal Police, National Security Guard in India, Metropolitan Police SO18 (Aviation Security Operational Command Unit), Pakistan Airports Security Force or US Federal Air Marshal Service.|$|R
50|$|KCCB is a Class G (untowered) airport. Runway 1-19 is {{no longer}} in existence. In its place are some hangars, a fuel island, and a covered, lighted wash rack. Runway 6-24, now {{lengthened}} to 3865 ft, was recently resurfaced and is mostly flat, with some undulations on the east half. There is a terminal building with an FBO (flight school & rentals), aircraft repair shop, Maniac Mike's restaurant, and a control tower which is used to <b>marshal</b> <b>aircraft</b> during the annual Cable Air Show in January. (The tower is not normally used at any other time, as Cable is an uncontrolled airport.)This airport is also home to the Civil Air Patrol Squadron 25. The Cable family was nice enough to loan Civil Air Patrol their airport every Tuesday night from 6:30-9:00.Cable Airport is still owned by the Cable family. Based on number of aircraft based at the field (450), it ranks as the largest privately owned airport in the world.|$|R
5000|$|All {{aircraft}} are assigned holding at a marshal fix, typically about 150° from the ship's Base Recovery Course (BRC), at a unique distance and altitude. The holding pattern is a left-hand, 6-minute [...] Each pilot adjusts his holding pattern to depart marshal precisely at the assigned time. <b>Aircraft</b> departing <b>marshal</b> will normally be separated by 1 minute. Adjustments may be {{directed by the}} ship's Carrier Air Traffic Control Center (CATCC), if required, to ensure proper separation. In order to maintain proper separation of aircraft, parameters must be precisely flown. Aircraft descend at [...] and [...] until 5000 ft is reached, {{at which point the}} descent is lessened to [...] Aircraft transition to a landing configuration (wheels/flaps down) at [...] from the ship. If the stack is held more than 10 degrees away from the final bearing (approach course to the ship), then at , the pilot will arc at , to and then intercept that final bearing, to proceed with the approach.No matter what, since the landing area is angled approximately 10° from the axis of the ship, aircraft final approach heading (Final Bearing) is approximately 10° less than the ship's heading (Base Recovery Course). Aircraft on the standard approach without an arc (called the CV-1) still have to correct from the marshal radial to the final bearing, and this is done in such case, at [...] As the ship moves through the water, the aircraft must make continual, minor corrections to the right to stay on the final bearing. If the ship makes course correction-which is often done {{in order to make the}} relative wind (natural wind plus ship's movement generated wind) go directly down the angle deck, or to avoid obstacles-lineup to center line must be corrected. The further the aircraft is from the ship, the larger the correction required.|$|R
50|$|No. 98 Squadron {{reformed}} on 12 September 1942 at RAF West Raynham as a bomber {{squadron of}} 2 Group, flying the North American Mitchell II. Relocating to Foulsham in mid-October, the Squadron continued {{training on the}} Mitchell, being declared operational on 8 December 1942, at first flying Air Sea Rescue (ASR) missions. On 22 January 1943 the Squadron made its first attack on the enemy, when six Mitchells from 98 Squadron and six from No. 180 Squadron (also flying its first combat mission), with an escort of Mustang fighters from 169 Squadron, attacked oil installations at Terneuzen, Belgium. One 98 Squadron Mitchell was shot down by German anti-aircraft fire while two of 180 Squadron's aircraft together with two 169 Squadron Mustangs were shot down by Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters. Following this inauspicious debut, 98 Squadron returned to ASR missions while modifications {{were made to the}} Mitchell's defensive gun turrets, the Squadron returning to combat on 13 May when six <b>aircraft</b> attacked railway <b>marshalling</b> yards at Boulogne. In August 1943 the Squadron moved to Dunsfold to take part in pre-invasion attacks on Northern France and on V1 flying bomb launching sites in the Pas-de-Calais. After the Normandy landings the Squadron operated in close support of the advancing Allied armies, and from October 1944 was based at Melsbroek near Brussels, Belgium, moving to Achmer, near Osnabrück, Germany, just days prior to VE Day.|$|R
40|$|IN 2007, {{with the}} {{imminent}} commercial {{launch of the}} A 380 and the 787 Dreamliner by Airbus and Boeing respectively, the two aircraft manufactur-ers were {{caught up in a}} dance seen by newspapers as a contest of strategy, but which was also experienced by each as exigencies of sustain-ing a suitable identity. Each identity emerged in the struggle for some footing amidst chaos, struggles for control that settled out over time into locations within networks of ties – cross-stream with other plane makers, up-stream with endless suppliers and down-stream with as many airlines as possible. These networks and the accompanying disciplines of actual production get encrusted into institutions, here an <b>aircraft</b> industry that <b>marshals</b> producer firms – ones that have survived thus far – within rhetorics, variously of delivery, service and innovation, along with tax-paying and subsidy-receiving. Strategy and rhetoric are figure and ground for one another, here as in all social life, their fadings and emergences correlative with slidings into and out of unchartable turbulence, true uncertainty, against manageable, insurable risk. Airbus, like Boeing, uses turbulence strategically for re-energizing its identity, while it re-crafts some network ties and production disciplines. Thus each firm can regenerate meanings – the sets of stories and narratives marking networks and disciplines that also get eroded in the endless posturings that implement rhetorics. In the present article we explore some aspects of these problematics. We make theoretical hay out of the common-sense truism that organizations have identities. Our focus is how identities reshape as they take up strat-egies. We work on how network and institutional infrastructures impact the viabilities of strategic stances, along with rhetorics, and point out nesting...|$|R
