He {{attended}} Brown and Cornell University, and later returned to the former as a popular ethics professor and its consequent dean of admissions. In place of the popular elective system and science curriculum, he championed a Kantian style of education with unified knowledge, moral development, and pursuit of ideals, and a style of democratic governance where students would lead and reason through their own education. Meiklejohn saw democracy as something imparted and reconsidered by passing generations, {{and that it was}} borne in [...] "strong discussions around agreed terms".

2500|$|Ryan Green came up {{with the}} idea for the game when Joel was four. He and Amy, both devout Christians, felt that the <b>added</b> <b>years</b> they had with Joel from the {{original}} diagnosis were a miracle. Prior to the idea, Green had written some smaller games that were meant to be more emotional, such as Giga Wife, which demonstrated how one's interactions with a spouse could be negatively compared to a Tamagotchi-like game. While at church, Ryan {{came up with}} the idea for That Dragon, Cancer during their reflection on the past few years, specifically recalling one night at the hospital where he was trying to stop Joel from crying but anything he did seemed to make his crying worse; only after he sat down and prayed to God did Joel stop crying; Ryan recalled how that reminded him of a video game with subverted game mechanics. He wanted to relay his experiences of raising Joel to a larger audience, and felt that an interactive video game would be a better medium to express a message of grace. Ryan stated that with video games [...] "you can create this world and ask the player to live in it and love what you have created". The name of the game is taken from a story that the Greens had told their other sons about Joel's illness through an allegory about how Joel was a brave knight fighting a dragon named Cancer.|$|E

Introduction: One much-debated subject is the cost of <b>added</b> life <b>years.</b> Costs of <b>added</b> life <b>years</b> refer to the consumption subtracted by the production during the extra years that an individual lives due to a lifesaving intervention or drug. Discussion: If following a societal perspective in health economic evaluations all costs and benefits should be included, together with costs of <b>added</b> life <b>years.</b> Thereafter, the additional principles should be implemented in the decision together with ethical viewpoints. Conclusions: Many theoretical arguments exist for the inclusion of costs of <b>added</b> life <b>years</b> if following a societal perspective. The current estimates for these costs need to be updated and re-estimated. The labor market structure and consumption of pharmaceuticals has changed since the numbers were calculated and uncertainty should be taken into account...|$|R

One ("Lines written among the Euganean Hills".--Editor.), which I sent from Italy, was written after a day's excursion among those lovely mountains which surround {{what was once the}} retreat, and where is now the sepulchre, of Petrarch. If any one is inclined to condemn the insertion of the introductory lines, which image forth the sudden relief of a state of deep despondency by the radiant visions disclosed by the sudden burst of an Italian sunrise in autumn on the highest peak of those delightful mountains, I can only offer as my excuse, that they were not erased at the request of a dear friend, with whom <b>added</b> <b>years</b> of intercourse only add to my apprehension of its value, and who would have had more right than any one to complain, that she {{has not been able to}} extinguish in me the very power of delineating sadness.|$|E

60|$|Lord Raymond {{presented}} {{himself to the}} house with fearless confidence and insinuating address. After the Duke of----and Mr. Ryland had finished their speeches, he commenced. Assuredly he had not conned his lesson; and at first he hesitated, pausing in his ideas, and {{in the choice of}} his expressions. By degrees he warmed; his words flowed with ease, his language was full of vigour, and his voice of persuasion. He reverted to his past life, his successes in Greece, his favour at home. Why should he lose this, now that <b>added</b> <b>years,</b> prudence, and the pledge which his marriage gave to his country, ought to encrease, rather than diminish his claims to confidence? He spoke of the state of England; the necessary measures to be taken to ensure its security, and confirm its prosperity. He drew a glowing picture of its present situation. As he spoke, every sound was hushed, every thought suspended by intense attention. His graceful elocution enchained the senses of his hearers. In some degree also he was fitted to reconcile all parties. His birth pleased the aristocracy; his being the candidate recommended by Adrian, a man intimately allied to the popular party, caused a number, who had no great reliance either on the Duke or Mr. Ryland, to range on his side.|$|E

Moreover, my youth is past, and I have gone through experiences and bereavements of which you know nothing, that cause me to set a very slight value on life. I care little whether I die or continue in the world for some few <b>added</b> <b>years.</b> Lastly, the excitement of adventure has become a kind of necessity for me.

You are quite young. If you stay here and approach your father in a proper spirit, I have no doubt but that he will forget all the rough words he said to you the other day, for which indeed you know you gave him some provocation. Is it worth while throwing up such prospects and undertaking such dangers for the chance of finding a rare flower?

60|$|Adrian's {{soul was}} painted in his countenance, and {{concealment}} or deceit {{were at the}} antipodes to the dreadless frankness of his nature. Evadne made it her earnest request that the tale of their loves should not be revealed to his mother; and after for a while contesting the point, he yielded it to her. A vain concession; his demeanour quickly betrayed his secret to the quick eyes of the ex-queen. With the same wary prudence that characterized her whole conduct, she concealed her discovery, but hastened to remove her son from the sphere of the attractive Greek. He was sent to Cumberland; but the plan of correspondence between the lovers, arranged by Evadne, was effectually hidden from her. Thus the absence of Adrian, concerted {{for the purpose of}} separating, united them in firmer bonds than ever. To me he discoursed ceaselessly of his beloved Ionian. Her country, its ancient annals, its late memorable struggles, were all made to partake in her glory and excellence. He submitted to be away from her, because she commanded this submission; but for her influence, he would have declared his attachment before all England, and resisted, with unshaken constancy, his mother's opposition. Evadne's feminine prudence perceived how useless any assertion of his resolves would be, till <b>added</b> <b>years</b> gave weight to his power. Perhaps there was besides a lurking dislike to bind herself {{in the face of the}} world to one whom she did not love--not love, at least, with that passionate enthusiasm which her heart told her she might one day feel towards another. He obeyed her injunctions, and passed a year in exile in Cumberland.|$|E

60|$|Hester Prynne's term of {{confinement}} was now at an end. Her prison-door {{was thrown}} open, {{and she came}} forth into the sunshine, which, falling on all alike, seemed, to her sick and morbid heart, as if meant for no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast. Perhaps there was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from {{the threshold of the}} prison than even in the procession and spectacle that have been described, where she was made the common infamy, at which all mankind was summoned to point its finger. Then, she was supported by an unnatural tension of the nerves, and by all the combative energy of her character, which enabled her to convert the scene into a kind of lurid triumph. It was, moreover, a separate and insulated event, to occur but once in her lifetime, and to meet which, therefore, reckless of economy, she might call up the vital strength that would have sufficed for many quiet years. The very law that condemned her--a giant of stern features but with vigour to support, as well as to annihilate, in his iron arm--had held her up through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy. But now, with this unattended walk from her prison door, began the daily custom; and she must either sustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature, or sink beneath it. She could no longer borrow from the future to help her through the present grief. Tomorrow would bring its own trial with it; so would the next day, and so would the next: each its own trial, and yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne. The days of the far-off future would toil onward, still with the same burden for her to take up, and bear along with her, but never to fling down; for the accumulating days and <b>added</b> <b>years</b> would pile up their misery upon the heap of shame. Throughout them all, giving up her individuality, she would become the general symbol at which the preacher and moralist might point, and in which they might vivify and embody their images of woman's frailty and sinful passion. Thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her, with the scarlet letter flaming on her breast--at her, the child of honourable parents--at her, the mother of a babe that would hereafter be a woman--at her, who had once been innocent--as the figure, the body, the reality of sin. And over her grave, the infamy that she must carry thither would be her only monument.|$|E
