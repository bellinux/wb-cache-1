The BS was not alone; four other new tube railway companies were looking for investors– the Waterloo and City Railway (W), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE) and the Great Northern and City Railway (GN) (the three other companies that were put forward in bills in 1892) and the Central London Railway (CLR, which received royal assent in 1891). The original tube railway, the C, was also raising funds to construct extensions to its existing line. Only the W, which was the shortest line and was backed by the London and South Western Railway with a guaranteed dividend, was able to raise its funds without difficulty. For the BS and the rest, and others that came later, much of {{the remainder of the}} decade saw <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> find finance in an uninterested market.|$|E

25|$|The trade {{monopoly}} in the Faroe Islands was abolished in 1856, {{after which the}} area developed as a modern fishing nation with its own fishing fleet.

25|$|After {{having his}} ships {{refitted}} Knowles sailed on a cruise, hoping to intercept a Spanish treasure fleet off Cuba. On 30 September {{he fell in}} with HMS Lenox, under Captain Charles Holmes, who {{reported that he had}} encountered a Spanish fleet some days earlier. The fleet was sighted the next morning but confusion over signals and <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> keep the weather gauge meant that the British fleet failed to attack in an organised manner. Though the Battle of Havana ended with the capture of one Spanish ship and another being badly damaged, it was not the major British victory hoped for. Knowles was accused of badly mismanaging the action and faced a court martial in December 1749. The result was a reprimand for the poor tactics he employed, while several of the other captains involved were also reprimanded. There was considerable bad feeling between Knowles and his subordinates, and several challenges to duel were issued. In once instance Knowles exchanged shots with Holmes, and in another two of his captains, Innes and Clarke, duelled, which resulted in Innes being mortally wounded. King George II eventually intervened to forbid any more duels over the matter.|$|E
25|$|The {{first great}} {{expansion}} of the country came with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, which doubled the country's territory, but brought it into minor conflict with the colonies of Spain which eventually resulted in the acquisition of Spanish Florida. The Oregon Country gave the United States access to the Pacific Ocean, though it was shared for a time with the United Kingdom. The annexation of the Republic of Texas in 1845 led directly to the Mexican-American War, after which the victorious United States obtained Mexico's northwestern quarter, including what was quickly made the state of California. However, as {{the development of the}} country moved west, the question of slavery became too much to ignore, as there was <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> keep the number of northern abolitionist states equal to the number of southern slave states, with vigorous debate over whether the new territories would allow slavery and events such as the Missouri Compromise and Bleeding Kansas. This came to a head in 1860 and 1861, when the governments of the southern states proclaimed their secession from the country and formed the Confederate States of America. The American Civil War led to the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865 and the eventual readmission of the states to the United States Congress.|$|E

500|$|As the {{previous}} season's league champions, Manchester City were strong favourites, particularly as Leicester were embroiled in <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> avoid relegation from the First Division. The Times correspondent {{anticipated that the}} condition of the pitch would influence the match, stating that [...] "if — as it is said — it is in a good, lush state Manchester will be happy.

[...] Reuters reported erroneously that forty-one children had been massacred in Vukovar by Croatian soldiers; although the claim was retracted a day later, it was used by the Serbian media to justify military action against Croatia.

In 1233, he was {{selected}} to lead the ailing diocese of Dunblane in Scotland, and faced <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> bring the bishopric of Dunblane (or [...] "bishopric of Strathearn") to financial viability. This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been the entitlement of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the papal court in Rome. While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to Inchaffray Abbey. He also regained enough revenue to begin work on the new Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E

500|$|In January 1838, Smith, Elder & Co. advertised {{the first}} part of Darwin's geology book, Geological {{observations}} on volcanic islands and coral formations, as a single octavo volume to be published that year. By {{the end of the month}} Darwin thought that his geology was [...] "covering so much paper, & will take so much time" [...] that it could be split into separate volumes (eventually Coral reefs was published first, followed by Volcanic islands in 1844, and South America in 1846). He also doubted that the treasury funds could cover all the geological writings. The first part of the zoology was published in February 1838, but Darwin found it <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> get the experts to produce their reports on his collections, and overwork led to illness.

One of the few untitled servitors of George III to escape this fate was the treasurer Qutlu Arslan who now led a group of nobles and wealthy citizens in <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> limit the royal authority by creating a new council, karavi, whose members would alone deliberate and decide policy. This attempt at [...] "feudal constitutionalism" [...] was rendered abortive when Tamar had Qutlu Arslan arrested and his supporters were inveigled into submission. Yet, Tamar's first moves to reduce {{the power of the}} aristocratic élite were unsuccessful. She failed in her attempt to use a church synod to dismiss the Catholicos-Patriarch Michael, and the noble council, darbazi, asserted the right to approve royal decrees.

[...] Both men refused—they had no feeling for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending was unsuitable for musical theatre. [...] In addition, given the unstable wartime political situation, they might {{need to change the}} setting from Hungary while in rehearsal. [...] At the next luncheon, Helburn and Langner again proposed Liliom, suggesting that they move the setting to Louisiana and make Liliom a Creole. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein played with the idea over the next few weeks, but decided that Creole dialect, filled with [...] "zis" [...] and [...] "zose" [...] would sound corny and would make it difficult to write effective lyrics.|$|E
