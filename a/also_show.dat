50|$|The Ferguson Library <b>also</b> <b>shows</b> films.|$|R
5|$|Weather maps {{primarily}} use {{the station}} model to show surface weather conditions, but the model can <b>also</b> <b>show</b> the weather aloft {{as reported by}} a weather balloon's radiosonde or a pilot's report.|$|E
5|$|A {{flat-bottomed}} design {{made her}} well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and {{allowed her to}} be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her hull, internal floors, and futtocks were built from traditional white oak, her keel and stern post from elm, and her masts from pine and fir. Plans of the ship <b>also</b> <b>show</b> a double keelson to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.|$|E
5|$|Aviation {{interests}} {{have their own}} set of weather maps. One type of map shows where VFR (visual flight rules) are in effect and where IFR (instrument flight rules) are in effect. Weather depiction plots show ceiling height (level where {{at least half the}} sky is covered with clouds) in hundreds of feet, present weather, and cloud cover. Icing maps depict areas where icing can be a hazard for flying. Aviation-related maps <b>also</b> <b>show</b> areas of turbulence.|$|E

5|$|Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes {{are all in}} {{straightforward}} ternary or episodic form, {{sometimes with}} a coda. The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies {{and the use of}} drone basses. However, some <b>also</b> <b>show</b> unusual sophistication, for example Op.63 No.3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium. Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, although it should <b>also</b> <b>show</b> several major differences from them.|$|E
5|$|It {{is evident}} that the mandibles were highly specialized. Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia {{provides}} further evidence that the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual mouthparts of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other extinct species found in Burmese, French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which <b>also</b> <b>show</b> morphologies not seen in extant ants.|$|E

5|$|Lamps in {{this case}} <b>also</b> <b>show</b> how some of these {{experimental}} bulbs progressed into vacuum tubes {{that were used in}} radios and TVs. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that were in this display case. These were numbered 530 to 871.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the {{narrative}} <b>also</b> <b>show</b> similarity to Captain Blood, a novel by Rafael Sabatini, and to the film Restoration. In Captain Blood, the protagonist is transported as a prisoner to a new world colony for false crimes against the king. In Restoration, the king attempts to steal the affections of the protagonist's love interest. Both works are set within the general time period featured in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Proteasome inhibitors {{have also}} shown promise in {{treating}} autoimmune diseases in animal models. For example, studies in mice bearing human skin grafts found {{a reduction in}} the size of lesions from psoriasis after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. Inhibitors <b>also</b> <b>show</b> positive effects in rodent models of asthma.|$|E

5|$|S.e.caesia, {{the most}} {{widespread}} of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except for a white throat and cheeks. The other western forms mainly differ in the exact shade of the underparts, although some southeastern forms <b>also</b> <b>show</b> a white forehead and supercilium. S.e.sinensis and S.e.formosana, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.|$|E
5|$|Scent plays a {{significant}} role in olfactory communication. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may <b>also</b> <b>show</b> marking behaviour but less prominently than the males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{observations}} of the nearby SN PTF 11kx, discovered January 16, 2011 (UT) by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), lead {{to the conclusion that}} this explosion arises from single-degenerate progenitor, with a red giant companion, thus suggesting there is no single progenitor path to SN Ia. Direct {{observations of}} the progenitor of PTF11kx were reported in the August 24 edition of Science and support this conclusion, and <b>also</b> <b>show</b> that the progenitor star experienced periodic nova eruptions before the supernova - another surprising discovery.|$|E

5|$|Six {{subspecies}} {{are currently}} recognised, characterised principally by differences {{in size and}} plumage. There is a steady change to the birds' morphology and size the further south they are encountered, with lighter and more greyish plumage, larger body size, and a shorter bill. Southerly populations <b>also</b> <b>show</b> more white plumage in the tail, with less whiteness on the wing.|$|E
5|$|Some tables, {{including}} the one published by IUPAC refer to all lanthanides and actinides as being in group 3: 30 lanthanide and actinide elements together with scandium and yttrium. Lanthanides, as electropositive trivalent metals, all have a closely related chemistry, and all show many similarities to scandium and yttrium, but they <b>also</b> <b>show</b> additional properties characteristic of their partially filled f-orbitals which are not common to scandium and yttrium.|$|E
5|$|Surveys <b>also</b> <b>show</b> {{that green}} {{is the color}} most {{associated}} with the calm, the agreeable, and tolerance. Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, {{is the color of}} neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons. Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.|$|E
