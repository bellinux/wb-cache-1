5|$|The {{distribution}} of archaeological finds {{suggests that the}} western end of the river between Bath and Avonmouth formed <b>a</b> <b>border</b> between the Dobunni and Durotriges during the late Iron Age, prior to the Roman conquest of Britain. Further east, between Bath and what is now Wiltshire, it may also have formed <b>a</b> <b>border</b> of the territory ruled by the Belgae. After the Roman occupation the river formed a boundary between the lands of the Hwicce (which became Mercia) and the kingdom of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|A {{key issue}} facing Kenya was <b>a</b> <b>border</b> dispute in North East Province, {{alongside}} Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region {{and claimed that}} it should be part of Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta refused to accede to their demands, insisting that the land remain Kenyan. In June 1962 Kenyatta travelled to Mogadishu to discuss the issue with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement.|$|E

Then, CR106 splits Lake Welch in two different locations on the southern side of the lake. CR106 then begins its trek out of Harriman State Park and into the town of Stony Point.|$|E

5|$|Washington then {{relocated}} east to Missouri in the 1850s, {{where he}} remained {{for a few}} years and fought as <b>a</b> <b>Border</b> Ruffian during the Bleeding Kansas confrontations over slavery along the border between Kansas Territory and Missouri. While in Missouri, Washington wrote poetry and contributed to local newspapers. He returned to Virginia later in the 1850s. While in Virginia, Washington again applied for a military office in March 1855 under an expansion in the Regular Army after Congress added two new regiments to protect the large additional territory obtained from Mexico. By December 1855, Washington was in Kanawha County where he established a joint stock company to promote emigration to Kansas. He returned to Missouri in 1856, where he continued to serve as <b>a</b> <b>Border</b> Ruffian.|$|E
