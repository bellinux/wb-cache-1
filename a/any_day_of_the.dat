The Union Cabinet of India then amended the Indian Flag Code with effect from 26 January 2002, allowing private citizens to hoist the flag on <b>any</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, subject to their safeguarding the dignity, honour and respect of the flag. It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens, and should be interpreted in the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.|$|E

The Ohio Department of Transportation and West Virginia Division of Highways (ODOT and WVDOH) conduct surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume.

In 2012, they calculated that 26,500vehicles traveled along the highway at the eastern terminus in West Virginia, and 37,840vehicles used I-470 across the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge. As part of the Interstate Highway System, the entire route is listed on the National Highway System—a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.|$|E

Ozone concentration is measured as a maximum daily mean of 8 hour averages and the target should not be exceeded on more than 25 calendar days per year, starting from January 2010.

500|$|Sundials {{had been}} used for {{timekeeping}} since Ancient Egypt. Ancient dials were nodus-based with straight hour-lines that indicated unequal hours—also called temporary hours—that varied with the seasons. Every day was divided into 12equal segments regardless {{of the time of}} year; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. The sundial was further developed by Muslim astronomers. The idea of using hours of equal length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu'l-Hasan Ibn al-Shatir in 1371, based on earlier developments in trigonometry by Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī (Albategni). Ibn al-Shatir was aware that [...] "using a gnomon that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on <b>any</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year". His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept appeared in Western sundials starting in 1446.|$|E

She again performed [...] "Gypsy" [...] on a piano on a Saturday Night Live show later that month, wearing a rainbow colored leotard with giant shoulder pads. Around the one minute mark, when the tempo of the song changes from a ballad to its original anthemic composition, a band stepped onstage from the shadows behind as well as dancers, who danced and created a party atmosphere. Hillary Hughes of The Village Voice found similarities in Gaga's vocals to those of singer Lana Del Rey.

Rolling Stone said the film was [...] "the ultimate Saturday action matinee–a film so funny and exciting it can be enjoyed <b>any</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> week." [...] Bruce Williamson of Playboy claimed: [...] "There's more excitement in the first ten minutes of Raiders than any movie I have seen all year. By the time the explosive misadventures end, any movie-goer worth his salt ought to be exhausted." [...] Stephen Klain of Variety also praised the film. Yet, making an observation that would revisit the franchise with its next film, he felt that the film was surprisingly violent and bloody for a PG-rated film.|$|E
500|$|There {{were four}} main {{individual}} classifications contested in the 2015 Tour de France, {{as well as}} a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses returned to the Tour {{for the first time since}} the 2008 edition. For all stage finishes, excluding the two time trial stages, the three first finishers of stages earned bonuses of 10, 6 and 4 seconds respectively. Of the reintroduction, race director Christian Prudhomme said: [...] "We want to open up the race, we want the race to be decided on <b>any</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tour." [...] If a crash had happened within the final [...] of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey. Rain on the final stage forced the final times of the general classification to be taken on the first crossing of the finish line before the ten laps of the cobbled Champs-Élysées. Riders were required to cross the finish line on the final lap to receive their times.|$|E
