25|$|The axon is a finer, cable-like {{projection}} {{that can}} extend tens, hundreds, or even {{tens of thousands}} of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon carries nerve signals away from the soma (and also carries some types of information back to it). Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock.</b> Besides being an anatomical structure, the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon: in electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative action potential threshold. While the axon and <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.|$|E
25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the propagation of}} action potentials along axons and their termination at the synaptic knobs, {{it is helpful to}} consider the methods by which action potentials can be initiated at the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock.</b> The basic requirement is that the membrane voltage at the hillock be raised above the threshold for firing. There are several ways in which this depolarization can occur.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} that changes in {{dendritic}} excitability affect action potential back propagation. Action potentials begin near the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> and propagate {{down the length of}} the axon, but they also propagate backward through the soma into the dendritic arbor. Active back propagation is dependent on ion channels and changing the densities or properties of these channels can influence the degree to which the signal is attenuated. Plasticity of back-propagation in the dendrites occurs in less than one minute and lasts longer than 25 minutes. Back propagation is a method of signaling to the synapses that an action potential was fired. This is important for spike-timing-dependent plasticity.|$|E

Thy-1 has been suggested to interact with G inhibitory proteins, the Src family kinase (SFK) member c-fyn, and tubulin within lipid rafts. In rats and mice, Thy-1 protein is present on the soma (cell body) and dendrites of neurons but is not expressed on axons until axonal growth is complete, and is again temporarily suppressed during axonal injury.

25|$|Given its {{conservation}} throughout evolution, {{the action}} potential seems to confer evolutionary advantages. One function of action potentials is rapid, long-range signaling within the organism; the conduction velocity can exceed 110m/s, which is one-third {{the speed of}} sound. For comparison, a hormone molecule carried in the bloodstream moves at roughly 8m/s in large arteries. Part of this function is the tight coordination of mechanical events, such as the contraction of the heart. A second function is the computation associated with its generation. Being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with transmission distance, the action potential has similar advantages to digital electronics. The integration of various dendritic signals at the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation, {{one that has been}} exploited biologically to form central pattern generators and mimicked in artificial neural networks.|$|E
25|$|In the {{sympathetic}} ganglia, satellite glial cells {{are one of}} three main types of cells, the other two being {{the sympathetic}} ganglion neurons and small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells. SIF cells of sympathetic ganglia are separated into groups, {{each of which is}} surrounded by an SGC sheath. The SGCs of the sympathetic ganglia come from the neural crest and do not proliferate during embryonic development until the neurons are present and mature, indicating that the neurons signal the division and maturation of the SGCs. The SGCs of sympathetic ganglia follow the same basic structure as the SGCs of sensory ganglia, except that sympathetic ganglia also receive synapses. Therefore, the SGC sheath of sympathetic neurons must extend even further to cover the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> near the somata. Like the regions of the sheath near the glial nucleus, the regions of the sheath at the axon hillocks are thicker than those surrounding the rest of the neuron. This indicates that the SGCs {{play a role in the}} synaptic environment, thereby influencing synaptic transmission.|$|E

40|$|Cerebral peptide 2 (CP 2), a 41 {{amino acid}} neuropeptide, was {{identified}} {{because it was}} transported from the cerebral ganglia of Aplysia to other central ganglia. Immunocytology indicates that CP 2 is distributed widely in the CNS and peripheral tissues of Aplysia. Most CP 2 -immunoreactive neurons {{were found in the}} cerebral ganglia and extensively overlap with the distribution of cerebral peptide 1 (CP 1). HPLC analyses confirm that individual cerebral neurons synthesize both CP 1 and CP 2. In other ganglia, CP 1 and CP 2 are localized predominantly to different neurons. CP 2 -immunoreactive fibers and varicosities are present in the neuropil of all ganglia but were found surrounding cell bodies and <b>axon</b> <b>hillocks</b> most often in the buccal and abdominal ganglia. Thus, the effects of CP 2 on neurons in these ganglia were determined using intracellular recording. In the buccal ganglia, CP 2 evokes rhythmic activity in many motor neurons that seems similar to that observed during ingestion; however, only one identified neuron was found to be depolarized directly. By contrast, in the abdominal ganglion, many neurons are depolarized directly by CP 2. A number of these {{have been shown to be}} part of the circuit that regulates respiratory pumping. Injection of CP 2 into freely behaving Aplysia increases the rate of respiratory pumping and causes other changes in behavior.

25|$|A typical neuron {{is divided}} into three parts: the soma or cell body, {{dendrites}}, and axon. The soma is usually compact; the axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it. Dendrites typically branch profusely, getting thinner with each branching, and extending their farthest branches a few hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock,</b> and can extend for great distances, giving rise to hundreds of branches. Unlike dendrites, an axon usually maintains the same diameter as it extends. The soma may give rise to numerous dendrites, but never to more than one axon. Synaptic signals from other neurons are received by the soma and dendrites; signals to other neurons are transmitted by the axon. A typical synapse, then, is a contact between the axon of one neuron and a dendrite or soma of another. Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory. If the net excitation received by a neuron over {{a short period of time}} is large enough, the neuron generates a brief pulse called an action potential, which originates at the soma and propagates rapidly along the axon, activating synapses onto other neurons as it goes.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{flattened}} shape, satellite glial cells contain all common organelles {{necessary to}} make cellular products and to maintain the homeostatic environment of the cell. The plasma membrane of SGCs is thin and not very dense, and it is associated with adhesion molecules, receptors for neurotransmitters and other molecules, and ion channels, specifically potassium ion channels. Within individual SGCs, there is both rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, but the latter is much less abundant. Most often the Golgi apparatus and the centrioles in an SGC are found in a region {{very close to the}} cell’s nucleus. On the other hand, mitochondria are found throughout the cytoplasm along with the organelles involved in autophagy and other forms of catabolic degradation, such as lysosomes, lipofuscin granules, and peroxisomes. Both microtubules and intermediate filaments can be seen throughout the cytoplasm, and most often they lie parallel to the SGC sheath. These filaments are found in greater concentrations at the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> and at the beginning portion of an axon in an SGC of the sympathetic ganglia. In some SGCs of the sensory ganglia researchers have seen a single cilium that extends outward from the cell surface near the nucleus and into the extracellular space of a deep indentation in the plasma membrane. The cilium, however, only has the nine pairs of peripheral microtubules while it lacks the axial pair of microtubules, making its structure very similar to the cilia of neurons, Schwann cells, and astrocytes of the CNS.|$|E
2500|$|A typical action {{potential}} {{begins at the}} <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> with a sufficiently strong depolarization, e.g., a stimulus that increases Vm.

40|$|Frog retinal photoreceptors are {{favourable}} {{material for}} studying {{a number of}} unresolved issues concerning the interconnections, three-dimensional organization and functions of intracellular membrane systems in neurons. At least two distinct regions of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) are present in these cells. One region, the subellipsoid SER, is located in rod cells {{at the base of}} the mitochondria-rich ellipsoid region, and is comprised of arrays of stacked tubules which exhibit frequent continuities with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The subellipsoid SER is also present throughout the ellipsoid region and at the apex of the inner segment. The second region of SER, the axonal SER, is comprised of agranular sacs and tubules present in the axons of rod cells, the perinuclear and Golgi regions of rod and cone cells and the synaptic terminals of rod and cone cells. There sacs and tubules exhibit continuities with cisternae of RER and with the nuclear envelope. Serial section analyses indicate that this SER can extend as a continuous networking along the entire length of the rod axons and throughout synaptic terminals. The axonal SER is distinct from the subellipsoid SER not only in location and morphology but also in its ability to bind divalent lead ions, a property it shares with synaptic vesicles, with agranular sacs at one face to the Golgi apparatus and with sacs extending from the Golgi apparatus toward the <b>axons</b> <b>hillock.</b> These latter sacs may serve in transport from the Golgi region to the axon. The axons SER in the axon, terminals, and the perinuculear and Golgi regions appear to be a source of synaptic vesicles as evidenced by this lead binding capacity and by the observation of vesicles, with the size (50 - 75 nm) and appearance of synaptic vesicles, budding from SER in direct continuity, with RER. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in synaptic terminals of frog photoreceptors is not continuous with endocytic structures found in the same region, such as blunt-ended tubules or anastomosing networks of tubules. Nor does the ER acquire exogenous horseradish peroxidase. These observations suggest that the ER does not play a direct role in membrane recycling in photoreceptors...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the third}} paper in a series on the morphology, immunohistochemistry, and synaptology of the mormyrid electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). The ELL is a highly laminated, cerebellum-like {{structure}} in the rhombencephalon that subserves an active electric sense: Objects in the nearby environment are detected {{on the basis of}} changes in the reafferent electrosensory signals that are generated by the animal's own electric organ discharge. This paper concentrates on the intermediate (cell and fiber) layer of the medial zone of the ELL and pays particular attention to the large multipolar neurons of this layer (LMI cells). LMI cells are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic and have one axon and three to seven proximal dendrites that all become myelinated after their last proximal branching point. The axon projects to the contralateral homotopic region and has ipsilateral collaterals. Both ipsilaterally and contralaterally, it terminates in the deep and superficial granular layers. The myelinated dendrites end in the deep granular layer, where they most likely do not make postsynaptic specializations, but do make presynaptic specializations, {{similar to those of the}} LMI axons. Because it is not possible to distinguish between axonal and dendritic LMI terminals in the granular layer, the authors refer to both as LMI terminals. These are densely filled with small, flattened vesicles and form large appositions with ELL granular cell somata and dendrites with symmetric synaptic membrane specializations. LMI cells do not receive direct electrosensory input on their somata, but electrophysiological recordings suggest that they nevertheless respond strongly to electrosensory signals (Bell [1990] J. Neurophysiol. 63 : 303 - 318). Consequently, the authors speculate that the myelinated dendrites of LMI cells are excited ephaptically (i. e., by electric field effects) by granular cells, which, in turn, are excited via mixed synapses by mormyromast primary afferents. The authors suggest that this ephaptic activation of the GABAergic presynaptic terminals of the myelinated dendrites may trigger immediate synaptic release of GABA and, thus, may provide a very fast local feedback inhibition of the excited granular cells in the center of the electrosensory receptive field. Subsequent propagation of the dendritic excitation down the myelinated dendrites to the somata and <b>axon</b> <b>hillocks</b> of LMI cells probably generates somatic action potentials, resulting in the spread of inhibition through axonal terminals to a wide region around the receptive field center and in the contralateral ELL. Similar presynaptic myelinated dendrites that subserve feedback inhibition, until now, have not been described elsewhere in the brain of vertebrates...|$|R
2500|$|The excitability of a neuron at {{any point}} depends on the {{internal}} and external conditions of the cell at the time of stimulation. [...] Since a neuron typically receives multiple incoming signals at a time, the propagation of an action potential depends on the integration of all the incoming EPSPs and IPSPs arriving at the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock.</b> [...] If the summation of all excitatory and inhibitory signals depolarize the cell membrane to the threshold voltage, an action potential is fired. [...] Changing the intrinsic excitability of a neuron will change that neuron's function.|$|E
2500|$|The action {{potential}} generated at the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> propagates as a wave along the axon. The currents flowing inwards {{at a point}} on the axon during an {{action potential}} spread out along the axon, and depolarize the adjacent sections of its membrane. If sufficiently strong, this depolarization provokes a similar action potential at the neighboring membrane patches. This basic mechanism was demonstrated by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin in 1937. After crushing or cooling nerve segments and thus blocking the action potentials, he showed that an action potential arriving {{on one side of}} the block could provoke another action potential on the other, provided that the blocked segment was sufficiently short.* ...|$|E
2500|$|Once {{an action}} {{potential}} has {{occurred at a}} patch of membrane, the membrane patch needs time to recover before it can fire again. [...] At the molecular level, this absolute refractory period corresponds to the time required for the voltage-activated sodium channels to recover from inactivation, i.e., {{to return to their}} closed state. There are many types of voltage-activated potassium channels in neurons, some of them inactivate fast (A-type currents) and some of them inactivate slowly or not inactivate at all; this variability guarantees that there will be always an available source of current for repolarization, even if some of the potassium channels are inactivated because of preceding depolarization. On the other hand, all neuronal voltage-activated sodium channels inactivate within several millisecond during strong depolarization, thus making following depolarization impossible until a substantial fraction of sodium channels have returned to their closed state. Although it limits the frequency of firing, the absolute refractory period ensures that the action potential moves in only one direction along an axon. [...] The currents flowing in due to an action potential spread out in both directions along the axon. However, only the unfired part of the axon can respond with an action potential; the part that has just fired is unresponsive until the action potential is safely out of range and cannot restimulate that part. [...] In the usual orthodromic conduction, the action potential propagates from the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> towards the synaptic knobs (the axonal termini); propagation in the opposite direction—known as antidromic conduction—is very rare. [...] However, if a laboratory axon is stimulated in its middle, both halves of the axon are [...] "fresh", i.e., unfired; then two action potentials will be generated, one traveling towards the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> and the other traveling towards the synaptic knobs.|$|E
2500|$|In sensory neurons, action {{potentials}} {{result from}} an external stimulus. However, some excitable cells require no such stimulus to fire: They spontaneously depolarize their <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> and fire action potentials at a regular rate, like an internal clock. The voltage traces of such cells {{are known as}} pacemaker potentials. [...] The cardiac pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node in the heart provide a good example. Although such pacemaker potentials have a natural rhythm, it can be adjusted by external stimuli; for instance, heart rate can be altered by pharmaceuticals as well as signals from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The external stimuli do not cause the cell's repetitive firing, but merely alter its timing. In some cases, the regulation of frequency can be more complex, leading to patterns of action potentials, such as bursting.|$|E
2500|$|All {{cells in}} animal body tissues are {{electrically}} polarized – in other words, they maintain a voltage difference across the cell's plasma membrane, {{known as the}} membrane potential. [...] This electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between protein structures embedded in the membrane called ion pumps and ion channels. [...] In neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across {{different parts of the}} cell, giving the dendrites, axon, and cell body different electrical properties. [...] As a result, some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable (capable of generating action potentials), whereas others are not. [...] Recent {{studies have shown that the}} most excitable part of a neuron is the part after the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> (the point where the axon leaves the cell body), which is called the initial segment, but the axon and cell body are also excitable in most cases.|$|E
2500|$|Neurons are {{electrically}} excitable cells composed, in general, {{of one or}} more dendrites, {{a single}} soma, a single axon and one or more axon terminals. Dendrites are cellular projections whose primary function is to receive synaptic signals. Their protrusions, or spines, are designed to capture the neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron. They have a high concentration of ligand-gated ion channels. These spines have a thin neck connecting a bulbous protrusion to the dendrite. This ensures that changes occurring inside the spine are less likely to affect the neighboring spines. The dendritic spine can, with rare exception (see LTP), act as an independent unit. The dendrites extend from the soma, which houses the nucleus, and many of the [...] "normal" [...] eukaryotic organelles. Unlike the spines, the surface of the soma is populated by voltage activated ion channels. These channels help transmit the signals generated by the dendrites. Emerging out from the soma is the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock.</b> This region is characterized by having a very high concentration of voltage-activated sodium channels. In general, it is considered to be the spike initiation zone for action potentials. Multiple signals generated at the spines, and transmitted by the soma all converge here. Immediately after the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> is the axon. This is a thin tubular protrusion traveling away from the soma. The axon is insulated by a myelin sheath. Myelin is composed of either Schwann cells (in the peripheral nervous system) or oligodendrocytes (in the central nervous system), both of which are types of glial cells. Although glial cells are not involved with the transmission of electrical signals, they communicate and provide important biochemical support to neurons. To be specific, myelin wraps multiple times around the axonal segment, forming a thick fatty layer that prevents ions from entering or escaping the axon. This insulation prevents significant signal decay as well as ensuring faster signal speed. This insulation, however, has the restriction that no channels can be present {{on the surface of the}} axon. There are, therefore, regularly spaced patches of membrane, which have no insulation. These nodes of Ranvier can be considered to be [...] "mini axon hillocks", as their purpose is to boost the signal in order to prevent significant signal decay. At the furthest end, the axon loses its insulation and begins to branch into several axon terminals. These presynaptic terminals, or synaptic boutons, are a specialized area within the axon of the presynaptic cell that contains neurotransmitters enclosed in small membrane-bound spheres called synaptic vesicles.|$|E
2500|$|A typical neuron {{consists}} of a cell body (soma), dendrites, and an axon. The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly in its undifferentiated stage. Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending for hundreds of micrometers and branching multiple times, giving rise to a complex [...] "dendritic tree". An axon (also called a nerve fiber when myelinated) is a special cellular extension (process) that arises from the cell body at a site called the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> and travels for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species. Nerve fibers are often bundled into fascicles, and in the peripheral nervous system, bundles of fascicles make up nerves (like strands of wire make up cables). The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never {{to more than one}} axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates. At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. There are, however, many exceptions to these rules: for example, neurons can lack dendrites, or have no axon, and synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite.|$|E
2500|$|Action {{potentials}} {{are most}} commonly initiated by excitatory postsynaptic potentials from a presynaptic neuron. Typically, neurotransmitter molecules are {{released by the}} presynaptic neuron. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. [...] This binding opens various types of ion channels. This opening has the further effect of changing the local permeability of the cell membrane and, thus, the membrane potential. If the binding increases the voltage (depolarizes the membrane), the synapse is excitatory. If, however, the binding decreases the voltage (hyperpolarizes the membrane), it is inhibitory. [...] Whether the voltage is increased or decreased, the change propagates passively to nearby regions of the membrane (as described by the cable equation and its refinements). Typically, the voltage stimulus decays exponentially with {{the distance from the}} synapse and with time from the binding of the neurotransmitter. [...] Some fraction of an excitatory voltage may reach the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> and may (in rare cases) depolarize the membrane enough to provoke a new action potential. [...] More typically, the excitatory potentials from several synapses must work together at nearly the same time to provoke a new action potential. [...] Their joint efforts can be thwarted, however, by the counteracting inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.|$|E
2500|$|In sensory neurons, an {{external}} signal such as pressure, temperature, light, or sound is {{coupled with the}} opening and closing of ion channels, which in turn alter the ionic permeabilities of the membrane and its voltage. These voltage changes can again be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) and, in some sensory neurons, their combined effects can depolarize the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> enough to provoke action potentials. [...] Examples in humans include the olfactory receptor neuron and Meissner's corpuscle, which are critical for the sense of smell and touch, respectively. [...] However, not all sensory neurons convert their external signals into action potentials; some do not even have an axon! Instead, they may convert the signal into {{the release of a}} neurotransmitter, or into continuous graded potentials, either of which may stimulate subsequent neuron(s) into firing an action potential. [...] For illustration, in the human ear, hair cells convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of mechanically gated ion channels, which may cause neurotransmitter molecules to be released. In similar manner, in the human retina, the initial photoreceptor cells and the next layer of cells (comprising bipolar cells and horizontal cells) do not produce action potentials; only some amacrine cells and the third layer, the ganglion cells, produce action potentials, which then travel up the optic nerve.|$|E
2500|$|Each excitable {{patch of}} {{membrane}} has two important levels of membrane potential: [...] the resting potential, {{which is the}} value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell, and a higher value called the threshold potential. [...] At the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> of a typical neuron, the resting potential is around –70 millivolts (mV) and the threshold potential is around –55 mV. [...] Synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to depolarize or hyperpolarize; that is, they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall. [...] Action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold. [...] When an action potential is triggered, the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward and then equally abruptly shoots back downward, often ending below the resting level, where it remains for some period of time. [...] The shape of the action potential is stereotyped; that is, {{the rise and fall}} usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell. [...] (Exceptions are discussed later in the article). [...] In most neurons, the entire process takes place in about a thousandth of a second. [...] Many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second; some types, however, are much quieter, and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials.|$|E

50|$|The <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> is a {{specialized}} {{part of the}} cell body (or soma) of a neuron that connects to the axon.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{inhibitory}} postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are summed in the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> {{and once}} a triggering threshold is exceeded, an action potential propagates {{through the rest of}} the axon (and [...] "backwards" [...] towards the dendrites as seen in neural backpropagation). The triggering is due to positive feedback between highly crowded voltage-gated sodium channels, which are present at the critical density at the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> (and nodes of ranvier) but not in the soma.|$|E
5000|$|The {{different}} locations of type I and type II synapses divide a neuron into two zones: an excitatory dendritic tree and an inhibitory cell body. From an inhibitory perspective, excitation comes {{in over the}} dendrites and spreads to the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> to trigger an action potential. If the message is to be stopped, it is best stopped by applying inhibition on the cell body, close to the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> where the action potential originates. Another way to conceptualize excitatory-inhibitory interaction is to picture excitation overcoming inhibition. If the cell body is normally in an inhibited state, {{the only way to}} generate an action potential at the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> is to reduce the cell body’s inhibition. In this [...] "open the gates" [...] strategy, the excitatory message is like a racehorse ready to run down the track, but first the inhibitory starting gate must be removed.|$|E
50|$|The axon is a finer, cable-like {{projection}} {{that can}} extend tens, hundreds, or even {{tens of thousands}} of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon carries nerve signals away from the soma (and also carries some types of information back to it). Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock.</b> Besides being an anatomical structure, the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon: in electrophysiological terms it has the most negative action potential threshold. While the axon and <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.|$|E
50|$|In {{electrophysiological}} models, the <b>axon</b> <b>hillock</b> {{is included}} with the initial segment of the axon where membrane potentials propagate from synaptic inputs to the dendrites or cell body are summed.|$|E
