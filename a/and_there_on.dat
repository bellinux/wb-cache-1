25|$|In February 1944 the 56th FG began {{employing}} 150-gallon drop tanks on missions, {{enabling them}} to escort heavy bombers to the target area on deep penetration missions. The 56th was assigned a patrol sector west of Hanover {{in the vicinity of}} Dümmer Lake, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> four missions in February and March Johnson shot down eight more German planes to become the leading U.S. ace at the time. Johnson's 200-hour combat tour was nearly over and he applied for and was granted a 25-hour extension of his tour. Promoted to captain on March 15, he scored three more victories before being transferred to the 62nd Fighter Squadron to act as its operations officer (S-3).|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the British difficulties, {{the survivors of the}} Dutch fleet had few problems returning to the Texel, with the exception of Brutus. Admiral Bloys van Treslong had sailed for the coast off Hinder with two brigs, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> 13 October the 40-gun British frigate [...] under Captain Sir Thomas Williams found him. At 16:30, Endymion closed with the larger, but damaged, Dutch ship and opened fire, Brutus responding with a broadside of its own. Williams successfully raked his opponent twice, but the complicated tides of the Dutch coast dragged his ship out of range at 17:30 before he could press his attack any further. Firing rockets in the hope of attracting attention from any of Duncan's ships, Williams was rewarded at 22:30 by the arrival of Beaulieu. On 14 October the frigates hunted for their opponents, and found the Dutch ships off the Goeree channel at 05:00. The frigates closed, and Bloys van Treslong withdrew, passing deeper into Dutch waters and reaching safety at Maese by 07:00. The British frigates, their quarry having escaped, returned to Duncan's struggling fleet.|$|E

500|$|After {{assisting}} Roland, Blitz {{returned to}} Smyrna, before {{being sent to}} the Aegean Sea to represent German interests there. On 22 April 1868, she steamed to the Black Sea for another stint at Sulina. She proceeded up the Danube to Galați, <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> 2 May, she received the order to return to Germany. Blitz arrived in Stralsund on 3 July, where she was withdrawn from active duty. She underwent an extensive overhaul at the Königliche Werft in Danzig in 1869. Shortly after the start of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870, the gunboat was recommissioned on the 24th of the month. She was assigned to a gunboat flotilla commanded by KK Franz von Waldersee, along with the aviso [...] and the gunboats [...] and [...] On 12 August, Waldersee took his four vessels to Rügen, where they briefly engaged blockading French vessels before returning to port. On 10 September, the unit was disbanded, and Blitz was sent first to Kiel and then in October to Wilhelmshaven to strengthen the defenses of the Jade Bay. She remained there until the end of January 1871, when she and Drache steamed to Tönning; there, they towed several cannon-armed shallops back to Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 November 1844, {{while at}} anchor in the Bay of Islands, Mary Davis Wallis {{describes}} Kororarika [...] as a town [...] "which appears small, {{consisting of a}} few houses along the shore, and cottages scattered here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> {{the slope of the}} hills behind. Nothing is to be seen back of the town but lofty hills not particularly verdant." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{precursors}} to {{the modern}} football codes were highly popular in Anglesey. They had few rules, and were quite violent. Rhys Cox, {{at the turn of}} the 18th century, described a game in Llandrygan as ending with [...] "umbers of players... left here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the road, some having limbs broken in the struggle, others severely injured, and some carried on biers to be buried in the churchyard nearest to where they had been mortally injured." [...] William Bulkeley, in his April 1734 diary, records that the violence of such games left no hard feelings, with both sides parting [...] "as good friends as they came, after they had spent half an hour together cherishing their spirits with a cup of ale... having finished Easter Holydays innocently and merrily." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to these lighter tracks, some producers started focusing on darker, more aggressive sounds; this style became known as darkside hardcore, or darkcore. [...] Strange noises and effects, syncopated rhythms made from rearranged funk breaks and loud bass lines defined the genre. [...] Examples of darkcore include Goldie's [...] "Terminator" [...] (1992), and Top Buzz's [...] "Living In Darkness" [...] (1992). These took their cue from the darker sounds of 'Belgian Techno', as found in tracks such as Beltram's [...] "Mentasm" [...] and [...] "Energy Flash" [...] (1991), {{as well as the}} dark breaks of 4 Hero's [...] "Mr Kirks Nightmare" [...] (1990) among others. These tracks were not widely called jungle or drum and bass by the mainstream media at their time of creation (although the terms [...] "jungle" [...] and [...] "jungle techno" [...] were in common use in the rave scene by then, with [...] "drum & bass" [...] appearing here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> particular mixes of several vinyl releases), but they can nevertheless be found on later jungle and drum and bass compilations. The first major round-up of these tracks which was to use the term 'drum & bass' was probably [...] "The Dark Side - Hardcore Drum & Bass Style": a compilation on React Records, released March 1993, which featured both [...] "Here Comes The Drumz" [...] and [...] "Terminator".|$|E
