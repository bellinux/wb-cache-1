Possibly by commenting on certain things which could be described by some as venturing into territory that's been forbidden by the mainstream media, he has been thrown off over half a dozen shows. The shows he was either thrown off or has been forced to leave include WKBD Television in the early 1970s, and KLAV in 1993.

5000|$|By April 1998, {{diverted}} {{to some degree}} by the burgeoning Lewinsky scandal, Starr's investigations in Arkansas were winding down, with his Little Rock grand jury about to expire. Hubbell, Jim Guy Tucker, and Susan McDougal had all refused to cooperate with Starr. Tucker and McDougal were later pardoned by President Clinton. When the Arkansas grand jury did conclude its work in May 1998, after 30 months in panel, it came up with only a contempt indictment against Susan McDougal. Although she refused to testify under oath regarding the Clintons' involvement in Whitewater, Susan McDougal did make {{the case in the}} media that the Clintons had been truthful in their account of the loan, and had cast doubt on her former husband's motives for cooperating with Starr. She also claimed that James McDougal felt abandoned by Clinton, and told her [...] "he was going to pay back the Clintons". She said to the press, again not under oath, that her husband had told her that Republican activist and Little Rock lawyer, Sheffield Nelson, was willing to [...] "pay him some money" [...] for talking to the New York Times <b>about</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> and in 1992, he told her that one of Clinton's political enemies was paying him to tell the New York Times about Whitewater.|$|E

[...] When Fowler reminded Clinton that Purdum is married to his former press secretary, he responded: [...] "That's all right - he's still a scumbag" [...] and later added [...] "He's just a dishonest guy - can't help it." [...] Clinton went on to observe, [...] "It's all politics. It's all about the bias of the media for Obama. Don't think anything about it. But I'm telling ya, all it's doing is driving her supporters further and further away - because they {{know exactly what it}} is - this has been the most rigged coverage in modern history - and the guy ought to be ashamed of himself. But he has no shame. It isn't the first dishonest piece he's written about me or her."

At {{the dawn of the}} Clinton era, health care was poised {{to be one of the}} major issues of the coming decades. Health care costs were rising at a rapid rate and had been doing so for well over a decade. The number of uninsured was steadily rising, and the recession of 1990 - 91 had brought fears of uninsurance to the ranks of the middle class. Employers were increasingly shifting the costs of insurance to their employees, and employees were afraid to switch jobs for fear of losing their health insurance. Despite leading the world by a large margin in health care spending, health outcomes in the U. S. were no better than other developed countries in dimensions such as life expectancy and infant outcomes. This combination of rising costs, high uninsurance, and poor outcomes, led to a crisis mentality in the U. S. health care system Moreover, a defining political event of the early 1990 s brought health care to the national stage. The election of Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania on a platform of major health care reform showed that this was an issue the public cared <b>about.</b> Candidate <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> embraced health care reform. The public responded favorably. Public opinion polls showed that health care ranked third on the list of voter concerns in the 1992 election, behind the econom...|$|R
