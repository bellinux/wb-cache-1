40|$|Hepatitis delta {{frequently}} {{leads to}} liver cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation. As treatment options are limited, {{there is a}} need for biomarkers to determine disease activity and to predict the risk of disease progression. We hypothesized that <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> could represent such a marker. Samples of 120 HDV-infected patients recruited in an international multicenter treatment trial (HIDIT- 2) were studied. <b>Anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> testing was performed using ETI-DELTA-IGMK- 2 -assay (DiaSorin). In addition, fifty cytokines, chemokines and angiogenetic factors were measured using multiplex technology (Bio-Plex System). A second independent cohort of 78 patients was studied for the development of liver-related clinical endpoints (decompensation, HCC, liver transplantation or death; median follow up of 3. 0 years, range 0. 6 - 12). <b>Anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> serum levels were negative in 18 (15 %), low (OD< 0. 5) in 76 (63 %), and high in 26 (22 %) patients of the HIDIT- 2 cohort. <b>Anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> were significantly associated with histological inflammatory (p< 0. 01) and biochemical disease activity (ALT, AST p< 0. 01). HDV replication was independent from <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM,</b> however, low HBV-DNA levels were observed in groups with higher <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> levels (p< 0. 01). While high IP- 10 (CXCL 10) levels were seen in greater groups of <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> levels, various other antiviral cytokines were negatively associated with <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM.</b> Associations between <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> and ALT, AST, HBV-DNA were confirmed in the independent cohort. Clinical endpoints occurred in 26 <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> positive patients (39 %) but in only one <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> negative individual (9 %; p =  0. 05). Serum <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> is a robust, easy-to-apply and relatively cheap marker to determine disease activity in hepatitis delta which has prognostic implications. High <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> levels may indicate an activated interferon system but exhausted antiviral immunity...|$|E
40|$|Background: The role of anti-HDV {{immunoglobulin}} M (IgM) {{testing in}} patients receiving pegylated interferon-alpha therapy for hepatitis delta is unknown. We performed <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> testing in a well defined cohort of HDVinfected {{patients who were}} treated with pegylated interferon-alpha 2 a plus adefovir, or either drug alone. Methods: Sera from 33 HDV-RNA-positive patients from the international HIDIT- 1 trial were available for <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> testing (ETI-DELTA-IGMK- 2 assay, DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) before therapy, at treatment weeks 24 and 48, and at 24 weeks {{after the end of}} treatment. Results: <b>Anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> tested positive in 31 out of the 33 patients (94 %) prior to treatment. HDV IgM levels correlated with histological inflammatory activity (r= 0. 51, P< 0. 01) and were higher in patients with alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels above the median (P< 0. 05). Quantitative <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> values declined in patients responding to antiviral therapy, however <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> remained positive after treatment in the majority of virological responders. Conclusions: We suggest that <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> testing might give additional useful information to determine disease activity in hepatitis delta and to predict treatment response to antiviral therapy with type I interferons. However, determination of <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> can not substitute HDV RNA testing, which remains the primary virological marker for response to therapy...|$|E

40|$|The authors contributed {{equally to}} this work. Background: The {{epidemiology}} of hepatitis D virus (HDV) in China is fairly unknown. The mechanisms whereby HDV leads to accelerated liver disease in hepatitis B virus (HBV) /HDV co-infected patients and the histological characteristics of chronic hepatitis D (CHD) patients need further investigation. Methods: The prevalence of HDV was retrospectively evaluated in all consecutive hospitalized {{patients with chronic}} HBV infection from May 2005 to October 2011. HBV/HDV co-infected patients and HBV mono-infected patients were compared clinically and histologically. Significant histological abnormality was defined as significant necroinflammation (grade $A 2) and/or significant fibrosis (stage $ F 2). Results: 6. 5 % of patients (426 / 6604) tested positive for <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HDV.</b> HDV was more common in patients over 50 years old than those under 50 (11. 7 % vs. 5. 1 %, P, 0. 001).

40|$|A {{significant}} part of liver disease, once considered the result of infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV), {{are the result of}} infection HBV, and hepatitis delta virus (HDV). HDV is hepatotropic, defective RNA virus that requires obligatory HBV presence for its replication and the formation of infectious particles. About 10 % of patients with chronic HBsAg-positive hepatitis infected by HDV. HDV results in coinfection (simultaneous infection of HBV and HDV) and superinfection (HDV infection with chronic hepatitis B). The natural course of the infection is characterized by rapid progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Diagnosis of HDV-infection is based on the detection of delta antigen, antibodies to the virus (<b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> and IgG) and RNA HDV in serum. The effectiveness of antiviral therapy proved only on the treatment by interferon (IFN- 2 α and PEG-IFN- 2 α). The only way to protect against HDV infection is vaccination against hepatitis B. </strong...|$|E
40|$|In Brazil, {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) is only {{reported in}} Western Amazonia, where severe cases of acute and chronic HDV hepatitis have been described. The study area was chosen in the States of Acre and Rondonia where most cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) /HDV are reported. From December 2003 to October 2004, 40 HBsAg carriers with <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> were selected. An epidemiologic questionnaire, including demographic and clinical/epidemiologic variables was filled out. HDV amplification and genotyping were performed. Genotype I was detected in 22 patients (55. 0 %), whereas genotype III was identified in 18 (45. 0 %). Patients who were infected with genotype I were older (45. 1 +/- 17. 8 years) than patients infected with genotype III (32. 8 +/- 10. 9 years; P = 0. 01). No symptoms were reported by 21 (52. 5 %) patients. Otherwise, 19 (47. 5 %) had symptoms (fatigue, abdominal pain, weight loss, and decompensated liver disease) that motivated them to seek medical care. Genotype III carriers were more symptomatic, but no statistical significance was achieved. Our preliminary results show that HDV genotypes I and III are present in Brazilian Amazonia and that HDV genotype III {{is not limited to}} the Amerindian population...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{decreasing}} {{trend in}} hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection worldwide, {{the importance of}} this disease cannot be underestimated. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate patients positive for HBsAg with respect to HDV infection and related factors. Patients with chronic hepatitis B who presented at Hamedan Province Hepatitis Community Center in 2002 - 2007 were included. A questionnaire covering demographic variables and history of hepatic disease was completed for each patient. Necessary tests were performed and antibodies to HDV were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 81 HBsAg positive patients, 14 (17. 3 %) contained anti-HDV IgG. Only one of the patients with <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> was positive for HBsAg. Of the anti-HDV IgG positive patients, two (14. 3 %) were women. Among the women examined in this study, 24 (35. 8 %) were anti-HDV IgG negative (p = 0. 21), and of these, six (42. 8 %) were HBeAg positive while 17 (25. 4 %) of the anti-HDV IgG negative women were positive for HBeAg (p = 0. 16). The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B among anti-HDV IgG positive and negative patients was 28. 6 % and 39. 2 % respectively (p = 0. 31). Because of the relatively high rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV co-infection in our study subjects, it is vital that healthcare providers and policy makers to recognize the risk factors associated with this HBV and HDV co-infection as well as the reasons for this increased anti-HDV serology in HBV carriers...|$|E
40|$|Backgrounds and Aims: Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) is a {{defective}} ssRNA virus requiring {{the provision of}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) for packaging of new HDV virions. Since the epidemiological features of HDV {{in this part of}} Iran seem to be unknown, the aim of this research was to determine the seroprevalence of HDV of hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg+) in blood donors, injecting drug users, hemophiliacs, hemodialysis and thalassemic patients in the city of Tabriz in northwestern Iran. Methods: The numbers of patients who were screened in the years 2006 - 2007 were 100 hemodialysis patients, 165 blood donors and 90 intravenous drug users, or a total of 355 patients who were HBsAg+ and randomly selected at the Tabriz Regional Educational Blood Center. Anti-HDV antibodies (IgM), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in serum samples were measured. Results: Eight of the hemodialysis patients (8 %), 3 of the 165 blood donors (1. 8 %) and 9 intravenous drug addicts (10 %) were HDV-IgM antibody-positive. Out of 152 serum samples collected in the hemophiliac population, only 11 samples were HBsAg+ (7. 23 %), and <b>anti-HDV</b> <b>IgM</b> antibodies were detected in just 2 cases. Also out of 112 thalassemic patients ’ sera specimens, only 2 samples was HBsAg+, and HDV-IgM antibodies were negative. The seropositivity of anti-HDV antibodies was 6. 01 %. The study of serum ALT levels in HBV-positive and HDV-positive patients showed obvious elevation in more than 95 % of cases. Conclusions: The results show the endemicity of HDV infection in Tabriz. HDV infection in Iran could be controlled by nationwide HBV vaccination...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV) {{is largely}} {{responsible}} for water borne epidemics in many developing countries. The principle mode of HEV transmission is the fecal oral route in epidemic and sporadic forms with a high case fatality ratio in pregnant women. Serum samples from 50 healthy subjects and from 435 acute viral hepatitis patients, 4 - 75 years old, were screened for markers of acute viral hepatitis. These included (HBsAg, anti-HBc (IgM), <b>anti-HDV</b> (<b>IgM),</b> HAV (IgM), anti-HCV (IgG), and anti-HEV (IgG), and (IgM) tests by enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIA). Furthermore isolation of HEV from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from stools belonging to anti-HEV IgG-positive patients was attempted by inoculation of HepG 2 and Vero cell line cultures. The inoculated cell cultures were examined after immunoperoxidase staining {{for the detection of}} HEV antigen. Plasma, lymphocytes and stool samples from anti-HEV IgM positive patients were examined for HEV RNA by PCR. Anti-HEV IgG was found in 144 / 435 (33 %) of these acute hepatitis patients. Anti-HEV (IgM) was detected in 8 / 52 (15. 4 %) out of 52 chosen from the 144 sera that were anti-HEV IgG positive cases. HEV was isolated in HepG 2 from 32. 6 % of lymphocyte and from 34. 9 % of stools from patients positive for anti-HEV (IgG). While it was isolated from 71. 4 % of lymphocytes and from 100 % of stools from patients positive for anti-HEV (IgM). In Vero cell cultures there was no HEV isolation from stools but HEV was isolated from 50 % of lymphocytes. HEV RNA was detected by PCR in 85. 7 % of stools, 62. 5 % of plasma, and in 37. 5 % of lymphocyte samples belonging to anti-HEV IgM positive cases. Analysis of these diagnostic tests indicated that virus isolation from peripheral blood lymphocytes and stools by inoculation of HepG 2 cell cultures is more sensitive than virus-RNA detection by PC...|$|E
