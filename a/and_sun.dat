5|$|The Battle of Red Cliffs, {{otherwise}} known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought {{at the end of}} the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei <b>and</b> <b>Sun</b> Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei <b>and</b> <b>Sun</b> Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei <b>and</b> <b>Sun</b> Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved.|$|E

5|$|The use of {{the lion}} <b>and</b> <b>sun</b> symbol in a flag is first attested in a {{miniature}} painting illustrating a copy of Shahnameh Shams al-Din Kashani, an epic on Mongol conquest, dated 1423. The painting depicts several (Mongul?) horsemen approaching the walled city of Nishapur. One of the horsemen carries a banner that bears a lion passant with a rising sun on its back. The pole is tipped with a crescent moon. By {{the time of the}} Safavids (1501–1722), and the subsequent unification of Iran as a single state, the lion <b>and</b> <b>sun</b> had become a familiar sign, appearing on copper coins, on banners, and on works of art.

5|$|As {{animals at}} {{the summit of the}} food chain, bears do not have many predators. The most {{important}} are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease. The tiger is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys on adult bears, including brown bears, sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, <b>and</b> <b>sun</b> bears.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submerged.

5|$|Characteristics often vary by habitat, between shade-dwelling genera (such as Prosartes, Tricyrtis, Cardiocrinum, Clintonia, Medeola, Prosartes, and Scoliopus) <b>and</b> <b>sun</b> loving genera.
