From 1942 to 1948 he published articles on such diverse subjects as water, bees, sheep, fishing, and whale hunting in prehistory.

25|$|Sanders {{continued}} to publish books and <b>articles</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> field, {{and was soon}} joined by the scholar James D. G. Dunn. In 1982 Dunn labelled the movement the “new perspective on Paul”. The work of these writers inspired {{a large number of}} scholars to study, discuss, and debate the relevant issues. Many books and articles dealing with the issues raised have since been published. The Anglican Bishop and theologian N. T. Wright has written a large number of works aimed at popularising the “new perspective” outside of academia.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1930s, outspoken {{opposition}} towards the granting of Dominion status to India became one of Churchill's major political focuses. Churchill was one of the founders of the India Defence League, a group dedicated to the preservation of British power in India. In speeches and press <b>articles</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, he forecast widespread British unemployment and civil strife in India should independence be granted. The Viceroy, Lord Irwin, who had been appointed by the prior Conservative Government, engaged in the First Round Table Conference in early 1931 and then announced the Government's policy that India should be granted Dominion Status.

He {{published a}} second collection of articles, The Pump House Gang, in 1968. Wolfe wrote on popular culture, architecture, politics, and other topics that underscored, among other things, how American life in the 1960s had been transformed by post-WWII economic prosperity. His defining work from this era is The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (published {{the same day as}} The Pump House Gang in 1968), which for many epitomized the 1960s. Although a conservative in many ways (in 2008, he claimed never to have used LSD and to have tried marijuana only once) Wolfe became one of the notable figures of the decade.|$|E

2500|$|The {{paper in}} {{question}} has, however, not been withdrawn by the journal. Later, {{the editor-in-chief of}} the journal issued a slightly different statement {{on behalf of the}} Institute of Physics, which owns the journal, in which he insisted on the fact that their usual peer-review procedures had been followed, but no longer commented on the value of the paper. In particular the sentences [...] "...it does not meet the standards expected of <b>articles</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> journal" [...] and [...] "The paper was discussed extensively at the annual Editorial Board meeting ... and there was general agreement that it should not have been published" [...] were removed. [...] The former phrase was, however, quoted in the New York Times, the Chronicle of Higher Education and Nature.

Many of these are elaborate papers. The first volume contains a paper on the theory of the propagation of sound; in this he indicates a mistake made by Newton, obtains the general differential equation for the motion, and integrates it for motion in a straight line. This volume also contains the complete solution of the problem of a string vibrating transversely; in this paper he points out a lack of generality in the solutions previously given by Brook Taylor, D'Alembert, and Euler, and arrives at the conclusion that the form of the curve at any time t is given by the equation [...] The article concludes with a masterly discussion of echoes, beats, and compound sounds.

60|$|More untimely, in one sense, {{than any}} other was the death of Professor Clifford, whose <b>articles</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> Review {{attracted}} so much attention, and I fear that I may add, gave for a season so much offence {{six or seven years}} ago. Cairnes was scarcely fifty when he died, and Bagehot was fifty-one, but Clifford was only four-and-thirty. Yet in this brief space he had not merely won a reputation as a mathematician of the first order, but had made a real mark on his time, both by the substance of his speculations in science, religion, and ethics, and by the curious audacity with which he proclaimed at the pitch of his voice on the housetops religious opinions that had hitherto been kept among the family secrets of the domus Socratica. It is melancholy to think that exciting work, done under pressure of time of his own imposing, should have been the chief cause of his premature decline. How intense that pressure was the reader may measure by the fact that a paper of his on The Unseen Universe, which filled eighteen pages of the Review, was composed at a single sitting that lasted from a quarter to ten in the evening till nine o'clock the following morning. As one revolves these and other names of eminent men who actively helped to make the Review what it has been, {{it would be impossible to}} omit the most eminent of them all. Time has done something to impair the philosophical reputation and the political celebrity of J.S. Mill; but it cannot alter the affectionate memory in which some of us must always hold his wisdom and goodness, his rare union of moral ardour with a calm and settled mind. He took the warmest interest In this Review from the moment when I took it up, partly from the friendship with which he honoured me, but much more because he wished to encourage what was then--though it is now happily no longer--the only attempt to conduct a periodical on the principles of free discussion and personal responsibility. While recalling these and others who are no more, it was naturally impossible for me to forget the constant and valuable help that has been so freely given to me, often at much sacrifice of their own convenience, by those friends and contributors who are still with us. No conductor ever laid down his bâton with a more cordial and sincere sense of gratitude to those who took their several parts in his performance.|$|E
