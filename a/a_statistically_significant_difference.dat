The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E

25|$|It was reported, in 1979, {{that there}} is a {{possible}} link between HSV-1 and Alzheimer's disease, in people with the epsilon4 allele of the gene APOE. HSV-1 appears to be particularly damaging to the nervous system and increases one’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The virus interacts with the components and receptors of lipoproteins, which may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease. This research identifies HSVs as the pathogen most clearly linked to the establishment of Alzheimer’s. According to a study done in 1997, without the presence of the gene allele, HSV-1 does not appear to cause any neurological damage or increase the risk of Alzheimer’s. However, a more recent prospective study published in 2008 with a cohort of 591 people showed <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> between patients with antibodies indicating recent reactivation of HSV and those without these antibodies in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease, without direct correlation to the APOE-epsilon4 allele.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of serum gonadotropin and total testosterone levels on semen parameters. Materials and Methods: Three hundred and eighty-two patients that applied to a male infertility polyclinic were included in our study. Serum gonadotropin and total testosterone levels and semen parameters of the patients were analyzed during the first visit to the clinic. The reference FSH value was 1. 5 - 12. 4 mIU/mL, that of LH was 1. 7 - 8. 6 mIU/mL and the reference value for total testosterone was 249 - 836 ng/dL. Results: While there was no <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> between the patients with low gonadotropin levels and the controls regarding any of the semen parameters (p > 0. 05), there was <b>a</b> strong <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> between the patients with high gonadotropin levels and the controls regarding sperm concentration (p = 0. 000), total motility (p = 0. 000), progressive motility (p = 0. 000), and morphology (p = 0. 000). There was <b>a</b> strong <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> between the patients with low testosterone levels and the controls regarding total motility (p = 0. 012) and progressive motility (p = 0. 010), and <b>a</b> weak <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in morphology (p = 0. 042).

Methods: A search was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials, uncontrolled clinical trials, case series and cross-over studies involving exercise interventions that included a combination of aerobic and strength components, either in circuit-mode or in sequence for people with SCI. Methodological quality was independently rated using the PEDro scale and key findings were extracted from trials by two reviewers. Results: The search identified 7981 abstracts, from which nine trials met the inclusion criteria.
