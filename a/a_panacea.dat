5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|The legendary herb {{has entered}} the modern Bulgarian {{vocabulary}} {{as a metaphor for}} a magic key or <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> in the wider sense. The phrase “to find the razkovniche” („да намериш разковничето“ „da namerish razkovnicheto“) means to find the solution to a certain problem, usually a complex or difficult one. Razkovniche is also the common Bulgarian name for the plant European waterclover (Marsilea quadrifolia) which, in its appearance, has many similarities with the descriptions of the mythical raskovnik. In eastern Serbia, raskovnik also refers to a specific plant used in vernacular medicine, namely Laserpitium siler.|$|E

25|$|The Congress {{concluded}} that the multiple-use concept presented new challenges and new opportunities to foresters everywhere, with great prospects for additional services {{to the welfare of}} mankind.

Moreover, there can be disadvantages to multiple use when it is inefficiently applied. But multiple use must be recognized as an important goal of forest policies.|$|E
25|$|The key to {{the early}} renown of the raintree stemmed from the {{apocryphal}} story that it was <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> for drought stricken districts through the ability of its leaves to condense moisture out of the air, retain it in large quantities and then expel it through its leaves and trunk. This story, and how it had been disproved, was discussed in two 1911 articles from the Port Douglas and Mossman Record. Otherwise it was seriously considered as a useful crop for the fodder its large seed pods provided for cattle.|$|E

25|$|Perception {{surrounding}} smoking has varied {{over time}} and {{from one place to}} another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> and deadly health hazard. In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage use, limit ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.|$|E

25|$|In 1580, a miner named Adreas Berthold {{traveled}} around Germany selling Silesian terra sigillata {{made from a}} special clay dug from the hills outside the town of Striga, now Strzegom, Poland, and processed into small tablets. He promoted it as <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> effective against every type of poison and several diseases, including plague. Berthold invited authorities to test it themselves. In two cases, physicians, princes and town leaders conducted trials involving dogs who were either given poison followed by the antidote or poison alone; the dogs who got the antidote lived and the dogs who got the poison alone died. In 1581, a prince tested the antidote on a condemned criminal, who survived.|$|E
25|$|Custom-compounded BHRT is a {{practice}} almost wholly {{restricted to the}} United States. BHRT {{is a form of}} alternative medicine, and has been promoted as <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> for many diseases {{in addition to being a}} means of relieving the symptoms of menopause and/or reducing the risk of osteoporosis (historically, the goals of hormone replacement therapy in allopathic medicine). There is little evidence to support many of these claims; the hormones are expected to have the same risks and benefits of comparable approved drugs for which there is an evidence base and extensive research and regulation. The exception is progesterone, which may have an improved safety profile than artificial progestogens, though direct comparisons with progestins have not been made. Risks associated with the process of compounding bioidentical hormones are not clearly understood. In addition, the accuracy and efficacy of saliva testing has not been definitively proven, and the long-term effects of using blood testing to reach target levels of hormones have not been researched.|$|E
25|$|Since its discovery, vitamin C {{has been}} {{considered}} almost <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> by some, although this led to suspicions of it being overhyped by others. Vitamin C has been promoted in alternative medicine {{as a treatment for}} the common cold, cancer, polio and various other illnesses. The evidence for these claims is mixed. Orthomolecular-based megadose recommendations for vitamin C are based mainly on theoretical speculation and observational studies, such as those published by Fred R. Klenner from the 1940s through the 1970s. There is a strong advocacy movement for such doses of vitamin C, and there is an absence of large scale, formal trials in the 10 to 200+ grams per day range. The single repeatable side effect of oral megadose vitamin C is a mild laxative effect if the practitioner attempts to consume too much too quickly. A tolerable upper limit (UL) of vitamin C was set at 2grams {{for the first time in}} the year 2000, referencing this mild laxative effect as the reason for establishing the UL.|$|E

500|$|Aboriginal {{groups are}} seeking to {{preserve}} their folkways and languages {{as well as to}} return to, or remain on, their traditional lands. Eco-tourism, sewing and selling carvings, jewelry and music have become viable areas of economic opportunity. However, tourism-based commercial development, such as the creation of Taiwan Aboriginal Culture Park, is not <b>a</b> <b>panacea.</b> Although these create new jobs, aborigines are seldom given management positions. Moreover, some national parks have been built on aboriginal lands against the wishes of the local communities, prompting one Taroko activist to label the Taroko National Park as a form of [...] "environmental colonialism". At times, the creation of national parks has resulted in forced resettlement of the aborigines.|$|E

The idea of alternative tourism was discussed. Several towns in Basse Casamance, including Carabane, were selected to test an integrated agritourism managed by the villagers themselves. In the early 1970s, the agritourism promoter Christian Saglio, a young French sociologist who later became the director of the Leopold Sedar Senghor French Institute in Dakar, believed in Carabane's potential. He stated that he wanted to make the island the [...] "Gorée of Casamance", using it as a hub for other camps. Saglio suggested the restoration of old buildings and canopy beds.|$|E
500|$|With the Webster-Ashburton Treaty {{ratified}} in 1843, Tyler {{was ready}} to make the annexation of Texas his [...] "top priority". Representative Thomas W.

In a widely circulated open letter, understood as an announcement of the executive branch's designs for Texas, Gilmer described Texas as <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> for North-South conflict and an economic boon to all commercial interests. The slavery issue, however divisive, would be left for the states to decide as per the US Constitution. Domestic tranquility and national security, Tyler argued, would result from an annexed Texas; a Texas left outside American jurisdiction would imperil the Union. Tyler adroitly arranged the resignation of his anti-annexation Secretary of State Daniel Webster, and on June 23, 1843 [...] appointed Abel P. Upshur, a Virginia states' rights champion and ardent proponent of Texas annexation. This cabinet shift signaled Tyler's intent to pursue Texas annexation aggressively.|$|E

500|$|Until its {{discovery}} and importation from the New World, tobacco was unknown to western medicine. [...] Europeans were not {{ignorant of the}} effects of smoke; incense has been used since antiquity, and the psychoactive effects of burning hemp seed was well known by the Scythians and Thracians. [...] The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates recommended the inhalation of smoke for [...] "female diseases" [...] as did Pliny the Elder, as a cure for coughs. [...] The Native Americans from whom the first western explorers learnt about tobacco used the leaf for a variety of purposes, including religious worship, but Europeans soon became aware that the Americans also used tobacco for medicinal purposes. [...] The French diplomat Jean Nicot used a tobacco poultice as an analgesic, and Nicolás Monardes advocated tobacco as a treatment for a long list of diseases, such as cancer, headaches, respiratory problems, stomach cramps, gout, intestinal worms and female diseases. [...] Contemporaneous medical science placed much weight on humorism, and for a short period tobacco became <b>a</b> <b>panacea.</b> [...] Its use was mentioned in pharmacopoeia as a tool against cold and somnolence brought on by particular medical afflictions, its effectiveness explained by its ability to soak up moisture, to warm parts of the body, and to therefore maintain the equilibrium so important to a healthy person. [...] In an attempt to discourage disease tobacco was also used to fumigate buildings.|$|E
