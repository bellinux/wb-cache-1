5|$|Animaniacs is {{a variety}} show, with short skits {{featuring}} a large cast of characters. While the show had no set format, {{the majority of}} episodes were composed of three short mini-episodes, each starring <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> characters, and bridging segments. Hallmarks of the series included its music, character catchphrases, and humor directed at an adult audience.|$|E

The relationship between Shepard and Liara can vary depending on whether they were romantically involved in the original Mass Effect. The mission includes two bosses and a chase scene in which the player must control a high-speed vehicle through the skies of a city. The player may also find numerous in-game upgrades that enhance aspects of the game's weapons and armor.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Clans' territories lies a {{mountain}} range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water. The Tribe {{is shown to}} be similar to the Clans, yet follows <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe, and the prey-hunters hunt.The Tribe was formed by the Ancients when they left the lake to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.|$|E

5|$|Half-Life: Decay is a multiplayer-only {{expansion}} {{pack for}} Valve Software's first-person shooter Half-Life. Developed by Gearbox Software {{and published by}} Sierra On-Line, Decay was released {{as part of the}} PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life in 2001. It is the third expansion pack for Half-Life, and like its predecessors, Decay returns to the setting and timeline of the original story, albeit portraying the story from the viewpoint of <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> protagonists: two women scientists working in the Black Mesa Research Facility. Decay is a cooperative multiplayer game, designed to be played by two people working together to pass through the game's levels.|$|E
5|$|Hitmaker {{had tried}} to develop an on-line version of Crazy Taxi, to be called Crazy Taxi Next {{exclusively}} for the Xbox, which, besides multiplayer game modes, would have included night and day cycles, each with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> passengers and destinations, while reusing and graphically updating the maps from Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2. Ultimately, both multiplayer and day/night cycles were dropped and work on Crazy Taxi Next was transferred to Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller, which included some of the nighttime driving concepts suggested by Next.|$|E

5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 28 games {{distributed}} on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were {{included with the}} console—a set of 12 in America and <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 10 in other countries—with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in a pack for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, Percepts, was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, Shooting Gallery, was available for purchase, and included four games on two cards that used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry. The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is left up to the players.|$|E
5|$|Decay {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and timeframe as Half-Life. Half-Life takes place at a laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility, situated in a remote desert in New Mexico. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. Like the previous expansions, Decay shows the story of Half-Life from the perspective of <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> protagonists. In Decay, players assume the roles of Colette Green and Gina Cross, two doctors who work in the same labs as Freeman, analyzing anomalous materials and specimens retrieved from Xen in prior teleportation experiments. After the experiment that causes the alien invasion takes place, Green and Cross must work with two ranking members of the science team, Dr. Richard Keller and Dr. Rosenberg, to contain and stabilize the deteriorating situation in Black Mesa.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to restricting photography of public art, closing {{a public park}} for a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both occasions, {{as one of the}} park's primary attractions, Cloud Gate was the focus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent most venues in the park including Cloud Gate on AT Plaza from 6a.m. to 11p.m. On August 7, 2006, Allstate paid $700,000 to rent the park. For this price, Allstate acquired the visitation rights to <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> features and only had exclusive access to Cloud Gate after 4p.m. These corporate closures denied tourists access to Kapoor's public sculpture, and commuters who walk through the park were forced to take alternative routes. City officials stated that the money would help finance free public programs in Millennium Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player campaign, Revelations offers a more action-oriented mode, called Raid Mode, where one or two players may fight {{their way through a}} selection of altered scenarios from the single-player campaign. These usually feature enemies of varying power for the player to defeat. Once a scenario has been completed, the player is rewarded with experience and battle points that can be exchanged for various weapons and items at a store. Gaining experience and acquiring new equipment allow players to progress to higher and more challenging scenarios. As the player progresses throughout the game, the player may also unlock numerous characters for use in both the single-player campaign and Raid Mode, with each character having <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> abilities and melee attack. The game supports a StreetPass functionality that allows different players to exchange items for use in the game.|$|E
5|$|Mass Effect 2 is a single-player action {{role-playing}} game {{in which}} the player takes the role of Commander Shepard through a third-person perspective. Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat-training and first name {{are determined by the}} player before the game begins. The player may choose to import a character from a completed saved game of the original Mass Effect or start the game with a new character. Importing an old character allows several decisions the player made in the original game to impact the story of Mass Effect 2 and grants the player a set of starting bonuses. The game features six different character classes for the player to choose from. Each class is proficient in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> powers and weapon types. For example, the Vanguard class is specialized in close-range combat and shotguns, while the Infiltrator class relies on stealth combat and the use of sniper rifles.|$|E

5|$|The episodes all contain <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> {{enemies in}} their levels, which the player must kill, stun, or avoid. These enemies are {{typically}} aliens or robots. Levels can also include hazards, such as electricity or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen {{to lose a}} life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Invasion of the Vorticons features a raygun that Keen can use ammo for to kill enemies; Keen Dreams exchanges this for flower power pellets that temporarily stun enemies when thrown, episodes four through six use a stun gun that permanently stuns enemies, and the 2001 Commander Keen has a stun gun that temporarily stuns enemies unless they are then killed with a pogo jump. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, collectable items that award an extra life beginning with episode four, and items that grant an instant extra life.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battlefield, with {{objectives}} which range from clearing enemy groups to capturing points of importance. Each map has unique terrain to be negotiated in battle ranging from mountains to rivers and flat plains. Viewed from an overhead perspective, there are castles and locations such as shops that the player can visit, the latter of which provides a means for obtaining items. Each chapter has <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> victory conditions, which {{can be related to}} the number of turns taken or how the enemy force is dealt with. Battles play out using a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During battle, the combat screen appears, showing the fight from a sidelong perspective. Both sides move at least once, after which the combat screen fades. Battles between individual units are governed by the series' recurring Weapons Triangle, a rock–paper–scissors system where certain weapons have advantages over others — lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. As they participate in battles, each unit gains experience points (EXP) from their actions: they raise their experience level by one when they have accumulated 100 EXP. EXP can be earned in both normal battles and challenge fights in special arenas. Players can save {{at the end of each}} chapter or outside battle. They also have a single mid-chapter save available. All units are subject to permanent death: If a unit dies in battle, they are removed from the rest of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the episodes}} contain <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> enemies in their levels, which the player must stun or avoid. The first episode {{contains}} {{a variety of}} alien creatures, including large slugs, giant bouncing mushrooms, and flying bats, while the second contains different types of robots and alien energy beings. Levels can also include hazards, such as dart traps or fire; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. The episodes feature three difficulty settings, which change the number and types of enemies present. While Vorticons contained a raygun and the in-between episode Commander Keen in Keen Dreams had pellets that temporarily stunned enemies, Goodbye, Galaxy features a stun gun that knocks out most enemies permanently using ammo found throughout the game. Different enemies take differing numbers of shots to kill, {{or in some cases}} are immune. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. The first episode also contains water droplets which award an extra life for every 100 drops, and the second green drinks which do the same. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, and items which instantly grant an extra life.|$|E

5|$|The low foot {{to lower}} leg ratio in Deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short {{metatarsus}} (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom {{suggested that the}} short metatarsus {{may be related to}} the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features– the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.– as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of Deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.|$|E
5|$|The turn of {{the decade}} brought Scorsese's {{black-and-white}} Raging Bull (cowritten by Schrader); an acknowledged masterpiece—the American Film Institute ranks it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time—it is also a retreat, telling {{a story of a}} boxer's moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambience noir dramas such as Body and Soul (1947) and Champion (1949). From 1981, the popular Body Heat, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, invokes <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting; its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo-noir, {{at a time when the}} major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The mainstreaming of neo-noir is evident in such films as Black Widow (1987), Shattered (1991), and Final Analysis (1992). Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double-entendre than Basic Instinct (1992), directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. The film also demonstrates how neo-noir's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir. Poison Ivy (1992) makes use of similar devices executed in Basic Instinct, including a shady, seductive femme-fatale with ulterior motives.|$|E
