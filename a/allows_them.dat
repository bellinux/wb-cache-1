5|$|As with {{previous}} Sonic games, Sonic 3 uses rings, {{scattered throughout the}} levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a life {{and return to the}} most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield that <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to breathe underwater, a shield that <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E

5|$|Their {{skill in}} {{foraging}} for food <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> {{to survive in}} steep mountain areas where they both graze and eat plants that many other cattle avoid. They can dig through the snow with their horns to find buried plants.|$|E
5|$|Women's role in {{ministry}}: The AG {{affirms the}} ministry {{of women in the}} church and <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to be ordained and serve in pastoral roles (see Ordination of women).|$|E
50|$|The {{prominence}} of major drug traffickers have <b>allowed</b> <b>them</b> to penetrate {{other sectors of}} the Burmese economy, including the banking, airline, hotel and infrastructure industries. Their investment in infrastructure have <b>allowed</b> <b>them</b> to make more profits, facilitate drug trafficking and money laundering.|$|R
50|$|The {{news about}} their martyrdom stormed across Hungary, {{shocking}} both Catholics and Protestants alike. Despite many pleas, Prince Gabriel refused to <b>allowed</b> <b>them</b> {{to be buried}} them in consecrated ground. He <b>allowed</b> <b>them</b> have a proper burial only when asked by Empress Katalina Pálffy, six months later.|$|R

5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the {{two parts of the}} wavefront to travel through different paths, <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E
5|$|After Raju and {{his team}} {{retrieve}} the gold, they are detained by local police. Raju identifies himself as a RAW agent {{and his team}} as intelligence officers from various agencies of India. He discloses his real name as Rajeev Sathyamoorthy.

50|$|The opisthosoma bears {{a further}} six pairs of appendages; the first pair houses the genital pores, while the {{remaining}} five pairs are modified into flattened plates, known as book gills, that <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to breathe underwater, {{and can also}} <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to breathe on land for short periods of time, provided the gills remain moist.|$|R
5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E
5|$|Experiments into behavior, to {{understand}} how organisms detect and {{interact with each other}} and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity because it <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to engage in a wider range of activities.|$|E
5|$|GateKeeper's {{entrance}} plaza {{is located}} {{along the beach}} {{next to one of}} Wicked Twister's towers. A sculpture with the GateKeeper logo is {{in the center of the}} plaza.

5|$|Horses have an {{advanced}} sense of taste, which <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> {{to sort through}} fodder and choose what they would most like to eat, and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the least weasel is {{sympatric}} with the stoat, the two species {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to quickly escape into holes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals have}} a {{specific}} temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer hibernation that <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to avoid the hottest and driest periods.|$|E

5|$|Many {{bacteria}} (such as E. coli) {{have two}} distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional random walk. (See external links below for link to videos.) The flagella {{of a unique}} group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as it moves.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 fan {{features}} dovetailed {{fan blades}} which <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> {{to be replaced}} without removing the entire engine, and GE/SNECMA claim that the CFM56 was the first engine to have that capability. This attachment method is useful for circumstances where only a few fan blades need to be repaired or replaced, such as following bird strikes.|$|E
5|$|The {{alternative}} {{train of}} thought {{is that it was}} simply not advantageous to be large until the appearance of the Ediacarans: the environment favoured the small over the large. Examples of such scenarios today include plankton, whose small size <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal blooms. But for large size never to be favourable, the environment would have to be very different indeed.|$|E
50|$|In Germany, Zet {{members were}} {{required}} to undergo voluntary military service. This <b>allowed</b> <b>them</b> to avoid being surveilled by the regular police, improved their physical condition and knowledge of military topics. Most importantly, it <b>allowed</b> <b>them</b> to keep their personal weapon and equipment in their accommodation outside the barracks. The equipment was then used in conspirative military training sessions.|$|R
50|$|The station used a {{broadcast}} system that <b>allowed</b> <b>them</b> to send images live over the cellular phone network, <b>allowing</b> <b>them</b> {{to go to}} places that traditional television network news journalists could not go with their satellite trucks. As well their images went out live, rather that delayed, and they offered an alternative perspective on the events.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a {{shareholder}} with a stock certificate {{can give a}} proxy to another person to <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to vote the shares in question. Similarly, {{a shareholder}} without a share certificate may often give a proxy to another person to <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> to vote the shares in question.
