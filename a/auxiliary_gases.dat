40|$|AbstractThe spout-fluid bed (SFB) {{is one of}} many {{modifications}} to conventional spouted bed, which is achieved by introducing an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> flow into the annular region of a spouted bed through a distributor. Therefore, the SFB has better gas-solid contact and mixing, and reduces the risks of particle agglomeration and dead zone. In addition, the gas-solid contact and the solids circulation rate can be controlled more easily and flexibly by installing a draft tube in the bed (DSFB). In this study, the effects of operating parameters on flow characteristics of the SFB and the DSFB were investigated and they were compared, using the same semi-cylindrical column and the same particles. As the results, the flow regime maps were recognized based on pressure fluctuation data and the DSFB had wide range of operating conditions for stable spouting, comparing with the SFB. The minimum spouting gas velocity for stable spouting state (spouting with aeration) decreased with increasing the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> velocity. Also, longitudinal and radial distributions of particle velocity in the spout and the annulus were obtained in detail for the stable spouting state by means of the particle image velocimetry (PIV).

40|$|Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) is a new-type {{solid fuel}} {{that is made}} by sorting, crushing, drying, {{blending}} and molding from municipal solid waste. It has following characteristics: 1) homogeneous dimension and physical-chemical characters; 2) high heating value (about 2 / 3 heating value of standard coal) and high volatile (about 70 %); 3) easy to store and to transport. To achieve efficient and clean combustion of RDF, a spouting-moving bed reactor is proposed. It includes two chambers: pyrolysis chamber and combustion chamber. RDF was firstly pyrolyzed with scarce air and then the volatile combusted completely in combustion chamber with secondary air. As the preparation of high temperature experiment, the hydrodynamics of spouting-moving bed are firstly investigated at ambient temperature in a 190 mm I. D. conical cylindrical perspex column. Our research mainly focuses on the following issues: (1) The minimum spouting velocity with different operation conditions and different bed materials; (2) The spout pressure-drop in the reactor (3) The region of steady spouting (4) The solids circulating flow rate with different operation conditions and different bed materials; According to the cold model test result, part of the parameters of hot model test reactor is determined. The results of cold test follow as: (1) Minimum spouting velocity increases as bed height, particle diameter and particle density increase, decreases as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> velocity increases. When <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> is added, the total gas volume entering spouting-moving bed is larger than that of typical spouted bed but less than the minimum fluidizing velocity. (2) The spout pressure-drop will increase as bed height and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> flowrate increase. The relationship of spout pressure-drop and bed height can be described by the Equation (2 - 5). (3) When <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> velocity and spouting gas velocity are varied, four different flow regimes are identified and mapped, which are fixed bed, steady spouted bed (spouting with aeration), jetting fluidized bed and spouted bed with pulsation (spout-fluid bed). (4) Solids circulation mass flow rate increases as spouting <b>gas</b> velocity and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> velocity increases. At axial direction, solids circulation mass rate firstly decreases as bed height decreases until it reaches the minimum at 160 mm (a little above the joint of column and cone) and then increases as bed height decreases the bed height {{has no effect on}} the solids ciuculation mass flowrate. (5) The particle flow pattern in the annular is successfully described by a pure dynamic model; the particle and gas flow pattern in the spout can be described by gas-solid phase flow model.

The indirectly heated generator with its bubble pump is the main new feature of this cooling machine and it showed good performance for all prototypes constructed.

40|$|RATIONALE Indolone-N-oxide {{derivatives}} possess interesting biological properties. The {{analysis of}} these compounds using mass spectrometry (MS) may lead to interference or under-estimation due to the tendency of the N-oxides to lose oxygen. All the previous works focused only on {{the temperature of the}} heated parts (vaporizer and ion-transfer tube) of the mass spectrometer without investigating other parameters. This work is extended to the investigation of other parameters. METHODS The behavior of N-oxides during atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) has been investigated using MSn ion trap mass spectrometry. Different parameters were investigated to clarify the factors implicated in the deoxygenation process. The investigated parameters were vaporizer temperature (APCI), ion-transfer tube temperature, solvent type, and the flow rates of the sheath <b>gas,</b> <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas,</b> sweep gas and mobile phase. RESULTS The deoxygenation increased when the vaporizer temperature increased. The extent of the 'thermally' induced deoxygenation was inversely proportional to the ion-transfer tube temperature and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate and in direct proportion to the mobile phase flow rate. Deoxygenation was not detected under MS/MS fragmentation and hence it is a non-collision-induced dissociation. N-Oxides have the tendency to form abundant 'non-classical' dimers under ESI, which fragment via dehydration rather than giving their corresponding monomer. CONCLUSIONS Deoxygenation is not solely a 'classical' thermal process but it is a thermal process that is solvent-mediated in the source. Deoxygenation was maximal with an APCI source while dimerization was predominant with an ESI source. Therefore, attention should be paid to these molecular changes in the mass spectrometer {{as well as to the}} choice of the ionization mode for N-oxides...|$|R

Neben der Thermosiphonpumpe ist der Hilfsgaskreislauf, sowohl für die Kälteleistung als auch für den Wirkungsgrad des Diffusions-Absorptionskälteprozesses, von besonderer Bedeutung. Ein Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die detaillierte Untersuchung des Hilfsgaskreislaufs. Mittels Clamp-On-Ultraschallsensoren gelingt es erstmalig den Ammoniakmolanteil sowie den Gasvolumenstrom kontinuierlich und ohne Eingriffe in den Prozess zu erfassen. Ein magnetgekoppelter Edelstahlpropeller ermöglicht, statt der üblichen Naturzirkulation, eine Zwangsumwälzung des Hilfsgaskreislaufs. Somit kann der Einfluss der Strömungsgeschwindigkeit auf die Stoffübertragung im Absorber und Verdunster nachgewiesen und bewertet werden.

This work {{demonstrates that}} it is possible to operate a diffusion absorption chiller directly heated by a solar collector. The generator, as the main component of the chiller, is directly integrated into a double glazed flat plate collector. The generator also acts as the bubble pump of the refrigeration process. Normally the bubble pump is heated at the bottom of the tube by a heating tape with a high heat flux. In a combined generator/collector the maximum heat flux is limited by the solar radiation and the efficiency of the solar collector. Due to the inclination angle of the collector the bubble pump has to pump the solution upwards. These boundary conditions require extensive investigations of the performance of the bubble pump. In addition to the bubble pump the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> circuit has a big influence on the coefficient of performance as well as the cooling capacity of the diffusion absorption chiller. A focus of this work is the detailed investigation of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> circuit.

The proposed multi-layer hybrid controller consists ofahigh-level supervisor that decides on-line the optimal operating mode throughahybrid model predictive control strategy,astatic lower-level controller defining proper set-points for the chosen mode, and existing standard low-levelc on trollers that ensure robust tracking of such set-points. The overall controller was designed in Matlab/Simulink using the Hybrid Toolbox, and then tested experimentallyareal process, showing {{the effectiveness of the}} approach...|$|R
30|$|An {{ion trap}} mass {{spectrometer}} LTQ Velos Pro (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with heated electrospray interface was operated in the positive mode with Xcalibur software version 2.1 as follows: A sheath gas (nitrogen, > 99.5 %) setting of 24 units and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> of 5 units was used and a spray voltage of 3.5  kV applied. The heated metal capillary was maintained at 275  °C {{with a mass}} range of 250 to 500  Da. The system was optimized for m/z 549 [M + H]+ of antimycin A 1 in the positive ion mode. Typical parameters: S-Lens 62 %; multipole 00 offset − 1.8  V; multipole 0 offset − 7.5  V; front lens − 9.1  V. MS/MS parameters: CID with isolation width 2.8  Da and without wide-band excitation activated; normalized collision energy 35 %; activation time 10  ms.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method for achieving an efficient central cathode in a Hall effect thruster is disclosed. A hollow insert disposed inside {{the end of}} a hollow conductive cathode comprises a rare-earth element and energized to emit electrons from an inner surface. The cathode employs an end opening having an area at least as large as the internal cross sectional area of the rare earth insert to enhance throughput from the cathode end. In addition, the cathode employs a high aspect ratio geometry based on the cathode length to width which mitigates heat transfer from the end. A gas flow through the cathode and insert may be impinged by the emitted electrons to yield a plasma. One or more optional <b>auxiliary</b> <b>gas</b> feeds may also be employed between the cathode and keeper wall and external to the keeper near the outlet...|$|R
