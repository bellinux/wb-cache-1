PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal (although it does implement the IS UNKNOWN operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors {{do not support the}} Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN.|$|E
5|$|I. anglicus, {{described}} by Friedrich Holl in 1829, {{is the original}} type species of Iguanodon, but, <b>as</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> was replaced by I. bernissartensis. In the past, it has been spelled as I. angelicus (Lessem and Glut, 1993) and I. anglicum (Holl, 1829 emend. Bronn, 1850). It is known from teeth from the middle Valanginian-age Lower Cretaceous Grinstead Clay Formation) of Cuckfield, West Sussex, England. It is currently classified in the genus Therosaurus as T. anglicus.|$|E
5|$|The barbarisation theory, {{ultimately}} {{derived from}} Edward Gibbon's 18th-century magnum opus, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, contains two propositions. (1) That the late army recruited much {{greater numbers of}} barbarian-born troops than {{the army of the}} Principate; and (2) that the greater number of barbarian recruits resulted in a major decline of the army's effectiveness and was a leading factor in the collapse of the Western Roman empire. <b>As</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> proposition (1) is probably correct, although it should be borne in mind that probably about three-quarters of the late army's recruits remained Roman-born. This section considers proposition (2).|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> any non-pseudoforest graph {{contains}} as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
5|$|Termites use {{sophisticated}} {{means to}} control the temperatures of their mounds. <b>As</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> the shape and orientation of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar chimney effect (stack effect) creates an updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across {{the tops of the}} towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds, which also include side vents in their construction. The solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the stack effect has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{identified}} seven ecotypes inhabit isolated ecological niches. Of three orca ecotypes in the Antarctic, one preys on minke whales, {{the second}} on seals and penguins {{and the third}} on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific ecotypes are labeled the transient, resident and offshore populations, <b>as</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>above.</b> The research supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients as a distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would mean that each new species becomes subject to separate conservation assessments.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena {{is that the}} vast majority of these were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of reports for transient phenomena occurring at the same place on the Moon could be used as evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on Earth for the same event, these must be regarded with caution. <b>As</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> an equally plausible hypothesis for some of these events is that they are caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different places on Earth at the same time, this could be used as evidence against an atmospheric origin.|$|E
5|$|This {{rapid rise}} {{in the power of}} Macedon was in part due to Philip's {{exceptional}} military and diplomatic skills. However, it was also in part due to the weakened state of the major powers of Greece. Sparta had never recovered from Epaminondas's liberation of Messenia, whilst in turn Thebes was still weakened by Epaminondas's death and the aftermath of Mantinea. Athens, <b>as</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>above,</b> was embroiled in a war with its allies; in 355 BC, the Athenians agreed a peace that left many of its former allies independent, severely weakening Athenian power. Although these powers protested against Philip's actions, they had too many other problems to attempt any intervention; Philip thus went largely unchallenged until 354 BC.|$|E
5|$|Dense gases such as xenon and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} can be breathed safely when mixed {{with at least}} 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% {{concentration}} along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and {{has been used for}} this, <b>as</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>above).</b> Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas, may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two major}} regions in the brain where noradrenergic neurons are located. These regions are called locus coeruleus and the lateral tegmental.
