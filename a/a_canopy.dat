5|$|The cathedral has two {{unusual and}} often-reproduced monuments, the Berkeley memorials. These are set into niches in the wall, and each is {{surrounded}} by <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> of inverted cusped arches. Pearson's screen, completed in 1905, echoes these memorials in its three wide arches with flamboyant cusps.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum is <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> or {{emergent}} tree of the Mabi rainforest {{community of}} north Queensland. Its terminal tubular flowers {{indicate that the}} species is pollinated by birds. Readily adaptable to cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra moisture and fertilisers low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally as vulnerable under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and logging.|$|E

5|$|Around 1912, New London {{citizens}} successfully {{petitioned the}} Public Utilities Commission for {{the installation of}} a footbridge connecting the station to the ferry docks {{in order to improve}} pedestrian safety. At the time, with no bridge crossing the river below Norwich, the ferries were heavily used. The footbridge, constructed of steel with <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> to keep out rain, was constructed soon after.|$|E
5|$|Banksia menziesii regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, or from epicormic buds on the trunk. It is {{generally}} only weakly serotinous {{in the southern}} part of its range, that is, it lacks <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> seed bank as follicles on old flower spikes in the canopy release their seed after two years, but populations retain more seed as populations move north. Lower canopies and drier climates predispose to hotter fires that are more likely to kill plants and effect seed release, and thus facilitate seedling recruitment.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) {{killed off}} all the elms that once {{populated}} the park and crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications, the pedestrian mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease-resistant elms planted to form <b>a</b> <b>canopy,</b> the King Fountain relit at night, and the lilac shrub border around {{the periphery of the}} park being restored.|$|E
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have a HEET turnstile entrance/exit {{at their}} extreme west end that was added during a 1990s renovation. Each leads to <b>a</b> <b>canopied</b> staircase that {{goes down to}} either side of Broadway near Havemeyer Street.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{features a}} lounge for chauffeurs {{on the ground}} floor and a private, gated, holding area in back for cars. Other features include sidewalk landscaping, including Japanese Cherry Trees, and <b>a</b> <b>canopied</b> entrance flanked by bronze lanterns.|$|R
50|$|The station had <b>a</b> <b>canopied</b> goods shed, {{and in the}} '1956 Handbook of Stations', listed it {{as being}} able to handle general goods, livestock, horse boxes and prize cattle vans. it also had a 1-ton 10 cwt {{permanent}} crane.|$|R
5|$|The {{region is}} semi-arid, and the {{vegetation}} is generally scrubland. Muckaty Station {{lies at the}} boundary of two bioregions, Tanami and Sturt Plateau. The Tanami bioregion is made up primarily of sandplains vegetated with bootlace oak (Hakea lorea), desert bloodwoods (Corymbia species), acacias and grevilleas, together with spinifex grasslands. The Sturt Plateau bioregion also includes spinifex grasslands, but with <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> of bloodwood trees.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E
5|$|As other {{stations}} Holden designed, Acton Town station {{features a}} tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure housing the station offices and shops. The ticket hall has a projecting London Underground roundel sign over <b>a</b> <b>canopy,</b> the brick {{walls of the}} ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof. From the ticket hall enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation. A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and fixed seating. The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end. Reinforced concrete platform canopies replaced the original timber canopies. Since 17 May 1994, the station has been a Grade II Listed building.|$|E

5|$|Each {{year on the}} Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a {{great number}} of devotees come to the monastery, popularly known as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed {{at the center of the}} church under <b>a</b> <b>canopy,</b> before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, {{chanting}} priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in front of the church, to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E
5|$|Fish, {{which may}} have been preyed upon by smaller crocodilians, are {{represented}} by teeth and scales. They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an indeterminate member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an indeterminate bowfin. Indeterminate caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding the lakes of the Mussentuchit, containing <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> of tree ferns, araucarias, and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of the lakes. These plants would have provided an abundant source of food for Eolambia.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock trees form <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> over Big Wapwallopen Creek in some places. The Wapwallopen Gorge {{is listed}} as a Locally Significant site on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. Hemlock and yellow birch are common at the gorge's upper end. However, river birch and {{sycamore}} are more common {{at the lower end}} of the gorge. There are riparian forests along Big Wapwallopen Creek in the American Legion Post 781 land tract. The tract of land also contains some wet areas such as vernal pools and marshes. These areas provide breeding grounds for reptiles, amphibians, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia aculeata {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from. It is serotinous—it accumulates <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> seed bank that is released only in response to fire—so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime. Plants take three to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire.|$|E
5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{from these}} {{historic}} examples {{we find the}} chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it stood {{at the head of}} the lord’s table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had <b>a</b> <b>canopy.</b> Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed with a key.|$|E

5|$|Some herons, such as {{the black}} heron, adopt an unusual {{position}} while hunting for prey. With their head held down in a hunting position, they sweep their wings forward to meet {{in front of their}} head, thereby forming an umbrella shaped canopy. The primaries and secondaries touch the water, the nape feathers are erected and the tail is drooped, thereby ensuring the canopy is totally enclosed. The bird may take several strides in this position. One theory about the function of this behaviour is that it reduces glare from the water surface, allowing the bird to more easily locate and catch prey. Alternatively, the shade provided by the canopy may attract fish making their capture easier. Some herons adopt a similar behaviour called double-wing feeding in which the wings are swept forward to create an area of shade, though <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> is not formed.|$|E
5|$|The Pulaski {{station was}} {{designed}} by the City of Chicago. The station house is at ground level and is set back from the street. It has a glass and steel façade, and most features within the station house are either made of stainless steel or painted white. The station's island platform is accessible from the station house via stairs, escalators, and an elevator. The platform serves the Orange Line's two tracks; the track to the Loop is located to the south, and the track to Midway located to the north. <b>A</b> <b>canopy</b> covers the entire platform. A bus terminal is located {{to the north of}} the station. To the west of the bus terminal and north of the railroad tracks is the Pulaski park and ride lot. The park and ride lot has 390 spaces which cost $4 for 12 hours and is operated by Standard Parking.|$|E
5|$|The keel of Yamato, {{the lead}} ship of the class, was laid {{down at the}} Kure Naval Arsenal, Hiroshima, on 4 November 1937, in a {{dockyard}} {{that had to be}} adapted to accommodate her enormous hull. The dock was deepened by one meter, and gantry cranes capable of lifting up to 350 tonnes were installed. Extreme secrecy was maintained throughout construction, <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> even being erected over part of the drydock to screen the ship from view. Yamato was launched on 8 August 1940, with Captain (later Vice-Admiral) Miyazato Shutoku in command. A great effort was made in Japan to ensure that the ships were built in extreme secrecy to prevent American intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications.|$|E
50|$|The interior, {{which has}} been altered considerably, {{includes}} a vaulted kitchen, equipped with a wide-arched fireplace, and another room with <b>a</b> <b>canopied</b> fireplace.
