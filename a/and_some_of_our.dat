The band played mostly blues and ballads, but the most popular music among whites in the area was country. Berry wrote, [...] "Curiosity provoked me to lay {{a lot of our}} country stuff on our predominantly black audience <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> black audience began whispering 'who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo?' After they laughed at me a few times they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|You {{note that}} I and President Joseph Fielding Smith <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> early church leaders have said and written about this {{doctrine}} and you {{asked if the}} doctrine of blood atonement is an official doctrine of the Church today. If by blood atonement is meant the atoning sacrifice of Christ, the answer is Yes. If by blood atonement is meant the shedding of the blood of men to atone in some way for their own sins, the answer is No. We {{do not believe that}} it is necessary for men in this day to shed their own blood to receive a remission of sins. This is said with a full awareness of what I and others have written and said on this subject in times past. In order to understand what Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Charles W. Penrose and others have said, we must mention that there are some sins for which the blood of Christ alone does not cleanse a person. [...] These include blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (as defined by the Church) and that murder which is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice. [...] However, and this cannot be stressed too strongly, this law has not been given to the Church at any time in this dispensation. [...] It has no application whatever to anyone now living whether he is a member or a non-member of the Church.|$|E
