5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E
5|$|The Antemoro soon {{developed}} a reputation as powerful sorcerers and astrologers, in large part owing to their monopoly on knowledge of writing, termed sorabe, which uses the Arabic script to transcribe the Malagasy language. Antemoro ombiasy (astrologer sages) migrated throughout the island, where they practiced their arts for local communities, served as advisers to kings, and even founded new principalities. This Antemoro mobility and their creation {{of a network of}} powerful spiritual advisers across the island is credited with forcing an awareness among Malagasy of communities beyond their own and sparking <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common Malagasy identity. The Antemoro kingdom was disbanded in the late 19th century following an uprising of the Antemoro commoners against the noble class.|$|E

25|$|The two Russian occupations {{had been}} harsh {{and were not}} easily forgotten.

The shining influence of the Russian imperial capital Saint Petersburg was also much stronger in southern Finland than in other parts of Sweden, and contacts across the new border dispersed the worst fears for the fate of the educated and trading classes under a Russian régime. At the turn of the 19th century, the Swedish-speaking educated classes of officers, clerics and civil servants were mentally well prepared for a shift of allegiance to the strong Russian Empire.|$|E

500|$|The second aria, [...] "" [...] ("My all in all, my eternal good"), {{again with}} strings, is a dance-like {{movement}} in free da capo form, A B A'. The unusually long text, of four lines for the A section and {{two for the}} B section, results in Bach's solution to repeat {{the end of the}} first line (my eternal good) after all text of A, and then after the middle section B repeat only the first line as A', thus ending A and A' the same way. In this modified repeat, the voice holds a long note on the word [...] ("peace"), after which the same theme appears in the orchestra and again in the continuo. The musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes the passepied character of the music, reminiscent of secular Köthen cantatas. Mincham describes: [...] "Bach's expression of the joy of union with Christ can often seem quite worldly and uninhibited", and summarises: [...] "The 3/8 time signature, symmetrical phrasing and rapid string skirls combine to create <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dance of abandonment." ...|$|E

Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine found Wilson to be the stand out among a pool of actors that [...] "deserve their own stand-alone appreciations". He said of the actor's performance: [...] "He's a young man, and he's in good shape, but he carries himself like an older, heavier one, as if weighed down by burdens he hasn't fully acknowledged because he's not ready yet. You get <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> personality, perhaps a soul, in the process of evolving."

500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{peaceful}} community of nations had been proposed {{as far back as}} 1795, when Immanuel Kant's [...] outlined the idea of a league of nations to control conflict and promote peace between states.

International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war. [...] This period also saw the development of international law, with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime, and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

Domenge stated that she attempts to express the beauty of natures geometric order that it expresses in the molecular structures of flowers and plants.

500|$|The Chief Justice {{proceeded}} to detail the origin, purpose, and case law {{history of the}} separation of powers. Article Three of the United States Constitution establishes an independent judiciary with [...] "distinct and inviolable authority." [...] Such separation of powers [...] "safeguards individual freedom." [...] As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 78, quoting Montesquieu, [...] "'there is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.'" [...] The separation of powers between the judiciary and legislative branches was examined in detail in Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc. (1995), in which the Supreme Court found unconstitutional a statute that reopened a case after a final judgment. At the time of the framing of the Constitution, judicial and legislative powers were often intermingled. The colonial legislatures often performed many of the functions of the judiciary, such as functioning as the court of last resort, granting new trials, and providing original review, appellate review, stays of judgments, and providing other types of relief [...] "in an effort to do what is agreeable to Right and Justice." [...] The colonial charters of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island gave the legislatures the authority of court of last resort. In New Hampshire, judicial appeals were directed to the governor and his council, but routinely referred to the legislature for discussion. And for over half a century, the colonial assembly of Virginia could review court judgments. The involvement of legislatures in judicial matters [...] "intensified during the American Revolution," [...] which [...] "soon prompted <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sharp necessity to separate the legislative from the judicial power." [...] The interference of the legislatures in judicial matters [...] "figur prominently in the Framers' decision to devise a system for securing liberty through the division of power." [...] This resulted in Article Three of the United States Constitution, which forms the [...] "central pillar of judicial independence" [...] and places [...] "'he judicial Power of the United States'... in 'one supreme Court', and in such 'inferior Courts'" [...] as Congress may establish. This judicial power extends [...] "to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority." ...|$|E
