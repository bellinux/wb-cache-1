5|$|Among the {{earliest}} {{members of the}} Mecoptera are the Nannochoristidae of Upper Permian age. Fossil Mecoptera become <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> diverse during the Cretaceous, for example in China, where panorpids such as Jurassipanorpa, hangingflies (Bittacidae and Cimbrophlebiidae), Orthophlebiidae, and Cimbrophlebiidae have been found.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{striation}} and {{the presence}} of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands. Boulder clay is also <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> moraines cover substantial areas.|$|E

5|$|Locusts are the {{swarming}} {{phase of}} certain species of short-horned grasshoppers {{in the family}} Acrididae. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances become more <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is an <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> {{familiar}} bird {{of human}} habitations and cultivation {{in most of}} southern Africa. It is not believed to be threatened, and accordingly is listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN's Red List. It can be an agricultural pest, especially of grain cultivation and vineyards.|$|E

5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Abundant</b> <b>and</b> widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E
5|$|Although males {{demonstrate}} little {{involvement in}} territorial disputes between neighboring communities, and ruffed lemur communities lack cohesiveness, females communally defend the community range against females of other communities. These disputes occur mostly during the hot, rainy season, when resources are more <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> occur near {{the boundaries of}} community ranges. Spacing is maintained by scent marking and vocal communication. Ruffed lemurs {{are known for their}} loud, raucous calls that are answered by neighboring communities and subgroups within the same community.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} season {{is the most}} suitable season, usually with favorable conditions <b>and</b> <b>abundant</b> food <b>and</b> water for breeding. Abiotic {{factors such as the}} timing of seasonal rains and winds can also {{play an important role in}} breeding onset and success.|$|R

5|$|Coniferous trees such {{as black}} spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> Norway maple is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other non-native species grown.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs are <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> can {{be found}} {{throughout}} the Americas and Eurasia. The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but {{tends to be more}} common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families {{can be found}} in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are fairly}} <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There is no {{evidence}} that they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. It is a common myth that earwigs crawl into the human ear and lay eggs in the brain.|$|E

50|$|The Senegal River Valley, {{with its}} rich {{alluvial}} and clayey soil, is comparatively abundant in flora. Moreover, higher rainfall, irrigation, <b>and</b> <b>abundant</b> side channels <b>and</b> sloughs tend {{to produce a}} lush, near-tropical vegetation, with baobab and gonakie trees <b>and</b> <b>abundant</b> rich grasses. Ddounm and barussus palms are also found here. Much of the flood plain is cultivated.|$|R
25|$|Cold seep {{deposits}} {{are found}} throughout the Phanerozoic rock record, especially in the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic (see for example Kaim et al., 2008). These fossil cold seeps are characterized by mound-like topography (where preserved), coarsely crystalline carbonates, <b>and</b> <b>abundant</b> mollusks <b>and</b> brachiopods.|$|R
5|$|In {{the great}} {{majority}} of cells, smooth ER regions are scarce and are often partly smooth and partly rough. They are sometimes called transitional ER because they contain ER exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the Golgi apparatus. In certain specialized cells, however, the smooth ER is <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> has additional functions. The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, of course, are the city's <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> ample indoor {{recreational}} facilities, {{which often}} include basketball and racquetball courts, weight and fitness training rooms, and swimming pools. These centers also {{play host to}} many special programs for children, youth and adults. The Bayside facility, for example, offers classes in yoga and pilates, as well as various types and styles of dance, not to mention seasonal offerings for young children and senior citizens.|$|E
5|$|Like {{several other}} large tyrannosaurids, Tarbosaurus is known from {{relatively}} <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> well-preserved fossil material. In fact, {{one quarter of}} all fossils collected from the Nemegt Formation belong to Tarbosaurus. Although Tarbosaurus has not been studied as thoroughly as the North American tyrannosaurids, the available material has allowed scientists to draw limited conclusions about its biology.|$|E

5|$|Megalodon faced {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment. However, its position {{at the top of}} the food chain probably had a profound impact on the structuring of marine communities. Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and diversification of cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were <b>abundant,</b> <b>and</b> adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|Middle Devonian basaltic {{volcanic}} {{rocks are}} found on western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. Correlation between the Hoy volcanics {{and the other}} two exposures has been proposed, but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain. Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney. Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands. Boulder clay is also <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> moraines cover substantial areas.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less diverse in temperate waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant in tropical waters. Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous sponges are <b>abundant</b> <b>and</b> diverse in shallower non-polar waters.|$|E
