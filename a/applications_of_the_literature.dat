The paper is {{meant as a}} practical guideline through some aspects of a wavelet-based texture analysis task. The following aspects of the problem are discussed: discrete and continuous wavelet decompositions, texture features for grey-level textures, extensions to colour texture and rotation-invariant features, and classi#cation, including supervised image classi#cation and unsupervised texture segmentation tasks. For these di#erent aspects, a theoretical and practical survey is given, experiments and real-world <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> are reviewed and some small-scale demonstration experiments are included. I. Introduction Texture is an important cue {{for the analysis of}} manytypes of images.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} model the concept of emotion and to extract the {{emotional}} impact from images, one may search suitable image processing features. However, in the literature, {{there is no consensus}} on the ones to consider since they are often linked to the application. Obviously, the perception of emotion is not only influenced by the content of the images, it is also modified by some personal experiences like cultural aspects and semantic associated to some colours or objects. In this paper, we choose low level features frequently used in CBIR especially those based on SIFT descriptors. To take into account the complex process of emotion perception, we also consider colour and texture features and one global scene descriptor: GIST. We supposed the chosen features could implicitly encode high-level information about emotions due to their accuracy in the different CBIR <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> We test our methodology on two databases: SENSE and IAPS...|$|E

It argues ultimately for a balanced, neo-institutionalist approach to arts management and evaluation, which would evaluate organizational performance in line with artistic goals and objectives.

40|$|ABSTRACT Heart {{disease is}} the number one killer of American women {{regardless}} of age or race. Women still face disparity in the assessment and recognition of heart disease. One key element that contributes to this delay is a prodromal symptom presentation that may impede quick assessment and streamline treatment for cardiovascular events. <b>The</b> aims <b>of</b> this project, using best evidence and initial testing with data from Arizona Health Sciences Center Clinical Research Data Warehouse, is to construct a women's Cardiac Prodromal Symptoms Recognition Assessment List to increase early recognition of cardiovascular etiology, resulting in earlier diagnostics and treatment. A literature review was completed to determine a list of current cardiac prodromal symptoms in women. Symptom data was mined from the clinical research data warehouse and compared to the symptom list. The project results support that prodromal symptoms are valid as identifiers of women experiencing a cardiac event. <b>The</b> <b>literature</b> review identified ten prodromal symptoms; Chest Pain/Discomfort, Shortness of Breath, Fatigue, Arm/Shoulder Pain, Weakness, Nausea/Indigestion, Back Pain, Jaw Pain, Sleep Disturbance and Dizziness/Syncope that are consistent in <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> <b>The</b> Clinical Research Data Warehouse (CRDW) clinical elements did match <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> prodromal symptoms list with <b>the</b> additional elements <b>of</b> edema defined as a physical finding and depression defined as a risk factor. <b>Application</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> review and mined clinical data provide an opportunity to explore a clinical issue such as cardiac prodromal symptoms recognition for women and to assist providers in rapid identification and treatment initiation for women experiencing cardiac events...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and management of}} long term successful relationships, in a business to business context, is widely accepted within <b>the</b> relationship marketing <b>literature</b> to add value (Baxter and Matear, 2004). This dissertation examines relationship marketing in a relatively unexplored context, and explores value creation through the development, management and importantly evaluation of relationships within an education setting. Using a case study organisation as <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research, an in-depth investigation {{of a range of}} stakeholder perceptions, within a Higher Education context, was undertaken. Depth interviews explored relationship marketing practice, as a means to establish <b>the</b> relevance and <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> to this sector, and <b>the</b> processes <b>of</b> value creation within the case study organisation's network. Accepting that relationship marketing implementation was shown to be embryonic in the case study organisation, and in fact in all stakeholder organisations too, this study revealed some important nuances in the underlying relationship characteristics and in the values underpinning practice. These included <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> shared values, public accountability and transparency in this context. The study confirmed the importance examining <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> value within a network (including customers, employees, and other stakeholders). Additionally it confirmed that <b>the</b> complex nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationships contained within this network involving multiple and sometimes conflicting roles, arguably specific to this sector, might have implications both for managers within the sector and for researchers in this field.

30|$|This {{systematic}} review was primarily aimed to conjure substantial evidence regarding the cytokine, chemokine, receptor and their antagonist (RANK, RANKL, OPG) levels in GCF consequent to <b>application</b> <b>of</b> orthodontic force. <b>The</b> <b>literature</b> revealed heterogeneity in study designs pertaining to participant characteristics, force <b>application,</b> levels <b>of</b> force, GCF collection methods and collection protocol, storage, and oral hygiene maintenance regimen. To draw logical conclusions each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variables was tabulated and analyzed separately. Associations {{of change in}} levels of mediators were established with mechanics of applied orthodontic force, amount of force, force reactivations, differentiation in levels between tension and compression sites, age groups (juveniles and adults, growers and non-growers), and velocity of tooth movement (Vt).|$|R

In this Food Security in Practice technical guide, Angelino Viceisza focuses on <b>the</b> class <b>of</b> economics experiments known as lablike field experiments and examines their basic rationale, the details involved in conducting them, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> them in <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> In addition, Viceisza discusses <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> game theory in conducting field experiments and considers some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical issues that can arise when drawing inferences and deriving policy implications from experimental work.
