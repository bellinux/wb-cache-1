Experiments were done using posterior lamellar discs from pig corneas with a diameter of 7. 5 mm and a thickness of 250 - 350 mum. The volume of tissue to be vitrified was 88 % lower with posterior corneal lamellae than with the previously used corneoscleral discs. A very thin-walled (0. 05 mm), teflon-coated bag served as the sample container. Immersed in only 0. 1 ml of the vitrification solution VS 41 a, the lamellae were cooled to a final storage temperature of - 196 degreesC. After warming and organ-culturing for 24 h, the endothelium was stained with trypan blue and alizarin red, to determine cell viability. Vitrification of corneal lamellae without apparent ice formation or cracking of the specimen was achieved. Despite the successful vitrification, only a maximum of 10 % of the endothelial cells was vital after warming. Thus, the toxicity of the cryoprotective agents and the devitrification that occurred during the heating process require further optimization of the method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

50|$|Chilled fog {{machines}} {{are designed to}} create thick clouds of fog that lie {{close to the ground}} and dissipate as they rise. They are typically created by using either dry ice, liquid nitrogen, or more recently liquid air.Dry Ice (solid carbon dioxide) effects are produced by heating water to or near boiling in <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>container</b> (for example: a 55-gallon drum with water heater coils in it), and then dropping in one or more pieces of dry ice. Because at standard temperature and pressure carbon dioxide is a gas, the carbon dioxide sublimates and instantly produces a gas, condensing water vapor and creating a thick white fog. A fan placed {{at the top of the}} container directs the fog where it is needed.Liquid nitrogen (N2) is used to create low lying fog effects in a manner similar to dry ice. A machine heats water to at or near the boiling point, creating steam and increasing the humidity in a closed container. When liquid nitrogen is pumped into the container, the moisture rapidly condenses, creating a thick white fog. A fan placed at the output of the container directs the fog where it is needed, creating a rolling fog that lies low to the ground.Liquid air is an alternative to using liquid nitrogen in generating low lying fog effects. Liquid air is composed of N2 and O2 mixed in a ratio of 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen stored as a liquid in insulated cylinders. This ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is the same as that of atmospheric air, and indeed liquid air may be fabricated by simply liquefying atmospheric air. Liquid air can be used as a direct replacement for liquid nitrogen in chilled-fog effects and is intended to be used in the same manner in the same equipment. Its key advantage over liquid nitrogen is that it presents no asphyxiation hazard, since it contains oxygen. A disadvantage is that it supports combustion, whereas liquid nitrogen inhibits combustion.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of fixed}} offshore platforms supported by pile foundations has encouraged {{the development of more}} rational methods of analysis of piles subjected combined axial and lateral loading. The combination of large lateral loads resulting from the action of wind, waves and currents in conjunction with vertical loads has created the need to analyze systems exposed to large inclined loads. [...] The scope of this thesis is to study the pile-soil interaction of a vertical flexible pile under inclined loadings in dense sand. To study the interaction, model flexible piles of 25 mm, 42 mm and 60 mm diameters were jacked into sand with controlled density. These model piles were instrumented with load-cells and strain-gauge bridges to measure the bending moment distributions. The piles were tested under vertical, horizontal and inclined loads using a computerized data acquisition system. <b>A</b> <b>suitable</b> soil <b>container</b> and laboratory test frame were assembled to conduct the tests. [...] The vertical load test results indicated that the value of the bearing capacity factor Nq was constant with depth and consistently smaller than that predicted by various existing theories. The results also indicated that the piles had a critical depth where the point resistance became constant with depth, at a pile diameter/depth ratio of about 20. [...] Experimental p-y curves were compared with those proposed by Reese et al (1974), Matlock et al (1980), Scott (1980) and Parker (1970). The test data indicate that the semi-empirical methods underestimate the ultimate resistance near the pile head and overestimate it at depth. Computed response of piles under test conditions showed good agreement with the measured response. [...] The ultimate load capacity under inclined load decreases with load inclination, with a rapid reduction for load inclinations between 45 and 90 degrees. Compared to a pile subjected to only lateral load, the vertical load on the pile increases the lateral deflections by about 4 to 15 %, and the maximum moment in the pile section by about 8 to 16 % for load inclinations from 60 to 30 degrees...|$|R

When Grandmother made jelly the wonderful aroma of cooking fruit filled the house. That wonderful aroma was the delicate fruit flavors being evaporated and lost from the jelly. When volatile flavors are retained food has a much better flavor. Freeze concentration of fruit juices is a method of removing water from juices without heating and changing juice flavor. Freeze concentration is effective because a solute in solution has a lower melting point than pure ice, and can {{be separated from the}} water component (ice) as the temperature approaches the melting point of pure ice.

Tenax TA™ sampling tubes are then used in passive or active sampling mode to collect the emitted vapours. In active sampling mode the air sample is drawn through the sampling tube using a calibrated pump at a rate of approximately 100  cm 3  min- 1. When used for personal hygiene monitoring, sampling times are typically 8  h giving a sampled volume of approximately 50  dm 3 of air. If the sample is actively collected from a contained space, care should be taken not to extract[*]>[*] 20 % of the enclosed volume to avoid dilution effects (air from the room will be pumped into the sampled space to replace the air pumped out). It is suggested therefore that active sampling is best used when the air space in a storage room or similar is to be monitored whereas passive sampling (which involves collection of a known volume of air by diffusion) is recommended for monitoring small volumes (drawers, cabinets, or contained objects). While passive methods of air sampling take longer (typically days or weeks), they offer further advantages over active air sampling methods: passive sampling has a lower impact on site as there is no requirement to use a pump, sampling can be undertaken in areas where there is no power supply and several sites can be measured simultaneously if multiple sampling tubes are deployed.|$|E

Objectives The aim of this study was to describe causes and clinical symptoms of methadone poisoning in children admitted to hospitals in Iran. Data Sources Relevant studies published in national and international journals before January 29, 2016 were identified by studying the available databases, including PubMed, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, Scopus, SID, Iranmedex, MagIran, and Irandoc. Study Selection After excluding duplicate, irrelevant, and low-quality articles, relevant papers were entered into the meta-analysis. The prevalence, mean, and standard deviation of methadone poisoning symptoms in children were statistically analyzed, using Stata version 11, and causes of methadone poisoning were presented in tables. Data Extraction Studies with unknown sample sizes, abstracts without access to full text, articles with quality assessment scores below 15. 5, and studies carried out on non-Iranian populations were excluded from the meta-analysis. Results During the initial advanced search, 1594 articles were identified. After quality assessment, 12 papers were found eligible for the final systematic review and meta-analysis, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reported symptoms included drowsiness, vomiting, apnea, cyanosis, seizure, ataxia, and delirium. In the meta-analysis, prevalence of symptoms in referred patients was estimated at 44 % (0. 95 % confidence interval, 0. 288 to 0. 609).
