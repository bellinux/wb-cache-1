40|$|BACKGROUND : Osteopetrosis or <b>Albers-Schönberg's</b> <b>disease</b> is a {{heterogeneous}} group of rare hereditary troubles {{of the bone}} characterized by bone sclerosis due to an alteration of the bone reabsorption mediated by osteoclasts. The defect in the osteoclastic activity is responsible for complete or partial medullary cavities occlusion, with consequent reduced hemopoiesis, and for the excessive fragility of the affected bone segments. CASE REPORT : We reported {{the case of a}} young man of 31 years affected by osteopetrosis in which a small cell lung cancer developed. RESULTS : Small cell lung cancer is a particularly rare neoplasm in the young, and even though it is highly sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatment its prognosis remains poor. The greatest clinical problem connected with chemotherapeutic treatment of patients affected by osteopetrosis is the variability of the reduction of their bone marrow reserve, which could expose them to an excessive hematological toxicity caused by the therapy. CONCLUSIONS : The adoption of suitable prophylactic measures, {{such as the use of}} growth factors and drugs selected in relation to their toxicity or given in reduced doses, should be appropriately considered in these subjects. </br...|$|R
50|$|This gene encodes {{a protein}} {{that may be}} {{involved}} in the degradation of G proteins via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. The encoded protein binds to members of subfamily A of the regulator of the G-protein signaling (RGS) family through an N-terminal leucine-rich region. This protein also has a central RING finger-like domain and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This protein is highly conserved from flies to humans. Defects in this gene may cause the autosomal recessive, infantile malignant form of osteopetrosis. This is also known as autosomal recessive <b>Albers-Schonberg</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Albers-Schönberg</b> <b>disease,</b> the {{classical}} form of osteopetrosis, is an autosomal dominant condition with generalized increased skeletal density due to reduced bone resorption. Characteristic radiological findings are generalized osteosclerosis, with, most typically, end-plate sandwichlike thickening of the vertebrae (Rugger-Jersey spine) and the bone-within-bone (endobones) phenomenon. We studied an extended kindred with <b>Albers-Schönberg</b> <b>disease</b> and found linkage with several markers from chromosome 1 p 21. The Albers-Schönberg gene {{is located in}} a candidate region of approximately 8. 5 cM flanked by markers D 1 S 486 and D 1 S 2792. A maximum LOD score (Z(max)) of 4. 09 was obtained in multipoint analysis at loci D 1 S 239 /D 1 S 248. Possible linkage of osteopetrosis to this chromosomal region was analyzed because the CSF- 1 gene, which is mutated in the op/op mouse model for osteopetrosis, is located in 1 p 21. However, SSCP and mutation analysis in patients did not reveal any abnormality, which excludes the CSF- 1 gene as the disease-causing gene. This was confirmed by refined physical mapping of the CSF- 1 gene outside the candidate region for the Albers-Schönberg gene. The identification of the molecular defect underlying <b>Albers-Schönberg</b> <b>disease</b> will therefore be dependent on the isolation of other genes from an 8. 5 -cM candidate region on chromosome 1 p 21...|$|E
40|$|Dominant {{negative}} {{mutations in}} CLCN 7, which encodes a homodimeric chloride channel needed for matrix acidification by osteoclasts, cause <b>Albers-Schönberg</b> <b>disease</b> (also known as autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type 2). More than 25 different CLCN 7 mutations {{have been identified}} in patients affected with <b>Albers-Schönberg</b> <b>disease,</b> but only one mutation (Clcn 7 G 213 R) has been introduced in mice to create an animal model of this disease. Here we describe a mouse with a different osteopetrosis-causing mutation (Clcn 7 F 318 L). Compared to Clcn 7 +/+ mice, 12 -week-old Clcn 7 F 318 L/+ mice have significantly increased trabecular bone volume, consistent with Clcn 7 F 318 L acting as a dominant negative mutation. Clcn 7 F 318 L/F 318 L and Clcn 7 F 318 L/G 213 R mice die by 1 month of age and resemble Clcn 7 knockout mice, which indicate that p. F 318 L mutant protein is non-functional and p. F 318 L and p. G 213 R mutant proteins do not complement one another. Since {{it has been reported that}} treatment with interferon gamma (IFN-G) improves bone properties in Clcn 7 G 213 R/+ mice, we treated Clcn 7 F 318 L/+ mice with IFN-G and observed a decrease in osteoclast number and mineral apposition rate, but no overall improvement in bone properties. Our results suggest that the benefits of IFN-G therapy in patients with <b>Albers-Schönberg</b> <b>disease</b> may be mutation-specific...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the causative mutation in a family with an unusual presentation of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (OPT), proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), renal stones, epilepsy, and blindness, a combination of features not previously reported. We undertook exome sequencing of one affected and one unaffected family member, followed by targeted analysis of known candidate genes to identify the causative mutation. This identified a missense mutation (c. 643 G>A; p. Gly 215 Arg) in the gene encoding the chloride/proton antiporter 7 (gene CLCN 7, protein CLC- 7), which was confirmed by amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) -PCR, and to be present in the three available patients. CLC- 7 mutations are known to cause autosomal dominant OPT type 2, also called <b>Albers-Schonberg</b> <b>disease,</b> which is characterized by osteosclerosis, predominantly of the spine, pelvis and skull base, resulting in bone fragility and fractures. <b>Albers-Schonberg</b> <b>disease</b> is not reported to be associated with RTA, but autosomal recessive OPT type 3 (OPTB 3) with RTA is associated with carbonic anhydrase type 2 (CA 2) mutations. No mutations were detected in CA 2 or any other genes known to cause proximal RTA. Neither CLCN 7 nor CA 2 mutations have previously been reported to be associated with renal stones or epilepsy. Thus, we identified a CLCN 7 mutation in a family with autosomal dominant osteopetrosis, RTA, renal stones, epilepsy, and blindness. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Albers-Schönberg</b> <b>disease,</b> or {{autosomal}} dominant osteopetrosis type II (ADO 2), {{is caused by}} ineffective osteoclastic bone resorption resulting from mutations in the chloride channel 7 (ClCN 7) gene.

Methods: We investigated the serum concentrations of the osteoclast-derived 5 b isoform of TRACP (TRACP 5 b) and the bone formation marker osteocalcin in clinically affected individuals, unaffected gene carriers, and healthy controls from 10 ADO 2 families with known ClCN 7 gene mutations.

40|$|Among {{the many}} new {{diseases}} {{which have been}} described during the present century, there are a remarkable number of disea§es of the osseous system. In some instances {{this is due to}} the necessity of x-ray examination and biochemical investigation for their diagnosis, but in others, such as osteopetrosis (<b>Albers-Schonberg</b> <b>disease),</b> osteochondrodystrophy (Morquio's disease), gargoylism (dysostosis multiplex), and hypertelorism, these aids were not essential, and it is perhaps surprising that the conditions escaped recognition until relatively late. The rarity of the conditions and the reluctance of writers of textbooks to list them as distinct diseases will also have militated against their general recognition. In the case of fenestrae parietales symmetricae both causes have been operative. Probably this heredo-familial condition occurs more frequently than is generally supposed, but has received little attention. It is, however, entirely comparable to such a disease as cleidocranial dysostosis, which is widely known, not from personal experience but from its established place in textbooks. The condition of fenestrae parietales symmetricae is characterized by th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Autosomal {{dominant}} osteopetrosis (<b>Albers-Schönberg</b> <b>disease)</b> classically {{displays the}} radiographic signs of osteosclerosis. The main ADO complications involve the skeleton: low-impact bone fractures, scoliosis and hip osteoarthritis. Management of osteopetrosis-related orthopedic problems is a surgical challenge {{due to increased}} bone density. The healing process is very slow in these patients because of bone remodeling defects related to osteoblast function failure. In case of bone deformities, a realignment method should be appropriated to osteopetrosis conditions. This article presents a case report of operative treatment of an 11 -year-old girl affected with ADO, who underwent a simultaneous valgus knee deformity correction of both limbs with medial eight-plate epiphysiodesis. Simultaneous correction of valgus deformity on both limbs using an extraperiosteal tension plate technique for medial tibial hemiepiphysiodesis was performed in a girl of 11. 5 years old with autosomal dominant osteopetrosis. The treatment duration from surgery to complete deformity correction and removal of plates was 18  months. The final aMPTA was 86 ° {{on the right side}} and 85 ° on the left side. The correction rate was 0. 61 °/month (right tibia) and 0. 67 °/month (left tibia). The MAD correction rate was evaluated as 1. 5  mm/month for the right limb and 1. 6  mm/month for the left limb. At the moment of plate removal, one screw was broken because of tight fixation in osteopetrotic bone. But it did not compromise the final result. The latest follow-up visit at the age of 14  years 6  months revealed excellent realignment without any deformity relapse. There was no any functional impairment. We consider the guided growth by tension band technique as very interesting and promising solution for treatment of pediatric angular deformity in patients with OP. This method allows to avoid osteotomy and related important risk of delayed union or nonunion frequently observed in osteopetrosis. Level of evidence: Level IV...|$|E
