5|$|By 1956, {{the surface}} of RM 2134 had been {{upgraded}} to stone, and the northern portion had been additionally straightened. On December 1, 1957, FM 2134 was extended northeastward across the Colorado River to the community of Voss. By 1961, the portion designated as RM 2134 had been upgraded to a bituminous surface, made of <b>asphalt</b> <b>and</b> crushed rock. The other road segment had been upgraded to a metal surface. In addition, a new bridge had been constructed along the RM 2134 portion, {{and it had been}} straightened generally along the present location of RE11. In 1985, plans were approved for the construction of the Stacey Reservoir. The construction was finished in 1990, and the lake was instead named the O.H. Ivie Reservoir. The construction of the lake destroyed a large portion of RM 2134, and caused the removal of the highway to FM 1929. RE11 was designated on its current location on October 31, 1996, and was officially approved on December 20, 1996. The route remains the most recently designated recreational road.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh <b>asphalt,</b> <b>and</b> {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E

The {{buildings}} are arranged around a ward with the principal accommodation on the north side. It {{is surrounded by a}} dry moat which is bridged at the gatehouse. To the west of the inner ward are the stables, the coach house, a rectangular bell tower and the kitchens and service area. To the north is the great hall range which consists of 18bays. Behind the entrance to the hall is the circular main tower. At the east end of the gallery wing is the octagonal library tower. The outer walls of the castle have full-height slender turrets at the changes in direction. Corbel tables support part of the battlements. The walls contain arrow slots, and in the gatehouse is a garderobe. The flat roof has a crenellated parapet.|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of eastern shale oil (ESO) residue as an asphalt additive to reduce oxidative age hardening and moisture susceptibility {{was conducted by}} Western Research Institute (WRI). The ESO residue, have a viscosity of 23. 9 Pa{lg_bullet}s at 60 {degree}C (140 {degree}F), was blended with three different petroleum-derived asphalts, ASD- 1, AAK- 1, and AAM- 1, which {{are known to be}} very susceptible to oxidative aging. Rheological and infrared analyses of the unaged <b>and</b> aged <b>asphalts</b> <b>and</b> the blends were then conducted to evaluate oxidative age hardening. In addition, the petroleum-derived <b>asphalts</b> <b>and</b> the blends were coated onto three different aggregates, Lithonia granite (RA), a low-absorption limestone (RD), and a siliceous Gulf Coast gravel (RL), and compacted into briquettes. Successive freeze-thaw cycling was then conducted to evaluate the moisture susceptibility of the prepared briquettes. The rheological analyses of the unaged petroleum-derived <b>asphalts</b> <b>and</b> their respective blends indicate that the samples satisfy the rutting requirement. However, the aging indexes for the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) -aged and RTFO/pressure aging vessel (PAV) -aged samples indicate that the blends are stiffer than the petroleum-derived asphalts. This means that when in service the blends will be more prone to pavement embrittlement and fatigue cracking than the petroleum-derived asphalts. Infrared analyses were also conducted on the three petroleum-derived <b>asphalts</b> <b>and</b> the blends before and after RTFO/PAV aging. In general, upon RTFO/PAV aging, the amounts of carbonyls and sulfoxides in the samples increase, indicating that the addition of the ESO residue does not mitigate the chemical aging (oxidation) of the petroleum-derived asphalts. This information correlates with the rheological data and the aging indexes that were calculated for the petroleum-derived <b>asphalts</b> <b>and</b> the blends...|$|R

5|$|To the observatory's {{disappointment}} and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it {{appeared as a}} point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets, they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about as dark as <b>asphalt</b> <b>and</b> {{similar to that of}} Mercury, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of Earth. Observations also revealed that Pluto's orbit was very elliptical, far more than that of any other planet.|$|E
