5|$|A 1977 BBC {{television}} debate discussed {{arguments for}} and against Myra Hindley's release, with Lord Longford on the side who argued that Hindley should be released and Ann West (the mother of Lesley Ann Downey) on the side arguing against <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> of Hindley being released and threatening to kill her if she ever got out of prison.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, gay {{relationships}} were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{refused to}} yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil {{prepared for what}} {{was seen as an}} imminent conflict. PedroII was the main reason for Brazil's resistance; he rejected <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> of yielding. This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
5000|$|I {{asked her}} if she had <b>any</b> <b>suggestions.</b> She said, what about Tempest Storm? I {{asked her if}} she had <b>any</b> other <b>suggestions.</b> Well, she said, what about Sunny Day? Well, I said, I guess {{it might as well be}} Tempest Storm.|$|R

5|$|The {{failure of}} Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein {{marked the end}} of Model's special {{relationship}} with Hitler, who on 21 January 1945 issued an order that all the divisions of Army Group B would thenceforth be personally responsible to him to limit Model's operational freedom of decision. <b>Any</b> <b>suggestion</b> of its withdrawal back to the river Rhine to obtain a better fighting position - given the Third Reich's weakening strength against the Allied torrent of men and material - was forbidden, and it was ordered to conduct its actions from now on upon the strategic basis of not yielding an inch of ground and an abandonment of tactical manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} recriminations among the British squadron, Schomberg praising Astraea and Phoebe but omitting Racehorse and Galatea from the {{recommendations}} in his post-battle report. Captain Losack was particularly offended as Schomberg had implied that Galateas distress signal was an overreaction {{in the face}} of the enemy, despite her casualties being greater than the rest of the squadron combined. He subsequently requested a court martial to clear <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> of cowardice from his name but the Admiralty refused, commenting that they were fully satisfied with his conduct. Historian William James claims that opinion within the Navy was also with Losack and that Schomberg had been excessively harsh in his criticism.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{developments}} in memorials to the war, the cenotaph, used an empty tomb to symbolise these aspects of the war. In 1919, Britain and France planned victory marches through their respective capitals {{and as part of}} this France decided to erect a temporary cenotaph, an empty sarcophagus monument, which would be saluted by the marching troops. The British Prime Minister David Lloyd George decided that a similar but non-denominational memorial should be built in London, despite ministerial concerns that a cenotaph was an inappropriate, Catholic form of monument, and that it might be desecrated. The victory marches went ahead; French political leaders had the memorial in Paris removed immediately after the parade, on the basis that it was too Germanic in appearance, but the London cenotaph proved very popular and hundreds of thousands flocked to see it. The popularity of the temporary Cenotaph resulted in it remaining open until the following year, when the decision had to be taken {{about what to do with}} the decaying structure: there was concern from the government that a permanent memorial might be vandalised, while the popular press criticised <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> of dismantling the existing structure. A new, permanent cenotaph designed by Edwin Lutyens was commissioned and unveiled on Whitehall Street on Armistice Day 1920, effectively turning this part of London into a memorial to the war; over a million people visited the site during November that year. The memorial style became very popular and spread to other countries in the subsequent years.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Paul Tate {{preferred}} not to make public comments; however, he was a constant presence during the murder trial, and in the following years attended parole hearings with his wife, and wrote letters to authorities in which he strongly opposed <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> of parole.

25|$|At Bernal's {{memorial}} service, Zuckerman downplayed Bernal's {{part in the}} Normandy landings, {{saying he}} was not cleared for {{the highest levels of}} security. Given Bernal's Marxist and pro-Soviet sympathies it is perhaps remarkable that there has never been <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> that he fed any information in that direction. But Brown provides evidence of Bernal's contributions to the preparation and the success of the invasion.|$|E

25|$|On 4 April reports emerged, later {{confirmed}} by US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, that an Iranian representative {{will meet the}} five Iranian government employees captured in January in a US raid on an Iranian liaison office in Arbil, although {{this would not be}} an official consular visit.

25|$|In none of {{the papers}} is there <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> there was verbal or {{physical}} violence {{on the part of}} Sergeant Woodard. It's quite unclear what really happened.

Woodard also suffered partial amnesia {{as a result of his}} injuries.|$|E
25|$|By 1978–79, up to 70% of {{the regular}} army was {{composed}} of black soldiers (though both the army and police reserves remained overwhelmingly white). By 1979 there were also 30 black commissioned officers in the regular army. While there was never <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> of disloyalty among the soldiers from predominantly black units (in particular within the Selous Scouts or the Rhodesian African Rifles – RAR), some argue that, {{by the time of}} the 1980 election, many of the RAR soldiers voted for Robert Mugabe.|$|E
50|$|The {{researchers}} also commented that these four areas of gendering sexuality occurred {{among the participants}} without <b>any</b> <b>suggestions</b> or hints towards these particular subject areas.

25|$|Despite (or {{perhaps because}} of) {{the fact that}} Wonder Woman {{had fallen in love}} with the first Steve Trevor, the {{producers}} chose to drop <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> that Steve Jr. and Wonder Woman were anything more than good friends. Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made it quite clear that she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S. Cramer noted the difficulties in maintaining long-term romantic tension between leads, because the resolution of that romantic tension often results in the cancellation of the series.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} or four camps {{under the name of}} Camp Farouk at that time in Afghanistan. I {{attended}} the open mainstream camp, not terrorist camps. I would not have been there if there was <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> of terrorist activity or the targeting of civilians. How would a white boy new to Islam, not understanding local customs or languages, largely uneducated in the ways of the world, get access to such supposedly secret camps planning acts of terror? The camps I attended were not al-Qaeda. I did not hear about such an organisation until my arrival in Guantanamo Bay.|$|E

There was controversy surrounding the omission of Indian captain Sourav Ganguly from the Asian side, leading to Ganguly criticising the selection panel and process; although {{there were reports that}} the selection panel decided unanimously against including Ganguly, and that <b>any</b> <b>suggestion</b> that he should have been included would have led to Majid Khan and Ravi Shastri walking out.|$|E
