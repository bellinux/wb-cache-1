5|$|Examples of graphs with <b>arbitrarily</b> large {{values of}} odd girth and {{chromatic}} number are Kneser graphs and generalized Mycielskians.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Euclid's algorithm, which computes the GCD of two integers, suffices to {{calculate}} the GCD of <b>arbitrarily</b> many integers.|$|E
5|$|According to {{quantum chromodynamics}} (QCD), quarks possess a {{property}} called color charge. There are {{three types of}} color charge, <b>arbitrarily</b> labeled blue, green, and red. Each of them is complemented by an anticolor – antiblue, antigreen, and antired. Every quark carries a color, while every antiquark carries an anticolor.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted <b>arbitrarily</b> or had operated <b>arbitrarily.</b>|$|E
5|$|Goldstone's theorem {{in quantum}} field theory states that in a system with broken {{continuous}} symmetry, there may exist excitations with <b>arbitrarily</b> low energy, called the Goldstone bosons. For example, in crystalline solids, these correspond to phonons, which are quantized versions of lattice vibrations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to prisons, labor camps and transformation facilities, the 610 Office can <b>arbitrarily</b> compel mentally healthy Falun Gong practitioners into psychiatric facilities. In 2002, {{it was estimated}} that approximately 1,000 Falun Gong adherents were being held against their will in mental hospitals, where reports of abuse were common.|$|E
5|$|In {{the maximum}} clique problem, the input is an undirected graph, and the output is a maximum clique in the graph. If there are {{multiple}} maximum cliques, one of them may be chosen <b>arbitrarily.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} from the 8th to the 12th century, Old English {{gradually}} transformed through language contact into Middle English. Middle English is often <b>arbitrarily</b> defined as beginning with the conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066, but it developed further in {{the period from}} 1200–1450.|$|E
5|$|One can {{ask whether}} the problem is at least {{solvable}} in a time <b>arbitrarily</b> highly dependent on G, but with a fixed polynomial dependency {{on the size of}} H.|$|E
5|$|Summation {{describes}} {{the addition of}} <b>arbitrarily</b> many numbers, usually more than just two. It includes {{the idea of the}} sum of a single number, which is itself, and the empty sum, which is zero. An infinite summation is a delicate procedure known as a series.|$|E
5|$|The single live cell of the {{starting}} configuration is a sawtooth pattern. This {{means that in}} some time steps the numbers of live cells grow <b>arbitrarily</b> large while in others they return to only two live cells, infinitely often.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the team}} was {{considered}} successful, {{in spite of the}} failure to recapture The Ashes, the problems between the players and the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players <b>arbitrarily</b> replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896–97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to <b>arbitrarily</b> high energy. The {{coupling}} constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This {{is one of the}} motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Grameen Bank {{started a}} new program, {{different}} from its traditional group-based lending, exclusively targeted to the beggars in Bangladesh. This program is focused on distributing small loans to beggars. The loans are completely interest-free, the repayment period can be <b>arbitrarily</b> long, and the borrower is covered under life insurance free of cost. For example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay back only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.|$|E
5|$|In the {{remaining}} case, each clause is either guaranteed to become true {{no matter how}} {{the remaining}} variables are assigned, or neither of its two variables has been assigned yet. In this case the algorithm creates a new choice point and sets any one of the unassigned variables to an <b>arbitrarily</b> chosen value.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the earl's arrival, {{judicial}} {{and police}} powers in territories {{controlled by the}} company were a confusion of differing standards that were also either inconsistently or <b>arbitrarily</b> applied. Part of Cornwallis's work was the introduction of criminal and judicial regulations that to a significant degree still underpin the Indian judicial system.|$|E
5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more <b>arbitrarily</b> defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{refused to}} hold the reunification elections, {{on the basis that}} the State of Vietnam was not a {{signatory}} to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Diệm the power to create laws by decree and <b>arbitrarily</b> give himself emergency powers. Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands, and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the Viet Cong, which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with any condition that could {{increase the risk of}} lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (<b>arbitrarily</b> defined as creatinine levels over 150 μmol/l (1.7mg/dl),), lung disease and liver disease. According to the prescribing information, heart failure (in particular, unstable or acute congestive heart failure) increases the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin. A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials, however, suggested metformin is the only antidiabetic drug not associated with any measurable harm {{in people with}} heart failure, and it may reduce mortality in comparison with other antidiabetic agents.|$|E
5|$|Pećanac had {{a leading}} role in the Association against Bulgarian Bandits, an {{organisation}} that <b>arbitrarily</b> terrorised Bulgarians in the Štip region. He also served as a commander with the Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists (ORJUNA). Pećanac was present as a member of parliament at the assassination of Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) leader Stjepan Radić and HSS deputies Pavle Radić and Đuro Basariček on 20 June 1928. Prior to the shooting, he was accused by HSS deputy Ivan Pernar of being responsible for a massacre of 200 Muslims in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{rates in}} Germany {{increased}} {{as the war}} drew to a close, particularly {{in areas where the}} Red Army was advancing. More than a thousand people (out of a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, <b>arbitrarily</b> executing civilians and setting fire to buildings. High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including Neubrandenburg (600 dead), Stolp in Pommern (1,000 dead) and Berlin, where at least 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified <b>arbitrarily.</b> Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsidiarity}} principle resolves some {{of these}} issues. The term originates from social thought within the Catholic Church and states that no larger organ shall resolve an issue that can be resolved at a more local level. It {{can be compared to}} federalist principles where entities of the union retain some aspects of sovereignty. Only when two or more members of the federation are affected by any given act does the federal government have the authority to intervene. Giving a reformed UN more powers but enshrining the subsidiarity principle in its Charter would guarantee that the UN does not evolve into a world autocracy that can <b>arbitrarily</b> dictate policy.|$|E
5|$|Warhol's {{production}} of Campbell's Soup can works underwent three distinct phases. The first {{took place in}} 1962, during which he created realistic images, and produced numerous pencil drawings of the subject. In 1965, Warhol revisited the theme while <b>arbitrarily</b> replacing the original red and white colors with {{a wider variety of}} hues. In the late 1970s, he again returned to the soup cans while inverting and reversing the images. Some in the art world consider Warhol's work completed after his 1968 shooting—which occurred the day before the Bobby Kennedy assassination— to be less significant than that done before it.|$|E
5|$|When {{a charge}} {{is placed in}} a {{location}} with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential {{at a certain point}} in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an <b>arbitrarily</b> chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.|$|E
25|$|F'kn is {{divisible}} by F'n, so, {{apart from}} F4 = 3, any Fibonacci prime {{must have a}} prime index. As there are <b>arbitrarily</b> long runs of composite numbers, there are therefore also <b>arbitrarily</b> long runs of composite Fibonacci numbers.|$|E
25|$|Sensitivity {{to initial}} {{conditions}} means that each {{point in a}} chaotic system is <b>arbitrarily</b> closely approximated by other points with significantly different future paths, or trajectories. Thus, an <b>arbitrarily</b> small change, or perturbation, of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} are plots of <b>arbitrarily</b> selected singular orbits.|$|E
25|$|Otherwise, choose '(X) <b>arbitrarily</b> {{to be any}} X-flap.|$|E
25|$|Security forces <b>arbitrarily</b> arrested {{union leaders}} (see section 6.a.).|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} of these {{equations}} the ratio tends toward A'n/B'n as z tends toward zero. In the second, the ratio tends toward A'n/B'n as z tends to infinity. This leads us to our first geometric interpretation. If the continued fraction converges, the successive convergents A'n/B'n are eventually <b>arbitrarily</b> close together. Since the linear fractional transformation Τn(z) is a continuous mapping, there must be a neighborhood of z = 0 that is mapped into an <b>arbitrarily</b> small neighborhood of Τn(0) = A'n/B'n. Similarly, there must be a neighborhood of the point at infinity which is mapped into an <b>arbitrarily</b> small neighborhood of Τn(∞) = A'n-1/B'n-1. So if the continued fraction converges the transformation Τn(z) maps both very small z and very large z into an <b>arbitrarily</b> small neighborhood of x, the value of the continued fraction, as n gets larger and larger.|$|E
25|$|Theorem (Erdős): There exist graphs of <b>arbitrarily</b> high girth and {{chromatic}} number.|$|E
