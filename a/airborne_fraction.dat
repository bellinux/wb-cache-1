The primary goals in choosing a stabilization temperature are (1) to ensure that the residual volatiles content is less than 0. 5 wt % including moisture, which might produce pressurizing gases via radiolysis during long-term sealed storage; (2) to minimize potential for water readsorption above the 0. 5 wt % threshold; and (3) to eliminate reactive uranium species.

Waste may be treated or stored in one of the HWM facility units prior to shipment off site for treatment or disposal. Planned facilities such as the Decontamination and Waste Treatment Facility (DWTF) and the Building 280 Container Storage Unit are expected to handle similar waste streams. A hazard classification was preformed in each facility safety analysis report (SAR) according to the DOE Standard 1027 - 92 `Hazard Categorization and Accident Analysis Techniques for Compliance with DOE Order 5480. 23, Nuclear Safety Analysis Reports. ` The general methodology practiced by HWM to determine alternate <b>airborne</b> release <b>fractions</b> (ARFs) in those SARs was based upon a beyond evaluation basis earthquake accident scenario characterized by the release of the largest amount of respirable, airborne radioactive material.

5000|$|As the {{industrial}} use of carbon by humans {{is a very}} new dynamic on a geologic scale, {{it is important to}} be able to track sources and sinks of carbon in the atmosphere. One way of doing so is by observing the proportion of stable carbon isotopes present in the atmosphere. The two main carbon isotopes are 12C and 13C. Plants absorb the lighter isotope, 12C, more readily than 13C. Because fossil fuels originate mainly from plant matter, the 13C/12C ratio in the atmosphere falls when large amounts of fossil fuels are burned, releasing 12C. Conversely, an increase in the 13C/12C in the atmosphere suggests a higher biospheric carbon uptake. The ratio of the annual increase in atmospheric CO2 compared to CO2 emissions from fossil fuel and cement manufactured is called the [...] "airborne fraction.". The <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> has been around 60% since the 1950s, indicating that about 60% of the new carbon dioxide in the atmosphere each year originated from human sources. For clarity, this is not meant to suggest that 60% of the uptake of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere comes from human activity. It means that the atmosphere exchanges around 210 giga-tonnes of carbon annually, but absorbs between 6 and 10 giga-tonnes more than it loses. Of this net gain, about 60% is attributable to the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{sources of}} [...] {{emissions}} are natural, and are balanced to various degrees by natural [...] sinks. For example, the natural decay of organic material in forests and grasslands {{and the action}} of forest fires results in the release of about 439 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide every year, while new growth entirely counteracts this effect, absorbing 450 gigatonnes per year. Although the initial {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere of the young Earth was produced by volcanic activity, modern volcanic activity releases only 130 to 230 megatonnes of carbon dioxide each year. These natural sources are nearly balanced by natural sinks, physical and biological processes which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For example, some is directly removed from the atmosphere by land plants for photosynthesis and it is soluble in water forming carbonic acid.

40|$|Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) conducts {{experimental}} {{work on the}} development of waste forms suitable for several types of spent fuel at its facility on the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) located 48 km West of Idaho Falls, ID. The objective {{of this paper is to}} compare the offsite radiological consequences of hypothetical accidents involving the various types of spent nuclear fuel handled in nonreactor nuclear facilities. The highest offsite total effective dose equivalents (TEDEs) are estimated at a receptor located about 5 km SSE of ANL facilities. Criticality safety considerations limit the amount of enriched uranium and plutonium that could be at risk in any given scenario. Heat generated by decay of fission products and actinides does not limit the masses of spent fuel within any given operation because the minimum time elapsed since fissions occurred in any form is at least five years. At cooling times of this magnitude, fewer than ten radionuclides account for 99 % of the projected TEDE at offsite receptors for any credible accident. Elimination of all but the most important nuclides allows rapid assessments of offsite doses with little loss of accuracy. Since the ARF (<b>airborne</b> release <b>fraction),</b> RF (respirable fraction), LPF (leak path fraction) and atmospheric dilution factor ({chi}/Q) can vary by orders of magnitude, it is not productive to consider nuclides that contribute less than a few percent of the total dose. Therefore, only {sup 134 }Cs, {sup 137 }Cs-{sup 137 m}Ba, and the actinides significantly influence the offsite radiological consequences of severe accidents.

40|$|In {{order to}} gain a risk {{management}} perspective, the DOE Rocky Flats Field Office (RFFO) initiated a survey of other DOE sites regarding risks from potential accidents associated with transuranic (TRU) storage and/or processing facilities. Recently-approved authorization basis documents at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) {{have been based on}} the DOE Standard 3011 risk assessment methodology with three qualitative estimates of frequency of occurrence and quantitative estimates of radiological consequences to the collocated worker and the public binned into three severity levels. Risk Class 1 and 2 events after application of controls to prevent or mitigate the accident are designated as risk-dominant scenarios. Accident Evaluation Guidelines for selection of Technical Safety Requirements (TSRs) are based on the frequency and consequence bin assignments to identify controls that can be credited to reduce risk to Risk Class 3 or 4, or that are credited for Risk Class 1 and 2 scenarios that cannot be further reduced. This methodology resulted in several risk-dominant scenarios for either the collocated worker or the public that warranted consideration on whether additional controls should be implemented. RFFO requested the survey because of these high estimates of risks that are primarily due to design characteristics of RFETS TRU waste facilities (i. e., Butler-type buildings without a ventilation and filtration system, and a relatively short distance to the Site boundary). Accident analysis methodologies and key assumptions are being compared for the DOE sites responding to the survey. This includes type of accidents that are risk dominant (e. g., drum explosion, material handling breach, fires, natural phenomena, external events, etc.), source term evaluation (e. g., radionuclide material-at-risk, chemical and physical form, damage ratio, <b>airborne</b> release <b>fraction,</b> respirable fraction, leakpath factors), dispersion analysis (e. g., meteorological assumptions, distance to receptors, plume meander, deposition, and other factors affecting the calculated {chi}/Q), dose assessments (specific activities, inhalation dose conversion factors, breathing rates), designated frequency of occurrence, and risk assignment per the DOE Standard 3011 methodology.

Currently for the quantification of such airborne {{exposure to}} inflammationinducing substances the LAL-Test is basically used to determine endotoxins. In addition to LAL-Test, test systems are used, which depend on releasing of proinflammatoric mediators from different cell systems. In contrast to the LAL-Test, these tests detect not only endotoxins, but also other proinflammatoric active substances, such as Glucans. One of these test systems is for example the so called Human Whole Blood Test. In this test, effective proinflammatoric substances are incubated with whole blood, then the releasing interleukin 1 ß from blood monocytes is quantified. In the present work, the LAL Test and the Human Whole Blood Test were compared for their quantification of inflammation-inducing substances in <b>airborne</b> dust <b>fractions</b> from animal houses. For this, the inhalable dust fraction, the respirable dust fraction, the PM 10 dust fraction and PM 1. 0 dust fraction were collected with standard filtration methods in different animal houses. Then the concentration of endotoxins and proinflammatoric substances in the samples was determined by using the above mentioned test systems. Furthermore, the obtained data were used for assessing whether endotoxins and proinflammatoric active substances may accumulate in one of the investigated dust fractions. In all dust fractions that were investigated in this work, a significant correlation between the endotoxic activity through LAL-Test and the proinflammatoric activity through Whole Blood Test could be detected. Thus, summarized it can be concluded, even though LAL-Test detects only endotoxins, it is also suitable to describe the airborne exposure to inflammation-inducing substances in animal stables. This result should be based on the fact, that endotoxins represent quantitatively and qualitatively the strongest inflammationinducing component in the air of animal houses. Furthermore the results of here carried out investigations indicate, that there is no specific accumulation of endotoxins and proinflammatoric active substances in anyone of the investigated dust fractions. A comparison of the volume-related proinflammatoric and endotoxic activity of in this work investigated dust fractions indicates, that the major part of the endotoxic and proinflammatoric activity is in the inhalable dust fraction and associated with particles, which are already deposited in the upper regions of the respiratory tract. Dust reduction measures in animal stables which, for example the nebulizing of oil, are especially effective in removing larger particles from the airborne state, should also contribute to a significant reduction in the total exposure to airborne endotoxins and inflammation-causing substances by both work staff and animals...|$|R

However, {{using the same}} database of measurements, other studies concluded that both chlorophyll and primary production had declined over this same time interval. The <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> of CO2 from human emissions, the percentage neither sequestered by photosynthetic life on land and sea nor absorbed in the oceans abiotically, has been almost constant over the past century, and that suggests a moderate upper limit on how much {{a component of the}} carbon cycle as large as phytoplankton have declined. In the northeast Atlantic, where a relatively long chlorophyll data series is available, and the site of the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey, a net increase was found from 1948 to 2002. During 1998-2005, global ocean net primary productivity rose in 1998, followed by a decline during the rest of that period, yielding a small net increase.

Uncertainties in this quantity are due to possible errors in the estimate of fossil fuel consumption and the corresponding CO 2 emission, possible natural fluctuations in the baseline CO 2 level, and uncertainties regarding the biospheric CO 2 input and uptake as a result of deforestation and reforestation and land management. Depending on different assumptions the effective <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction,</b> defined as the ratio of CO 2 increase due to fossil fuel CO 2 alone to the integrated CO 2 production, might be as low as 0. 38 or as high as 0. 72, compared to the apparent <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> of 0. 55. The effective <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> derived from carbon cycle models, considering only the CO 2 uptake by the ocean, lies in the range 0. 60 – 0. 70.

An extended form of the Kaya identity relates the increase in the CO 2 growth rate (1. 9 % y- 1 over 1959 - 2006) to the growth rates of four global driving factors: population (contributing + 1. 7 % y- 1); per capita income (+ 1. 8 % y- 1); the total carbon intensity of the global economy (- 1. 7 % y- 1); and <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> (averaging + 0. 2 % y- 1 with strong interannual variability).

40|$|Several basic ratios {{describing}} the carbon-climate system are observed to adopt relatively steady values. Examples include the CO 2 <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> (the {{fraction of the}} total anthropogenic CO 2 emission flux that accumulates in the atmosphere) and the ratio T/QE of warming (T) to cumulative total CO 2 emissions (QE). This paper explores the reason for such near-constancy in the past, and its likely limitations in future. The contemporary carbon-climate system is often approximated as a first-order linear system, for example in response-function descriptions. All such linear systems have exponential eigenfunctions in time (an eigenfunction being one that, if applied to the system as a forcing, produces a response of the same shape). This implies that, if the carbon-climate system is idealised as a linear system (Lin) forced by exponentially growing CO 2 emissions (Exp), then all ratios among fluxes and perturbation state variables are constant. Important cases are the CO 2 <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> (AF), the cumulative <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> (CAF), other CO 2 partition fractions and cumulative partition fractions into land and ocean stores, the CO 2 sink uptake rate (kS, the combined land and ocean CO 2 sink flux per unit excess atmospheric CO 2 ), and the ratio T/QE. Further, the AF and the CAF are equal. The Lin and Exp idealisations apply approximately (but not exactly) to the carbon-climate system in the period from the start of industrialisation (nominally 1750) to the present, consistent with the observed near-constancy of the AF, CAF and T/QE in this period. A nonlinear carbon-climate model is used to explore how the likely future breakdown of both the Lin and Exp idealisations will cause the AF, CAF and kS to depart significantly from constancy, in ways that depend on CO 2 emissions scenarios. However, T/QE remains approximately constant in typical scenarios, because of compensating interactions between emissions trajectories, carbon-cycle dynamics and non-CO 2 gases. This theory assists in establishing both the basis and limits of the widely-assumed proportionality between T and QE, at about 2 K per trillion tonnes of carbon...|$|E
40|$|Projections of the {{response}} to anthropogenic emission scenarios, evaluation of some greenhouse gas metrics, and estimates of the social cost of carbon often require a simple model that links {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) to atmospheric concentrations and global temperature changes. An essential requirement of such a model is to reproduce typical global surface temperature and atmospheric CO 2 responses displayed by more complex Earth system models (ESMs) under a range of emission scenarios, as well as an ability to sample the range of ESM response in a transparent, accessible and reproducible form. Here we adapt the simple model of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5 th Assessment Report (IPCC AR 5) to explicitly represent the state dependence of the CO 2 <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction.</b> Our adapted model (FAIR) reproduces the range of behaviour shown in full and intermediate complexity ESMs under several idealised carbon pulse and exponential concentration increase experiments.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of airborne endotoxins and microorganisms in livestock buildings (cattle, pig, poultry) was surveyed in four European countries (England, The Netherlands, Denmark and Germany). Measurements were {{made during the}} day and night. The endotoxin concentrations were determined from dust samples separated into inhalable and respirable <b>fractions.</b> <b>Airborne</b> microorganisms were classified as total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and total fungi. The lowest endotoxin concentrations were found in cattle houses. The highest concentrations of endotoxin were measured in poultry houses, especially percheries, with an overall mean of 692 and 49 ng/m 3 for inhalable and respirable fractions, respectively. Endotoxin concentration was usually higher in the day than at night. These concentrations give cause for concern for the health of stockmen working in such buildings. The corresponding mean emission rates from poultry houses were 678 and 43 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight, respectively, 51 and 6 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight from pig buildings and 9 and 1 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight from cattle houses. A new automated bioaerosol sampler was developed, which allows remote, independent sampling of airborne microorganisms. Its principle of operation is similar to a slit sampler: airborne microbes are collected by impaction on an agar surface. Most measurements of airborne microorganisms were made in Germany. The indoor {{concentration of}} total bacteria was 6. 43 log colony-forming units (cfu) /m 3 in broiler houses, 5. 1 log cfu/m 3 in pig buildings and 4. 3 log cfu/m 3 in cattle buildings. During the day, the overall concentration of Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 3 and 4 log cfu/m 3. The mean fungi concentration for cattle was 3. 8, for pigs 3. 7 and for poultry 4. 0 log cfu/m 3 during the day. Slightly lower concentrations were measured at night. No significant correlation was found between the concentrations of endotoxin and Enterobacteriaceae. The highest emission rate of total bacteria and fungi was measured for broilers, i. e. 9. 5 and 7. 7 log cfu/h (500 kg) liveweight, respectively. Buildings for laying hens had the highest mean emission rate of 7. 1 log cfu/h (500 kg) liveweight for Enter obacteriaceae...|$|R
40|$|The {{underground}} construction operations {{require special}} attention to Occupational Safety and Health - OS&H aspects. In such situations, the presence of some ubiquitous pollutants (e. g. silica) further contributes to the already critical environment due to narrow operating spaces, high concentration of great power machinery, production of airborne particulates from excavation activities. Moreover, the geological variability of rock formations may challenge the design decisions, and affect the exposure of workers to noxious pollutants. In this context an ongoing and continuous monitoring of the workers' exposure conditions and of the working environment quality can provide useful information about the possible correlation between geo-mechanical parameters of the rock formations, erformance parameters of the used technologies and techniques, and production or release of pollutants. The paper summarizes {{the results of a}} study carried out at "La Maddalena" pilot tunnel of the Turin-Lyon railway line. The excavation by an open Tunnel Boring Machine -TBM- takes place in a geological environment of rocks with a content of crystalline silica (quartz) ranging from 30 to 80 %. Hence, ongoing and continuous measurements (personal and stationary) in compliance with the up to date reference standards were scheduled from the very early stages of the excavation, to monitor the content of <b>airborne</b> particulate (respirable <b>fraction)</b> and crystalline silica. The study discusses factors and parameters possibly affecting the content of airborne silica: • the geological aspects; • the state of fracturing of the rock (in terms of Rock Mass Rate - RMR); • the water seepage; • the TBM's Performance parameters (thrust, head rpm, and daily progress rate); • the micro-climatic conditions in the tunnel. Due to the great variability of activities involved by the tunnel driving macro-phases, the evaluations on workers were conducted by homogeneous groups, divided by work area and with specific indication of the different jobs. The results proved that for almost all the groups the crystalline silica levels exceeded 0, 025 mg·m- 3, Threshold Limit Value - Time- Weighted Average - TLV-TWA for the pulmonary fibrosis Risk suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists - ACGIH (coherently with the ACGIH's approach to provide information on the risk involved by substances with reference only to health impairments other than cancer, and to include clear information on the possible carcinogenic class). The achieved results will be helpful to improve the Chemical Risk Management in the future Base Tunnel construction...|$|R
40|$|Airborne disease {{transmission}} {{has always}} been a topic of wide interest in various fields for decades. The transmission of airborne disease starts when the infectious agents such as the influenza virus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis are exhaled from an infected person. The infectious agents are then dispersed and finally inhaled by a susceptible person. The transmission of infectious diseases in indoor environments, especially in aircraft cabins may represent great risk as they have high occupant density and need to be investigated. With the recent advancements, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become a powerful tool for predicting the transmission of airborne diseases in indoor environments. The CFD simulations need precise thermo-fluid boundary conditions for the exhalation/inhalation during various respiratory events and reliable flow models to accurately predict the transport of the infectious agents. ^ The present study first developed exhalation/inhalation models for coughing, breathing and talking. The study conducted measurements on the exhaled/inhaled flow rate, flow direction and area of mouth/nose opening with human subjects. The flow rate variation over time can be defined as a combination of gamma functions for a cough; sinusoidal function for breathing, and a constant for talking process. The variables required to define these flow rate functions can be obtained from the physiological details of a person. The direction of the exhalation jet and the area of mouth/nose opening did not vary significantly during these processes. Though variation among people existed but had no correlation with the physiological details of a person. Thus a mean value for these parameters can be used as boundary condition. In summary, a set of mathematical equations were developed to provide the flow boundary conditions to the CFD simulations for the coughing, breathing and talking processes. The equations account for the variation in the flow boundary conditions with time and people. ^ The droplets exhaled by an infectious person are the carriers of infectious agents. The transport of these expiratory droplets in an aircraft was investigated using the CFD methods. The developed exhalation/inhalation boundary conditions were used. A seven-row, twin-aisle, fully-occupied cabin with index passenger seated at the center was investigated. The droplets exhaled were from a single cough, a single breath and a 15 -s talk of the index passenger. The droplets were tracked by using Lagrangian method and their evaporation was modeled. It was found that the bulk airflow pattern in the cabin played the most important role on the droplet transport. The droplets were contained in the row before, at, and after the index patient within 30 s and dispersed uniformly to all the seven rows in 4 minutes. For the cough case, the total <b>airborne</b> droplet <b>fraction</b> reduced to 48 %, 32 %, 20 %, and 12 % after 1, 2, 3 and 4 minutes respectively. Similar observations were made for the breathing and talking cases. ^ The study further developed methods to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of expiratory droplets for any flight duration based on the 4 minutes of CFD simulations. The CFD simulations indicated that the local droplet concentrations were higher in the zone, where the expiratory droplets first reached. The droplets concentration then reduced due to the constant dispersion and removal of the droplets from the outlets. The variation in the droplet concentration {{in the vicinity of the}} passengers with time indicated that the droplets got well mixed in the cabin in 3 minutes, thus perfectly mixed conditions can be assumed beyond 3 minutes. The droplets from multiple exhalations from the index passenger were found to follow similar tracks. This indicates that the airflow in most of the cabin was steady. It is proposed that the concentration of the droplets in a zone can be obtained by adding the concentrations in the zone from all the exhalations taken place until that time provided with a time shift. Finally, the amount of droplets inhaled by the susceptible passengers was calculated for 4 hours of flight duration under three scenarios. ^ The study used the deterministic and probabilistic approaches (Wells Riley equation) to quantify the risk of infection based on the inhaled infectious dose. The inhaled dose was calculated using the amount of inhaled droplets and the infectious dose contained in a droplet. A case with index passenger suffering with influenza was analyzed. For the deterministic approach, the amount of influenza virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) particle inhaled by each passenger was calculated. For the probabilistic approach, the risk of infection for each passenger was evaluated based on the amount of inhaled quanta. The effectiveness of masks in reducing the risk of infection was also explored. ...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{carbon sinks}} {{currently}} absorb {{approximately half of}} the anthropogenic CO 2 emitted by fossil fuel burning, cement production and land-use change. However, this <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> may change in the future depending on the emissions scenario. An important issue in developing carbon budgets to achieve climate stabilisation targets is the behaviour of natural carbon sinks, particularly under low emissions mitigation scenarios as required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. A key requirement for low carbon pathways is to quantify the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies which will be strongly affected by carbon cycle feedbacks. Here we find that Earth system models suggest significant weakening, even potential reversal, of the ocean and land sinks under future low emission scenarios. For the RCP 2. 6 concentration pathway, models project land and ocean sinks to weaken to 0. 8 ± 0. 9 and 1. 1 ± 0. 3 GtC yr- 1 respectively for {{the second half of the}} 21 st century and to - 0. 4 ± 0. 4 and 0. 1 ± 0. 2 GtC yr- 1 respectively for the second half of the 23 rd century. Weakening of natural carbon sinks will hinder the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies and therefore increase their required deployment to achieve a given climate stabilisation target. We introduce a new metric, the perturbation <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction,</b> to measure and assess the effectiveness of negative emissions...|$|E
30|$|In {{addressing}} {{the amount of}} atmospheric removal, we must consider the ‘rebound effect’. When human activities cause CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere, only about half remains there, with the rest absorbed by terrestrial and oceanic sinks. When human activity removes CO 2 from the atmosphere, the opposite occurs. To reduce the CO 2 concentration by 1 ppm, for example, one needs to take up an amount of CO 2 equivalent to approximately 2 ppm (assuming that the <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> is approximately 0.5). This has been termed the rebound effect, and one must be careful about the efficacy of CDR (Cao and Caldeira [2010 a]).|$|E
40|$|Inclusion of {{fundamental}} ecological interactions between carbon and nitrogen cycles {{in the land}} component of an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) leads to decreased carbon uptake associated with CO 2  fertilization, and increased carbon uptake associated with warming of the climate system. The balance of these two opposing effects {{is to reduce the}} fraction of anthropogenic CO 2  predicted to be sequestered in land ecosystems. The primary mechanism responsible for increased land carbon storage under radiatively forced climate change is shown to be fertilization of plant growth by increased mineralization of nitrogen directly associated with increased decomposition of soil organic matter under a warming climate, which in this particular model results in a negative gain for the climate-carbon feedback. Estimates for the land and ocean sink fractions of recent anthropogenic emissions are individually within the range of observational estimates, but the combined land plus ocean sink fractions produce an <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> which is too high compared to observations. This bias is likely due in part to an underestimation of the ocean sink fraction. Our results show a significant growth in the <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> of anthropogenic CO 2  emissions over the coming century, attributable in part to a steady decline in the ocean sink fraction. Comparison to experimental studies on the fate of radio-labeled nitrogen tracers in temperate forests indicates that the model representation of competition between plants and microbes for new mineral nitrogen resources is reasonable. Our results suggest a weaker dependence of net land carbon flux on soil moisture changes in tropical regions, and a stronger positive growth response to warming in those regions, than predicted by a similar AOGCM implemented without land carbon-nitrogen interactions. We expect that the between-model uncertainty in predictions of future atmospheric CO 2  concentration and associated anthropogenic climate change will be reduced as additional climate models introduce carbon-nitrogen cycle interactions in their land components...|$|E

Analysis of the linear model (including its uncertainties) suggests no significant decrease in the response of the natural carbon cycle. Recent data points rather to an increase. We apply the same linear diagnostic to fluxes from atmospheric inversions. Flux responses show clear regional and seasonal patterns driven by terrestrial uptake in the northern summer. Ocean fluxes show little or no linear response. Terrestrial models show clear responses, agreeing globally with the inversion responses, however the spatial structure is quite different, with dominant responses in the tropics rather than the northern extratropics...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial and oceanic {{carbon cycle}} {{processes}} remove ~ 55 % of global carbon emissions, {{with the remaining}} 45 %, known as the "airborne fraction", accumulating in the atmosphere. The long-term dynamics of the component fluxes contributing to the <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> are challenging to interpret, but important for informing fossil-fuel emission targets and for monitoring the trends of biospheric carbon fluxes. Climate and land-cover forcing data for terrestrial ecosystem models are a largely unexplored source of uncertainty {{in terms of their}} contribution to understanding <b>airborne</b> <b>fraction</b> dynamics. Here we present results using a single dynamic global vegetation model forced by an ensemble experiment of climate (CRU, ERA-Interim, NCEP-DOE II), and diagnostic land-cover datasets (GLC 2000, GlobCover, MODIS). For the averaging period 1996 – 2005, forcing uncertainties resulted in a large range of simulated global carbon fluxes, up to 13 % for net primary production (52. 4 to 60. 2 Pg C a − 1) and 19 % for soil respiration (44. 2 to 54. 8 Pg C a − 1). The sensitivity of contemporary global terrestrial carbon fluxes to climate strongly depends on forcing data (1. 2 – 5. 9 Pg C K − 1 or 0. 5 to 2. 7 ppmv CO 2 K − 1), but weakening carbon sinks in sub-tropical regions and strengthening carbon sinks in northern latitudes are found to be robust. The climate and land-cover combination that best correlate to the inferred carbon sink, and with the lowest residuals, is from observational data (CRU) rather than reanalysis climate data and with land-cover categories that have more stringent criteria for forest cover (MODIS). Since 1998, an increasing positive trend in residual error from bottom-up accounting of global sinks and sources (from 0. 03 (1989 – 2005) to 0. 23 Pg C a − 1 (1998 – 2005)) suggests that either modeled drought sensitivity of carbon fluxes is too high, or that carbon emissions from net land-cover change is too large...|$|E
