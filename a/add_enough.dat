5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E

In November 2016 the company reduced the workforce in the Perrysburg plant by 20% {{as part of a}} worldwide restructuring.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until about}} 1850 Sonoma Creek was {{unchanged}} from its natural state. Adverse erosion and bank cutting were at sustainable levels {{and did not}} <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> turbidity to the creek system to discourage aquatic species. Flooding in the downstream reaches did not realize the modern frequencies since all the creek reaches could absorb more excess water from peak rainfall events. The Kenwood area existed {{in the form of}} a large marsh effectively blocked by a natural earthen dam from penetrating the course of the creek as it flows west out of Kenwood toward Glen Ellen.|$|E

25|$|Surge - is {{the point}} at which the {{compressor}} cannot <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> energy to overcome the system resistance or backpressure. This causes a rapid flow reversal (i.e., surge). As a result, high vibration, temperature increases, and rapid changes in axial thrust can occur. These occurrences can damage the rotor seals, rotor bearings, the compressor driver and cycle operation. Most turbomachines are designed to easily withstand occasional surging. However, if the machine is forced to surge repeatedly for a long period of time, or if it is poorly designed, repeated surges can result in a catastrophic failure. Of particular interest, is that while turbomachines may be very durable, the cycles/processes that they are used within can be far less robust.|$|E
25|$|Rice is {{a staple}} food in Gullah {{communities}} {{and continues to}} be cultivated in abundance in the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. Rice is also an important food in West African cultures. As descendants of enslaved Africans, the Gullah continued the traditional food and food techniques of their ancestors, demonstrating another link to traditional African cultures. Rice is a core commodity of the Gullah food system: a meal was not considered complete without rice. There are strict rituals surrounding the preparation of rice in the Gullah communities. First, individuals would remove the darker grains from the rice, and then hand wash the rice numerous times before it was ready for cooking. The Gullah people would <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> water for the rice to steam on its own, but not so much that one would have to stir or drain it. These traditional techniques were passed down during the period of slavery and are still an important part of rice preparation by Gullah people.|$|E
25|$|This {{was a case}} filed before The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division {{on behalf}} of the Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America against University of Michigan – Michigan Stadium {{claiming}} that Michigan Stadium violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its $226-million renovation by failing to <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms, concessions and parking. Additionally, the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue, with nearly all the seats being provided in the end-zone areas. The U.S. Department of Justice assisted in the suit filed by attorney Richard Bernstein of The Law Offices of Sam Bernstein in Farmington Hills, Michigan, which was settled in March 2008. The settlement required the stadium to add 329 wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by 2010, and an additional 135 accessible seats in clubhouses {{to go along with the}} existing 88 wheelchair seats. This case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the DOJ the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules. The agreement now is a blueprint for all stadiums and other public facilities regarding accessibility.|$|E

The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Chefs charming cast and sharp, funny script <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> spice to make this feel-good comedy a flavorful—if familiar—treat." [...] Metacritic gave the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews".|$|E
500|$|Sakura Eries, also of Mania.com, gave volumes five, six, {{and eight}} to eleven {{positive}} ratings overall. She noted that volume five may appeal to readers {{more interested in}} the side characters, and that appreciating Kobayashi's humor {{in the second half of}} chapter eight [...] "requires a bit more mental effort". In volume ten, she remarks that while Kobayashi borrows the oft-used cliché of a disastrous school play, he manages to <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> twists to make it unique. The play's climax, however, confused her more than it amused her.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed {{review for}} Newsweek, David Ansen praised Rossum's performance, but criticized the filmmakers for {{their focus on}} visual design rather than {{presenting}} a cohesive storyline. [...] "Its kitschy romanticism bored me on Broadway and it bores me here—I {{may not be the}} most reliable witness. Still, I can easily imagine a more dashing, charismatic Phantom than Butler's. Rest assured, however, Lloyd Webber's neo-Puccinian songs are reprised and reprised and reprised until you're guaranteed to go out humming." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly believed Schumacher did not <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> dimension in adapting The Phantom of the Opera. [...] "Schumacher, the man who added nipples to Batman's suit, has staged Phantom chastely, as if his job were to adhere the audience to every note".|$|E

After 1863 the institution also admitted tuberculosis patients. The county built a separate building for the insane asylum in 1870.

500|$|Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy {{gave the}} episode a four star review, stating that it {{provided}} [...] "another {{example of a}} resoundingly triumphant ending that conveys so much via [...] simple image". He praised the characterisation of Toshiko—stating that both Mori and Raynor [...] "deserve {{a great deal of}} credit for reaching such dramatic heights"—and also the [...] "refreshingly non-mawkish glimpse at the brutality of war and humanity". Ian Berriman of SFX was more mixed, giving the episode three stars and comparing it to a re-written version of the series one episode [...] "Captain Jack Harkness". He felt that though the episode provided a [...] "likeably girlish side of Torchwood’s blandest character" [...] the characterisation did not <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> depth. Berriman acknowledged the [...] "sweet, surprisingly subdued, almost coy" [...] tone as an indicator of the programme's flexibility, but added that he [...] " [...] the show when it’s full-blooded and outrageous." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 gave a critical review, feeling that Toshiko and Tommy had [...] "no chemistry" [...] and that the episode seemed to convey that [...] "men die for women's wiles". She felt that despite the flaws of the romance plot, the episode provided some [...] "powerful stuff" [...] and that Tommy's plight was a strong concept if poorly resolved.|$|E
500|$|Life Is Peachy {{received}} mainly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Q Magazine said {{the album is}} [...] "Harsher and harder than their groundbreaking debut." [...] AllMusic wrote: [...] "Korn <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> elements of alternative rock song structure to make the music accessible to the masses, and their songwriting has continued to improve." [...] iTunes commented that [...] "Regardless of the musical textures, Life Is Peachy is unified in its focus." [...] Entertainment Weekly said that the album left the [...] "impression that frontman Jonathan Davis is turning his well-publicized childhood traumas into a cheap marketing device". They gave it a C- and said that it [...] "may {{be of interest to}} mental-health professionals." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Korn has learned more than a few tricks from Nine Inch Nails, and it's not above using invective for simple shock value. But the chip on its shoulder sounds genuine." [...] Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club panned Life is Peachy, calling the album [...] "nothing but plain old, ham-fisted, butt-stupid heavy metal". Adrian Bromley of Chronicles of Chaos wrote that he was [...] "impressed with the strength and sound quality" [...] Korn [...] "has been able to magnify with _Life Is Peachy_".|$|E
500|$|The pre-title {{sequence}} has a {{scene where}} Bond flies a nimble homebuilt Bede BD-5J aircraft through an open hangar. Hollywood stunt pilot and aerial co-ordinator J.W. [...] "Corkey" [...] Fornof, who piloted the aircraft at more than 150 miles per hour, has said, [...] "Today, few directors would consider such a stunt. They'd just whip {{it up in a}} computer lab." [...] Having collapsible wings, the plane was shown hidden in a horse trailer; however, a dummy was used for this shot. Filming inside the hangar was achieved by attaching the aircraft to an old Jaguar car with a steel pole, driving with the roof removed. The second unit were able to <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> obstacles including people and objects inside the hangar to hide the car and the pole and make it look as though Moore was flying inside the base. For the explosion after the mini jet escapes, however, a miniature of the hangar was constructed and filmed up close. The exploding pieces of the hangar were in reality only four inches in length. Bond stole a Mercedes-Benz saloon car at a depot manned by antagonist soldiers, then as he tried to escape drove over barrier spikes which shredded his tyres. So he maneuvered his vehicle's bare wheels onto the rails to pursue the train. During filming, the car had intact tyres in one scene so as to avoid any mishap.|$|E
6000|$|He {{called it}} [...] "Little Pyramus and Thisbe," [...] and it so pleased a certain rich lady that she paid a large price for it; and then, {{discovering}} that it told a true story, she generously <b>added</b> <b>enough</b> to send Johnny {{and his mother}} to the country, when Fay and her father were ready to go.|$|R

2500|$|Critics {{were divided}} on their {{opinions}} of the game, but overall review scores were moderate. [...] Aggregate scores averaged in the 60% range for both platforms at websites GameRankings and Metacritic. [...] Most reviewers praised the game's visual and audio presentation. [...] They felt that the environments were convincing as areas {{of the body and}} that the soundtrack was strong. [...] Critics differed in opinion in regards to gameplay; many praised the addition of local cooperative play and the ability to upgrade the MicroBot with new weaponry and features, but many felt the game did not <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> new gameplay elements to the genre to keep the player interested long-term.|$|E
2500|$|A special {{characteristic}} of slacklining is {{the ease with}} which the dynamics of the practice can be altered. Using narrow (...) webbing will result in a stretchier slackline. This allows for more sway in the line and can make a short line feel substantially longer. Wider webbing (...) is much more rigid, often creating a bouncier slackline optimal for aerial tricks. The tension of the line will also increase or decrease the sway of the line. Weight due to the different methods of tensioning will also vary the performance of a slackline. A comealong and a ratchet will both <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> weight to allow the feedback from quick movements on shorter slacklines to be felt.|$|E

2500|$|Pure culture yeasts {{that are}} grown {{in a lab}} are often freeze dried and {{packaged}} for commercial use. Prior to their addition into must, these yeasts need to be re-hydrated in [...] "starter cultures" [...] that must be carefully monitored (particularly in regards to temperature) {{to insure that the}} yeast cells are not killed off by cold shock. Ideally winemakers want to <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> inoculum to have a viable cell population density of 5 million cells per milliliter. The exact amount of freeze-dried culture varies by manufacturer and strain of yeast but it is often around 1gram per gallon (or 25grams per 100 liters). Wines that could have potentially problematic fermentation (such as high sugar level late harvest or botryized wines) may have more yeast added.|$|E
2500|$|Foley {{returned}} from knee surgery as Mankind {{to win the}} WWF Championship {{for the third time}} at SummerSlam in a triple threat match against Steve Austin and Triple H. It has been stated by Stone Cold, Triple H, and Foley himself that Triple H was originally scheduled to win the championship. Foley stated the reason he was booked into the match was because Austin had torn a ligament in his knee and a triple threat match would <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> intangibles to make an acceptable match without aggravating Austin's knee. Mankind's win also led to an enraged Triple H to assault Austin, justifying Austin's absence while his knee healed. Triple H defeated Mankind and won the title the next night on Raw. A major feud then developed between Mankind and the McMahon-Helmsley regime, led by Triple H. Mankind received a title shot against Triple H on an episode of RAW on October 25, 1999. Mankind appeared to have the title won after he forced Triple H to pass out by ramming a smelly sock down Triple H's gullet, but Val Venis interfered and cost Mankind the championship.|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{reception}} of Art of Conquest was lukewarm. GameRankings averaged it at 66%, and Metacritic averaged it slightly lower, at 63%. IGN, {{who gave it}} a 7.8 out of 10, stated [...] "While it's a solid game, there's just not enough here to compel me to reawaken the substantial addiction the first game generated. Whether or not it's worth it for you to pick this one up depends almost entirely {{on how much you}} enjoyed the original game. With so few significant changes it plays almost exactly the same. For those who couldn't get enough of Empire Earth, the expansion should be a perfect fit. Just don't expect the breadth and scope of the first game." [...] Finally, GameSpot gave it a 5.2 out of 10, and said [...] "Ultimately, The Art of Conquest doesn't <b>add</b> <b>enough</b> to make much of a difference." [...] A notable criticism from GameSpot was regarding the way Space was implemented in the game. Spaceships were only available on certain maps and the gameplay was very similar to water—a dock-type building is built and spaceships travel much like naval ships. Other reviewers found fault with the game's price of 30 USD. The IGN reviewer said [...] "I like Art of Conquest enough but it just falls short of being worth the $30 price tag." ...|$|E
