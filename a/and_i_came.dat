There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to understand it.|$|E

The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me.

500|$|Brundage's {{interest}} in Asian art {{stemmed from a}} visit he made to an exhibition of Chinese art at the Royal Academy in London in early 1936, after the Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Brundage stated of the experience, [...] "We [...] spent {{a week at the}} exhibition <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> away so enamored with Chinese art that I've been broke ever since." [...] He did not begin active collecting until after the Brundages' two-week visit to Japan in April 1939, where they visited Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara and Nikko. They followed up Japan with visits to Shanghai and Hong Kong, but due to the war between Japan and China, were unable to explore further on Avery Brundage's only visit to mainland China—this disappointment bothered him his whole life.|$|E

He finally died on 10 April after [...] "a constipation which medicine could not remove", leaving Coke {{in charge of}} a 30,000 acre estate at the age of 22. Soon after his father's death, Harbord and other senior Whigs visited Coke and asked him to stand for Norfolk in his father's stead. Coke was not enthusiastic, not seeing himself as a politician and hoping to enjoy his new estates and wealth, but after his visitors pointed out a Tory might otherwise replace him [...] "my blood chilled all over me from my head to my foot, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> forward". On 12 April he issued a manifesto to the Norfolk electorate, soon returning to campaign, and after being unanimously nominated on 27 April he was elected in May.|$|E

Leigh's character died in the eighth-season finale. In May 2012, Rhimes revealed why she decided to have Lexie die: [...] "I love Chyler and I love the character of Lexie Grey. She was an important member of my Grey's family. This was not an easy decision. But it was a decision that Chyler <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to together.

500|$|The Los Angeles Times film critic, Charles Champlin, {{explained}} that the Director's Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival [...] "came into being {{as one of the}} consequences of the political turmoil that aborted the festival in 1968. It is designed to make the festival a less than totally establishment affair and it offers Third World, independent and frequently angry films on social themes." [...] He further {{explained that}} Carradine's Americana was [...] "an ideal selection for the fortnight." [...] In fact, the film won the People's Choice Award there in 1981. Film columnist Christopher Hicks stated that Americana was also warmly received at the 1981 United States Film and Video Festival in Park City, Utah. [...] This was the third of such events which would later become known as the Sundance Film Festival. Carradine said of the audience's reaction to the film, [...] "Well, they laughed in all the right places, and they applauded at the end, so I guess it went alright." [...] He also said, [...] "Americana swept the festival <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> very close to making a distribution deal with Warner Brothers." [...] However, the Associated Press described Americanas reception in Utah as [...] "quiet".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Barbara Gordon, the Batwoman character and her sidekick Bat-Girl appeared in Batman-related publications, but were eventually removed at the direction of editor Julius Schwartz for being outdated and unrealistic. Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the Batman television series of the 1960s. Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl. When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating [...] "Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the ’50s but she {{had nothing to do with}} a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I knew we could do a lot better, so Julie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show." [...] Yvonne Craig portrayed the character in the show's third season.|$|E
500|$|Live was {{released}} to keep Usher's fans satisfied during the four-year break between My Way (1997) and 8701, his {{second and third}} studio albums, respectively. During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty (1998), Light It Up (1999) and Texas Rangers (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed {{in his hometown of}} Chattanooga, Tennessee on October15 and 16,1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, [...] "I really like the sound of a band, that's one, just for myself, but there were so many people who didn't {{get a chance to see}} the concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> out with a home video for all the people who didn't get a chance to see the performance, and a little bio of me as well." [...] Seven of the songs included on Live are from Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) and My Way. A medley of songs originally performed by Bobby Brown—"Don't Be Cruel", [...] "Every Little Step", [...] "Rock Wit'cha" [...] and [...] "Roni"—is also featured on the album, along with covers of Force MDs' [...] "Tender Love" [...] and LL Cool J's [...] "I Need Love".|$|E

500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E
500|$|Leave Home has various lyrical themes {{throughout}} its track list. The opening song, [...] "Glad to See You Go", is rather uptempo and frenetic. The track was about Dee Dee's then-girlfriend Connie, who {{was well known}} in the punk rock scene as having once dated New York Dolls bassist Arthur Kane and attempting to cut his finger off with a knife. Connie also harmed Dee Dee in several ways, such as slicing his buttocks with a beer bottle. At the time, every other member of the band despised Dee Dee's girlfriend and he eventually broke up with her. Joey recalls: [...] "Dee [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> up with the song 'Glad to See You Go,' about Connie's leaving." [...] In the mid-1980s, Connie died from a drug overdose. [...] "Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment" [...] utilizes Joey's singing abilities with its vocal-demanding melody. Author Scott Schinder called the song a [...] "sing-along mental-illness ode." [...] The next song, [...] "I Remember You" [...] was said by author Greil Marcus to be all about the moment where [...] "Joey's voice turns the single word [...] "you" [...] into pure poetry." [...] "Oh, Oh, I Love Her So" [...] pays homage to the 1950s doo-wop genre, and consists of a three-chord barrage. The song was written solely by Joey, where in the song he humorously tells of how he met a girl at Burger King and they fell in love by a soda machine.|$|E
500|$|American critic Robert Christgau {{gave the}} album a [...] "neither" [...] rating, {{indicating}} an album that [...] "may impress {{once or twice}} with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won't". A negative review came from Rolling Stone, who gave the album two stars out of five, labelling the album [...] "utterly disappointing" [...] and blaming producer Nellee Hooper, suggesting he [...] "sabotaged a ferociously iconoclastic talent with a phalanx of cheap electronic gimmickry." [...] Michele Romero of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying, [...] "On a few songs, [...] breathy mewl is a pleasant contrast to the mechanical drone of Sugarcube-like techno-tunes. But most of Debut sounds annoyingly like the monotonous plinking of a deranged music box. Wind it up if you like -- eventually it will stop." [...] Debut rated highly in British end of year polls. The NME ranked Debut at number one on their list of [...] "Top 50 LPs of 1993". Melody Maker placed the album at number six on their list of [...] "Albums of the Year for 1993" [...] calling it [...] "a fantastic debut". In 1994, Q included the album on their list for top fifty albums of 1993. Björk reacted to the positive reviews hesitantly, stating that if she'd [...] "delivered exactly the same album <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> from Nottingham, I'd have got completely different reviews, normal down-to-earth ones" [...] and that Debut [...] "was {{a bit of a}} rehearsal and it's really not that good.

In the debut story, while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman, Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the super villain Killer Moth, attracting Batman's attention and leading to a crime-fighting career. Although Batman insists she give up crime-fighting because of her gender, Batgirl disregards his objections.|$|E
