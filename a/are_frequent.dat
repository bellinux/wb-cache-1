Floods <b>are</b> <b>frequent</b> enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E

Droughts <b>are</b> <b>frequent</b> and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected.

It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E

Web sites such as Index Fungorum and ITIS list current names of fungal species (with cross-references to older synonyms).|$|E
