5|$|In 1811, Tucker was in Richmond {{to attend}} a benefit performance, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> life in danger during the infamous Richmond Theatre fire. The event, {{including}} a play entitled The Father, or Family Feuds and a pantomime afterwards named Raymond and Agnes, was held in December. It being Christmas time, the auditorium was packed—with 518 adults and 80 children.|$|E

5|$|Virgil Earp was {{not expecting}} a fight. Once Behan said that he'd {{disarmed}} the Cowboys, Virgil traded the short, double-barreled shotgun {{he was carrying}} for Holliday's cane. Virgil carried the cane {{in his right hand}} and shifted the pistol in his waistband from the right side to his left. Holliday concealed the short shotgun under his long jacket. Wyatt too was not expecting a fight <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> pistol in his overcoat pocket.|$|E

5|$|Whitlock {{is the son}} of Raymond and Genny Whitlock. Whitlock was {{originally}} going to be named Sergio Nehemiah Whitlock, but his grandmother did not like the name. His father, who worked for Yellow Pages, opened up a phone book to a random page <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> finger down to select his name, ending up with Nikita. Whitlock graduated from Wake Forest with a Health and Exercise Science major.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Corbally {{returned}} to school, {{where he met}} his wife Marguerite Walker; they married in 1946. In 1947, with a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington, {{he took a job}} as a high school chemistry teacher in Tacoma. He pursued further education at the University of Washington, graduating with a master's degree in 1950. He gained a doctorate in 1955 from the University of California, Berkeley <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> degree in educational administration and finance to work by taking an associate professor position at Ohio State University, where he would eventually become provost and vice president of academic affairs, positions held until he accepted the chancellor position at Syracuse University in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Because Missouri had {{run aground}} during {{an unusually high}} tide, Wallin {{required}} a date on which the tide would be roughly comparable to {{the conditions under which}} Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time as a factor, Wallin took charge of the operation <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> five-point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E

5|$|Monday {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the fire-fighting, but he had apparently left the City; his name is not mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events. In this state of emergency, Charles again overrode the City authorities <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> brother James, Duke of York in charge of operations.|$|E
5|$|At the 2007 World Championships, Lysacek {{made his}} first attempt at landing a quadruple jump in the short program. He {{attempted}} a quad-triple, but {{stepped out of the}} quad <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> hand down, and followed it with a double. He placed fifth in the short program and earned himself his first new short program personal best in two years. In the long program, he completed a quadruple toe-loop as the first part of a quad-triple combination, but lost control of the landing, adding a three turn after it, and was unable to complete the following triple as intended. He performed a double loop instead of a planned triple loop and placed fifth once again in the long program, placing fifth over all.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Booker and tech {{executives}} Sarah Ross and Nathan Richardson formed Waywire, {{a company}} focused on video sharing technology. Early investors included Oprah Winfrey, Eric Schmidt, Jeff Weiner, and Troy Carter. After Booker's relationship to Waywire was discussed in a front-page New York Times story, board member Andrew Zucker {{stepped down from}} his position. Shortly thereafter, Waywire CEO Nathan Richardson departed the business as the company shifted its focus from content creation to content curation. In August 2013, Booker told NBC News he intended to resign from the Waywire board <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> holdings in a trust if elected to the Senate; by September, he had resigned his place {{on the board and}} donated his share of the company to charity. Waywire was sold to another video curation business the following month.|$|E

5|$|In September York {{arrived from}} Ireland, {{and at the}} {{parliament}} of October that year, the duke {{walked up to the}} throne <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> hand on it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly in shock. It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York's plans, though it is assumed that this had been agreed upon between the two in Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was agreed. The Act of Accord of 31October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} {{expanding}} Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire {{had come into}} contact in the mid-1st century BC, there had been friction between the two great powers over {{the control of the}} various states lying between them. The largest and most important of these was the Kingdom of Armenia. In 20 BC, Augustus succeeded in establishing a Roman protectorate over the country, when Tigranes III was enthroned as king of Armenia. Roman influence was secured through a series of Roman-sponsored kings until 37 AD, when a Parthian-supported candidate, Orodes, assumed the throne. The Roman-supported king, Mithridates, recovered his throne with the support of Emperor Claudius in 42 AD, but was deposed in 51 AD by his nephew Rhadamistus of Iberia. His rule quickly became unpopular however, and this gave the newly crowned king Vologases I of Parthia the opportunity to intervene. His forces quickly seized the two capitals of Armenia, Artaxata and Tigranocerta, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> younger brother Tiridates on the throne. The onset of a bitter winter and the outbreak of an epidemic forced the Parthians forces to withdraw, allowing Rhadamistus to retake control of the country. His behavior towards his subjects, however, was even worse than before, and they rose in rebellion against him. Thus in 54 AD Rhadamistus fled to his father's court in Iberia, and Tiridates re-established himself in Armenia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} off-season, the Canucks {{announced}} they had re-signed Bure to a five-year, $24.5million contract on June 16. The deal {{was reported to}} have been signed before game three of the Stanley Cup Finals against New York. It also included Bure's marketing rights <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> father, Vladimir, on the team payroll as a fitness and marketing consultant. The average annual salary of $4.9million made Bure the league's third highest-paid player, behind Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. In fact, Bure and the Canucks had entered into contract negotiations {{at the beginning of the}} 1993–94 season, although two years remained in his original deal. Neither side could come to an initial agreement; one of the major factors was the Canucks' demands for the contract to be in Canadian dollars on account of the American exchange rate. Numerous accusations were made in the media during the Canucks' playoff run that Bure threatened not to play if a contract could not be agreed upon. A Toronto Star article, published before the first game of the Finals on May 31, 1994, claimed Bure had signed a five-year, $30million contract that, if the Canucks had not agreed to, would have seen him pull out of game five of the Conference Finals against the Maple Leafs. The article was followed by two additional claims in the following two days in the Vancouver-based newspaper The Province and Toronto Sun. The Toronto Sun held the contract was a five-year, $22.5 million deal, and that it was signed before either game six or seven of the opening round against the Flames after Bure's agent, Ron Salcer, told general manager Quinn that Bure would not play if the deal was not made. As the story continued well into the next season, Pat Quinn appeared in a segment on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)'s Hockey Night in Canada on March 27, 1995, publicly denying the claims.|$|E

5|$|Just {{after the}} start of the second half of extra time Cardiff made their final substitution, {{replacing}} McNaughton with Darcy Blake. Two minutes later Kuyt made a run from deep in the Liverpool half, his initial shot was blocked, but the ball rebounded towards him. As the ball came back to him he shot again and the ball went past Heaton and into the Cardiff goal to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. Cardiff were struggling after the goal with a number of their players suffering from cramp. Nevertheless, they had a chance in the 111th minute, when a Gunnarsson long throw was only half-cleared by Liverpool, but they were unable to convert the chance. Towards the end of the half Cardiff began to exert more pressure on Liverpool. Turner, who had been moved into the striker position won a corner for Cardiff, which was punched away by Reina for a throw-in. Cardiff won another from the throw, which found Kiss, whose shot was cleared off the line of the Liverpool goal by Kuyt for another corner. The subsequent corner was headed on by Gunnarsson to Turner, who beat Kuyt to the ball <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> shot past Reina into the Liverpool goal to level the score at 2–2. Turner was shown a yellow card for removing his shirt during the celebration of the goal. Liverpool won a corner with a minute remaining but they were unable to score and the referee brought extra time to an end with the scores level, resulting in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
