500|$|It was {{discovered}} that the craft was inherently unstable in forward flight, as the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center</b> of pressure was well forward {{of the center of}} gravity. The Avrocar thus included a mechanical stability control system that was independent of the pilot's controls.

The mathematical expressions for the aerodynamic loads need not be explicit functions of the blade displacement quantities.

2500|$|The {{center of}} {{pressure}} of an aircraft is the point where all of the aerodynamic pressure field may be represented by a single force vector with no moment. [...] A similar idea is the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center</b> which is the point on an airfoil where the pitching moment produced by the aerodynamic forces is constant with angle of attack.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in analysis of the longitudinal static stability of all flying machines. [...] It is desirable that when the pitch angle and angle of attack of an aircraft are disturbed (by, for example turbulence) that the aircraft returns to its original trimmed pitch angle and angle of attack without a pilot or autopilot changing the control surface deflection. For an aircraft to return towards its trimmed attitude, without input from a pilot or autopilot, it must have positive longitudinal static stability.|$|E

[...] This behavior is known as the [...] "helm" [...] and is either a weather helm or lee helm. A slight amount of weather helm is thought by some sailors to be a desirable situation, both {{from the standpoint of the}} [...] "feel" [...] of the helm, and the tendency of the boat to head slightly to windward in stronger gusts, to some extent self-feathering the sails. Other sailors disagree and prefer a neutral helm.|$|E
40|$|A special {{finite element}} for the {{modeling}} of a swept tip rotor blade is derived. The swept tip blade undergoes moderate deflections in flap, lag and torsion. The nonlinear, partial differential {{equations of motion}} are discretized using a Galerkin finite element method. Tip sweep introduces flap-torsion and lag-axial couplings, and may lead to aeroelastic instabilities associated with frequency coalescence. When frequency coalescence does not occur, sweep is usually stabilizing. A comparison of the approximate model of a swept tip blade, using a blade with straight elastic axis and offsets of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centers</b> of gravity, with the exact swept tip model developed in this paper indicates that the approximate model can produce inaccurate results for the case of hingeless rotor blades...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the NACA gust tunnel to {{determine}} the effectiveness of a torsionally flexible wing with the torsion axis ahead of the locus of the section <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centers</b> in reducing airplane accelerations due to atmospheric gusts. For three gust shapes, a series of flights was made with the airplane model equipped with either a torsionally flexible or a rigid wing. The results indicated that the torsionally flexible wing reduced the maximum acceleration increment 5 percent for the sharp-edge gust and about 17 percent for gust shapes with gradient distances of 6. 8 and 15 chord lengths. The analysis indicated that the effectiveness of this method of gust alleviation was independent of the gust velocity and that, for the same total load increment, the torsionally flexible wing would have 10 percent less bending-moment increment at the root section of the wing than a rigid wing in all but the sharpest gusts. The results also indicated that the torsionally flexible wing slightly increased the longitudinal stability of the airplane model in a gust...|$|R

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the death}} rate among the air gunners {{remained}} exceptionally high and not until late models produced after 1944, was the 13mm (.5 in) rear plate of the armour shell moved rearwards into the (wooden) rear fuselage to allow a gunner to sit behind the fuel tank. The armour did not extend to the rear or below although side armour panels were riveted to the rear armour plate to protect the ammunition tank for the UBT machine gun, providing some measure of protection. The modifications including adding the rear gunner and gun had added weight behind the center of gravity, resulting in [...] "marginal" [...] stability and handling characteristics that were [...] "barely acceptable". The need to shift the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center</b> of the aircraft rearwards due to {{the weight of the}} added rear gunner and lengthened cockpit was the reason for the swept back outer wings in later Il-2s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were known}} for their poor pitch handling characteristics. The famous aerodynamicist Irv Culver told Albatross owner Jeff Byard that the problem came from three sources. First, the rotation axis of the all flying horizontal tail was located at 35% chord instead of slightly {{in front of the}} <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center</b> at 25% chord. [...] Second, the horizontal tail rotation hinge had high friction. Third, the relatively soft pitch axis cable control system stored elastic energy reacting the friction in the tail hinge. As the pilot tried to input pitch controls into the unstable tail, the friction of the tailplane hinge prevented initial movement which then stored up energy in the control cables. The pilot then applied more force to get the desired reaction. Eventually, the high friction would break loose and the horizontal tail would move much farther than desired due to the higher than necessary force applied by the pilot and releasing the force in the control cables. The resulting over control often resulting in PIO and when near the ground would likely damage the aircraft. [...] Culver instructed the owner to move the hinge axis forward to 24.5%, add a downspring to the pitch control, and liberally lubricate the hinge axis before each flight to reduce friction. According to Byard, the plane flies significantly better with the improvements.|$|E
2500|$|The early {{two-seater}} prototype {{proved to}} be too heavy for the limited power of the early AM-35 engine. A redesigned single-seat version was soon developed and saw combat, particularly in the early phase {{of the war in}} the Soviet Union. While the Il-2 {{proved to be}} a deadly air-to-ground weapon, heavy losses were caused by its vulnerability to fighter attack. Consequently, in February 1942, the two-seat design was revived. The Il-2M, with a rear gunner under the stretched canopy, entered service in September 1942 with the surviving single-seaters eventually modified to this standard. Later changes included an upgrade from 20mm to 23mm or 37mm cannons, aerodynamic improvements, use of wooden outer wing panels instead of metal and increased fuel capacity. In 1943, the Il-2 Type 3 or Il-2m3 came out with redesigned [...] "arrow-wings" [...] that possessed leading edges that were swept back 15 degrees on the outer panels, and nearly straight trailing edges, resulting in a wing planform somewhat like the AT-6 trainer. Performance and handling were much improved from the resulting shift of the Il-2's <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center</b> rearwards with the revised [...] "arrow wing" [...] planform to correct the earlier problem, and this became the most common version of the Il-2. A radial engine powered variant of the Il-2 with the Shvetsov ASh-82 engine was proposed in 1942 to remedy projected shortages in the Mikulin inline engines. However, the ASh-82 was also used in the new Lavochkin La-5 fighter which effectively secured all available engines to the Lavochkin bureau. The radial engine Sukhoi Su-2 ground attack aircraft was produced in small quantities, but was generally considered unsuitable due to inadequate performance and lack of defensive armament.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{develops}} {{a new class}} of adaptive controllers that guarantee global stability in presence of actuation uncertainties. Actuation uncertainties culminate to linear plants with a partially known input matrix B. Currently available multivariable adaptive controllers yield global stability only when the input matrix B is completely known. It is shown in this work that when additional information regarding the structure of B is available, this difficulty can be overcome using the proposed class of controllers. In addition, a nonlinear damping term is added to the adaptive law to further improve the stability characteristics. It is shown here that the adaptive controllers developed above are well suited for command tracking in hypersonic vehicles (HSV) in the presence of <b>aerodynamic</b> and <b>center</b> of gravity (CG) uncertainties.
