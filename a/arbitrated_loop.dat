In this paper, we describe a FC-AL topology and FC-AL protocols for storage networks.

While this topology has the best scalability of the three FC topologies (the other two are <b>Arbitrated</b> <b>Loop</b> and point-to-point), {{it is the only}} one requiring switches, which are costly hardware devices.|$|E

5000|$|Fibre Channel ports {{capable of}} <b>arbitrated</b> <b>loop</b> {{communication}} are NL_port (node loop port) and FL_port (fabric loop port), collectively {{referred to as}} the L_ports.

The hub on the other hand, while maintaining a logical ring, allows a star topology on the cable level. Each receive port on the hub is simply passed to next active transmit port, bypassing any inactive or failed ports.|$|E

In 1997, Data General's Clariion division took {{the unusual step of}} adopting an emerging standard — Fibre Channel.

50|$|<b>Arbitrated</b> <b>Loop</b> (see FC-AL-2). In this design, all {{devices are}} in a loop or ring, similar to token ring networking. Adding or {{removing}} a device from the loop causes all activity on the loop to be interrupted. The failure of one device causes {{a break in the}} ring. Fibre Channel hubs exist to connect multiple devices together and may bypass failed ports. A loop may also be made by cabling each port to the next in a ring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arbitrated</b> <b>Loop,</b> {{also known}} as FC-AL, is a Fibre Channel {{topology}} in which devices are connected in a one-way loop fashion in a ring topology. Historically it was a lower-cost alternative to a fabric topology. It allowed connection of many servers and computer storage devices without using then very costly Fibre Channel switches. The cost of the switches dropped considerably, so by 2007, FC-AL had become rare in server-to-storage communication. It is however still common within storage systems.|$|E

5000|$|In modern SCSI {{transport}} protocols, {{there is}} an automated process for the [...] "discovery" [...] of the IDs. The SSA initiator (normally the host computer through the 'host adaptor') [...] "walk the loop" [...] to determine what devices are connected and then assigns each one a 7-bit [...] "hop-count" [...] value. Fibre Channel - <b>Arbitrated</b> <b>Loop</b> (FC-AL) initiators use the LIP (Loop Initialization Protocol) to interrogate each device port for its WWN (World Wide Name). For iSCSI, because of the unlimited scope of the (IP) network, the process is quite complicated. These discovery processes occur at power-on/initialization time and also if the bus topology changes later, for example if an extra device is added.|$|E
40|$|The {{bandwidth}} {{performance of}} a Fibre Channel <b>Arbitrated</b> <b>Loop</b> (FCAL) is roughly defined to be 100 MegaBytes (10 bytes) per second. Furthermore, FCAL is capable of a theoretical peak of 40, 000 I/O operations (transactions) per second., These performance levels, however, are largely not realized by the applications that use Fibre Channel as an interface to disk subsystems. The bandwidth and transaction {{performance of a}}n <b>Arbitrated</b> <b>Loop</b> is sensitive to both the number of devices on the loop {{as well as the}} physical length of the loop. This study focuses on the effects of these two factors on the observed performance of Fibre Channel <b>Arbitrated</b> <b>Loop</b> as the number of nodes is scaled from 2 to 97 devices and as the physical length of the loop is scaled from 50 meters to several kilometers in length. To summarize, this study shows that the performance decreases significantly for very long loops and explains how this can be partially avoided. Also, the loop propagation delay on loops with many devices has only a moderate affect on performance. Finally, the effects of length tend to dominate the effects of population for very long, highly populated loops...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} delivering real-time messages, both periodic and aperiodic, over bre channel <b>arbitrated</b> <b>loop.</b> Periodic messages typically have hard real-time constraints whereas aperiodic tasks are delivered based on the best-e ort approach. The deadlines of periodic messages are guaranteed by limiting the packet size under the access fairness algorithm de ned in bre channel <b>arbitrated</b> <b>loop</b> or FC-AL. The aperiodic messages are delivered using a global server scheme based on the full duplex communication and transfer state facilitated in FC-AL. The algorithm {{presented in this paper}} is optimal in that it guarantees all the deadlines of periodic messages and fully-utilizes network bandwidth. The optimality is expected to apply to many other broadcasting networks, both LANs and eld buses, by considering the global server scheme in their ongoing standardization processes...|$|E

The tutorial examines their interface specifications, transport protocols, fairness algorithms, and capabilities of fault tolerance.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the accomplishments of}} a Phase I project whose purpose was to demonstrate feasibility of developing inexpensive and fast data storage using multi-host Fibre Channel disk clusters. In Phase I, a working file system called ZFS was developed and tested. The ZFS approach {{was designed to be}} suited for high energy physics applications, but is general and flexible enough to be useful for other high-volume applications. The ZFS approach, which borrows from the networking concept of cut-through routing, uses Linux boxes and disk clusters in a Fibre Channel [...] <b>Arbitrated</b> <b>Loop</b> architecture. In ZFS, file locking and other meta-data level operations are carried out over the primary data network, after which all data are sent directly over a Fibre Channel between the workstation and the disk cluster. No intermediate server is required. Substantially higher throughputs than in traditional networked disk architectures have been demonstrated. The ZFS architecture is described and tests of the first implementation of ZFS at Fermilab are discussed. The current system is implemented for Linux and is being optimized for Fermilab's needs, but extensions to other operating systems and other data-intensive applications are clearly foreseen...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1998 / Town & Country Resort Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaSince {{becoming}} an ANSI standard in 1994, Fibre Channel has matured into a high-speed reliable data communication solution. Fibre Channel uses point-to-point, <b>arbitrated</b> <b>loop,</b> or switched topologies, {{to provide a}} wide range of options for data storage and highspeed data transfer applications. Unlike Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel supports protocols such as HIPPI-FP, SCSI and IPI, allowing for greater flexibility when designing systems. However, the wide range of options supported in the Fibre Channel standard can be the source of misunderstanding and incompatibility. This paper intends to clear up some of the misconceptions about Fibre Channel by presenting the current standard and discussing how Fibre Channel can be used in data acquisition systems. Since these systems often require extremely high throughput for routing data, as well as high speed data storage to long term media, solutions are not often cut and dry. This paper will give examples of how using different layers of the Fibre Channel protocol will meet the needs of today’s data acquisition requirements. It provides a brief overview of Fibre Channel technology and identifies the different types of Fibre Channel products available. It provides examples of how commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products can be used to build data acquisition and storage systems requiring throughputs of up to 90 Mbytes per second on a single fiber. Additionally, it shows how multiple fibers can be used to achieve much higher data rates...|$|E
