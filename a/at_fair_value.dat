2500|$|In 1961, Buffett {{revealed}} that 35% of the partnership's assets were {{invested in the}} Sanborn Map Company. He explained that Sanborn stock sold for only $45 per share in 1958, but the company's investment portfolio was worth $65 per share. This meant that Sanborn's map business was being valued at [...] "minus $20." [...] Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an activist investor, obtaining a seat for himself on the Board of Directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the shares. To avoid a proxy fight, the Board offered to repurchase shares <b>at</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value,</b> paying with a portion of its investment portfolio. [...] 77% of the outstanding shares were turned in. Buffett had obtained a 50% return on investment in just two years.|$|E

2500|$|Off balance sheet: Derivative (finance) of {{many types}} {{have in the}} past been {{referred}} to as [...] "off-balance-sheet." [...] This term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact. While there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally, there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives <b>at</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> on the balance sheet. There is also a generally accepted principle that, where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities, accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gain/loss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the income statement on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities. Certain credit derivatives products, particularly Credit Default Swaps, now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation. In the case of Credit Default Swaps, this documentation has been formulated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets.|$|E
5000|$|Although FAS 157 {{does not}} require fair value to be used on any new classes of assets, it does apply to assets and {{liabilities}} that are recorded <b>at</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> in accordance with other applicable rules. The accounting rules for which assets and liabilities are held <b>at</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> are complex. Mutual funds and securities companies have recorded assets and some liabilities <b>at</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> for decades in accordance with securities regulations and other accounting guidance. For commercial banks {{and other types of}} financial services companies, some asset classes are required to be recorded <b>at</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value,</b> such as derivatives and marketable equity securities. For other types of assets, such as loan receivables and debt securities, it depends on whether the assets are held for trading (active buying and selling) or for investment. All trading assets are recorded <b>at</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value.</b> Loans and debt securities that are held for investment or to maturity are recorded at amortized cost, unless they are deemed to be impaired (in which case, a loss is recognized). However, if they are available for sale or held for sale, they are required to be recorded <b>at</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> or the lower of cost or fair value, respectively. (FAS 65 and FAS 114 cover the accounting for loans, and FAS 115 covers the accounting for securities.) Notwithstanding the above, companies are permitted to account for almost any financial instrument <b>at</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value,</b> which they might elect to do in lieu of historical cost accounting (see FAS 159, [...] "The Fair Value Option").|$|E

40|$|<b>Fair</b> <b>value</b> {{accounting}} {{has become}} a very popular and controversial topic {{in light of the}} 2008 - 2009 liquidity crisis in the United States. <b>Fair</b> <b>value,</b> also called mark-to-market, implies that assets and liabilities get measured and reported in firms‘ financial statements at market value as opposed to historical value. This study explores <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting and looks at whether or not <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting contributed to the liquidity crisis in 2008 - 2009. The first section of this thesis addresses the definition of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> and takes a look <b>at</b> how <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> has developed over time by summarizing <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> pronouncements released by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

40|$|We survey CFOs from 36 {{countries}} {{to examine whether}} and how firms altered their risk management policies when <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> reporting standards for derivatives were introduced. A substantial fraction of firms (42 %) state that their risk management policies have been materially affected by <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> reporting.

Finally, firms that take active positions are more likely to be affected by <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> reporting. Taken together, our evidence indicates that requirements to report derivatives <b>at</b> <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> have had a material impact on derivative use; while speculative activities have been reduced, sound hedging strategies have been compromised as well...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the association between}} asset revaluations of non-current assets and audit fees, using a sample of ASX 300 companies from the years 2003 – 2007.

Furthermore, companies whose noncurrent assets are revalued upwards and those that revalue their non-current assets upwards every year have significantly higher audit fees. Additional tests provide empirical evidence that the strength of corporate governance has a moderating effect on the level of audit fees.
