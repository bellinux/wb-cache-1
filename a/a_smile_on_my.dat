500|$|Half an {{hour after}} Michael Vaughan {{resigned}} from the Test captaincy, Collingwood relinquished charge of the ODI squad because it was affecting his ability to enjoy the game. Collingwood told his wife {{on the night before}} his century against South Africa {{that it was time to}} go. [...] He later explained, [...] "I've found the extra workload to be very difficult [...] [...] It's mentally tiring, and that's the top and bottom of it. [...] I want to have <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face when I'm playing cricket, and, if I'd have kept going, I'm not sure that would have been the case." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face, too.|$|E
2500|$|Stuart Snyder, {{who oversaw}} Cartoon Network and other Turner Broadcasting System cable {{networks}} from 2007 to 2014, said he {{became interested in}} the new Clone Wars series immediately upon starting the job in May 2007. Snyder flew out to San Francisco, California to screen several episodes, and told Lucas the only place he wanted to see the show was on Cartoon Network. Snyder wished to create an action/adventure block of shows on Friday night in an attempt to rejuvenate Cartoon Network. Snyder expressed confidence that the shows would help boost ratings: [...] "You catch me at a time where I have <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face because of our internal results". [...] "I can say there's a little bit of bragging on the third quarter for us." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{warmth and}} odour stole over my senses. I was neither hungry nor thirsty, but drugged with fatigue. With <b>a</b> fixed <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face (<b>a</b> <b>smile</b> betokening, as I believe now, little but {{feminine}} vanity and satisfaction after feeding on that strange heart), my thoughts went wandering. The sounds of skies and earth drowsed my senses, and I nodded {{off into a}} nap. The grinding of wheels awoke me. From a welter of dreams I gazed out through {{the opening of the}} barn at a little battered cart and a shaggy pony. And behold, on the chopped straw and hay beside me, lay stretched out, nose on paw, our enemy, the sheep-dog. He thumped a friendly tail at me, while he growled at my deliverer.|$|R
6000|$|Edith turned even paler than before. [...] "You {{will not}} give me up, Harold, but you cannot hold me. I can bear my life in {{seclusion}} and retirement, and can even be happy in the thought of our past love, of your greatness, and in the peace of England, which, I should have the consolation of knowing, {{was due to the}} sacrifice that we had both made, but I could not live happy, even with your love and your companionship, knowing that I have brought woes upon England. Nor will I live so. Death will break the knot if you will not do so, and I could die with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lips, knowing that I was dying for your good and England's. If you will not break the bond death shall do so, and ere to-morrow's sun rises, either by your sacrifice or by my own hand, you will be free. Marry for the good of England. Here is the ring by which you pledged your troth to me," [...] and she took it from her finger and dropped it in the fire that blazed on the hearth. [...] "There is the end of it, but not the end of our love. I shall think of you, and pray for you always, Harold. Oh, my dear lord and master, do not make it too hard for me!" [...] and she threw herself on his neck in a passion of tears. For two or three minutes they stood locked in each other's close embrace, then she withdrew herself from his arms.|$|E
60|$|I {{write on}} the instant, as you direct; and in a tragi-comic humour, for I have a tear in my eye and <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> cheek. Dearest Darsie, sure never a being but {{yourself}} could be so generous--sure never a being but yourself could be so absurd! I remember {{when you were a}} boy you wished to make your fine new whip a present to old Aunt Peggy, merely because she admired it; and now, with like unreflecting and inappropriate liberality, you would resign your beloved to a smoke-dried young sophister, who cares not one of the hairs which it is his occupation to split, for all the daughters of Eve. I in love with your Lilias--your Green Mantle--your unknown enchantress!--why I scarce saw her for five minutes, and even then only the tip of her chin was distinctly visible. She was well made, and the tip of her chin was of a most promising cast {{for the rest of the}} face; but, Heaven save you! she came upon business! and for a lawyer to fall in love with a pretty client on a single consultation, would be as wise as if he became enamoured of a particularly bright sunbeam which chanced for a moment to gild his bar-wig. I give you my word I am heart-whole and moreover, I assure you, that before I suffer a woman to sit near my heart's core, I must see her full face, without mask or mantle, aye, and know a good deal of her mind into the bargain. So never fret yourself on my account, my kind and generous Darsie; but, for your own sake, have a care and let not an idle attachment, so lightly taken up, lead you into serious danger.|$|E

50|$|Even with Jonathan Ross as {{a three-hour}} warm-up man, Buy Me Up TV failed to coax the glimmer of <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> face. The talents of Doon Mackichan couldn't rescue Justin Edwards' and James Eldred's account of life {{behind the scenes}} at a 24-hour {{shopping}} channel.Perhaps, judging that this setting {{has been the subject}} of numerous satires, the authors settled for a frenzied facsimile of life at the consumerist cutting edge. Everyone sounded barking, indeed on the verge of a nervous breakdown, perhaps because they had to cope with dialogue that could apparently only be delivered at ear-shattering volume. The audience laughter was strangely disturbing, as if they had been force fed E numbers before being manacled to their seats.|$|R
2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time.

Then I saw 2 ̆ 2 South Karelian Institute 2 ̆ 2 on the address label, and with <b>a</b> big <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face I opened the package. In it was a CD-ROM with a short film that brought back pleasant memories of Lappeenranta. This tranquil, provincial town on beautiful Lake Saimaa in Finland served as the venue of the Second Plenary Conference of the Tensions of Europe Network, which I attended back in May. This unusual gesture of distributing a souvenir CD reflects the enthusiasm with which local organizer Karl-Erik Michelsen and his team from the South Karelian Institute of the Lappeenranta University of Technology, assisted by Donna Mehos of the Foundation for the History of Technology, put together this event on 2 ̆ 2 Technology and the Rethinking of European Borders. 2 ̆...|$|R

5000|$|The Alessi {{family were}} {{introduced}} in 1992 following the announced departures of several regular characters. The family were the first [...] "truly ethnic" [...] group to be introduced into the cast. Following her stint as Meg Morris in Prisoner, Ballantyne took eight years off television to concentrate on theatre work. She then received the role of Cathy Alessi and revealed she could not turn it down. Ballantyne told David Nicholls of Inside Soap [...] "I had <b>a</b> wry <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face when I read about the character of Cathy Alessi. She has two teenage sons, one just {{out of school and}} one still in school, and that's a very similar situation to my own." [...] Ballantyne's character became popular with viewers in Australia and the actress said Cathy had some good storylines coming up, so she hoped she would become as popular as Meg. Within a year, the entire Alessi family had left, leaving only Rick (Dan Falzon) behind.|$|R
5000|$|Matinee {{was well}} {{received}} by film critics {{and has a}} 93% rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 30 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three and half out of four stars and wrote, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} big laughs in Matinee, and not many moments when I didn't have <b>a</b> wide <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Matinee, which devotes a lot of energy to the minor artifacts of American pop culture circa 1962, is funny and ingenious up to a point. Eventually, it becomes much too cluttered, with an oversupply of minor characters and a labored bomb-and-horror-film parallel that necessitates bringing down the movie house". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "In Matinee, Dante has captured the reason that Cold War trash like Mant struck such a nerve in American youth: The prospect of atomic disaster was so fanciful and abstract that it began to merge in people's imaginations with the very pop culture it had spawned. In effect, it all became one big movie. Matinee is a loving tribute to the schlock that fear created".|$|R
40|$|Do {{you like}} action? Do you enjoy problem-solving? Would it intrigue {{you to be}} a part of a field where you will be {{learning}} throughout your entire life? I’m an emergency room pharmacist and I love my job. I always knew that I wanted to be a pharmacist. I made my decision freshman year of high school when I did community service in the pharmacy at the local hospital. After graduating high school in 2001, I nurtured my interest by working as a pharmacy tech for years while i was an undergrad. Life after high school [...] . is always full of surprises. I was almost derailed a couple of times (I will give you advice on how to avoid this) but I graduated from NSU in 2006 with my B. S. in Biology, then went on to pharmacy school. I graduated from NSU COP in 2010, finished a year of residency with a focus on emergency medicine and was hired as an emergency department pharmacist. I then worked on a clinical toxicology certificate through the University of Florida for a couple of years so I can be more helpful in drug overdoses and poisonings. I moved to California a couple of years ago and here I am, I really feel like I am living the dream, working a job that puts <b>a</b> silly <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face pretty much every single day. When I think about going to work, I actually get super excited. If you think about it, pretty much every situation in the emergency room is treated with medications and I am thus a part of every single patient that comes through our doors. From therapeutic recommendations to dose adjustments to helping determine how to best give a medication and what to look out for, I can say that I help save lives, every day. Selecting, dosing and giving medications can be incredibly stressful to non-pharmacists. It’s really great to be part of the emergency department and the emergency room staff is always so appreciative to have us there. If you have a thirst for action, can keep your calm in stressful situations and enjoy solving problems with an enthusiastic, diverse team of people, think about being an emergency department pharmacist. You’ll never be bored, I promise...|$|R

Subhash K. Jha also gave a 4/5 and said, [...] "Hrishida won't recognise this as his [...] "Khubsoorat". But he won't disapprove of what has been done to his work". [...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave the film a 4/5 and said that, [...] "director Shashank Ghosh is no Hrishikesh Mukherjee" [...] though manages [...] "to make a perfect Disney movie. It makes you laugh. It makes you go 'aww' and that goes a long way in a young romance" [...] Saibaal Chatterjee of NDTV also gave a positive review, giving the film a 3.5/5 and saying, [...] "in the end, Khoobsurat is a pretty good show. It is both funny and flashy, but its many flourishes are delivered in measures that religiously avoid excess". Srijana Mitra Das of Times of India gave the film 3.5/5 and said, [...] "This delightfully roguish romance tickles everything fun-loving inside you ... that's what makes it so khoobsurat." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN IBN gave a rating of 3/5 and wrote, [...] "Khoobsurat is for those seeking comfort in the familiar, it's a pretty satisfying watch." [...] Sarita A. Tanwar of DNA India gave the film 3/5 and said it [...] "is sure to connect with the hearts of girls of all ages". Sonia Chopra of Sify also gave the film a 3/5, and said [...] "this film has little of the gentle nuance of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee-directed original, but it's still pretty good fun. This Bollywood-Disney fairytale combo is worth a shot". Raja Sen, of Rediff gave the film 3/5, and compared it to candy, saying [...] "wrapped in bright plastic and frequently too sweet for your own good, they act as sunny, unsurprising treats that lead to sticky, syrupy smiles". Andy Webster of the New York Times also wrote positively, saying [...] "Bollywood films have appropriated Hollywood genres and imagery for years, but Mr. Ghosh, using a pleasing pastel palette, deftly achieves a particularly Disney-like polish. And he avoids making-of-a-royal pitfalls: Ms. Kapoor’s character never abandons her humor for refinement. Twice, Mili says that she was raised to speak up for herself. Not a bad characteristic for a future Rajput princess".However, a critic at Bollywood Hungama disagreed and gave the film 2.5/5, and said, [...] "overall, Khoobsurat is likeable in parts with good performances and stunning visuals; however the weak script is an 'ugly' hurdle this film will face at the box-office". Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times also gave a negative review, giving the film a 1/5, and said [...] "the film could have been more tolerable".|$|R
