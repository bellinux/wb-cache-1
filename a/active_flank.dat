40|$|Despite {{the clear}} {{evidence}} of <b>active</b> <b>flank</b> dynamics that is affecting {{the eastern side of}} Mount Etna, the contribution of tectonic processes has not been yet understood. So far, the various models proposed to explain the observed flank deformation have been based on onshore structural data, coming from the volcanic edifice. The Ionian offshore of Mount Etna has been only recently investigated using multichannel seismic profiles, and offers the opportunity to image the structural features of the substrate of the unstable flank of the volcano. This contribution aims at describing the deformation located offshore Mount Etna using multichannel seismic profiles recently acquired during three seismic surveys. The onshore flank deformation of Mount Etna appears to be laterally confined by two tectonic guidelines, trending roughly E–W, located to the north and south of the deforming flank; the northern guideline, in particular, takes the surface expression of a sharp fault (Pernicana Fault). Though often assumed that these boundary structures continue offshore as linear features, connected to a frontal thrust ramp, the occurrence of this simple offshore structural system has not been imaged. In fact, seismic data show a remarkable degree of structural complexity offshore Mount Etna. The Pernicana Fault, for instance, is not continuing offshore as a sharp feature; rather, the deformation is expressed as ENE–WSW folds located very close to the coastline. It is possible that these tectonic structures might have affected the offshore of Mount Etna before the Pernicana Fault system was developed, less than 15 ka ago. The southern guideline of the collapsing eastern flank of the volcano is poorly expressed onshore, and does not show up offshore; in fact, seismic data indicate that the Catania canyon, a remarkable E–W-trending feature, does not reflect a tectonic control. Seismic interpretation also shows the occurrence of a structural high located just offshore the edifice of Mount Etna. Whereas a complex deformation affects the boundary of this offshore bulge, it shows only limited internal deformation. Part of the topography of the offshore bulge pre-existed the constructional phase of Mount Etna, being an extension of the Hyblean Plateau. Only in the northern part, the bulge is a recent tectonic feature, being composed by Plio-Quaternary strata that were folded before and during the building of Mount Etna. The offshore bulge is bounded by a thrust fault that can be related to the intrusion of the large-scale magmatic body below Mount Etna...|$|E

These results suggest that divergent transcription over short distances is common for active promoters and may help promoter regions maintain a state poised for subsequent regulation.

The morphological changes and depositional processes that brought to the gradual filling of the slide scar have been studied in detail. Thirteen surveys {{in a period of}} little more than 4 years provided a unique opportunity to reconstruct the morpho-sedimentary evolution of the submarine slope and its recovery after the mass-wasting event. The scar has been progressively filled with lava and volcanoclastic debris: ill the first month and a half, the filling rate was very high due to the entrance of lava flows into the sea and to the morphological readjustment of the slope: in the following months/years the rate dramatically decreased when the eruptive vents moved upwards and the eruption finally stopped. After 4 years (February 2007) more than 40 % of the scar was, already filled.

Etna has been observed and measured thanks to geodetic networks and InSAR data analysis. The spreading area is bordered to the north by the east-west Pernicana Fault System (PFS) whose dynamics is often linked with the eruptive activity, as recently observed during the 2002 - 2003 eruption. A seismic sequence occurred from April 2 - 3, 2010, along the PFS with very shallow (a few hundred meters) mainshocks of magnitude 4. 3 and 3. 6. Explosions and ash emissions at the summit craters followed this swarm culminating a few days later (April 7 - 8). Despite their small magnitude, the earthquakes caused damage and significant surface fracturing along the PFS. In order to investigate and measure the deformations in the near field of the earthquakes, the SISTEM integration approach has been exploited. The SISTEM enabled integrating geodetic in situ ground deformation measurements (GPS and Levelling) with satellite interferometric measurements (ENVISAT and ALOS), in order to obtain high resolution 3 D displacement maps, allowing to overcome the limitations of each technique and take advantage of the particular features of each of them. The integrated ground deformation field evidenced that the medium behave elastically.

40|$|Separate regions {{within the}} Transantarctic Mountains, the uplifted {{flank of the}} West Antarctic rift system, appear to have {{distinct}} Neogene histories of glaciation and valley downcutting. Incision of deep glacial outlet valleys occurred at different times throughout central and northern Victoria Land. This is corroborated by measurements of cosmogenic nuclides 21 Ne, robe and 26 Al of glacial erosion surfaces and high-elevated moraines. 21 Ne ages of two summit plateaus, at elevations of 1650 m in central Victoria Land and ~ 2800 m in northern Victoria Land, range from 3. 84 to 11. 2 Ma, respectively. The latter date indicates that these glacial erosion surfaces are the oldest known exposure dated surfaces on Earth. Glacial erosion terraces, remnants of early phases of valley downcutting, have 21 Ne ages of 1. 27 and 6. 45 Ma for central and northern Victoria Land, respectively. Therefore, deglaciation of summit plateaus, valley downcutting and topographic uplift occurred during the Mid-Miocene in northern Victoria Land and not earlier than the Mid-Pliocene in central Victoria Land. In northern Victoria Land, ice flow directions changed markedly from the time a regional ice sheet occupied {{the level of the}} highest summits to the present condition with summits rising up to 800 above the valley glaciers. In central Victoria Land, the oldest documented ice flow direction occupying the summit erosion surface prior to incision was SW-NE, draining the East Antarctic Ice Sheet along an outlet glacier at least 10 times as wide as the present E-W-flowing David Glacier. This great variation in denudation histories probably results from differential tectonic uplift of various regions within the presently <b>active</b> rift <b>flank.</b> Three tectonic processes contribute to Late Neogene uplift: (1) ongoing extension in adjacent Ross Sea rift basins; (2) regional dextral transtension following SE-trending Precambrian and Palaeozoic structural trends which offsets the ~ N-S-trending grain of the rift and reactivates earlier faults; and (3) isostatic response to valley downcutting and related denudation.

40|$|LTDS and VIBRATEC {{founded the}} Labcom LADAGE (gears {{dynamics}} joint laboratory). One of its {{goals is to}} develop numerical methods and simulation tools for predicting gears dynamics, {{in order to take}} account of multiphysics couplings between internal and external excitations and to follow the evolution of industrial demand towards more and more complex systems. The operation of a combustion engine is such that it generates a cyclic disturbance of the circular motion of the gearbox primary shaft. Coupled with internal excitations, this disturbance can generate losses of contact at the loaded gear pair. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox hammering noise. The irregular rotation of the motor is also sufficient for generating loss of contact of unloaded gears, such as idler gears of an automotive gearbox. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox rattle noise. Two different approaches can be retained to describe the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of mechanisms with contact and backlash nonlinearities, depending on the intensity of the vibroimpact pulses and contact duration. Hammering noise For high level pulses, the contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is long. A nonlinear dynamic model is introduced, taking into account both the gear backlash and the contact stiffness nonlinearities. Solving the equations of motion requires the implementation of specific methods dedicated to nonlinear problems. For example, the finite difference method is used in order to obtain the periodic solutions. They are followed up according to a parameter control, thanks to a pseudoarc length continuation method. Indeed, this approach has proven very efficient for studying multifrequency excitations. A direct integration time method is also used in order to compare obtained results. Eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix inform us about their loss of local stability and {{about the nature of the}} bifurcations that occur. This first approach is well suited to characterize the hammering noise of a truck timing multistage gear. A large variety of dynamic behaviours have been identified. In addition to periodic responses, pseudoperiodic and chaotic ones are highlighted. Multiple impacts per period of excitation are observed. These nonlinear responses occur at resonances and instability regions. Then, the adding effect of the engine torque fluctuation is considered. The dynamic behaviour of the two-stage gear train becomes more complex. Vibroimpact regimes are observed over a wide range of operating conditions. Rattle noise A second approach is retained for low level pulses. The contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is very short. They are described in a more simple way, using a coefficient of restitution. The dynamic response of the system is built piecewisely by solving the equations of motion for the free flight periods. New initial conditions are introduced after each impact, derived from the dynamic response just before impact. This second approach is particularly well suited to characterize the rattle noise due to nonlinear dynamic behaviour of idle gears of an automotive gearbox. In addition to the gearbox design parameters and the engine operating conditions, the dynamic response of idle gears depends on the drag torque applied to the idle gear and the coefficient of restitution. They are identified experimentally through implementation of optical encoders in an actual automotive gearbox and the operation of a specific test bench which replicates the automotive power train. Models of the different drag torque sources are validated from analysis of the free damped response of the drivelines. The coefficient of restitution and its probability density function are measured from further experiments under stationary operating conditions. A nonlinear model of the dynamic response of idle gears is built. The key parameters are the dimensionless backlash, the coefficient of restitution and a dimensionless parameter proposed to describe the rattle excitation level. Periodic, pseudoperiodic and chaotic responses including impacts between <b>active</b> <b>flanks</b> and reverse flanks are observed. Experiments under controlled excitation are performed to validate the assumptions, to confirm the ability of the proposed parameter to describe the rattle noise threshold, and to characterize the dynamic behaviour of the idle gear. Predictions are fitted with the drag torque and coefficient of restitution previously identified. Comparisons with measurements demonstrate the ability of the model to predict gear rattle for any idle gear, any gearbox and any operating condition...|$|R

Among the many modifications that have been characterized, histone tail acetylation is most strongly correlated with transcriptional activation. In Metazoa, promoters of transcriptionally active genes are generally devoid of physically repressive nucleosomes, consistent with the contemporaneous binding of the large RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. The histone acetyltransferase p 300 is also detected at <b>active</b> gene promoters, <b>flanked</b> by regions of histone hyperacetylation. Although the correlation between histone tail acetylation and gene activation is firmly established, the mechanisms by which acetylation facilitates this fundamental biological process remain poorly understood. To explore the role of acetylation in nucleosome dynamics, we utilized an immobilized template carrying a natural promoter reconstituted with various combinations of wild-type and mutant histones. We find that the histone H 3 N-terminal tail is indispensable for activator, p 300, and acetyl-CoA-dependent nucleosome eviction mediated by the histone chaperone Nap 1. Significantly, we identify H 3 lysine 14 as the essential p 300 acetylation substrate required for dissociation of the histone octamer from the promoter DNA. Together, a total of 11 unique mutant octamer sets corroborated these observations and revealed a striking correlation between nucleosome eviction and strong activator and acetyl-CoA-dependent transcriptional activation. These novel findings uncover an exclusive role for H 3 lysine 14 acetylation in facilitating the ATP-independent and transcription-independent disassembly of promoter nucleosomes by Nap 1. Furthermore, these studies directly couple nucleosome disassembly with strong, activator-dependent transcription...|$|R

Etna has been observed and measured thanks to geodetic networks and InSAR data analysis. The spreading area is bordered to the north by the east-west Pernicana Fault System (PFS) which dynamic is often linked with the eruptive activity, as recently observed during the 2002 - 2003 eruption. A seismic sequence occurred since April 2 - 3, 2010, along the PFS with two very shallow (a few hundred meters) mainshocks of magnitude 3. 6 and 3. 5. Explosions and ash emissions at the summit craters followed this swarm and culminated some days later (April 7 - 8). Just after the earthquake, specific GPS surveys were carried out aimed at monitoring the eastern part of the Pernicana fault, and the leveling route on the northeastern flank of the volcano was also surveyed. Trying to investigate the deformation occurred along the PFS during the events of April 3 rd 2010, we performed a DInSAR (Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) analysis of ascending and descending Envisat, and of ascending ALOS-PALSAR images encompassing the date of the earthquake. The Envisat interferograms show very intense but local deformation on the Envisat ascending data and a low signal for the descending geometry, close to the Pernicana fault trace. This is probably due to the oblique normal/leftlateral kinematics of the PFS (as deduced also by GPS and leveling data), indeed both vertical (lowering) and horizontal (eastwards) components of motion produce a strong stretching of the LOS (Line Of Sight) distance for ascending geometry, while the two components act in opposite ways for the descending geometry, resulting in lower LOS distance variations compared to the ascending data set. We analyzed also the ALOS pair referring to 21 / 02 / 2010 – 08 / 04 / 2010 time and acquired along the ascending track number 638. The ALOS interferogram clearly show three fringes corresponding to roughly 35 cm of LOS displacement. The preliminary modeling of the interferograms agree with the seismic information (very shallow faulting, seismic moment) and show that the medium behave elastically. In order to investigate the ground deformation pattern associated with this event, an application of the novel SISTEM (Simultaneous and Integrated Strain Tensor Estimation from geodetic and satellite deformation Measurements) approach is presented here. To achieve higher accuracy and get better constraint of the 3 D components of the displacements, we improved the standard formulation of SISTEM approach, based on the GPS and a single DInSAR sensor, in order to take into account all the available dataset (GPS, leveling, ascending and descending ENVISAT C-Band interferograms and the ALOS L-Band data). The 3 D displacement maps obtained using the SISTEM approach well show the kinematics of the PFS, and are able to reconstruct also the ground deformation affecting the whole investigated area, defining the movements of the north-eastern flank of the volcano. These results, which provide an accurate spatial characterization of ground deformation, are hence promising for future studies aimed at improving the knowledge about the kinematics of the active faults of Mt.

An integrated stratigraphic and structural investigation allowed the identification of thrust-related depositional sequences with systems tracts defined by specific stratigraphic signatures recording the complex migration path of the active thrusts in the mountain chain. In the foredeep basin, where thrust-related depositional sequences are better preserved, five basic depositional units have been distinguished: 1. Condensed section, underlying at the scale of the entire basin the major truncation surface at the base of the sequence. The deposition of this unit, indicative of a strongly reduced sediment supply, corresponds to a moment of forward transport of the allochthonous sheets over a long thrust flat (active-thrust-flat systems tract); 2. Syn-ramp wedge, made up of a prograding slope-fan system constituted of a thick body of gravity-driven deposits truncated upsection by the active frontal ramp of the allochthonous sheets (active-frontal-ramp systems tract). 3. Onlap-slope system, represented by retrograding basinal deposits onlapping the edge of the allochthonous sheets and featuring a backstepping passive margin (early stage of the backward-thrust-migration systems tract). 4. Transgressive system, made up of basinal deposits matching the maximum marine flooding of the tectonic wedge (late stage of the backward-thrust-migration systems tract); 5. Prograding shelf-margin system laterally grading into a prograding system of basin-floor turbidites (forward-thrustmigration systems tract). In the foreland areas, these depositional units grade into more or less condensed pelagic deposits, with the exception of unit 5 that may laterally pass towards the foreland into a shallower, flexure-related transgressive system. On top of the allochthonous sheets, both the active-thrustflat systems tract and the active-frontal-ramp systems tract are represented by shallowing-upward shelfal deposits (nappe sheet drape). In an early stage of the backward-thrust-migration systems tract, a retrograding fandelta/shelf system represents in the mountain chain the counterpart of the onlap-slope system. In a late stage, the retrograding fandelta/shelf system is overlain by a muddier transgressive system recording the progressive flooding of the tectonic wedge. The forward-thrust-migration systems tract is commonly represented by a prograding shoalwater delta/shelf system.

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a severe hereditary disorder {{caused by a}} loss of dystrophin, an essential musculoskeletal protein. Decades of promising research have yielded only modest gains in survival {{and quality of life}} for these patients and there have been no approved gene therapies for DMD to date. There are two significant hurdles to creating effective gene therapies for DMD; it is difficult to deliver a replacement dystrophin gene due to its large size and current strategies to restore the native dystrophin gene likely require life-long administration of a gene-modifying drug. This thesis presents a novel method to address these challenges through restoring dystrophin expression by genetically correcting the native dystrophin gene using engineered nucleases that target one or more exons in a mutational hotspot in exons 45 - 55 of the dystrophin gene. Importantly, this hotspot mutational region collectively represents approximately 62 % of all DMD mutations. In this work, we utilize various engineered nuclease platforms to create genetic modifications that can correct a variety of DMD patient mutations. Initially, we demonstrate that genome editing can efficiently correct the dystrophin reading frame and restore protein expression by introducing micro-frameshifts in exon 51, which is adjacent to a hotspot mutational region in the dystrophin gene. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to mediate highly efficient gene editing after introducing a single TALEN pair targeted to exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. This led to restoration of dystrophin protein expression in cells from DMD patients, including skeletal myoblasts and dermal fibroblasts that were reprogrammed to the myogenic lineage by MyoD. We show that our engineered TALENs have minimal cytotoxicity and exome sequencing of cells with targeted modifications of the dystrophin locus showed no TALEN-mediated off-target changes to the protein coding regions of the genome, as predicted by in silico target site analysis. In an alternative approach, we capitalized on the recent advances in genome editing to generate permanent exclusion of exons by using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) to selectively remove sequences important in specific exon recognition. This strategy has the advantage of creating predictable frame restoration and protein expression, although it relies on simultaneous nuclease activity to generate genomic deletions. ZFNs were designed to remove essential splicing sequences in exon 51 of the dystrophin gene and thereby exclude exon 51 from the resulting dystrophin transcript, a method that can potentially restore the dystrophin reading frame in up to 13 % of DMD patients. Nucleases were assembled by extended modular assembly and context-dependent assembly methods and screened for activity in human cells. Selected ZFNs had moderate observable cytotoxicity and one ZFN showed off-target activity at two chromosomal loci. Two <b>active</b> ZFN pairs <b>flanking</b> the exon 51 splice acceptor site were transfected into DMD patient cells and a clonal population was isolated with this region deleted from the genome. Deletion of the genomic sequence containing the splice acceptor resulted in the loss of exon 51 from the dystrophin mRNA transcript and restoration of dystrophin expression in vitro. Furthermore, transplantation of corrected cells into the hind limb of immunodeficient mice resulted in efficient human dystrophin expression localized to the sarcolemma. Finally, we exploited the increased versatility, efficiency, and multiplexing capabilities of the CRISPR/Cas 9 system to enable a variety of otherwise challenging gene correction strategies for DMD. Single or multiplexed sgRNAs were designed to restore the dystrophin reading frame by targeting the mutational hotspot at exons 45 - 55 and introducing either intraexonic small insertions and deletions, or large deletions of one or more exons. Significantly, we generated a large deletion of 336 kb across the entire exon 45 - 55 region that is applicable to correction of approximately 62 % of DMD patient mutations. We show that, for selected sgRNAs, CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing displays minimal cytotoxicity and limited aberrant mutagenesis at off-target chromosomal loci. Following treatment with Cas 9 nuclease and one or more sgRNAs, dystrophin expression was restored in Duchenne patient muscle cells in vitro. Human dystrophin was detected in vivo following transplantation of genetically corrected patient cells into immunodeficient mice. In summary, the objective of this work was to develop methods to genetically correct the native dystrophin as a potential therapy for DMD. These studies integrate the rapid advances in gene editing technologies to create targeted frameshifts that restore the dystrophin gene around patient mutations in non-essential coding regions. Collectively, this thesis presents several gene editing methods that can correct patient mutations by modification of specific exons or by deletion of one or more exons that results in restoration of the dystrophin reading frame. Importantly, the gene correction methods described here are compatible with leading cell-based therapies and in vivo gene delivery strategies for DMD, providing an avenue towards a cure for this devastating disease.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in the recent past that the study of {{sedimentary}} structures (the type and geometry of the units that build up a sedimentary rock) considerably contributes to our knowledge of the conditions that prevailed during the deposition. This monograph brings a comparative study of sedimentary structures of three shallow marine sand deposits in Belgium: those of a modern, active environment (the Flemish Banks off the French-Belgian North-Sea coast) and two ancient examples (the late Lower Eocene Vlierzele Sands and the early Middle- Eocene Brussels Sands). The introductory literature section discusses the interpretation of sedimentary structures in loose, clastic sediments of the shallow-marine clastic tidal environment. It puts together some relevant reviews from recent dynamic and experimental studies, bedform morphology, and the classification and interpretation of sedimentary structures. It appears that, especially in the subtidal environment, there is quite a lot of confusion in terminology and a lack of study concerning the dynamic interpretation of bedforms occurring and the internal structures resulting. For the purpose of this study, the following main definitions are adopted. A megaripple is a two-dimensional bedform generated by a unidirectional current, that flows sufficiently long over a bed of loose sand grains and applies bottom shear stresses, greater than those needed for the migration of (common) small-current ripples, but smaller than those required for the flattening of the bed morphology (that would result in the upper flow regime plane beds). Megaripples have straight to sinuous crestlines oriented perpendicular to the flow direction. In cross-section, they are asymmetric, their steeper (downstream) lee faces sloping between 20 ° and 35 °. Megaripples are higher than 5 cm and their spacing (wavelength) is greater than 60 cm. Sandwaves are also flow-transverse bedforms, essentially of larger dimensions than megaripples. Megaripples always cover the <b>active</b> sandwave <b>flanks</b> and it is the megaripple migration that causes the movement of the sandwaves. Sandwaves are typically associated with the tidal environment. Their height ranges from 1 to 10 m and more, while their spacing (wavelength) attains 80 to 500 m and more; the sandwave flanks have normally slopes of only 1 to 7 °. Their cross-profile may vary from asymmetric to symmetric. From our literature survey and from our own data, we believe that sandwaves occur where {{at the same time there}} is a sufficient supply of sand, and where both the ebb and flood currents are strong enough to create megaripples. In the literature review furthermore some recent publications on the relationship between tidal hydrodynamics and megaripple morphology are discussed. Special attention is also paid to the recent progress in bedding (stratification) characteristics of sediments deposited in highly dynamic tidal nearshore and inshore environments. Chapter 3 opens with a literature discussion concerning actual North Sea tidal sandbank (tidal current ridge) morphology and dynamics. The Oost Dijk and Buiten Ratel sandbanks are two typical sand ridges of Ch There is no overall model yet to explain the sandbank origin or to predict its internal structures. Our approach to contribute in this research was to obtain undisturbed surface sediment samples (using a small Reineck boxcorer) on relevant morphological areas of the Oost Dijk and Buiten Ratel sandbanks and to study the sedimentary structures made clear on lacquer peels. From the 37 samples three main sediment structure facies could be recognized (megaripple cross-bedding X, horizontal bedding H, bioturbated sands B) and further subdivided into eight subfacies. The undisturbed megaripple cross-bedded sand was interpreted as the deposition, caused by the migration of active, tidal megaripples of only a few decimetres height. The horizontally bedded samples are produced either directly by surface wave action, or as the result of storm wave deposition. The bioturbated structures are mainly attributed to the action of sea urchins and Polychaeta worms. The presence of these species indicates a tidal flow that is too weak to produce bed-load sand transport, but strong enough to prevent the settling of mud. The kind and occurrence of sedimentary facies is closely related to the position of the sampling stations with respect to the sandbank morphology. This consistent relationship is, together with re-interpreted published data on hydrodynamics, bed morphology, and grain-size characteristics, incorporated into a preliminary, qualitative modelof fair-weather sediment dynamics on the Flemish Banks. It is thought that though the near-bed sediment transport paths converge to the sandbank crest area, the resulting sand transport is partly counteracted by transport in suspension from theshallowest parts of the sandbank to the surrounding deeper areas. The main points of our model are: (1) sand sedimentation from suspension is the main source of sediment in the inter-bank channels and on the lower mild, landward sandbank slopes. (2) the steeper slopes, facing the regionally dominant flood currents, are erosional. (3) continued action of only the fair-weather tidal sediment processes would ultimately result in a landward shift of the sandbanks. As there is no measurable shift of the sandbank position over the past century, it is supposed that storm-wave effects combined with storm-enhanced tidal currents would compensate for the landward sediment transport. How this mechanism exactly works still remains to be elucidated. Sedimentary structures of the Brussels and Vlierzele Sands were studied in outcrops throughout Central Belgium. Both clastic tidal deposits appear in an area, little affected by tectonics, and occupy nearly the same position in the biostratigraphic scale (transition Lower-Middle Eocene); but as they don't overlap in outcrops, and as both deposits are restricted to a limited area, their relative position still is in discussion. The Brussels Sands are characterized by an irregular base, while their top surface is very smooth. Thicknesses may locally amount to up to 80 m. The erosive character of the Brussels Sands base is thought to be related to a strong SSW-NNE tidal current, that eventually produced longitudinal scour troughs. One remarkable, well-localized, highly glauconiferous, depositional facies of the Brussels Sands, characterized by thick trough-shaped (XI) and, mostly, tabular (X 2) cross-beds, was studied in detail. lts sedimentary structures include: thick cross-beds with thick bottomsets and eroded top; many unidirectional reactivation surfaces; mud-clad burrows; mud drapes, many of which are believed to be incompletely developed. As to grain size, the facies consists of a mixture of fine and medium sands; but also a coarse to very coarse subpopulation is present. The deposit is the result of the migration of asymmetric, mostly straight-crested transverse bars fiIling up quite narrow (1 km?), shifting, tidal channels. The dominant tidal flow was from SSW to NNE. Sand supply was abundant; due to the presence of transported glauconite, it is most probably derived from the open shelf. The other facies determined in the Brussels Sands are all part of a continuous succession X 3 -XB-B/HB. Master bedding is conform with the (often erosive and sloping) lower surface of X 3, and graduaIly becomes horizontal. At the same time, the amount of (tidal mud-draped) cross-bedding diminishes, while grain size decreases, and the degree of bioturbation and the content of carbonates increase. The homogeneous to faintly parallel-laminated, medium-sized and very well sorted facies H is several times intercalated within this succession. Due to its highly erosive base, its good sorting, its lack of any bioturbation traces and its vague parallellamination, the facies H is interpreted as a storm deposit, that periodically interrupts the lateral accretion of the X 3 -XB-B/HB succession. The lateral relations between the different Brussels Sands facies are very complex and some still remain hypothetical. In general, the fine-grained, carbonate-rich facies (B and HE) are the only facies to occupy the top part of the Brussels basin fill. Our paleogeographical reconstruction should therefore be regarded in a preliminary context. The reconstruction assumes (i) at the transition Ypresian-Lutetian there is a global low sea level; (ii) at the time of the beginning deposition of the Brussels Sands, there is no connection between the North-Sea basin and the Paris Basin via a narrow seaway over the Ardennes-Artois tectonic high, so the "Brussels" transgression came from the north; (iii) no local tectonic events, other than a regional, slow subsiding and tilting, influence the sedimentation of the Brussels Sands. There is a schematic representation of the different stages thought to correspond to the different Brussels Sands depositional history: 1. Low sea level during transition Ypresian-Lutetian. Low or moderate tidal range. Some consequent river valleys are developed in a relatively flat landscape. Glauconite is being formed on the North-Sea shelf. 2. Rapid sea-level rise. The sea extends into the Brabant river mouths that are transformed into estuaries and/or tidal inlets. Due to their favourable dimensions with respect to the tidal system supposed to exist in the open North Sea, a situation of tidal resonance (enhancement) is installed in the Brabant tidal inlets. 3. Considerable, tidal erosion and incision in the Brabant area. Separate tidal channels are installed. They have local deeps of up to 80 m. During decreasing sea-leve 1 rise, large amounts of clastic sediment mixed with glauconite are carried from the open North Sea into the estuaries or tidal channels. They are deposited as transverse bars, that migrated to the north in ebb-dominated, rapidly shifting channels. 4. Decreasing sea-level rise. Supply of coastal-reworked clastics goes on, under decreased tidal energy. Supply of glauconite terminated. In cut-off tidal channels, there is deposition of fine sand and a limited input of carbonate mud of local origin. There is now also a higher production of biogenous silica, that will be the source of the siliceous cement of the typical Brussels Sands concretions. The Brabant area develops into a semi-enclosed bay in which occasional catastrophic wave events produce the enigmatic facies H. 5. High sea-level stand. Tidal range reduced to moderate or low. Deposition of fine-grained, carbonate-rich facies B and RB. 6. Slight regression (possibly linked with sea-level fall) before the deposition of the Lede Sands. In the Vlierzele Sands, four main sedimentary facies were recognized. The lower one (B), cbaracterized by a dominance of fine-grained, bioturbated sand, was only found in the type section at Vlierzele. Three other facies alternate in a succession of up to 10 m thickness, whose units are no more than lor a few metres thick and laterally pinch out. Facies X has decimetre-scale megaripple cross-bedding, often with herringbones and mud drapes. Facies P is characterized by low-angle beds of parallel lamination, thin megaripple cross-beds and small-ripple crossbedding. Facies H consists of massive structured sand or faintly visible, parallellamination. The geometry of the facies described is illustrated. In many of the outcrops of the Vlierzele type area, the top of units of facies X shows completely preserved megaripple form sets and even of partly preserved, 1 m high sandwaves. The megaripples apparently were part of rather extensive, slightly sloping megaripple fields, that were partly eroded and partly left untouched by the event that occasioned the covering mass of facies H. Three of these megaripple field levels were progressively measured and mapped as excavation works in the outcrops proceeded. From these maps and our outcrop surveys, it is concluded that the megaripples are generally 25 cm high, have spacings of 5 - 8 m, and are relatively straight-crested. They form megaripple fields covering slopes of 2 ° (locally up to 6 °) dip to the north (the open sea). Their crestlines are not completely perpendicular to the megaripple field contour lines; instead, they form angles of 10 - 15 °. All megaripples belonging to one field are in a similar evolution stage with respect to their morphology, shaped by an almost symmetrical, strong tidal flow; thus they were all preserved at the same time. As to their sedimentological environment, it is put forward that the different facies described could have developed in a clastic shelf tidal current ridge environment. The very active, tidal megaripples represent dynamic sediment movements at the steeper flanks of the sand ridges. The fine sand fractions are winnowed out and carried to the top and the landward mild slopes of the sandbanks, thus forming the facies P and B. The megaripple fields of the steep sandbank slopes were "fossilized" more than once, under a cover of unstructured sand (facies H), that is interpreted as a rapid deposition of suspended sand. The suspension was probably due to the extremely powerful water movements, occasioned by high waves breaking on the sandbanks. The Vlierzele Sands are considered as a fossil equivalent of the Flemish Banks depositional environment, whereas the Brussels Sands are thought to be the product of the evolution from a tidal inlet or estuary environment to a more open shelf bay. These sedimentary conditions don't necessarily exclude a contemporaneous, lateral setting...|$|R
