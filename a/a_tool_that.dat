5|$|Olaf {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} wave {{that left the}} coast of Africa on September 17. Over {{the next two weeks}} it moved westbound into the East Pacific Ocean. Initially, the wave was not in an environment conductive for further development. However, on October 2, a low-level circulation was noted on satellite imagery. This circulation quickly became better defined over the next several hours while located 400 miles (645km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. The next day, Dvorak Classifications, <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> estimates a tropical cyclone intensity, were placed at 1.5. This is equivalent to winds of around 30mph (50km/h). In addition, a ship nearby reported winds of 35mph (45km/h). Microwave imagery also indicated that the center was near the associated convection. Based on this, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|The initial Windows {{release was}} criticized by players for several {{perceived}} shortcomings. The game was shipped with SecuROM copy protection that required activation from 2K Games' servers over the Internet; the unavailability of these servers was reported {{as the reason}} for the cancellation of the game's midnight release in Australia. Players found that the SecuROM limited the number of times the game could be activated to two; user feedback led to 2K Games to increase the activation count to five, and later offer <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> allowed users to revoke previous activations on their own. Ultimately 2K Games removed the activation limit, though retail versions of the game still required the activation process. Levine admitted that their initial approach to the activation process was malformed, harming their reputation during the launch period.|$|E

With the help of James' brother John Ritty, they patented it in 1883. It was called Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier and it was invented for the purpose to stop cashiers of pilfering and eliminating employee theft or embezzlement.|$|E
