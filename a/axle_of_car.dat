50|$|The new Rover 12 used a two-cylinder, water-cooled, side-valve {{engine of}} 1624 cc. The chassis and rear <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> this <b>car</b> {{would go on}} to be used in {{modified}} form in the 1912 cars.|$|R
50|$|As {{the train}} {{passed over the}} first of two points, the {{embedded}} tyre slammed against the guide rail of the points, pulling it from the railway ties. This guide rail also penetrated the floor <b>of</b> the <b>car,</b> becoming embedded in the vehicle and lifting the axle carriage off the rails. At 10:59 local time (08:59 UTC), one of the now-derailed wheels struck the points lever of the second switch, changing its setting. The rear <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> number 3 were switched onto a parallel track, and the entire car was thereby thrown into the piers supporting a 300 t roadway overpass, destroying them.|$|R

5000|$|Train {{cars were}} {{numbered}} 1 to 5 with 1 and 5 being [...] "cab" [...] cars. To keep operations consistent, when the sixth car was added, the additional car was designated car [...] "3A" [...] (rather than 4 making {{the back end}} Car/Cab 6); that way pilot operations from the rear cab retained the [...] "Cab 5" [...] designation for all trains regardless of size (this practice continued until the Mark VI trains had fully replaced the Mark IVs at which time reverse motion was conducted as [...] "Cab 6 Operation"). Car 3A did not include engines. Motors were eight units on each train: <b>Axle</b> #2 (back <b>of</b> Car/Cab1), front and rear <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cars</b> 2, 3 and 4, along with <b>axle</b> #11 (back <b>of</b> Car/Cab 5).|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} Japanese trains, the Tōkaidō Shinkansen and {{all subsequent}} Shinkansen lines were standard gauge ( [...] between the rails). The trains were powered by 25 kV AC electricity at 60 Hz with all <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> all <b>cars</b> powered by 185 kW traction motors, giving a 220 km/h top speed.|$|R

50|$|In another subtype, a {{secondary}} vehicle is used. Such a vehicle {{can be a}} carousel, a car, railed cart, wheeled land vehicle, or even a ship on the water. The electrical generator is installed on the vehicle. The rotor of the electrical generator is brought in motion by the carousel, the <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>car,</b> or the screw of the ship, correspondingly.|$|R
50|$|Watt's linkage {{is used in}} {{the rear}} <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> some <b>car</b> {{suspensions}} as an improvement over the Panhard rod, which was designed in the early twentieth century. Both methods intend to prevent relative sideways motion between the <b>axle</b> and body <b>of</b> the <b>car.</b> Watt’s linkage approximates a vertical straight line motion more closely, and does so while locating the centre <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> rather than toward one side of the vehicle, as more commonly used when fitting a long Panhard rod.|$|R

50|$|Bogie {{exchange}} {{is a system}} for operating railway wagons on two or more gauges to overcome difference in the track gauge. To perform a bogie exchange, a car is converted from one gauge to another by removing the bogies or trucks (the chassis containing the wheels and <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>car),</b> and installing a new bogie with differently spaced wheels. It is generally limited to wagons and carriages, though diesel locomotives can be exchanged if enough time is available.|$|R
50|$|Inboard brakes are {{fitted to}} a driven <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>car,</b> as they require a drive shaft {{to link the}} wheel to the brake. Most have thus been used for rear-wheel drive cars, {{although}} four-wheel drive and some front-wheel drives have also used them. A rare few rear wheel drive racing cars (e.g., the Lotus 72) have also used inboard front discs, accepting {{the need to provide}} a drive shaft to gain the unsprung weight and braking torque advantages.|$|R
5000|$|Arthur Krebs {{proposed}} {{placing the}} front <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> a <b>car</b> at a positive caster angle in his UK patent of 1896, entitled Improvements in mechanically propelled vehicles, stating {{it was intended}} [...] "To ensure stability of direction {{by means of a}} special arrangement of fore-carriage, that is to say, to re-establish automatically the parallelism <b>of</b> the two <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle when there is no tendency to keep them in any other direction, or after a temporary effort has caused them to diverge from said parallelism. ... The <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> the fore-carriage is situated a suitable distance behind the projection of the axis of the pivot-pin in order to ensure the stability of direction above referred to." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{explanation}} of the seat compression in the accelerating frame requires not only the thrust from the <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>car,</b> but additional (fictitious) forces. In an inertial frame, only the thrust from the axle is necessary. Therefore, the inertial frame has a simpler physical explanation (not necessarily a simpler mathematical formulation, however), indicating the accelerating frame is a non-inertial frame of reference. In other words, in the inertial frame, fictitious forces are zero. See inertial frame for more detail.|$|R
50|$|Weitzer Rt. in 1903 {{transferred}} the electric transmission {{to a larger}} scale, and ordered four-cylinder petrol engines of 50 and of 70 horsepower from De Dion-Bouton.

50|$|Allowance is {{basically}} the size difference between components that work together. Allowance between parts that are assembled is very important. For example, the <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> a <b>car</b> has to be supported in a bearing otherwise it will fall to the ground. If there was no gap between the axle and the bearing {{then there would be}} a lot of friction and it would be difficult to get the car to move. If there was too much of a gap then the axle would be jumping around in the bearing. It is important to get the Allowance between the axle and the bearing correct so that the axle rotates smoothly and easily without judder.|$|R

5000|$|Starley, then aging, {{found it}} {{difficult}} to ride a tricycle sociable with his son, James, in the other saddle. They could not steer because one was stronger than the other. The historian Edward Lyte wrote: [...] "Each rider of the sociable drove his own big wheel independently, so the course of the machine along the road was rather variable. One day Starley cried 'I have it!' and dismounted. He sat down to a cup of tea and forthwith invented the differential gear that is now incorporated in the back <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> every <b>car.</b> It was a Saturday.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the fatigue fracture problem <b>of</b> the rear <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> a China-made <b>car</b> at the reliability test stage on the durable enhancement roads of proving ground, and the strain loading spectrum <b>of</b> the rear <b>axle</b> fracture location and the weak points of the finite element analysis was measured. The fatigue damage of the broken crack at the rear axle on the durable enhancement roads was calculated and contrasted detailedly. At the same time, a six-channel MTS coupling system is used to conduct the vibration mode frequency sweep to the rear <b>axle</b> and <b>car</b> body <b>of</b> test <b>car</b> and the benchmarking car, and through vibration frequency sweep, {{an analysis of the}} reason of differences between the two cars and its relationship with the car body vibration frequency is made. The enhancement test and frequency sweep results show that the fatigue damage of two vehicles focuses mainly on the washboard road, the impact of the speed on the fatigue damage <b>of</b> the test <b>car</b> fluctuates significantly, the damages <b>of</b> the two <b>cars</b> vary greatly when the forced vibration excitation frequency of the washboard road is greater than 20 Hz and the vibration modal frequency <b>of</b> the rear <b>axle</b> is close to the excitation frequency of the washboard road, causing high stress distribution and then fatigue fracture to the rear <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> the test <b>car.</b> The test results have provided an important basis for the structural improvement of the broken rear axle and the enhancement in the fatigue strength <b>of</b> the rear <b>axle...</b>|$|R

25|$|Traction of the ICE1 {{trainsets}} {{is achieved}} by the eight driven <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> both power <b>cars.</b> Because relatively few axles have traction, the steepness of the grade the trains can safely negotiate are limited. The ICE1 is limited to grades of about 3.5%. Steeper grades cannot be negotiated safely, because the wheels could slip due to the low adhesion under adverse conditions, which {{may lead to a}} stopped train becoming stuck on a grade.

500|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene where}} Alex swims underneath {{the ship was}} filmed in the Tongue of the Ocean {{off the coast of}} New Providence in the Bahamas. The location was chosen due to its water clarity, however, after viewing dailies of the scene, De Bont felt the water was too clear, so it was reshot with divers above the camera dusting the area in front of the lens with sediment to alter the clarity of the footage. [...] The scene was filmed underneath a propeller-less barge that was designed to resemble the Seabourn Legend. To provide a sense of velocity in the scene, the barge was towed by tugboats at one and a half knots. The production crew did not have a winch system available for the underwater shoot as depicted in the scene, so a pulley system was created by feeding Patric a rope that was attached to the <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> a <b>car</b> that drove along the barge.|$|R
