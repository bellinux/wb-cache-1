5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not possible to know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is not possible to plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore follows {{a boy and}} his pet dog as they are {{inadvertently}} transported to a fantasy world created by an eccentric inventor. The player guides both {{the boy and his}} shapeshifting dog through Evermore, <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> composed of separate realms, each resembling a different period of real-world history. The gameplay shares many similarities with Secret of Mana, such as real-time battles, a ring-shaped menu system, and the ability to switch control between the two characters. Despite similar game mechanics and a similar title, it is not an entry in the Mana series.|$|E
5|$|A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature (or {{physical}} feature), a body {{of liquid}} {{on the surface of}} <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, {{a body of}} water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.|$|E

25|$|The play Darwins Kapten was {{published}} by Henning Mankell in 2009, and had its world premiere in 2010 at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. It is about Charles Darwin and his journey with the Beagle: many years after the five-year long voyage, Darwin receives a message that his captain on the ship, FitzRoy, has committed suicide. The play portrays the reception of Darwin’s discoveries, {{as well as the}} consequences of taking a stand against existing ideas in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> built on belief in God as the only creator of life.|$|E
25|$|Greed is a {{theme of}} the novel {{because it is a}} basic {{motivation}} for several of the characters.

The French are not happy that the English are continuously attempting to conquer their lands. For this reason, {{there is a great deal}} of fighting between the two sides. Of particular interest in this novel is the greed of Sir Oliver in taking Castelgard and La Roque, and Arnaut’s greed in wanting to take it back. This causes Marek and his team to be stuck in the middle of two battling hotheads.|$|E

500|$|The {{setting of}} the book has been {{described}} as dystopian. However, it is presented by Heinlein as utopian; its leaders are shown as good and wise, and the population as free and prosperous. Slusser wrote in 1987 that Starship Troopers depicts <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> [...] "hell for human beings", but nonetheless celebrates the ideology of its fictional society. The rulers are claimed to be the best in history, because they understand that human nature is to fight for power through the use of force. The suggestion of utopia is not explored in depth, as the lives of those outside the military are not shown in any detail. The novel suggests that the militarist philosophy espoused by many of the characters has a mathematical backing, though reviewers have commented that Heinlein does not present any basis for this.|$|E
500|$|Film noir {{is often}} {{described}} as essentially pessimistic. The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations (which, in general, they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating), striving against random, uncaring fate, and frequently doomed. The films are seen as depicting <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> inherently corrupt. Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era—in particular, with a sense of heightened anxiety and alienation that is said to have followed World War II. In author Nicholas Christopher's opinion, [...] "it is as if the war, and the social eruptions in its aftermath, unleashed demons that had been bottled up in the national psyche." [...] Film noirs, especially those of the 1950s and the height of the Red Scare, are often said to reflect cultural paranoia; Kiss Me Deadly is the noir most frequently marshaled as evidence for this claim.|$|E

500|$|In , Matthew Alford {{argued that}} with the fourth installment, [...] "the {{franchise}} had made a clear shift towards supporting establishment narratives, despite its earlier reservations" [...] and that a [...] "central theme" [...] is whether John Connor [...] "should prioritise striking a decisive military blow against the machines or rescue some captured humans, who are entombed—with shades of Auschwitz—by the Terminators". [...] "he flashforwards from the first three Terminator films hinted at a horrible future scape of pain, deprivation and ad-hoc guerrilla warfare", he writes, but [...] "in contrast, producer Jeffrey Silver explained that the Department of Defense gave 'fantastic cooperation [...] because they recognized {{that in the future}} portrayed in this film, the military will still be {{the men and women who}} protect us, no matter what may come'". Alford concludes that [...] "for <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> set just fifteen years after a global nuclear holocaust the survivors are fancifully healthy, not to mention hairy" [...] and that this [...] "normalises the unthinkable".|$|E

Nintendo published the title in all regions except for North America, {{where it was}} published by Xseed Games.

The Last Story takes place upon the island fortress of Lazulis, in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> slowly being drained of life by an unknown force. The story focuses {{on a group of}} mercenaries looking for work on Lazulis; one of their number, Zael, dreams of becoming a knight.

500|$|The Nightfly was {{met with}} almost universally {{positive}} reviews. Billboard labeled it their top album pick {{in the first month}} of its release, calling it a [...] "stunning debut" [...] and praising its [...] "typically blue chip crew of crack players and crisp digital production." [...] David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone that [...] "Donald Fagen conjures a world where all things are possible, even to a kid locked in his bedroom." [...] Robert Christgau, writing for The Village Voice, gave the album an A and commented, [...] "these songs are among Fagen's finest [...] his acutely shaded lyrics puts the jazziest music he's ever committed to vinyl into a context that like everything here is loving but very clear-eyed." [...] Robert Palmer of The New York Times called The Nightfly a [...] "vivid and frequently ingenious look back at <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> gone forever.

2500|$|In conclusion, {{in direct}} {{contrast}} to the common critiques and ignorance of the co-authorship of Caballero, the novel itself is [...] "a collaborative text about collaboration, a text that self-consciously enacts the politics of its production within its pages.

500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, Late Registration {{serves as}} an {{exhibition}} of [...] "the stealthy power of West's storytelling." [...] West stated that his goal for the album was to touch on topics that {{people from all walks}} of life could find relatable, while remaining true to himself: [...] " [...] raps that were just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith." [...] The opening track [...] "Heard 'Em Say" [...] is a [...] "mournfully contemplative" [...] song that [...] "talks about being honest with yourself in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not." [...] The song is written from the perspective of an afflicted, impoverished American quietly lamenting the fallacies of society and questioning the ways of the world around him. West delivers a tongue-in-cheek lyrical narrative within [...] "Gold Digger" [...] in which he critically depicts the disastrous life of a man married to a woman who manipulates him for financial gain. However, another story arises within the third verse, which illustrates a once destitute black male who earns a fortune and decides to leave a loyal, unselfish girlfriend for a white woman.|$|E
500|$|Cleave {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in West Africa, which he credits for having partially inspired The Other Hand. Further inspiration came from Cleaves's temporary employment while studying experimental {{psychology at the}} University of Oxford. During the summer, Cleave painted underpasses, gardened and picked up litter, and hoped to use this experience to write a book. His final job was at Campsfield House in Oxfordshire, an immigration detention centre. Cleave spent three days serving food to residents from war zones including Somalia, Eritrea and the Balkans. He explained: [...] "I got talking {{with some of them}} and said why are you here? Why are you in prison? It's not illegal and yet we concentrate them in these places. It's a text-book definition of a concentration camp. The conditions are appalling. I was shocked enough for that {{to be the end of}} my light comedy book of my amusing summers working as a labourer." [...] Cleave believes he would not have written the novel were he not a parent, as he does not wish for his children [...] "to grow up into <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> callous and stupid." ...|$|E
500|$|Noting the realism in {{the writing}} for the series, Gilchrist stated: [...] "It's as if Rhimes and Co. {{harnessed}} the sublime and the mundane of our daily experiences, that strange sense of drama that emerges from even the most unimportant daily conflicts, and it transported it on <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> legitimately fraught with life and death decisions." [...] However, he expressed disappointment {{in the end of}} the second season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship with a patient as a way to [...] "slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death. Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens' development in the last part of the second season: [...] "Izzie's descent into abject hysteria, which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything, actually made me want something terrible to happen to her too." [...] He described how some episodes were not among the show's strongest, noting that the some plot lines created poignancy, and connected in an unfamiliar way.|$|E

This is because the harpsichord was actually a very different instrument than the piano, as is explained in this paper. This paper traces {{the history of the}} piano's rise to dominance over the harpsichord, and how its unique hammer action began creating an idiomatic piano style. The piano also revolutionized keyboard repertoire, taking some genrs from the harpsichord and also creating completely new genres of compositions. Despite its slow start in the early eighteenth century, the piano completely revolutionized the musical world into which it was born. The rise of the fortepiano throughout the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries transformed traditional keyboard technique, style and compositions...|$|R
