So, the productivity-labor cost gap is significantly and negatively affected by the share of old workers in the firm. Unless an agreement can be found through early retirement schemes, employers are reluctant to fire these workers because of the threat of a labor dispute with the (relatively powerful) Belgian unions. 5 In this context, the introduction of RESSC lowers the productivity-labor cost gap. Whether the limited reduction introduced by the ISP does more than compensate this gap is an empirical question. If it does, this reduction provides an incentive to keep old workers longer in the firm (potentially inducing a substitution effect detrimental to the employment level of younger workers).|$|E

40|$|A recent {{development}} in educational accountability is a risk-based approach, in which intensity {{and frequency of}} school inspections vary across schools to make educational accountability more efficient and effective by enabling inspectorates to focus on organizations at risk.

Adverse effects were defined as below average final achievement and/or below <b>average</b> <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> School composition, previous underperformance, insufficient judgments on having a systematic evaluation approach, evaluation of support, and monitoring student performance appeared as factors related to subsequent underperformance of schools. Although a rich set of possible risk factors was available, further investigation {{of a large number}} of schools is required in order to find nearly all underperforming schools. However, a group of about 40 % of the schools showed very small risk on underperformance, which represents the efficiency gain when risk-based school accountability would be applied.

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is threefold. First, we put the {{relationship}} between the educational composition of the workforce and firm productivity to an updated test, using Belgian linked employer-employee panel data for the years 1999 – 2010. These data offer several advantages. The panel covers {{a large part of the}} private sector, provides accurate information on average productivity (i.e. the <b>average</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> per hour worked) and allows us to control for a wide range of worker and firm characteristics. It also enables us to address important methodological issues, such as firm-level time-invariant heterogeneity, measurement errors, reverse causality, feedback effects and state dependence of firm productivity. Indeed, early studies using the Hellerstein and Neumark approach ‘have been criticized mainly due to the potential endogeneity’ in the explanatory variables that have been studied (Bartolucci 2013), which can be a result of these issues. To do so, we rely on the generalised method of moments (GMM) estimator. 4 A second objective is to examine whether education increases productivity and wage costs equally (i.e. to extend the analysis to productivity-wage gaps). Finally, our study provides first evidence on whether the alignment between productivity and wage costs across educational levels depends on the characteristics of workers, i.e. their age and gender.|$|E

Moreover, teachers leaving the most disadvantaged schools in terms of student populations are consistently less effective than those who stay...|$|R

It is a new, very simple and practical technique. It is potentially useful for enhancing the spatial details and preserving the spectral fidelity of the low spatial resolution images. 1...|$|R
40|$|Does GDP {{composition}} affect GDP {{growth and}} volatility? Typically, economies at advanced {{stages of development}} grow slower, are less volatile and have {{a larger share of}} services in GDP with respect to economies at middle stages. I propose a theory of development consistent with these three facts. I show that even when total factor productivity (TFP) growth and volatility are the same in manufacturing and services at the gross output level, the larger intensity of intermediate goods in gross output production in manufacturing implies a larger growth and volatility of TFP at the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> level in manufacturing than in services. As GDP is a weighted <b>average</b> of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of the sectors in the economy, a larger share of services in the economy implies both a smaller GDP growth and a smaller GDP volatility. Numerical results suggest that along a transition path in which the share of services increases from 0. 41 to 0. 73, the same gross output TFP process in manufacturing and services implies a per-capita GDP growth and volatility 21 % and 18 % larger {{in the first part of}} the transition with respect to the second. These numbers represent 95 % of the difference in per-capita GDP growth and 95 % of the difference in per-capita GDP volatility between middle and high income economies during the 1970 - 2006 period. Also, the model can account for 58 % of the per-capita GDP growth and 32 % of the per-capita GDP volatility differences measured in the U.

In 2003, for the first time, these tables additionally include {{a measure of the}} educational ‘value added ’ by a school to its pupils. This paper provides the first large scale analysis of the likely impact of the new value added performance indicator on the rankings of schools in the resulting league tables. Our analysis employs a national dataset of matched exam results, recently released by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), which includes the results of the cohort of pupils who sat Key Stage 3 (KS 3) exams at age 14 in 1997, and GCSE (or equivalent) exams at age 16 in 1999; this yields data on over half a million pupils. Using this dataset we have replicated five performance indicators which have been or will be published in the UK. In particular, we focus on the key pre- 2002 PI, the percentage of pupils gaining at least five GCSEs or equivalent at grade C or above (% 5 A*-C), and the new value added indicator (VAcap). At a national level, we investigate the relationships between both the indicators themselves and the rankings which result. We then focus on one LEA, Bristol, and show to what extent school positions in the league tables are sensitive to the PI employed. We find a low degree of correlation between % 5 A*-C and VAcap and the resulting rankings, both at national and local level. This is reflected in the degree to which Bristol schools ’ ranking positions change when different PIs are employed. We conclude that value added does provide a more accurate measure of school performance and hence should help parental choice. We provide evidence, however, which suggests that a single PI, representing a school <b>average</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> score, may not be sufficiently informative...|$|E

Chapter 1 analyzes South Africa's Free Basic Water Policy, under which households receive a free water allowance equal to the World Health Organization's recommended minimum of 6 kiloliters per month. I structurally estimate residential water demand, evaluate the welfare effects of free water, and provide optimal price schedules derived from a social planner's problem. I use a unique dataset of monthly metered billing data for 60, 000 households for 2002 - 2008 from a particularly disadvantaged suburb of Pretoria. The dataset contains rich price variation across 18 different nonlinear tariff schedules, and includes a policy experiment which removed the free allowance. I find that without government subsidy, the mean monthly consumption would decrease from 12. 6 to 5. 6 kiloliters, which is below the clean water consumption recommended by the WHO. However, {{it is possible to}} reallocate the current subsidy to form an optimal tariff without a free allowance, which would increase welfare while leaving the water provider's revenue unchanged. This optimal tariff would also reduce the number of households consuming below the WHO-recommended level.

40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{several issues}} related to efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness in Alberta's agriculture and food sector, in both its primary agricultural sector and its secondary processing industry related to food and beverages. A major underlying theme of this work is that the competitiveness and economic sustainability of Alberta's agriculture and food sector is considerably driven by long run trends in productivity. Two emerging trends in Alberta's agriculture and food sector are initially documented: the increasing role of specialty crop production and the rising importance of value added production. Productivity trends and competitiveness issues are examined for Alberta's primary agricultural production sector. Index numbers for agricultural output, aggregate input, and (total factor) productivity were constructed, using Tornqvist-Theil indexing procedures, for both Alberta and the Prairies for the period 1948 to 1994. Alberta's annual output growth rate of 2. 43 percent and its productivity growth rate in agriculture of 1. 9 percent over this time period closely mirror output and productivity performance for the entire Prairies. Since 1978, however, both output growth and productivity performance in Alberta has been somewhat slower than in the prairie region as a whole. The foregoing aggregate productivity trends in primary agriculture mask considerably different trends for the crops sector in Alberta versus the livestock sector. Both crop output growth and crop productivity growth have been consistently stronger than output and productivity growth in the livestock sector. Productivity, for example, has grown annually at 2. 75 percent in the crop sector but only at 0. 81 percent {{per year in the}} livestock industry in Alberta. Alberta's lagging agricultural productivity performance since 1980, albeit with some modest recovery in the 1990 s, is largely attributable to negative productivity growth in the livestock sector. Historical productivity performance in the crops and livestock sectors in Alberta roughly parallels experience in nearby American states. A simple econometric model was constructed to explore the relationship between total factor productivity (TFP) in primary agriculture and proxies for expenditures on research and development (R&D). Lagged R&D expenditures are found to be a statistically significant influence on productivity, lending empirical credence to the widely held belief that expenditures on R&D are vital to productivity growth in agriculture. The Alberta food and beverage industry {{is one of the largest}} manufacturing industries in the province, and it has been greatly influenced by the implementation of recent trade agreements, as well as rapidly changing global business environments, changing consumer preferences, and rising living standards. Therefore, the performance of the industry is critical to Alberta's economy. In the thirty-two year period of 1961 - 1993, the Alberta food and beverage industry has experienced fundamental structural changes toward greater scale economies featured by higher levels of concentration and larger facilities. The number of plants has been reduced by 40 %. On the other hand, the industry's total value added rose 2. 6 times. As a result, the <b>average</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> per establishment has been growing at an annual compound rate of 4. 67 %, so that the 1993 level is 4 times the level in 1961. Despite this gain, the average scale of production is larger at the national level, and the difference between the two tends to be wider in the last ten years of the study. The competitiveness assessment of the food and beverage industry shows the overall Canadian sector performed better in terms of profitability and market share. Total factor productivity, measured by the index number approach, has been used to assess the performance of the food and beverage industry in both Alberta and Canada in this report. Although both output and inputs grow faster in Alberta than in Canada, Alberta's TFP growth in the processing sector has been sluggish, if not negative. In the period of 1961 - 1974, TFP climbed marginally at annual rates of 0. 33 % for Alberta and 0. 35 % for Canada. But in the period of 1974 - 1993, with annual decreasing rates of 1. 52 % and 1. 15 % respectively, the food and beverage industries in both Alberta and Canada suffered from a loss of productivity, with the Canadian sector in a relatively better position. Factors which affect the growth of TFP include: lagging research and development, excessive cost of inputs, and sluggish market demand. In comparison to the food processing industry overall, Alberta's slaughtering and meat processing industry shows much more promising performance. Overall it is in the strongest position among all Alberta food and beverage industries, and it is also more competitive than its Canadian counterpart. The red meat industry in Alberta, especially the beef packing subsector, has benefited from structural change in the industry, the exploitation of economies of scale, and increases in labour productivity. Finally, it is important to note the beneficial impacts that productivity improvement in primary agriculture has on the processing sector, and vice versa. Gains in productivity in primary production may be transferred to the processing sector in the form of cheaper inputs. Conversely, efficiency gains in the processing sector result in an increased derived demand for the products of primary agriculture. Policies which encourage productivity growth in either sector can increase the competitiveness of both sectors. Further, policies which stimulate increased expenditure on research and development lie at the heart of productivity enhancement in both primary agriculture and the food processing sector.

It is concentrated in a small number of industries that make an intensive use of computers. The contribution of the production of ICT is also substantial: 0. 4 of point over the same period. All in all, we evaluate the contribution of ICT in France at 0. 7 of point of annual growth during the period 1987 – 98. We also use the dual approach of growth accounting to evaluate the contribution of ICT to price evolutions. Our results show that the use of IT and the production of ICT have significantly reduced the value-added price inflation by 0. 3 and 0. 4 of a point respectively for an average annual price growth of 1. 4 percent between 1987 and 1998. 1...|$|R
30|$|DCE {{has been}} classically assumed {{to improve the}} {{sensitivity}} of T 2 WI alone or T 2 WI combined with DWI, based on studies showing an <b>average</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> of about 10 – 15 % [28]. While acknowledging this, opposers argue that this technique is redundant in most examinations, since it improves T 2 WI alone, while showing no relevant <b>added</b> <b>value</b> compared to the combination of T 2 WI and DWI [13]. This statement {{is supported by the}} results of several single-centre studies [34 – 36] and of a recent meta-analysis [37], {{as well as by the}} empirical experience from large-volume centres. Furthermore, a csPCa can present with different contrast enhancement patterns, overlapping at a significant extent with those of other benign conditions such as prostatitis or benign hypertrophy nodules in the TZ [13]. As aforementioned, PI-RADS version 2 acknowledged those limitations by circumscribing the role for DCE to PZ only and limiting it to a qualitative evaluation on a binary base for problem-solving purpose [10].|$|R

40|$|Input-output {{economics}} {{has become}} a popular tool to analyse the international fragmentation of value chains, especially now that several multi-regional tables that cover {{large parts of the}} global economy have become available. It has been argued that these tables, when analysed {{with the help of the}} input-output economics toolbox, can provide better insights about global value chains than can be obtained by case studies of individual value chains. We argue that there are several problems related to the aggregated nature of the input-output table that may lead to large distortions and biases in the aggregate picture about global value chains that is obtained by input-output analysis. There are three main sources behind the distortion obtained in static decompositions of <b>value</b> chains: the <b>average</b> nature of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> to output ratios in the tables, the emergence of production cycles in the process of aggregating several value chains into a single table, and the characteristic of the so-called inverse Leontief matrix to even out the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> distribution. We provide an overview of how these distortions work, and argue that under a wide range of circumstances, input-output methods tend to overstate the contribution of the final sector to the value chain. We also show that this bias does not vanish when we compare input-output decompositions at two different points in time...|$|R
40|$|Taking the German capital Berlin as an example, {{the role}} of the health care sector in terms of employment, {{revenues}} and growth is empirically assessed. The article is based on the authorsrsquo study ldquoGesundheitsmarkt Berlin—Perspektiven für Wachstum und Beschäftigungrdquo (Henke et al. 2002) (The Berlin Health Care Market—Growth and Employment Prospects). For this purpose, the authors collected data for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000 on turnovers and employment in the various sectors of the local health care market. Results indicate that 177, 781 persons, or almost one out of eight persons, are employed in health-related areas in Berlin, which is more than in the German <b>average.</b> The gross <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of Berlinrsquos health care market has been estimated at € 6. 8 billion, corresponding to 10 % of the gross <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of Berlinrsquos overall economy in 1999. Health expenditures are estimated at 11. 9 %, which is higher than the German average at 10. 8 %. Taking these figures as a basis, suggestions to strengthen and further develop this potential are derived. This article demonstrates that health care can be an important economic factor in the regional context and thus should not only be regarded as a cost factor but should be developed.

40|$|Depositary {{receipts}} gained much {{popularity in}} the 1990 s. After a slowdown in 2001 / 2002, years 2003 and 2004 brought a renewed progress of the DR markets. Also Central European companies are gradually becoming aware {{of the advantages of}} DR offering. In line with the market segmentation hypothesis, we found, that the prices of depositary receipts by Central European companies and their respective actual shares are very closely correlated and the opportunity of arbitrage is therefore very limited. To quantify the effects of a DR issue on the respective actual shares in the local market, we considered 19 shares of companies from the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, which issued depositary receipts. The results show that creation of a DR program may {{have a positive impact on}} the respective actual shares’ <b>value.</b> The simple <b>average</b> of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> to the share price one year after establishment of the DR program reached very high, positive value; the price increase (from the level of the day 20 prior to the issue) equaled 33. 33 %. On the other hand, with 7 out of 19 shares no positive effect of DR offering on price could be observed. On the same sample, the hypothesis, that a DR listing enhances liquidity of the respective actual shares in the local market, was confirmed. The daily trading volumes improved on average by 21 % in the year subsequent to the listing.

40|$|Presented diploma thesis compares {{financial}} {{performance of a}} selected company with the {{financial performance}} reached in a given industrial sector. INFA criteria are used {{for the evaluation of}} the company and of its performance. INFA is a system of pyramidal decomposition of economic <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> The sector database of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic was used for the referential analysis. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part defines financial analysis, economic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and INFA criterion system from a theoretical point of view. The second part applies INFA on the specific company. The values of company indicators determined by this method are then compared with <b>average</b> <b>values</b> in the sector. Discrepancies are discussed and elucidated. The final chapter evaluates advantages and disadvantages of the used benchmarking model...|$|R
40|$|The European {{emission}} trading scheme (EU ETS) {{has introduced}} a price for carbon, thus generating an additional cost for companies that are regulated by the scheme. The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide empirical evidence on the effect of the EU ETS on firm-level economic performance. There is a growing body of empirical literature that investigates the effects of the EU ETS on firm economic performance, with mixed results. Differently from the previous literature, we test the effect of the EU ETS on a larger set of indicators of economic performance: employment, <b>average</b> wages, turnover, <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> markup, investment, labour productivity, total factor productivity and ROI. Our results, based on a large panel of European firms, provide a broad picture of the economic impact of the EU ETS in its first and second phases of implementation. Contrarily to the expectations, the EU ETS did not affect economic performance negatively. Results suggest that firms have reacted to the EU ETS by passing-through costs to their customers on the one hand and improving labour productivity on the other hand...|$|R
