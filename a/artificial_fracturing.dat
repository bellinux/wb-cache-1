2500|$|Tight gas is gas in low-permeability rock. Reservoirs require <b>artificial</b> <b>fracturing</b> {{to enable}} the gas to flow. Canadian Hunter Exploration in the 1970s {{identified}} a huge gas resource in the Deep Basin of western Alberta. In this area, much of the sedimentary section is charged with natural gas. [...] The rock can have extremely low permeability but production is not hampered {{by the presence of}} water. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are techniques used to develop such resources. Similar gas-charged areas have been found {{in many parts of the}} world; a common term for this kind of reservoir is [...] "basin-centred gas". The Montney Play has seen significant development in the early 2000s (decade) in the southern Peace River Country.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2008, the USGS {{released}} a report giving a new resource assessment of the Bakken Formation underlying portions of Montana and North Dakota. The USGS believes that with new horizontal drilling technology there is somewhere between [...] of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil in this 200000 sq mi formation that was initially discovered in 1951. If accurate, this reassessment would make it the largest [...] "continuous" [...] oil accumulation (The USGS uses [...] "continuous" [...] to describe accumulations requiring extensive <b>artificial</b> <b>fracturing</b> to allow the oil to flow to the borehole) ever discovered in the U.S. The formation is estimated to contain significantly more - figures in excess of [...] have been reported - but it is yet uncertain {{how much of this}} oil is recoverable using current technology. In 2011, Harold Hamm claimed that the recoverable share may reach this would mean that Bakken contains more extractable petroleum than all other known oil fields in the country, combined.|$|E
50|$|Widely {{distributed}} in sedimentary basins of southern California is the Monterey shale, thought {{by some to}} contain more than 400 billion barrels of oil in place. The formation has for many years yielded oil in areas where it is naturally fractured, and oil companies are investigating {{ways to make the}} shale in currently non-productive areas give up the oil through <b>artificial</b> <b>fracturing.</b> Over some large areas, California's geologic layers are complexly folded, making horizontal drilling difficult. As of 2013, the Monterey shale has resisted attempts to obtain economic production of oil through hydraulic fracturing, fracking, which involves injecting water, sand, and chemicals into the shale under high pressure, to crack the rock and allow the oil and gas to flow. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates there are over 15 billion barrels of oil that can be recovered using today's technology and potentially much more if techniques can be found to safely release it. Despite intense industry efforts, there has been little success to date (2013) in producing Monterey-hosted tight oil/shale oil, and it may be many years, if ever, before the Monterey becomes a significant producer of shale oil.|$|E

The numerical simulation is compiled and software calculates the capacity model by using numerical simulation. This simulation technique verifies {{the validity of the}} model and numerical method. On this basis, we study the influence of the included angle of <b>artificial</b> <b>fracture</b> and well array direction, <b>artificial</b> <b>fracture</b> length, start-up pressure gradient and production pressure difference to the capacity of the oil well...|$|R
30|$|Natural {{carbonate}} core samples with <b>artificial</b> <b>fractures</b> {{are often}} {{used to evaluate the}} damage of fractured carbonate formations in the laboratory. It is shown that the most frequent error for evaluation results directly from the random width characterized by the <b>artificial</b> <b>fractures.</b> To solve this problem, a series of simulated fractured core samples made of stainless steel with a given width of fracture were prepared. The relative error for the width of <b>artificial</b> <b>fracture</b> decreased to 1 %. The width of natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>fractures</b> in carbonate reservoirs can be estimated by image log data. A series of tests for formation damage were conducted by using the stainless steel simulated core samples flushed with different drilling fluids, such as the sulfonate/polymer drill-in fluid and the solids-free drill-in fluid with or without ideal packing bridging materials. Based on the experimental results using this kind of simulated cores, a novel approach to the damage control of fractured carbonate reservoirs was presented. The effective temporary plugging ring on the end face of the simulated core sample can be observed clearly. The experimental results also show that the stainless steel simulated cores made it possible to visualize the solids and filtrate invasion.|$|R
30|$|According to the Griffith criterion, the {{direction}} of <b>artificial</b> <b>fracturing</b> generally develops along {{the direction}} of maximum stress (Sumigawa et al. 2017; Yin et al. 2015). The initial fracture direction and the secondary steering direction of fracturing may coincide with {{the direction of}} maximum principal stress. In addition, {{the distance between the}} two wells is short, and the natural fractures near the faulting are developed. Therefore, a well-connected fracture channel is formed between the Bei 14 -X 51 - 59 well and the gas injection well Bei 14 -X 54 - 58, and thus the CO 2 reaches the production well quickly along the connected channel. The Bei 14 -X 52 - 58, which is closer to the gas injection well, has no artificial fractures. From the flow field distribution in Fig.  7, {{it can be seen that}} the CO 2 migration channel between the gas injection well and the Bei 14 -X 51 - 59 is more than that of the Bei 14 -X 52 - 58 resulting in faster migration. These also illustrate the role of fractures in the main effect of gas channeling.|$|E
40|$|Large scale {{utilization}} of geothermal energy will require means for enhanced energy extraction from geothermal reservoirs since the higher quality hydrothermal resources adequate for commercial electricity generation represent {{only a small}} fraction of the estimated resource base. Technologies are being developed for <b>artificial</b> <b>fracturing</b> of hydrothermal and dry hot rock geothermal resources to obtain adequate permeability for water circulation and to expose new rock surface area. Non-isothermal processes such as in-place boiling or artificial circulation of cooler fluids can be used to extract the energy from the fractured formation. To evaluate non-isothermal heat transfer processes, physical model studies were conducted in the Stanford Geothermal Program fractured-rock reservoir model capable of operating at a maximum pressure of 800 psig at 500 ºF. The 17 -ft{sup 3 } physical model has been described previously [Hunsbedt, Kruger, and London (1975), Hunsbedt (1975), and Hunsbedt, Kruger and London (1976) ]. A summary of the characteristics of the relatively large fracture-permeability rock systems tested in the model are summarized in Table 1. The porosity and permeability characteristics of these systems resembled those of fracture-stimulated ones created by high-energy explosives. 1 tab., 4 refs., 2 figs...|$|E
40|$|Natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>fracturing</b> of rock plays a very {{important}} role in geologic processes and for engineered structures in and on rock. Fracturing is associated with crack initiation, propagation and coalescence, which have been studied experimentally and analytically by many researchers. The analytical models developed to describe the initiation and propagation of cracks in brittle materials can be incorporated in Finite Element (FE) and Displacement Discontinuity (DD) codes. Corresponding research has been going on at MIT and has {{led to the development of}} a DDM code - FROCK - which currently uses a stress-based criterion proposed by Bobet (1997) to model crack initiation and propagation. Even though the predictions obtained with this criterion generally correspond to the experimental results, there are cases, in which the results obtained with FROCK are not satisfactory. This thesis proposes and implements new crack initiation and propagation criteria in the DDM code FROCK, namely a strain-based criterion and two stress-dependent criteria. It also studies the crack initiation and propagation processes numerically, using the FEM code ABAQUS. Existing crack initiation and propagation criteria (stress, strain and energy based) are also investigated with ABAQUS. The crack development processes are studied by modeling pairs of pre-existing flaws (double-flaw geometries) embedded in specimens subjected to vertical compressive loads in both ABAQUS and FROCK. For the different flaw arrangements studied, the difference between the stress and strain fields around the flaw tip gradually increases as the horizontal distance between the inner flaw tips increases. In terms of crack initiation, the results obtained with the stress and strain-based criteria studied were more consistent with the experimental observations than the results obtained with the energy-based criterion. The proposed strain-based criterion implemented in FROCK yielded better results than Bobet's stress-based criterion currently used in FROCK, for the five flaw arrangements studied. The results obtained with the two proposed stress-dependent criteria indicate that the critical shear stress at which a crack propagates in rock does not depend upon the normal stress applied, since the best crack propagation results were obtained for very low or zero friction angles. by Bruno Miguel Gonçalves da Silva.

30|$|According to {{the above}} method, the {{distribution}} characteristics of the <b>artificial</b> <b>fractures</b> of II oil group in Hailar Bei 14 block are shown in Fig.  5. A total of 29 wells underwent fracturing operations between 2006 and 2015, including two wells that were multiple fracturing. From the prediction results, {{it can be seen}} that the fractured well Bei 14 -X 56 - 54 first produced a fracture along the direction of the original geostress. As a result of the existence of <b>artificial</b> <b>fractures</b> and the initiation of injection-production, an induced stress field was generated and the direction of the geostress in this area is turned. Based on the distribution of the maximum horizontal principal stress at that time, the fracture directions of other wells after the fracturing operation were sequentially obtained. Therefore, the <b>artificial</b> <b>fractures</b> in this area extend in different directions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{characteristics}} of the ultra-low permeability, facture system becomes the key to the deployment of shale gas, and the following stress sensitivity damage will restrict the engineering effect. The essay takes the Niutitang group of black shale as the research object, which carried out for natural fracture rock sample and <b>artificial</b> <b>fracture</b> rock sample study of stress sensitivity evaluation in order to compare differences between them. The experimental results show that the natural fracture rock sample is medium to strong stress sensitivity, while the <b>artificial</b> <b>fracture</b> rock sample is from strong to the extreme strong stress sensitivity. Natural fracture is more flattening than the <b>artificial</b> <b>fracture</b> formation because of leaching action. The processed SEM image can reflect structure information on the two-dimensional surface. Its surface structure conforms to the fractal structure characteristics.

40|$|AbstractThe main aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} gas–oil relative permeability curves as the main flow function in different gas injection scenarios, immiscible and near miscible in case of highly fractured reservoirs. In this research, some experiments have been done on the reservoir core sample selected from sandstone formation {{in one of the}} Iranian naturally fractured oil reservoirs. The core is saturated with oil sample and CO 2 is injected into oil saturated core sample. Experiments have been performed on both of the sandstone and <b>artificial</b> <b>fractured</b> sandstone, represented as no fractured and highly fractured reservoirs, based on incremental pressure algorithm approaching into near miscible condition. Inverse modeling method has been used to calculate relative permeability curves. By comparing the relative permeability curves in immiscible and near-miscible conditions, the results show that in sandstone core type this change is considerable, but in highly <b>artificial</b> <b>fractured</b> sandstone with a high ratio of <b>artificial</b> <b>fractured</b> to sandstone absolute permeability (Kef /Ks) is not substantial. Moreover the results show that in the described case of <b>artificial</b> <b>fractured</b> core type so simple conventional relative permeability methods have the same results compared to a sophisticated inverse modeling method. The other main result is the lack of miscibility activation in near miscible injection through the highly fractured reservoirs leading to viscose dominant flow rather than capillary. Finally by considering this changing behavior, a better knowledge of gas front movement through highly fractured reservoirs in low IFT regions can be obtained...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{technology is}} widely used in most oil-water wells to improve production. However, the mechanism of fracturing in a reservoir with inclusion fissures is still unclear. In this study, a theoretical model was developed to determine the stress distribution during hydraulic fracturing.

Stress intensity factors at the tip of both the <b>artificial</b> <b>fracture</b> and the inclusion were achieved, and initiation of the fracture was predicted. Furthermore, to validate the theoretical model, re-fracturing experiments were performed on a large-scale tri-axial system. The results showed that the defects reduce the intensity of the rock, which introduces the possibility that more complex fractures emerge in the reservoir. The results also showed that the fracture direction is governed by far-field stress.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, on {{the basis}} of the fact that tight {{reservoirs}} exhibit fractures of different scales after hydraulic fracturing and given their coupling patterns, an improved 2 nd-order finite element mixed model is proposed for fluid flow in such reservoirs. This model takes into account the threshold pressure gradient as well as cross flow from the matrix to the natural fractures. The natural fractures are assumed to be continuous, while the hydraulic fractures are treated as discrete ones. All the media are coupled by the cross flow between them. Sensitivity analyses are performed to determine the effects of the threshold pressure gradient and the permeabilities of the various media. It is concluded that the actual bottom-hole pressure can be increased by increasing the permeability of only the natural fractures or by decreasing the threshold pressure gradient. Increasing the permeabilities of all the media causes the bottom-hole pressure to decrease rapidly initially and then slowly and increases the cross flow to the <b>artificial</b> <b>fractures.</b> Thus, increasing the permeability of <b>artificial</b> <b>fractures</b> is a suitable strategy only in the case of low-permeability matrices...|$|R
