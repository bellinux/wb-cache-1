5|$|In later years, Wolff said he {{was always}} wary of Heydrich, {{who seemed to be}} waiting for an {{opportunity}} to move against him and disgrace him with Himmler. Within the Allgemeine-SS, Heydrich forged relationships with some of the more powerful SS and Police Leaders such as Friedrich Jeckeln. Heydrich maintained a dialogue with him, but cautiously, especially after Jeckeln ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> Himmler in the late 1930s and early 1940s.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} {{building}} up a new newspaper, Kringen had a certain personal drive, as he ran for parliament in 1909. When he lost the election, he also lost interest to a certain degree. He resigned in 1912 and Ole Holmen, {{a member of the}} Vang municipal council, took over as chief editor. However, he ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> other people involved with the newspaper and was fired in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did {{not share}} a united {{political}} view and the magazine ostensibly stayed politically neutral. This stance was adopted to ensure the magazine did not fall <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the colonial government's censors and to protect contributors employed by the government. However, writings falling under various parts the political spectrum were published, including works by cultural nationalists, a sonnet dedicated to Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg, and notes on fascism.|$|E
5|$|Foreign comics, {{especially}} Japanese, {{became quite}} successful in Canada, and stood out for gaining {{large numbers of}} female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books. They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as child pornography and result in jail terms.|$|E
5|$|His 1815 Polish {{translation}} of Homer's Iliad {{met with a}} negative reception. In 1816–20 he published many of his writings in a 9-volume Works (Dzieła). Volumes 7–9 comprised his Humankind: A Didactic Poem (Ród Ludzki. Poema Dydaktyczne), a gigantic philosophical essay and poem that is regarded as {{an important contribution to}} the history of Polish philosophy. However, the work ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the new censorship law and was not distributed, much of the edition eventually being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, the French {{consumer}} group UFC Que Choisir initiated {{a lawsuit against}} Valve for several of their Steam policies that conflict or run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> French law, including the restriction against reselling of purchased games which is legal in the European Union. In August 2016, BT Group {{filed a lawsuit against}} Valve stating that Steam's client infringes on four of their patents, which they state are used within the Steam Library, Chat, Messaging, and Broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game's history, TSR took {{no action}} against small publishers' {{production}} of D compatible material, and even licensed Judges Guild to produce D materials for several years, such as City State of the Invincible Overlord. This attitude {{changed in the}} mid-1980s when TSR took legal action {{to try to prevent}} others from publishing compatible material. This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies. Although TSR took legal action against several publishers in an attempt to restrict third-party usage, it never brought any court cases to completion, instead settling out of court in every instance. TSR itself ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> intellectual property law in several cases.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Needham (died 3 May 1731), {{also known}} as Mother Needham, was an English procuress and brothel-keeper of 18th-century London, who has been {{identified}} as the bawd greeting Moll Hackabout in the first plate of William Hogarth's series of satirical etchings, A Harlot's Progress. Although Needham was notorious in London at the time, little is recorded of her life, and no genuine portraits of her survive. Her house was the most exclusive in London and her customers came from the highest strata of fashionable society, but she eventually ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the moral reformers of the day and {{died as a result of}} the severe treatment she received after being sentenced to stand in the pillory.|$|E
5|$|His {{policies}} ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States {{government to}} have him overthrown. The US was also concerned {{by the presence of}} communists in the Guatemalan government, and Árbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. Árbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended further into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the Guatemalan government issued an official apology for Árbenz's overthrow.|$|E
5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the electric chair, and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at the wheel, to the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months into}} his term, Dow {{inadvertently}} ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> his own prohibition laws. After {{setting up a}} committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because the invoice was in his name, this placed Dow in technical violation of the law. Dow's enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed judicial discretion, the judge {{had no choice but}} to issue the warrant. Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.|$|E
5|$|While Cáceres {{was engaged}} in what would evidently be a lengthy siege, Montejo sent a column of Spanish {{soldiers}} into the area around Gracias a Dios; he sent a second column, with 20 Spaniards accompanied by native auxiliaries, south to the Valley of Xocorro. Montejo led a third column in person, taking 23 Spanish soldiers to Comayagua. He also sent a message ahead, for Santa María de Comayagua to send support to Cáceres at the Peñol, and fourteen soldiers marched from there to join the siege. The Xocorro column was forced to return to Santa María de Comayagua after falling <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish authorities in San Miguel, who claimed they were infringing upon their jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn's {{diabetes}} worsened {{during the}} course of the trial, and by the time he was executed, his elderly mother had died. He suffered a heart attack while in custody. On 9 May 1964, was carried on a stretcher into the prison courtyard and assisted by guards and two Catholic priests to stand alongside the post to which he was tied. He was blindfolded against his request and shot in front of approximately 200 spectators. Lodge defended his actions, claiming the United States did all it could to prevent the execution. The ambassador claimed Cẩn would have been allowed to seek refuge at the U.S. embassy, despite the fact that he had ordered Conein to intercept Cẩn at the airport. Rev. Cao Văn Luân, Catholic rector of Huế University who had been fired for falling <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the powerful Archbishop Thục, asked Lodge that Cẩn not be executed. According to Luân, Lodge reportedly assured the rector the execution would not take place. Cẩn left his personal fortune, which had indeed been deposited in foreign banks, to Catholic charities.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Arévalo's {{presidency}} in 1951, Jacobo Árbenz {{was elected to the}} {{presidency in}} a landslide. The progressive military leader of 1944 continued Arévalo's reforms, and began an ambitious land-reform program, known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation, and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. Árbenz' policies ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the United Fruit Company, which lost some of its uncultivated land. The company lobbied the US government for Árbenz' overthrow, and the State Department responded by engineering a coup under the pretext that Árbenz was a communist. Carlos Castillo Armas took power {{at the head of a}} military junta, provoking the Guatemalan Civil War. The war lasted from 1960 to 1996, and saw the US-backed military commit genocide against the indigenous Maya peoples, and widespread human rights violations against civilians.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{numerous}} {{proposals were}} put forward to salvage Titanic. However, all fell <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> practical and technological difficulties, {{a lack of}} funding and, in many cases, {{a lack of understanding}} of the physical conditions at the wreck site. Charles Smith, an architect from Denver, proposed in March 1914 to attach electromagnets to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wreck's steel hull. Having found its exact position, more electromagnets would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch Titanic to the surface. An estimated cost of $1.5 million (£ today) and its impracticality meant that the idea was not put into practice. Another proposal involved raising Titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using electromagnets. Once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float gently to the surface. Again, the idea got no further than the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|Pursuant to dynastic imperatives and {{the ethos}} of the time, the nobles {{required}} Tamar to marry {{in order to have}} a leader for the army and to provide an heir to the throne. Their choice fell on Yuri, son of the murdered prince Andrei I Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal, who then lived as a refugee among the Kipchaks of the North Caucasus. The choice was approved by Tamar's aunt Rusudan and the prince was brought to Georgia to marry the queen in 1185. Yuri proved to be an able soldier, but a difficult person and he soon ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> his wife. The strained spousal relations paralleled a factional struggle at the royal court in which Tamar was becoming more and more assertive of her rights as a queen regnant. The turning point in Tamar's fortunes came with the death of the powerful Catholicos-Patriarch Michael whom the queen replaced, as a chancellor, with her supporter, Anton Gnolistavisdze. Tamar gradually expanded her own power-base and elevated her loyal nobles to high positions at the court, most notably the Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of a dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the growing list of early retirements when he slid off at the hairpin under brakes and into the gravel trap whilst trying to force his way past a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race and setting the fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd's List for 2 February {{reported}} that Minerva, Blaney, master, had run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> , Salkeld, master, from Bengal, in The Downs. Castor was on shore at Ramsgate, and the cargo {{was expected to}} be saved.|$|E
25|$|The {{myth that}} I had {{something}} to do both with spurring the investigation and with airing all of this has stuck around because it is convenient for some to blame me rather than those aides who ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the law.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major issue}} in Villepin's {{government}} was {{the state of the}} national budget. France runs high deficits, which run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the rules set in the EU Maastricht Treaty. Villepin's margin of maneuver in that respect was extremely slim.|$|E
25|$|Falling <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> camp rules {{exposed a}} {{prisoner}} to sanctions, which could come about for various reasons: refusal to salute, refusal to answer during roll call, insubordination, possession of banned objects like paper, wearing civilian clothes, escape or attempted escape.|$|E
25|$|TSR ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> {{intellectual}} property law regarding the Cthulhu Mythos and Melnibonéan Mythos, elements of which were included in early versions of the 1980 Deities & Demigods manual. These problems were ultimately resolved by excising the material from later editions of the book.|$|E
25|$|Along similar legal lines, {{defendants}} in a wrongful-death action {{brought by the}} survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly {{on the ground that}} the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 2009, William J. Kelly, {{conservative}} {{activist and}} candidate for Illinois Comptroller, attempted {{to remove a}} FFRF sign at a holiday display. The case was dismissed on several grounds, including that the lawsuit ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the First Amendment prohibition against content-based discrimination and that the plaintiff's rights had not been violated.|$|E
25|$|The broader legal {{consequence}} of the Court's decision was its establishment of a general test for determining whether a device with copying or recording capabilities ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> copyright law. This test has created some interpretative challenges to courts in applying the case to more recent file sharing technologies available for use on home computers and over the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Jerry Fowler, meanwhile, later ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the law, was {{defeated}} for a sixth {{term in the}} 1999 primary, and served time in a federal prison in Texas for bribery and income tax evasion. Jerry Fowler's wife, Mari Ann, disappeared one Christmas weekend {{when she went to}} visit her husband in prison, was never located, and has been declared legally dead.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} in which Sahagún {{conducted}} his research, the conquering Spaniards were greatly outnumbered by the conquered Aztecs, and were concerned about the threat of a native uprising. Some colonial authorities perceived his writings as potentially dangerous, since they lent credibility to native voices and perspectives. Sahagún was aware of the need to avoid running <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the Inquisition, which was established in Mexico in 1570.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1986 season, the Mustangs were {{discovered}} to have once again run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> NCAA rules and their football team {{was not allowed}} to participate in the 1987 season. SMU also was not permitted to play home games in the 1988 season, but the school decided to suspend the program itself for an additional year as it found itself unable to field a viable team.|$|E
25|$|Butterfield and Hazard also {{performed}} some rescue services. On one occasion {{he came across}} a transport vessel that had lost her masts and that had already run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> two other ships. Butterfield {{was able to bring}} her into port, thereby saving her cargo of military supplies intended for the British Army serving against the Irish rebels. Sir Robert Kingsmill, the commander in chief at Cork thanked him for his service.|$|E
25|$|Adulterous office romances {{are widely}} {{considered}} to be unhelpful to business and work relationships, and superior-subordinate relationships are banned in 90% of companies with written policies regarding office romance. Companies cannot ban adultery, as, in {{all but a handful}} of states, such regulations would run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> laws prohibiting {{discrimination on the basis of}} marital status. Firings nonetheless often occur on the basis of charges of inappropriate office conduct.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a concern in the {{administration}} over whether {{the use of military}} forces to support and carry out the evacuation was permitted under the newly passed War Powers Act. Eventually White House lawyers determined that the use of American forces to rescue citizens in an emergency was unlikely to run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the law, but the legality of using military assets to withdraw refugees was unknown.|$|E
25|$|Schlesinger and Warner Bros. had {{problems}} with Clean Pastures from the start. Hollywood censors alleged that the film ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the Hays Production Code because it burlesqued religion. Later commentators surmise that the censors also objected to the portrayal of a Heaven run by African Americans. In 1968, the short's stereotypical portrayal of black characters prompted United Artists to withhold it from distribution {{as one of the}} infamous Censored Eleven.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} {{game in the}} series, , Phoenix travels to the Kingdom of Kuhra'in, where he reunites with Maya Fey, and discovers that defense {{attorneys}} are reviled throughout the kingdom, having a reputation of abiding criminals. He successfully defends his young tour guide and Maya when they are both accused of murder, putting himself at severe risk of falling <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the Kingdom's Defense Culpability Act, which states that defense attorneys of parties found guilty are put to death.|$|E
25|$|John Pepper, {{also known}} as József Pogány and Joseph Pogany (born József Schwartz; November 8, 1886 – February 8, 1938), was a Hungarian-Jewish Communist politician, active in the radical {{movements}} of both Hungary and the United States. He later served as a functionary in the Communist International in Moscow, before being cashiered in 1929. Later an official in the Soviet government, Pepper ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the secret police and was executed during the Great Terror of 1937–38.|$|E
25|$|In March 1842 Owen Glendower was in Chatham, being fitted as {{a prison}} hulk {{to be based}} at Gibraltar. She then sailed from Chatham for Gibraltar in October with 200 convicts for work on the {{development}} of the Dockyard and the construction of a new breakwater there. Among the convicts were some who had run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the restrictive political laws of the time, such as the Tolpuddle Martyrs. Once in Gibraltar, Owen Glendower then served for decades as a convict hulk.|$|E
