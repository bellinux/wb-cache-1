25|$|Barry causes Colin {{problems}} by interfering with his work, deliberately making him jealous, {{and engaging in}} criminal antics with villainous Nick Cotton (John Altman) leaving Colin {{to pay for the}} damages. Further problems arise when Colin is called for jury service in 1987. The plaintiff {{is a member of the}} gangster organisation known as The Firm, and when Colin refuses to give a verdict of not guilty at the trial, Colin's flat is vandalised by Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt). Colin calls the police, but they are more concerned about Colin's relationship with Barry than catching the vandals. They discover that Barry was under the age of legal sexual consent for gay men when he and Colin began living together, and the police decide to inform Barry's parents (in 1987 the legal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> for gay men was 21). Barry is petrified of his homophobic father and decides to end his relationship with Colin.|$|E
500|$|Stockwell Day {{called a}} new Canadian Alliance {{leadership}} race for 2002, and soon declared himself a candidate. Harper emerged as Day's main rival, and declared his own candidacy on December 3, 2001. He eventually won {{the support of}} at least 28 Alliance MPs, including Scott Reid, James Rajotte and Keith Martin. During the campaign, Harper reprised his earlier warnings against an alliance with Quebecois nationalists, and called for his party to become the federalist option in Quebec. He argued that [...] "the French language is not imperilled in Quebec", and opposed [...] "special status" [...] for the province in the Canadian Constitution accordingly. He also endorsed greater provincial autonomy on Medicare, {{and said that he}} would not co-operate with the Progressive Conservatives {{as long as they were}} led by Joe Clark. On social issues, Harper argued for [...] "parental rights" [...] to use corporal punishment against their children and supported raising the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent.</b> He described his potential support base as [...] "similar to what George Bush tapped".|$|E

25|$|Several {{widely publicized}} cases of female-on-male {{statutory}} rape in the United States involved school teachers engaging {{in sexual intercourse}} with their underage students.

5000|$|Both Lawson and Theo Merz (writing in the Daily Telegraph) {{compare the}} Cucumber trilogy to Davies' Queer as Folk—Lawson argues that while Cucumber and Banana are [...] "notably sexually graphic", the times have changed: [...] "Queer as Folk {{was made at}} a time when campaigners were {{fighting}} to reduce the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> gay <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> from 18 to 16, while Davies’ latest shows are screening in an era when men and women can legally marry each other", and therefore the depictions <b>of</b> explicit <b>sexual</b> themes are less likely to offend. Merz agrees, stating that Cucumber and Banana [...] "feel less dangerous, and so less exciting than the earlier Queer as Folk"; Merz also argues that Cucumber has wider latitude to represent more varied gay characters as it is not carrying the burden of being the only show on television representing gay life.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2006, Toews {{introduced}} a bill (Bill C-2) to raise the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> from fourteen to sixteen. [...] The bill included an exemption for adolescents who have relations with persons {{no more than five}} years older than themselves. [...] Under Canadian law, [...] "sexual consent" [...] covers all activities from kissing to intercourse. [...] Liberal MP Irwin Cotler argued that the Conservative Party was misrepresenting the issue to the Canadian public, and noted that the sexual exploitation of persons under eighteen is already illegal under Canadian law. [...] Toew's proposed changes were supported by other interested parties, including Manitoba Justice Minister Gord Mackintosh. [...] The bill became law in February 2008, over a year after Toews left the Justice portfolio.|$|E
2500|$|Although Fidel Castro {{sought to}} {{eliminate}} prostitution after taking power, {{the discrepancy between}} typical Cuban wages (less than one US dollar per day) and the spending power of foreign tourists lures some Cubans, including minors, into prostitution. However, allegations of widespread sex tourism have been downplayed by Cuban justice minister Maria Esther Reus. According to the Miami Herald, prostitution is not illegal in Cuba, but procuring a prostitute for others is outlawed. The <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> on the island is 16. According to a travel advice website {{by the government of}} Canada, [...] "Cuba is actively working to prevent child sex tourism, and a number of tourists, including Canadians, have been convicted of offences related to the corruption of minors aged 16 and under. Prison sentences range from 7 to 25 years." [...] It is illegal to import or produce pornography in Cuba.|$|E

50|$|Some laws {{regulating}} {{sexual activity}} {{are intended to}} protect one or all participants, while others are intended to proscribe behavior that {{has been defined as}} a crime. For example, a law may proscribe unprotected sex if one person knows that he or she has a sexual disease or to protect a minor; or it may proscribe non-consensual sex, or because of a relationship between the participants, etc. In general, laws may proscribe acts which are considered either sexual abuse or behavior that societies consider to be inappropriate and against the social norms. Sexual abuse is unwanted sexual contact between two or more adults or two or more minors, and, depending on laws with regard to <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent,</b> <b>sexual</b> contact between an adult and a minor.|$|R
2500|$|Barry {{remained}} on-screen as {{a full-time}} character until 1988. His character was used to highlight many other gay issues, such as homophobia, gay legal inequality — the legal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> gay <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> (which {{at the time was}} 21 instead of 16 as it is today) — and most notably the hardship that many young gay men face when [...] "coming out" [...] to their parents. The plot saw Barry forced into [...] "outing" [...] himself to his father, who reacted badly, and this subsequently led to Barry living the remainder of his stay in Walford as a heterosexual in order to appease him [...] — thus highlighting the pressure to conform that many young gay people face. Although the scenes where Barry was disowned by his father (as a result of his sexuality) were filmed, they never made it to air. In an interview featured in EastEnders Handbook by Hilary Kingsly, Michael Cashman expressed how sorry he was that these particular scenes were cut, although no reason for their exclusion was given. As such, Barry's confrontation with his father occurred off-screen. Eventually, the differences between Colin and Barry became too great for them to overcome, they split and Barry left Walford for a job on a cruise ship, but returned briefly in February 1989 to aid the departure of Colin.|$|R
40|$|When {{is a woman}} not a woman? In some traditions, {{a female}} human being is {{considered}} to be a woman when she marries, regardless <b>of</b> her <b>age.</b> In certain communities, first menstruation is taken as a sign of womanhood. In other societies, the age when childhood ends shifts with changes in fashion, pop culture, and sexual imagery. There are other thresholds too, enshrined in national laws relating to the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> marriage, <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent,</b> and <b>of</b> legal responsibility. These differ among countries and within countries, so that a 17 -year-old in some countries may be old enough to marry, but not old enough to buy alcohol or take out a mortgage. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) gives us a benchmark for when childhood ends: all people under the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 18 are children. This is not to deny 17 - year-old females their right to be considered and to be called 'women' if they wish. It does not suggest that the group often labelled 'adolescents' or 'teenagers' or 'young people' is immature. It is a way to remind ourselves that anyone under the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 18, regardless of other thresholds and labels, has a right to special protection. This is particularly important in relation to children and sexual activity...|$|R

The research project {{was inspired by}} recent debates within {{the media and the}} wider public regarding the role of sex education in developing healthy sexual practices amongst young people. Discourse surrounding the subject often pertained to the omission <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> from sex education classes and how this often left youth confused about how to adequately communicate and understand consent. Under social conditions where pornography is increasingly used by young people as a form of sex education, questions arose regarding whether young people felt that the formal sex education they received was helpful or relatable to their own experiences. However, before one can adequately examine the social practices <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> by young people, a clear understanding of the legal and pedagogical constructions of consent must be attained. The purpose of this thesis will be to map these constructions <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> and compare these with the social practices involved in negotiating <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> amongst young people.

40|$|Legal, moral, and {{health-related}} issues around <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> {{have become}} {{prominent in the}} media in recent years. The public debate surrounding these news stories indicates a large discrepancy in people’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> and its legal implications. Motivated {{by the fact that}} university students are sexually victimized at rates exceeding the general population, this study explores factors that influence knowledge of legal aspects <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> and confidence in using such knowledge of students/alumni, under 30 years old, from two southern Ontario universities. This quantitative study used an online survey design, and is grounded in a heuristic paradigm, with a feminist perspective. Ten vignette-style questions were developed to evaluate legal <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> knowledge. Participants felt relatively confident about their level of knowledge and understanding, and yet their scores on knowledge do not reflect that. Association between variables was examined using bivariate and multiple regression analyses. No factors were found to be statistically significantly associated with level <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> knowledge. A regression model for levels <b>of</b> confidence about <b>sexual</b> <b>consent,</b> accounted for 12. 4 % of the variance.

40|$|In the UK, {{there has}} been growing concern about young people’s {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent,</b> with the views of young people themselves often lost in academic and educational policy debates. However, the focus on high rates <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> violence has meant a lack of attention on the everyday negotiation of consensual heterosexual activity, leading to assumptions being made regarding young people’s lack <b>of</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent.</b> This paper emerges from a wider study of over 500 young people which sought to uncover {{their understanding of the}} issues. Drawing on data from workshops and the open text responses to an on-line survey the findings presented in this paper show that the majority of heterosexual young people understood the complexity <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> as an embodied process, which can be difficult to define, talk about or practice uniformly. This complex understanding, in which <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> is a continuum rather than a dichotomy, has implications for sexual education initiatives. We argue that it is only by providing a closer understanding of how - within consensual sexual activities - young people understand and enact <b>sexual</b> <b>consent</b> through a range of embodied communication strategies that education surrounding sexual assault will become meaningful...|$|R
