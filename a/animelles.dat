500|$|In the 21st century, {{the nations}} {{with the highest}} {{consumption}} of sheep meat are the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Australia, Greece, Uruguay, the United Kingdom and Ireland. These countries eat 14–40lbs (3–18kg) of sheep meat per capita, per annum. Sheep meat is also popular in France, Africa (especially the Maghreb), the Caribbean, {{the rest of the}} Middle East, India, and parts of China. This often reflects a history of sheep production. In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and offal may be popular or traditional. Sheep testicles—called <b>animelles</b> or lamb fries—are considered a delicacy {{in many parts of the}} world. Perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the Scottish haggis, composed of various sheep innards cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach. [...] In comparison, countries such as the U.S. consume only a pound or less (under 0.5kg), with Americans eating 50pounds (22kg) of pork and 65pounds (29kg) of beef. In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly lamb chops and leg of lamb.|$|E
