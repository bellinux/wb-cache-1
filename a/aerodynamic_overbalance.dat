40|$|Tests {{of several}} modern {{airplanes}} indicate that control surfaces {{with a high}} degree of aerodynamic balance are likely to possess characteristics which make them unsatisfactory or dangerous in high-speed flight. Dive tests made in the spring of 1940 at the NACA on a naval fighter-type airplane illustrate one form of instability that may be encountered. During a dive at an indicated airspeed of 365 miles per hour, the ailerons suddenly overbalanced. The efforts of the pilot to bring the ailerons back to neutral resulted in a violent oscillation of the control stick from side to side. Fortunately, the force required to return the ailerons to neutral was within the pilot's capabilities. A time history of the maneuver is given in figure 1 and typical frames from motion pictures of the cockpit and of the wing, taken during the maneuver, are given in figure 2. In the illustrated case, the occurrence of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>overbalance</b> was attributed to a slight bulge, approximately 1 / 16 inch thick, on the lower surface of the leading edges of the ailerons, caused by the installation of additional mass balance ahead of the hinge line. A drawing showing the shape of the bulge is given in figure 3. After this slight protuberance had been eliminated, dives were successfully made at higher speeds...|$|E
