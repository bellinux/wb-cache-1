40|$|AbstractThe present {{research}} suggests that the size of the solution space, which for a given set of stakeholder needs is delimited by system requirements, relates to the probability of finding <b>affordable</b> <b>solutions.</b> As a result, the effectiveness of tradespace exploration techniques is limited by its size and internal ordering. Therefore, we suggest that there exist models to elicit and use requirements that, for a given set older needs, could facilitate the maximization of the solutionof stakehspace so that the probability of finding more <b>affordable</b> <b>solutions</b> during tradespace exploration is also maximized. The {{present research}} proposes a mathematical model of the requirements elicitation process that facilitates defining performance objectives for the requirements elicitation process in striving for system affordability. The uniqueness of this research lays on two elements. First, the requirements elicitation process is mathematically modeled so that their objectives with respect to the effects on the solution space can be mathematically, and thus rigorously, described. Second, the system of interest focuses on the definition of the solutionspace as a driver for system affordability instead of on its actual exploration. The present research closes therefore the loop between stakeholder needs, system requirements, solutionspaces, and system affordability. The results of the present research are generalized to discrete requirements, fuzzy requirements, and continuous requirements or value functions...|$|R

50|$|Electronic design {{automation}} software (EDA) developer Protel marketed CircuitMaker 2000 as a schematic capture tool, together with Traxmaker as its PCB layout counterpart, {{as a powerful}} yet <b>affordable</b> <b>solution</b> for circuit board needs. Its ease of use and comparatively low cost quickly gained it popularity among students, and the software suite was commonly used to teach circuit board design to engineering students in universities. The wide availability of plug-ins and component libraries have accelerated adoption, and quickly amassed a worldwide community. When Protel was acquired by Altium Limited in the early 2000s, engineering efforts were redirected towards the development of DXP2004, and CircuitMaker 2000 was eventually discontinued. Due to its new status as abandonware, CircuitMaker 2000 remained popular among hobby users and students. This popularity has been observed by Altium, and the most successful features of CircuitMaker 2000 have since been integrated in DXP2004 and later {{found their way into}} Altium Designer.|$|E
50|$|Some years later, further {{research}} {{was carried out}} in relation to 3D FPM approximations in (Ortega, Oñate & Idelsohn, 2007). This work focused on constructing robust approximations regardless of the characteristics of the local support. To this end, local automatic adjusting of the weighting function and other approximation parameters were proposed. Further 3D applications of the method involved compressible aerodynamics flows with adaptive refinement (Ortega, Oñate & Idelsohn, 2009) and moving/deforming boundary problems (Ortega, Oñate & Idelsohn, 2013). In these works, the FPM showed satisfactory robustness and accuracy, and capabilities to address practical computations. Among other achievements, it was demonstrated that a complete regeneration of the model discretization could be an <b>affordable</b> <b>solution</b> strategy, even in large simulation problems. This result presents new possibilities for the meshless analysis of moving/deforming domain problems. The FPM was also applied with success to adaptive shallow water problems in (Ortega, Oñate, Idelsohn & Buachart, 2011) and (Buachart, Kanok-Nukulchai, Ortega & Oñate, 2014). A proposal to exploit meshless advantages in high-Reynolds viscous flow problems is presented in (Ortega, Oñate, Idelsohn & Flores, 2014a).|$|E
50|$|George Dennis, Vince Primerano and Grant Gaynor {{conceived}} {{of the first}} operational set of TV Ears in Huntington Beach, California in 1998.

However, Dennis gave up the search when he realized that all possibilities left him with expensive hearing aids that were not covered by insurance. This is when he decided to create his own cost-effective solution for the hearing impaired to watch television and designed the basis for what would become the TV Ears that are available today. Eventually, the headset would go through four separate versions, before settling on the current TV Ears 5.0, which utilizes the brand’s proprietary Voice Clarifying Circuitry. Today, TV Ears is the #1 selling brand for TV listening devices and is recommended by doctors and audiologists across the world. TV Ears is located in San Diego, California where they house the North America distribution center, support, and sales teams.|$|E
40|$|Program {{failures}} {{have plagued}} {{the defense and}} aerospace industry for decades, as unanticipated cost and schedule overruns have rendered the development of systems ineffective {{in terms of time}} and cost considerations. This raises the need to holistically include performance, cost and schedule considerations during the early-phase design of systems to perform valuable tradeoffs that derive more feasible and <b>affordable</b> <b>solutions.</b> This paradigm is the design for affordability. This design for affordability conundrum is targeted at defense and aerospace systems, which have complex mission requirements and stakeholder involvement that are susceptible to changes and perturbations over time. Without a systematic framework, the design for affordability process can potentially become cognitively challenging to system architects and lead to unsatisfactory results. To resolve affordability, it can first be defined as the property of becoming or remaining feasible relative to resource needs and resource constraints over time. Affordability can then be treated as an ility that drives the design of more affordable yet technically sound architectures. Tradespace-based methods are introduced to drive affordability and incorporate these holistic considerations into the design process. They facilitate the systematic and disciplined search for <b>affordable</b> <b>solutions</b> to the system, program and portfolio of interest. Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration (MATE), Epoch-Era Analysis (EEA) and the Multi-Attribute Expense (MAE) function were modified for affordability analysis. Their feasibility was demonstrated through application to two design case studies. Results from both case studies demonstrated the dynamic tradeoffs among performance, cost and schedule parameters. Tradespace-based methods can thus be applied to the progressive design of systems, programs and portfolios using either a bottom-up or top-down approach to deliver <b>affordable</b> <b>solutions</b> in these cases. Affordability is not only an engineering problem; it is also a policy and management problem. Therefore, affordability can be approached through perspectives beyond engineering design. New policies and refined management practices can be used alongside tradespace-based methods for affordability analysis to ensure the continued delivery of affordable systems for the future. by Marcus Shihong Wu.
