He <b>asserts</b> <b>that</b> trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when grown on the plain.|$|E

Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view {{seems to be that}} the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
