40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method {{to construct a}} dynamic single assignment (DSA) form of array intensive, pointer free C programs. A program in DSA form does not perform any destructive update of scalars and array elements, i. e., each element is written at most once. As DSA makes the dependencies between variable references explicit, it facilitates complex analyses and optimizations of programs. Existing transformations into DSA perform a complex data flow analysis with exponential analysis time, and they work only for a limited class of input programs. Our method removes irregularities from the data flow by adding copy assignments to the program, {{so that it can}} use simple data flow analyses. The presented DSA transformation scales very well with growing program sizes and overcomes a number of important limitations of existing methods. We have implemented the method and it is being used in the context of memory optimization and verification of those optimizations. Experiments show that in practice, the method scales well indeed, and that <b>added</b> <b>copy</b> operations can be removed in case they are unwanted...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Activation of {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -gamma signaling influences metabolic profiles and {{the propensity}} toward inflammation. Small-molecule stimulation of PPARgamma is investigated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The common PPARgamma Pro 12 Ala variant has functional and prognostic consequences. A protective {{effect of the}} 12 Ala-allele carriership on diabetes and myocardial infarction in healthy populations has been suggested. The relevance of this pathway also needs exploration in patients with manifest vascular disease. We investigated the effects of carriership of the Pro 12 Ala variant on angiographic and cardiovascular event outcomes in male patients with {{symptomatic coronary artery disease}} (CAD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) cohort was genotyped for the Pro 12 Ala variant (rs 1801282). Ten-year follow-up was derived from nation-wide registries, and risks were estimated using proportional hazards. Quantitative coronary angiography measurements were obtained and relations with genotype estimated using a generalized linear model. RESULTS: Genotypes ascertained (n = 679) comprised 540 (80 %) Pro/Pro, 126 (19 %) Pro/Ala, and 13 (2 %) Ala/Ala subjects. The 12 Ala allele was associated with less extensive focal (P = 0. 001) and diffuse (P = 0. 002) atherosclerosis and lower 10 -year cardiovascular risk. Hazard ratios were 0. 10 (95 % CI 0. 01 - 0. 70, P = 0. 02) for ischemic heart disease and 0. 24 (0. 08 - 0. 74, P = 0. 013) for vascular death, per each <b>added</b> <b>copy</b> of 12 Ala, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of the 12 Ala allele of PPARgamma have less widespread CAD and are considerably protected against 10 -year (cardio) vascular morbidity and mortality. These long-term findings in patients with manifest CAD support an important role of PPARgamma in determining vascular ris...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} we present two {{new ways to}} {{transform}} a program to dynamic single assignment form or DSA form. The importance of DSA form is that all restrictions on reordering statements due to memory reuse have been eleminated, thus allowing advanced memory optimizations required for multimedia applications {{to do a better}} job without a need to revert to more complex analyses. Though methods exist to do the transformation to DSA, they are both limited in applicability and scalability. To overcome these problems we developed two methods to do this conversion and for both the essential difference with existing methods is that we <b>add</b> <b>copy</b> operations to simplify the data flow, thus simplifying the DSA conversion considerably. However we cannot just <b>add</b> <b>copy</b> operations because that defeats the purpose of optimizing the memory use of a program. To solve this problem we present an advanced copy propagation method that removes copy operations such that we can obtain the DSA form of the program that we aim for. An added advantage of this method is that we can remove copy operations selectively, thus leaving some in in favor of lower complexity of the resulting program...|$|R

Thus, the two elements connected by a singular vertex or singular edge will be disconnected. Therefore, such elements should be removed immediately.|$|R
