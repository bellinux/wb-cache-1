5|$|Agriculture in Wales {{is heavily}} subsidised by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy with farmers getting annual {{payments}} {{for the area}} they farm. A new scheme was announced in 2014; after a transitional period lasting until 2019, lowland farms will receive almost £200 per hectare while farms in disadvantaged <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> receive £166. The total payment for Wales between 2014 and 2020 will be £1,870 million, but some of this (15%) {{will be used for}} rural development projects.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{only means}} of {{communication}} is a walkie-talkie connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah. Players may choose {{from a number of}} dialog options to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive objects or environments, or can refrain from communicating. The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> be opened up for players. The game also features a day-night cycle. Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for later use.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Suillus americanus has {{a similar}} appearance, but a more easterly distribution. It is {{associated}} with eastern white pine. Although some authors have tried {{to distinguish between the}} two with by using width of the stem, or by differences in fruit body colouration, it is acknowledged that these characteristics are variable, and depend on environmental factors. The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, although more samples from different geographical <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> be needed to verify this.|$|E

50|$|A new roofdeck {{on top of}} Glorietta 2 is {{currently}} under construction. Under Mitsubishi's partnership, a Japan-inspired retail <b>area</b> <b>will</b> open at the roofdeck with HalloHallo as its anchor. The roofdeck retail <b>area</b> <b>will</b> have a GLA of 2,500 square meters. An events <b>area</b> <b>will</b> be built for MNL48, the Philippines' version of Japanese idol group AKB48.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} phase of the {{terminal}} expansion, capacity of the departures <b>area</b> <b>will</b> be increased from the current 500 passengers per hour to 1,280 passengers per hour. It will include a large duty-free shop, a new business lounge, as well as renovated food & beverage and promotional <b>areas.</b> There <b>will</b> be 22 check-in desks and 5 long security lines. A new baggage sorting <b>area</b> <b>will</b> be added to the existing one. In addition, the baggage reclaim <b>area</b> <b>will</b> be expanded and equipped with three long carousels.|$|R
5|$|In addition, a 50,000 square-meter {{entertainment}} {{complex that}} will contain a Disney theme park, cinemas, shops, and a 25-screen Multiplex theater {{will be built}} at the Check Post exit from the Carmel Tunnels. In 2014, a new major plan for the city was proposed, under which extensive development of residential, business, and leisure <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> take place with the target of increasing the city's population by 60,000 by 2025. Under the plan, five new neighborhoods will be built, along with new high-tech parks. In addition, existing employment centers will be renovated, and new leisure areas and a large park will be built.|$|E
5|$|Regular bus {{services}} will serve the stadium {{from the city}} centre, and additional services to other <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> be considered if there is sufficient demand. A review {{of the park and}} ride operating times will take place, with an extension to the service to be sought. On matchdays, 400 car parking places and 355 cycle parking places will be available at the stadium. A cycle route exists between the site and the city centre.|$|E
5|$|Roanoke Regional {{features}} a large surface parking lot, which {{is divided into}} long term (996 spaces) and short term (226 spaces) parking. An additional 598 parking spaces are available in an overflow lot across Aviation Drive during peak travel times. In service since 1990, a small parking shuttle bus operates every 10 to 15 minutes between 6 a.m. and midnight. Future improvements to the parking <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> result {{in the construction of}} a multi-level parking garage atop the site of the existing long term lot.|$|E
50|$|The {{metropolitan}} area of Ploiești comprises 13 satellite towns. The <b>area</b> <b>will</b> {{become an important}} transit for two Pan-European motorway and rail corridors.

The manipulator repair and storage <b>area</b> <b>will</b> provide for storage of 20 manipulators, an area for receiving potentially contaminated manipulators and an area for the repair of manipulators. The decontamination <b>area</b> <b>will</b> be capable of decontamination of manipulators and shipping casks, pigs, T-handle carriers and other shipping containers. The laundry storage <b>area</b> <b>will</b> provide space for potentially contaminated and clean laundry...|$|R
5|$|The boom {{in urban}} {{development}} and modern architecture has brought some {{changes to the}} city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> see or have already seen massive urban development. Ørestad now has seen most of the recent development. Located near Copenhagen Airport, it currently boasts {{one of the largest}} malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the IT University and a high school.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} different microhabitats in a wood; coniferous forest, broad-leafed forest, open woodland, scattered trees, woodland verges, clearings and glades; tree trunk, branch, twig, bud, leaf, flower and fruit; rough bark, smooth bark, damaged bark, rotten wood, hollow, groove and hole; canopy, shrub layer, plant layer, leaf litter and soil; buttress root, stump, fallen log, stem base, grass tussock, fungus, fern and moss. The greater the structural {{diversity in the}} wood, the greater the number of microhabitats that will be present. A range of tree species with individual specimens of varying sizes and ages, {{and a range of}} features such as streams, level areas, slopes, tracks, clearings and felled <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> provide suitable conditions for an enormous number of biodiverse plants and animals. For example, in Britain {{it has been estimated that}} various types of rotting wood are home to over 1700 species of invertebrate.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{there are}} no {{regulations}} at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that {{is close to the}} outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can {{have a significant effect on}} how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.|$|E

If, over some {{area of the}} picture, the pattern is repeated at smaller distances, that <b>area</b> <b>will</b> appear closer than the background plane. If the distance of repeats is longer over some area, then that <b>area</b> <b>will</b> appear more distant (like {{a hole in the}} plane).|$|R

25|$|Plans {{to develop}} the Pier 6 Landscape are underway. The Pier 6 {{landscape}} will complete park construction of the outer two-thirds of the pier. Designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, the design integrates the landscape with the proposed viewing platform at the northwest corner, while large lawns and planted <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> provide a counterpoint to the adjacent active program at Piers 5 and 6. The centralized flower meadow and perimeter plantings will introduce new ecologies to {{the southern end of}} the park and the large lawn <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> provide space for park programs and events. The Pier 6 viewing platform is designed by Bjarke Ingels Group and its construction is contingent on funding. The plan provides a shaded area for visitors and space for events and programs.|$|E
25|$|Central {{estimates}} {{produced by}} the Met Office predict average annual temperature to increase by 2°C (4°F) and the warmest summer day to increase by 3°C (6°F) by the 2050s.

25|$|Pricing to RSPs is uniform {{within each}} of the {{technologies}} regardless of where the service is delivered and across the technologies for the basic package.
