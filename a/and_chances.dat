5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{sideline}} 4...g5, {{the main line}} continues with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns {{in return for a}} material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire the bishop pair. After 6.Nbd2Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage <b>and</b> <b>chances</b> for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may end up with the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all. The maverick gambit 6...f6 also exists.|$|E

25|$|Looking {{for a much}} {{improved}} performance after their last home game, the midweek game versus Manchester City provided the response that both fans and manager were looking for.

Afonso Alves made it two goals in two games after converting a penalty – Boro's 6000th league goal.

25|$|At {{the debate}} at Freeport Lincoln forced Douglas {{to choose between}} two options, either of which would damage Douglas' {{popularity}} <b>and</b> <b>chances</b> of getting reelected. Lincoln asked Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision. Douglas responded {{that the people of}} a territory could keep slavery out even though the Supreme Court said that the federal government had no authority to exclude slavery, simply by refusing to pass a slave code and other legislation needed to protect slavery. Douglas alienated Southerners with this Freeport Doctrine, which damaged his chances of winning the Presidency in 1860. As a result, Southern politicians would use their demand for a slave code for territories such as Kansas to drive a wedge between the Northern and Southern wings of the Democratic Party. In splitting what was the majority political party in 1858 (the Democratic Party), Southerners guaranteed the election of Lincoln, the nominee of the newly formed Republican Party, in 1860.|$|E

25|$|There were {{generally}} two approaches to metering losses. The first was attritional - operations {{were conducted to}} inflict maximum losses on ARVN/US forces. This meant expending lives and resources in attacks (ambushes, raids etc.) or in defensive operations (digging in to fight, bleeding opponents and then withdrawing when enemy forces grew too strong). Attacks were scaled up or down depending on a myriad of factors including the political situation in a particular area. The second approach was avoidance of battle unless numerical superiority <b>and</b> <b>chances</b> of success were good. In the Vietnam War, most Communist units (including mobile NVA regulars using guerrilla tactics) spent {{only a limited number}} of days a year fighting. While they might be forced into an unwanted battle by an ARVN/US action, most of the time was spent in population control, training, intelligence gathering, propaganda indoctrination or construction of fortifications, with Communist troops typically only fighting an average of 1 day in 30. In essence, the VC/NVA largely fought on the ground only when they wanted to fight.|$|E
25|$|Missed {{opportunity}} with Lindbergh In late 1926, an enterprising Charles Lindbergh {{had convinced}} Earl Thompson, and Major Albert Bond Lambert to back him on {{an attempt to}} win the $25,000 Orteig Prize for a non-stop transatlantic flight. He specifically wanted a single pilot, and a single engine to reduce weight <b>and</b> <b>chances</b> of failure. The ideal plane was the Wright-Bellanca WB-2. Lindbergh set out by train to New York in a new suit to look professional for a face-to-face meeting with Columbia Aircraft to buy the only WB-2. In the meeting, Levine said the aircraft was worth $25,000, but would discount it to $15,000 due to the free publicity that would be made from the flight, well above the approximate $10,000 price that had been anticipated by Lindbergh and his backers. Lindbergh returned to St. Louis, and had a check signed to him personally for $15,000 and a request to name the WB-2 The Spirit of St. Louis. Lindbergh {{said he would have}} the plane back in St. Louis in a week.|$|E
25|$|The Saints lost 3–0 to {{struggling}} Crystal Palace {{in their}} first game of December, dropping down {{a place in the}} league table as a result. Christian Benteke opened the scoring for the home side in the 33rd minute after a poor clearance from Fraser Forster, before James Tomkins double Palace's lead just a few minutes later from close range. The visitors enjoyed the majority of possession <b>and</b> <b>chances</b> on goal, but Benteke struck again late on to secure the victory. The following week, Southampton picked up a 1–0 win over Middlesbrough at St Mary's Stadium to move up to tenth in the league table. After a first half of relatively few chances, Sofiane Boufal broke the deadlock shortly after the break with his first Premier League goal, striking from around 25 yards out. On 14 December, Southampton and Stoke City drew 0–0 at the bet365 Stadium. The hosts were reduced to ten men early on when Marko Arnautović was sent off for a high-footed challenge, but the visitors failed to take advantage and break the deadlock. Jay Rodriguez came closest to score, but missed from close range, while a shot from James Ward-Prowse was cleared off the line later on.|$|E

25|$|Southampton {{travelled}} to the Stadium of Light {{for their}} penultimate {{game of the}} season, facing a Sunderland side just one point and one place below them in the bottom quadrant of the league table. Once again the Saints dominated early possession <b>and</b> <b>chances,</b> although they lacked an end product with Rickie Lambert often found offside and surrounding players in poor form in the opposition half; it took until 27 minute for Sunderland to have the first actual chance of the game, which ended with a harmless shot at Artur Boruc. Into the second half the game continued on level terms, with Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet performing well against the attacks of the visitors, {{and it was the}} home side who took advantage on 68 minutes when full-back Phil Bardsley made a run into the Southampton half and drove a shot in from outside the box. The Saints responded quickly however, as both substitute midfielders James Ward-Prowse and Jason Puncheon linked up well to equalise for Pochettino's side eight minutes later. Lambert had a chance to win it for the visitors, but in the end the game finished 1–1 which meant Southampton were almost entirely safe in the Premier League, but for an unlikely run of results in the final matches of the season.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November, Southampton lost 2–1 at the {{struggling}} Hull City. The Saints went a goal up within six minutes, when Charlie Austin scored a penalty awarded for a foul by Curtis Davies. The visitors continued to dominate {{throughout the rest}} of the first half and into the second, although the hosts equalised through Robert Snodgrass in the 61st minute. Within two minutes, Hull went 2–1 through Michael Dawson, holding on for an unlikely win. On 19 November, the club returned from another international break to face Liverpool at St Mary's, which ended in a goalless draw. Former Saints winger Sadio Mané came close to opening the scoring for the visitors twice in the first half, before Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Nathaniel Clyne also missed good chances later on, with the home side's defence playing strongly to keep Liverpool out. The following week, Southampton beat Everton (managed by former Saints boss Ronald Koeman) by a single early goal to return to tenth in the league table. Charlie Austin scored in the first minute to put the hosts ahead, converting a cross from debutant Josh Sims. Southampton continued to dominate possession <b>and</b> <b>chances</b> on goal throughout the match, with James Ward-Prowse coming closest to doubling his side's lead in the second half.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week, the Saints lost 3–0 to Manchester City at home. After a goalless first half, {{the visitors}} opened the scoring ten {{minutes after the}} half-time break when Vincent Kompany headed in a corner from David Silva. City continued to enjoy the majority of possession <b>and</b> <b>chances</b> on goal, with Leroy Sané doubling their lead in the 77th minute, before Sergio Agüero scored a third three minutes later to secure the win. Southampton managed just one chance on target in the whole game – a Maya Yoshida header in the second half. The club lost again the following week to league leaders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, who beat the Saints 4–2. Eden Hazard opened the scoring for the hosts within five minutes, before Oriol Romeu scored his first goal of the season to bring Southampton level. Gary Cahill scored on the stroke of half-time, before Diego Costa doubled Chelsea's lead ten minutes after the break. Costa scored again in the penultimate minute of normal time, before Ryan Bertrand scored a second consolation for the visitors just {{before the end of}} the game. The club were held to a goalless draw against Hull City later in the week. The game saw very few chances for either side, with only three shots on target in the 90 minutes. Kamil Grosicki almost scored for the visitors early on with a sixth-minute free kick that hit the post, while Southampton's closest effort came in stoppage time at the end of the game, when Dušan Tadić saw a penalty saved by Eldin Jakupović to keep the Tigers fighting for Premier League safety.|$|E

25|$|Despite some {{legislation}} passed in 1985 to ensure equality, both the Equal Opportunity Law, which prohibits discrimination, and the Child-Care Leave Law, which gives parents unpaid leave {{to tend to}} children, then return to their old position or a similar one, lacked any real power to drive change. No penalties were issued for companies who ignored this, meaning, only women who take on the same burden as male employees, of working full-time, with no breaks for pregnancy or child rearing, are able to have any hope of advancement. Boards of directors, public servants, and judiciary branches of work are typically closed to any career woman not willing to work full-time and overtime regularly. The largest part {{of the labor force}} are not the full-time career women, but housewives who work part-time, supplementing the household budget. In fact, the government discourages housewives from making too much money, because if housewives make a certain amount, they lose their husband's dependent allowance. This limits the jobs women can do while married. In many instances of the Japanese work force, women who wish to receive equal pay <b>and</b> <b>chances</b> at promotion are expected to act like their salaryman counterparts. This is indicative of one of the problems women face when seeking employment in Japan. While equal in part, they still face discrimination. Many businesses lack the flexibility to offer work which fits the irregular schedules of housewives. There have been some strides forward however. The equal employment legislation of the 1980s did prohibit discrimination in the training, benefits, retirement, and dismissal, however, not in recruitment, hiring, or promotion.|$|E
