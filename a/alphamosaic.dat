5000|$|<b>Alphamosaic</b> Ltd was a UK {{semiconductor}} company specialising in {{low power}} mobile multimedia processors, {{based on their}} VideoCore architecture. <b>Alphamosaic</b> was spun out of its parent company, Cambridge Consultants, by Robert Swann and Steve Barlow in 2000.|$|E

50|$|VideoCore is a {{low-power}} {{mobile multimedia}} processor originally developed by <b>Alphamosaic</b> Ltd and {{now owned by}} Broadcom. Its two-dimensional DSP architecture makes it flexible and efficient enough to decode (as well as encode) a number of multimedia codecs in software while maintaining low power usage. The semiconductor intellectual property core (SIP core) has been found so far only on Broadcom SoCs.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{although}} Cambridge foreign acquisitions still {{occur as}} noted with Cambridge Consultants Ltd’s (CCL) acquisition of US firm Synapse, but such acquisitions became 20 % dearer directly after the Brexit plebiscite (with assets 20 % cheaper to outsiders). Until then {{this was part}} of CCL’s strategy to evolve a track record of creating high-value organisations built around disruptive technology, an exemplar of “thin” globalisation. Thus four of Cambridge’s $ 15 billion capitalisation firms - Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR), Xaar, Vectura and Domino Printing Sciences - were among those spun off by CCL. Other spin-offs include <b>Alphamosaic</b> and Inca, who were subsequently acquired by Broadcom for $ 123  m and Japan’s Dainippon Screen for $ 60  m. With the expansion of its US presence, CCL would also be bringing its venturing activity to the extensively “financialized” US capital markets. Now there is greater uncertainty about basic and applied research funding that hitherto came to Cambridge research from programmes such as Horizon 2020. The UK government has given some reassurance that substitution of such funding will occur short-term, but the final arrangement awaits the results of Brexit negotiations. By contrast as shown, long-term uncertainty is in part insured against by the issuing of Cambridge University bonds that are currently available for purchase by the UK central bank’s quantitative easing policy, as long as it lasts. With inflation on the rise in 2017 monetary policy will remain constrained and interest rates straining but likely to be kept at historic lows during the UK’s “resilience-free” economic era, likely to last 10 years or more since the 2007 – 8 global financial crisis.|$|E
