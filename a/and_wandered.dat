5|$|Ricketts and {{the other}} {{settlers}} living in the area {{were not aware of}} the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two of the Ricketts' guests who went fishing <b>and</b> <b>wandered</b> down Kitchen Creek.

50|$|Blue tangs {{experience}} {{three different}} social modes: territorial, schooling, <b>and</b> <b>wandering.</b> Blue tangs in non-territorial modes form schools <b>and</b> <b>wander,</b> while territorial blue tangs do not. Territoriality reduces {{competition for food}} resources because one individual claims both a territory and its resources. Additionally, schooling allows fish to better overcome food defense by others, <b>and</b> <b>wandering</b> allows for individual movement to feeding areas, cleaning stations, and other resources. Social behaviors are affected by outside conditions such as damselfish density, conspecific population density, and life history stage.|$|R

Leaving without a guide they soon got lost, <b>and</b> <b>wandered</b> in the hills for almost two days. On the third day they sent a detachment of Lascarins to find {{the way back to}} the camp.

25|$|Now the Kandyans {{concentrated}} {{their attack}} on the middle column. After heavy fighting they were repulsed, but this took some time during which the middle column became separated from the vanguard, who were continuing their running battle. In the confusion the elephants carrying Dona Catarina and other valuables, including the ammunition reserves, left the column <b>and</b> <b>wandered</b> into the forest. Meanwhile the advance guard, now proceeding without a guide, took a wrong turn and stumbled into a marshy field. Here the Kandyans surrounded and overwhelmed them. Following them in, the second column mounted a better resistance, managing to hold out for three hours, but they were eventually annihilated after their captains Henrique Pinto and Diogo Borges were killed.|$|E

A few photos show that they were possibly near a river or a ravine. Some show a twig with plastic bags and candy wrappers {{on top of a}} rock, another shows what looks like toilet paper and a mirror on another rock, and another shows the back of Kremers's head with what looks like blood by her temple.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, Ord was a {{military}} aide {{on the staff of}} the governor of Arizona. He was also a liaison with Army unit that included his former regiment. He saw service on the Mexican border due to the rise of tension along the border following the Battle of Agua Prieta. This was where Pancho Villa sustained his greatest defeat and his units were disorganized <b>and</b> <b>wandered</b> around northern Mexico foraging for supplies. Desperate for food and fresh horses, Pancho Villa camped his army of an estimated 500 horsemen outside of Columbus, New Mexico on the Mexican side of the border in March 1916. On March 9, 1916, he invaded the United States for supplies and arms which resulted in the Battle of Columbus. Ord had been given the rank of Major and served Arizona well in organizing and arming militia units. No major raids across the border took place in Arizona.|$|E
