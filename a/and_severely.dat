5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and as rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These rankings are due to its small <b>and</b> <b>severely</b> fragmented distribution, and the ongoing degradation of its habitat. Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, the drift of aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. Studies have shown it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Departing Bermuda, Gonzalo {{accelerated}} {{toward the}} waters of the North Atlantic, passing close to southeastern Newfoundland before becoming extratropical on October 19. Gusty winds and bands of heavy rain in the southeastern Avalon Peninsula engendered minor flooding and power outages. A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the British Isles and central Europe on October 21, killing three people in the United Kingdom <b>and</b> <b>severely</b> hindering transportation. The system later played a role in triggering torrential rains over the Balkans, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Preckwinkle {{decided to}} paint over two 36-year-old, unmaintained <b>and</b> <b>severely</b> damaged public murals in the 47th Street Metra underpass. The murals {{had been created}} by {{graffiti}} artists, working with permission from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, and had represented themes that included Latin-American, African, Mayan, Indian, and Native American spiritual practices. The walls were later covered with newly commissioned murals: one {{is made up of}} a series of ceramic tiles and the other is a traditional painted mural featuring the city and important historical South Side figures, including former Alderman Dorothy Tillman.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to propel while rowed. A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective weapon against galleys, matching their forward firepower <b>and</b> <b>severely</b> outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E

5|$|Rain started falling {{again and}} heavy fog {{closed in on}} the {{mountain}} top <b>and</b> <b>severely</b> reduced visibility there. Again the North Koreans attacked the 2nd Platoon and the adjacent E Company infantrymen. One of the engineers was shot through the neck and Vandygriff {{sent him to the}} company command post, only to have the man return to report that there was no longer a command post, that he could not find anyone and had seen only North Korean dead. Vandygriff now went to the noncommissioned officer who was in command of the E Company platoon and inform him. The two decided to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home from}} Belgrade on 6 February, the {{aeroplane}} carrying Edwards {{and his team}} mates crashed on takeoff after a refuelling stop in Munich, Germany. Seven players and 14 other passengers died at the scene, and Edwards {{was taken to the}} Rechts der Isar Hospital with multiple leg fractures, fractured ribs <b>and</b> <b>severely</b> damaged kidneys.

5|$|The 27-year war can {{be divided}} roughly into three periods of major {{fighting}} – from 1975 to 1991, 1992 to 1994, and from 1998 to 2002 – broken up by fragile periods of peace. By the time the MPLA finally achieved victory in 2002, more than 500,000 people had died and over one million had been internally displaced. The war devastated Angola's infrastructure, <b>and</b> <b>severely</b> damaged the nation's public administration, economic enterprises, and religious institutions.|$|E
5|$|The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{failed to}} issue {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches 24hours in advance. Despite {{the lack of}} early warning, only six deaths ensued.
