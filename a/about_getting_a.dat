Though the Government claimed that the program improved indigenous school attendance, it was heavily criticised by indigenous spokespeople and academics for being excessively punitive rather than implementing other policies that have been far more effective in improving school attendance, such as reinstating bilingual learning. Furthermore, the Government was criticised for being deceptive <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> mandate for this from consultation with indigenous leaders.|$|E

In episode 3, Sam is the key player in an elaborate con of Dahlia's to get the Malloy children into Rosemere Academy.

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed January 10, 2011) Includes bibliographical references. Purpose: To examine the {{relationship}} of demographics, sexual behaviors, and vaccine attitudes with {{the acceptance of the}} human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine or the intent to self-vaccinate. Methods: New clients (n = 1325) attending the San Diego County Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinic were recruited to participate in a study of self-acceptance for the administration of a vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV). Participants were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire about attitudes toward vaccines, health history, sexual behaviors, knowledge about HPV and HPV vaccinations, and socio-demographic information. Results: Approximately fifty five percent of clients indicated that they would be interested in <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> HPV vaccine; <b>about</b> sixteen percent indicated that they were against it, and roughly thirty percent were uncertain about it. In a multivariable polychotomous logistic regression model, when comparing individuals who answered unsure <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> HPV vaccine to those who said yes, those individuals who had no knowledge about HPV were more unsure <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> HPV vaccine compared to those with a lot of knowledge, when comparing those who stated that they were unwilling to <b>get</b> <b>an</b> HPV vaccine to those that were willing, those who had never had genital warts were more against <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> HPV vaccine compared to those who had a genital warts infection, and after comparing individuals who responded that they were uncertain <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> HPV vaccine, those who had insurance were more unsure <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> HPV vaccine compared to those who were uninsured. Conclusions: New clients at the San Diego County Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinic decisions regarding the HPV vaccine were influenced by their amount of knowledge about HPV, whether they had ever had a genital wart infection, and their insurance coverage status. Their decisions were not related to their age, education, type of sexual partners, race, having a past or current sexual partner tell them they had genital warts, number of lifetime sexual partners, employment status, or income level...|$|R

Hebel could not find a Basel publisher willing to produce the book in Alemannic, and the collection was only published in 1803 by Philip Macklot in Karlsruhe, after Hebel and his friends managed to collect enough advance subscriptions.
