Lamkahouan of the Houston Chronicle said in 2007 that [...] "prices have {{remained}} reasonable" [...] because Southcrest is {{south of the}} 610 Loop. In 2006 20 homes sold in Southcrest. Of them, 20% were foreclosures. Matt Swift, owner of Swift & Co.

50|$|Constant capital {{includes}} the outlay {{of money on}} (1) fixed assets, i.e. plant, machinery, land and buildings, (2) raw materials and <b>ancillary</b> operating <b>expenses</b> (including external services purchased), and (3) certain faux frais of production (incidental expenses). Variable capital by contrast refers to the capital outlay on labour costs insofar as they represent workers' earnings.|$|R

This is roughly equal to intermediate consumption. Finer distinction include raw materials, intermediate goods, inventories, <b>ancillary</b> operating <b>expenses</b> and (working capital). It is contrasted with fixed capital. The term was used in more specialized ways by classical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx.|$|R
40|$|This study compares nonprofit, government, and forprofit {{hospitals}} in South Florida. Property rights arrangement {{is defined as}} rights to residual profits in the forprofit hospitals, and the tax-exemption status {{on the part of}} nonprofit and government hospitals with obligations to serve charitable purposes in the public interest. This dissertation derives and tests implications about differences in behavior in the context of efficiency, equity, and quality of care delivered in nonprofit, government, and forprofit hospitals. Fifty-six hospitals with Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH) accreditation were compared on institutional variables (bed size, location 3 ̆e; efficiency variables (occupancy rates, <b>ancillary</b> <b>expenses,</b> bad debts, manhours per patient day, salaries per FTE, length of stay/DRG, charges/DRG, reimbursement/ORB (on twenty DRGs); equity variables (Medicare days, Medicaid days, and uncompensated care); and finally, the quality variable (death rates/DRS on twenty DRGs). The immediate effects of profit maximization is considered as an incentive for managers in the forprofit hospitals. The social obligations attached to the tax-exemption status can be argued as the underlying rationale far output maximization, i. e. maximizing benefits to society by serving more patients in the nonprofit and government hospitals. Using analysis of variance, nonprofit, government, and forprofit hospitals were compared to determine if statistically significant differences were present at the. 05 level of significance. Pairs of hospital types were tested for significant differences using ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and multiple regression analysis. The results provided mixed support for the property rights theory. Significant differences were found on institutional variables, bed size and location; efficiency variables, bad debts, manhours per patient day, and charges per DRG; equity variables Medicare days, Medicaid days, and uncompensated care. In terms of the quality variable, the death rates per DRG showed no statistical significance. Unexpectedly, nonprofit hospitals were very similar to forprofit hospitals on the variables bad debts and Medicaid days. The relevance of this finding to health policy issues today, particularly tax-exemption privileges, warrant a suggestion for further evaluation of the performance of the nonprofit sector...|$|E
40|$|It {{is almost}} as {{difficult}} to find individuals opposed to waterfowl conservation {{as it is to}} hear Americans speaking out against motherhood or corn on the cob. Yet, in a real sense, it has been the American tradition of unchecked population expansion, taming the wilderness, and converting prairies and marshes into cornfields that has nearly spelled disaster for some of our native waterfowl. Of a wetland area in the United States that originally covered some 127 million acres, nearly 50 million acres have already been drained and lost as waterfowl habitat. Marshes have not only been converted to farmland but also have provided land for expanding suburbs and have been covered with cement or asphalt for roads, airports, and the other hallmarks of modern civilization. All of this has been done in the hallowed name of progress, for the benefits of a greater gross national product, and in hopes of a higher collective standard of living. Unfortunately, waterfowl have had few spokesmen to decry their changing standards of living, and their gross national product can only be measured in terms of the numbers of birds that annually fly southward toward their wintering areas. These numbers, as reflected in annual harvests and changes in season lengths and bag limits, provide a measure of the health of our waterfowl resource. In recent decades that health index has often sagged alarmingly, and a few species have scarcely been able to recover from these setbacks. Some persons might well pose the questions: 2 ̆ 2 Just how important to our economy is a healthy waterfowl population? So what if one or two species might become extinct, aren 2 ̆ 7 t there plenty more to take their places? 2 ̆ 2 It is nothing if not traditional to measure the value of things in terms of dollars, the very lodestone of American values. Thus, there are the annual license fees and 2 ̆ 2 duck stamp 2 ̆ 2 costs paid by some two million hunters-and the costs of ammunition, gas, lodging, and expendable supplies that are used on every hunt. Then there are the depreciation costs on guns, clothes, vehicles, boats, decoys, and all the other special equipment on which the waterfowl hunter lavishes his care and dollars. Costs of raising and training hunting dogs, rental or lease costs for hunting areas, hunting club costs, and similar <b>ancillary</b> <b>expenses</b> all contribute to the overall economic impact of waterfowl hunting. The 1965 National Survey of Hunting and Fishing reported that the average American waterfowl hunter spends over fifty dollars per year on his sport. With more than two million waterfowl hunters in the United States and Canada, at least a hundred million dollars per year would be a minimum economic value of waterfowl hunting...|$|E
