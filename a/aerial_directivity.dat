40|$|The work is {{concerned}} with the restoration of the hydrolocation images at unknown characteristic of the directional aerial. The aim is to develop the theory and methods increasing the angular resolution of the scanning sonar (SS) and based on a posteriori echogram processing. The statistical analysis of the optimum system for restoration of the SS echogram in the conditions of a priori parametric uncertainty has been performed; the <b>aerial</b> <b>directivity</b> characteristic evaluation procedure has been developed. The device normalizing the dynamic range of SS echo-signals, methods evaluating the ideal echogram and realized as a software package which were approved at processing of the real echograms have been developed. The device normalizing the dynamic range of SS echo-signals, device restorating the hydrolocation image and also the application package are used. Application field: hydrolocation, problems of image restoration at unknown distortion operatorAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
