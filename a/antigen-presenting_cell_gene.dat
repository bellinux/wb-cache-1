The transcriptional coactivator class II transactivator (CIITA) controls MHCII expression. The CIITA gene is regulated by three independent promoters (pI, pIII, pIV). We have generated pIV knockout mice. These mice exhibit selective abrogation of interferon (IFN) -�– induced MHCII expression {{on a wide variety of}} non-bone marrow–derived cells, including endothelia, epithelia, astrocytes, and fibroblasts. Constitutive MHCII expression on cortical thymic epithelial cells, and thus positive selection of CD 4 � T cells, is also abolished.

40|$|Background & AimsCrigler–Najjar type 1 (CN-I) is an {{inherited}} liver disease {{caused by an}} absence of bilirubin–uridine 5 ′-diphosphate–glucuronosyltransferase (UGT 1 A 1) activity. It results in life-threatening levels of unconjugated bilirubin, and therapeutic options are limited. We used adult Gunn rats (an animal model of the disease) to evaluate the efficiency of lentiviral-based gene therapy to express UGT 1 A 1 in liver. Methods Gunn rats were given intraportal injections of VSVG-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors that encode UGT 1 A 1 {{under the control of}} a liver-specific transthyretin promoter (mTTR. hUGT 1 A 1); this vector does not contain target sequences for miR- 142, a microRNA that is expressed specifically in hematopoietic cells. Rats were also injected with the vector mTTR. hUGT 1 A 1. 142 T, which contains 4 copies of the miR- 142 target sequences; its messenger RNA should be degraded in <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cells.</b> Bilirubinemia was monitored, and the presence of transduced hepatocytes was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Vector expression was tested in vitro in rat hematopoietic cells. Results In Gunn rats, bilirubin levels normalized 2 weeks after administration of mTTR. hUGT 1 A 1. However, hyperbilirubinemia resumed 8 weeks after vector administration, concomitant with the induction of an immune response. In contrast, in rats injected with mTTR-UGT 1 A 1. 142 T, bilirubin levels normalized for up to 6 months and transduced cells were not eliminated. Conclusions Lentiviral vectors that express UGT 1 A 1 reduce hyperbilirubinemia in immunocompetent Gunn rats for at least 6 months. The immune response against virally expressed UGT 1 A 1 can be circumvented by inclusion of miR- 142 target sequences, which reduce vector expression in <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cells.</b> This lentiviral-based <b>gene</b> therapy approach might be developed to treat patients with CN-I...|$|R

40|$|The immune {{response}} to certain synthetic polypeptide antigens and native proteins {{has been shown}} to be controlled by {{immune response}} (Ir) genes, which reside in the murine major histoeompatibility complex (MHC) 1 (reviewed in 1).

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which cells rapidly polarize {{in the direction of}} external signals are not understood. Helper T cells, when contacted by an <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cell,</b> polarize their cytoskeletons toward the <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cell</b> within minutes. Here we show that, in T cells, the mammalian Ras-related GTPase CDC 42 (the homologue of yeast CDC 42, a protein involved in budding polarity) can regulate the polarization of both actin and microtubules toward <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cells</b> but is not involved in other T-cell signaling processes such as those which culminate in interleukin 2 production. Although T-cell polarization appears dispensable for signaling leading to interleukin 2 production, polarization may direct lymphokine secretion towards the correct <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cell</b> in a crowded cellular environment. Inhibitor experiments suggest that phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase is required for cytoskeletal polarization but that calcineurin activity, known to be important for other aspects of signaling, is not.

We compared the transcriptional profiles of immature and mature mouse Langerhans cells using the suppressive, subtractive hybridization method and identified a novel gene of unknown function, termed herein transmembrane protein 123 (Tmem 123), of which mRNA expression was enhanced in mature but not in immature Langerhans cells. Its expression was also enhanced in other mature DCs such as bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and splenic DCs. Interestingly, CD 40 expression was up-regulated on mature BMDCs cultured with colchicine concurrently with the enhanced expression of Tmem 123 compared with that of fresh BMDCs. Furthermore, the expression of CD 40 was enhanced on Tmem 123 -transfected DC 2. 4 cells, a mouse BMDC-derived cell line, compared with that on mock-transfected DC 2. 4 cells. This enhancement of CD 40 expression did not occur after deletion of lysosome/endosome targeting YXXφ motifs (where X is any amino acid and φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) in the Tmem 123 cytoplasmic tail. By stimulation with anti-CD 40 monoclonal antibody, these transfectants secreted an increased amount of IL- 12 / 23 p 40 compared with mock-transfected DC 2. 4 cells.

In this study, we have evaluated T, B, and <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cell</b> functions of malnourished mice fed a 4 % protein diet compared with litter-mate controls fed a 20 % protein diet. Spleen cells from malnourished mice presented both soluble foreign protein and allogeneic MHC antigens less efficiently than control mice. However, T cells from malnourished animals demonstrated effective or enhanced specific T-cell activation when stimulated with allogeneic cells, while B cells from protein-deprived animals responded normally in proliferative responses to T-cell driven cognate and non-cognate, as well as mitogen, stimulation. To assess further <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cell</b> function, three requirements for successful antigen presentation were evaluated. First, the proliferation of the IL- 1 -dependent cloned T-cell line D 10 demonstrated a slight deficiency in IL- 1 production by malnourished splenic <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cells,</b> {{and the addition of}} saturating amounts of IL- 1 to the assay could partially reconstitute function. Second, quantitative cell-sorter analysis revealed minimal deficiencies of spleen-cell Ia expression.

Dendritic cell immunoreceptor is a recently reported C-type lectin receptor characteristic with cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. Expression of mouse dendritic cell immunoreceptor mRNA was observed specifically in spleen and lymph node, slightly increased with dendritic cell maturation during in vitro culture of bone marrow cells, and was not detected in cultured natural killer cells. Surface expression of mouse dendritic cell immunoreceptor protein was observed in splenic <b>antigen-presenting</b> <b>cells</b> including B cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, but not in T cells.
