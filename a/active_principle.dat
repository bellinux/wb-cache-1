Ayurvedic scholars established fundamental rules for medicinal plant identification, collection and storage of drugs. According to Ayurveda, habitat an ecological factors have influence on pharmacological activity of plant based drugs. According to Ayurveda, habitat is known as desha. Plants growing in jangala desha, anoop desha, and are known as xerophytes, hydrophytes and mesophytes, respectively Season has impact on availability of <b>active</b> <b>principles</b> in medicinal plants. According to principles of Western Herbal Medicine, Therapeutic efficacy varies during different times or seasons of the year. The constituent and <b>active</b> <b>principles</b> vary quantitavely at different seasons of the year and the majority of plant materials are usually best collected during the dry season, when the herbs are at peak maturity and concentration.

Optimal compounds would be those that were stable at neutral pH but were quickly activated at low pH.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} salts of {{morphine}} are used, {{with the most}} common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, {{so it is not}} used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the United Kingdom and in Canada and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate, sulphate, and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other (especially older) opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the NSAID; multiple barbiturate salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the <b>active</b> <b>principle</b> of valerian. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production, more rarely sodium morphenate takes its place. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not {{to be confused with the}} current, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name), which also included the valerates of caffeine and cocaine, with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.|$|E
500|$|Robert Kilwardby (c. 1215–1279) {{discussed}} three alternative {{explanations of}} the motions of the celestial spheres, rejecting the views that celestial bodies are animated and are moved by their own spirits or souls, or that the celestial bodies are moved by angelic spirits, which govern and move them.

[...] Just as heavy bodies are naturally moved by their own weight, which is an intrinsic <b>active</b> <b>principle,</b> so the celestial bodies are naturally moved by a similar intrinsic principle. [...] Since the heavens are spherical, the only motion that could be natural to them is rotation.

500|$|Imagery {{found on}} prehistoric murals and rock {{paintings}} of modern-day Spain and Algeria suggests that human usage of psilocybin mushrooms predates recorded history. In Mesoamerica, the mushrooms {{had long been}} consumed in spiritual and divinatory ceremonies before Spanish chroniclers first documented their use in the 16th century. In a 1957 Life magazine article, American banker and ethnomycologist [...] described his experiences ingesting psilocybin-containing mushrooms during a traditional ceremony in Mexico, introducing the substance to popular culture. In 1959, the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann isolated the <b>active</b> <b>principle</b> psilocybin from the mushroom Psilocybe mexicana. Hofmann's employer Sandoz marketed and sold pure psilocybin to physicians and clinicians worldwide for use in psychedelic psychotherapy. Although the increasingly restrictive drug laws of the late 1960s curbed scientific research into the effects of psilocybin and other hallucinogens, its popularity as an entheogen (spirituality-enhancing agent) grew in the next decade, owing largely to the increased availability of {{information on how to}} cultivate psilocybin mushrooms.|$|E

One can see this symbol as a decorative element on Taoist organization flags and logos, temple floors, or stitched into clerical robes. According to Song dynasty sources, it originated around the 10th century CE. Previously, a tiger and a dragon had symbolized yin and yang.|$|E

In the European Pharmacopoeia the St. John’s wort monograph specifies the exact content of hypericin of the vegetable product (determined through the spectophotometric method), of 0. 08 g% total hypericin.

2500|$|By the 1890s, the {{profound}} effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, {{setting off a}} search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations {{for the development of}} new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897, John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the <b>active</b> <b>principle</b> as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis.

Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist).

2500|$|Race in {{a broader}} context is also {{addressed}} in The Mystery of the Sea, but to a much lesser extent than nationality. Smith connects the theme of race to the political context of the Spanish–American War, arguing that Americans constructed [...] "fantasies of conflict" [...] in order to transform the war into a [...] "moral crusade against the Spanish". In the popular imagination, Cubans were presented as white, while the Spanish were imagined as [...] "swarthy", adding a racial dimension to the fighting. This ideological (and inaccurate) racial construction was largely unsuccessful after American forces had actually gone into Cuba, but these ideas, namely judgment based on skin color, are important in The Mystery of the Sea. Stoker paints {{the character of the}} [...] "negro" [...] kidnapper as inherently depraved and inferior to the white men (Archibald even {{goes so far as to}} declare that he is [...] "the <b>active</b> <b>principle</b> of whatever evil might be"), and Archibald fears that this dark-skinned man is going to rape Marjory. Smith sees this man as a representation of the Cubans, a [...] "common enemy" [...] of both Catholic and Protestant forces as the Spanish–American War progressed. Archibald eventually murders this man while saving Marjory, exulting in the murder and soliloquizing at length about how a justified murder is an exhilarating deed. It is unclear whether this apparent justification stems from the fact that the potential assailant was black or from the crime he was about to commit, but Stoker nonetheless presents only a negative picture of people of African descent, and one that is in accord with the tensions of the time period.|$|E
