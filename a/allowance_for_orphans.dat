5000|$|Fabius {{advocated}} {{a new kind}} of French socialism, which accepted the market economy. In social policy, a law of December 1984 replaced <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>orphans</b> with a family support allowance, and empowered family allowance funds to aid in recovery of child support when a parent fails to pay. The allowable income for recipients of the young child allowance was increased (July 1984) for families with three or more children. The Fabius Government also sought to reduce penalties on families with working mothers by substantially increasing the income ceiling for dual-income families receiving the young child allowance. A parental education fund was created (1985), which provided for payments to each person who stops work or reduces hours of work {{as a result of the}} birth of any child beyond the first two, for which the parent(s) is/are responsible. In 1985, as a means of upholding the rights of homosexuals, the penal code was amended to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of [...] "moral habits" [...] which included sexual orientation.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} as prime minister, average living {{standards}} steadily rose while numerous social reforms were carried out. The 1956 Clean Air Act was passed during {{his time as}} Chancellor; his premiership saw the 1957 Housing Act, the 1960 Offices Act, the 1960 Noise Abatement Act, the Factories Act 1961, {{the introduction of a}} graduated pension scheme to provide an additional income to retirers, the establishment of a Child's Special <b>Allowance</b> <b>for</b> the <b>orphaned</b> children of divorced parents, and a reduction in the standard work week from 48 to 42 hours.|$|R
5000|$|The Tribe had a {{scholarship}} fund. By 1920, the fund paid out scholarships of $500 per {{year of college}} education. This practice continued into the 1970s, though the [...] "nature of the awards has changed". The society also operated a monthly <b>allowance</b> program <b>for</b> eligible <b>orphans</b> from birth to eighteen.|$|R
25|$|Ordinary {{income is}} a net income concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance. There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> disability, special tax <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s allowance, fishermen’s <b>allowance,</b> special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> self-employed within agriculture, special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> high expenses linked to illness, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> payments to individual pension schemes, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> travel between home and work, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> donations to voluntary organisations, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> paid union fees, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|R
50|$|After the American Civil War {{broke out}} in 1861, many soldiers' {{children}} were added to her care. Her <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the increased cost of living was brought up to $1.25 a week {{and in response to}} her appeal for such children, the State opened at Xenia, Ohio a home <b>for</b> soldiers' <b>orphans.</b> <b>For</b> 10 years, she successfully managed the home and cared for 101 needy children of Washington County. She faced problems of feeding and clothing so many, especially in war times, when prices went up and the attention of those who had helped her before was drawn away. There was also the issue of sickness when diphtheria and scarlet fever invaded the home.|$|R
25|$|Originally, Gmail, Google Docs and Picasa had {{separate}} <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> {{free storage}} and a shared <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> purchased storage. Between April 2012 and May 2013, Google Drive and Google+ Photos had a shared <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> both free and purchased storage, whereas Gmail had a separate 10 GB storage limit, which increased to 25 GB on {{the purchase of}} any storage plan.|$|R
5000|$|Medical <b>Allowance</b> <b>for</b> {{employees}} of Grade-1 to 15 increased by 100 percent. While the raise in medical <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> {{employees of}} Grade-16 to 22 is 15 {{percent of their}} basic pay.|$|R
50|$|Basic <b>Allowance</b> <b>for</b> Housing (BAH) is a United States {{military}} privilege {{given to}} many military members. It was previously called Basic <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> quarters (BAQ) and {{is administered by}} the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO).|$|R
30|$|In {{the pilot}} ETSs in China, a {{majority}} of <b>allowances</b> are allocated <b>for</b> free, with a relatively small portion being auctioned in Shenzhen and Guangdong. Grandfathering is applied to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> cogeneration units in Guangdong, and benchmarking is adopted to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> coal-fired and gas-fired units in Shanghai. As China has a steadily growing economy, a benchmarking method based on actual output (rather than historical output) is planned to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> generation companies in the national level ETS, in order to balance emission reduction and economic growth.|$|R

2500|$|The yield {{is usually}} quoted without making any <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> tax {{paid by the}} {{investor}} on the return, and is then known as [...] "gross redemption yield".

50|$|The rate {{at which}} patent {{applications}} are allowed can vary significantly from one technology to another. US patent applications {{in the field of}} electrical connectors, for example, get one <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> every two rejections. Business method patent applications, however, only get one <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> every 20 rejections.|$|R
30|$|Third, auctions {{should be}} {{introduced}} into the <b>allowance</b> allocation <b>for</b> takers. In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the allowance allocation. After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the allowance on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively. In the Guangdong industrial sectors, the enterprises must acquire a 3  % allowance through auction, and they can then activate a 97  % <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> free; for large public buildings, 100  % are allocated for free by benchmarking before the compliance period. At present, the government-allocated <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the enterprises is free in Beijing. However, the CET will eventually be completely adjusted by the market, {{as is the case}} for CET in the EU (European Union). Specifically, a certain level of auction, such as 3  %, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers; and a lesser amount for auction, which should be smaller than the proportion of auction in the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the givers; alternatively, 100  % can be free <b>for</b> the <b>allowance</b> of the givers.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the lack}} of evidence, a huge body of {{literature}} continues {{to suggest that there}} is a crisis of care for children who are orphaned by AIDS. Based on a study of Kopanong Municipality in Free State, this study investigated extended family care <b>for</b> <b>orphans</b> and other vulnerable children in the context of ubiquitous poverty and the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. It asked whether the application of current welfare policies recognises or facilitates extended family care <b>for</b> <b>orphans.</b> The care <b>for</b> <b>orphans</b> has been conceptualised in terms of {{the lack of}} adequate number of members of extended family who would provide care <b>for</b> <b>orphans</b> and the quality of care which orphans receive from their carers. To address questions of care <b>for</b> <b>orphans</b> and implications <b>for</b> welfare policies, this study employed both quantitative and qualitative research techniques to gather information on the prevalence of orphans, their living conditions, and types of care and support available, available welfare services and access thereto...|$|R
5000|$|Emissions allocation: Under the Clear Skies Act, {{emission}} allowances are to {{be allocated}} based on historical fuel consumption, what {{is often referred to}} as [...] "grandfathering". Under the Clean Air Planning Act, a grandfathering approach is used to allocate emission <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> SO2, but <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> NOx, mercury, and CO2, are allocated using an output-based scheme. Under this approach, referred to as a generation performance standard (GPS), generators are given <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> each unit of electricity they generate. The number of <b>allowances</b> allocated <b>for</b> each unit of generation changes each year as the total generation from covered sources changes. The use of a GPS dampens the electricity price impacts of the bill but raises overall compliance costs.|$|R
