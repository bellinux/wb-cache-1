The occurrence of such a burst was inferred from light signals detected by two Vela bhangmeters −2 min before the TIROS-N event. We found the precipitation to be unusually large but not unique. It probably resulted from passage of TIROS-N through the precipitating electrons above a pre-existing <b>auroral</b> <b>arc</b> that may have brightened to an unusually high intensity from natural causes −3 min before the Vela signals....We conclude that such an event, although rare, is not unique and, furthermore, that this particular event was associated with an <b>auroral</b> <b>arc</b> that probably existed before the Vela event. Although it may be argued that the segment of the arc sampled by the TIROS-N was intensified by a SNB, we find no evidence to support this thesis or to suggest that the observation was anything but the result of natural magnetospheric processes.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{works have}} dealt with the identification and evaluation of the physical processes that determine the characteristic scale sizes of discrete <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs.</b> It is broadly acknowledged that a characteristic spatial width of approximately 100 km (at ionospheric heights) results naturally from the ionospheric mapping of the high-altitude magnetospheric convection electric field. However, recent analysis of the spatial power spectral distributions of electric and magnetic field variations has revealed structure at much smaller spatial scales. In this analysis, precipitating auroral electron data from the J-package sensor on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite is used to study the spatial scale sizes and size distributions of polar <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs.</b> A monotonically decreasing inverse-wavelength spectrum with a slope near unity is common, with no strictly preferred scale sizes, although the scale spectrum does flatten at scales larger than approximately 100 to 200 km.

40|$|The {{altitude}} {{of the maximum}} luminosity of single, discrete <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs</b> was measured by photometric triangulation from two stations (College and Fort Yukon, Alaska) located 226 km apart on nearly the same magnetic meridian. The average height of the evening aurora decreases smoothly with increasing solar depression angle (sda) from 160 km near 12 &deg; sda to 100 km after 18 &deg; sda. The average height remains constant until around 12 &deg; sda in the morning. This diurnal variation {{is similar to that}} of the electron density in the F region of the ionosphere. Thus, the behavior is consistent with the concept that the mean auroral electron energy increases as the ionospheric conductivity decreases due to ionospheric recombination in the evening twilight. However, the mean electron energy decreases in magnitude at dawn when the solar ionizing radiation returns and the electron density in the F region increases. The magnetospheric acceleration mechanism associated with discrete <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs</b> thus appears to be inversely proportional to the ionospheric conductivity, because the time variation of the acceleration mechanism coincides with the local F region electron density and not with any obvious magnetospheric process. Previous auroral altitude observations, using similar triangulation methods, showed that the {{altitude of}} discrete <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs</b> increases as a function of latitude. When these data are corrected for the twilight effect, the dependence of altitude on latitude disappears. Thus, the average altitude of discrete <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs</b> and, by inference the magnetospheric auroral electron acceleration mechanism, is significantly influenced by the initial ionospheric conductance...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{three-dimensional}} {{computer simulations}} of the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling are performed to study self-excitation of auroral arcs with {{special emphasis on}} 1) nonlinear evolution of the feedback instability in the M-I coupling system, 2) controlling mechanisms of the <b>auroral</b> <b>arc</b> structure, 3) formation of a field-aligned electric potential structure {{in association with the}} development of the feedback instability, and 4) effects of the parallel potential generation on <b>auroral</b> <b>arc</b> development. As was already shown by Sato [1978] and Watanabe and Sato [1988], it is reconfirmed that the feedback instability produces a longitudinally elongated, latitudinally striated structure where the upward field-aligned current and the ionospheric density are locally enhanced. On top of this the present extended study reveals the following important new features : 1) The global distribution of the striation structure is primarily governed by the magnetospheric convection pattern and the ionospheric density distribution. 2) There appears a significant dawn-dusk asymmetry in the <b>auroral</b> <b>arc</b> formation, even though the apparent geometrical relationship is symmetric. This dawn-dusk asymmetry reflects the geometrical fact that the ionospheric Pedersen current closing the magnetospheric current is anti-symmetric with respect to the noon-midnight plane, while the self-closed Hall current is symmetric. 3) The recombination effect plays {{a significant role in the}} global, as well as local, development of the <b>auroral</b> <b>arc</b> structure. The nonlinearlty of recombination, in conjunction with the closure of an arc-associated local field-aligned current system, acts to destroy an old arc and creates a new arc in a different but adjacent position. This results in a peculiar behavior of <b>auroral</b> <b>arc</b> formation and deformation. 4) A V-shaped field aligned potential structure is created in association with an <b>auroral</b> <b>arc.</b> Rapid increase in the electron density and the local upward field-aligned current of an arc arises as a result of enhanced ionization by precipitating electrons accelerated by the parallel potential. 5) A drastic oscillatory behavior of appearance and disappearance of auroral arcs is obtained when the ionization effect is strong. The period is primarily given by the Alfven bounce time. ...|$|E

A reduction in the measured neutral temperature of about 100 K in the arc, relative to temperatures on either side, was found for all three arc crossings.

This can be explained by differences in the height of the emission region and in the propagation path of the hiss in the ionosphere : the high-frequency (～ 64 kHz) hiss is emitted at low altitudes of 1000 - 1500 km, its propagation path being limited to a narrow region near the location of the <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs,</b> while the low-frequency (～ 8 kHz) hiss is emitted at higher altitudes of 3000 - 3500 km, its propagation path spreading widely due to the refraction effect in the ionosphere...|$|R

30|$|The {{observations}} made by Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs), radars, and satellites {{have indicated}} that large vertical motion in the polar region is occasionally generated in the thermosphere associated with auroral activities. However, {{the behavior of the}} vertical wind is often very complicated, and the cause of the vertical wind has not been explained by auroral heating or by ion-neutral drag alone. It has been pointed out that a background horizontal flow is likely to significantly alter the dynamics of the neutral atmosphere near an <b>auroral</b> <b>arc.</b> Recent observations have also suggested that strong downward motion is generated in the vicinity of an <b>auroral</b> <b>arc.</b> To study the thermospheric dynamics near a local heating region embedded in a large-scale horizontal flow, a two-dimensional numerical simulation of the thermospheric dynamics has been performed. It is found that interaction of local heating and strong horizontal flow could {{play an important role in}} generating vertical motion near an <b>auroral</b> <b>arc.</b> The simulation results indicate that for a horizontal wind speed larger than about 300 m/s, a steady wave-like structure of the neutral wind is formed within and downstream of the heated region. For a horizontal wind speed less than about 300 m/s, on the other hand, no significant vertical motion is generated outside the heated region.

40|$|Three {{models for}} the magnetosphere-ionosphere {{coupling}} feedback instability are considered. The first model is based on demagnetization of hot ions in the plasma sheet. The instability {{takes place in the}} global magnetosphere-ionosphere system when magnetospheric electrons drift through a spatial gradient of hot magnetospheric ion population. Such a situation exists on the inner and outer edges of the plasma sheet where relatively cold magnetospheric electrons move earthward through a radial gradient of hot ions. This leads to the formation of field-aligned currents. The effect of upward field-aligned current on particle precipitation and the magnitude of ionospheric conductivity leads to the instability of this earthward convection and to its division into convection streams oriented at some angle with respect to the initial convection direction. The growth rate of the instability is maximum for structures with sizes less than the ion Larmor radius in the equatorial plane. This may lead to formation of <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs</b> with widths about 10 km. This instability explains many features of such arcs, including their conjugacy in opposite hemispheres. However, it cannot explain the very high growth rates of some <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs</b> and very narrow arcs. For such arcs another type of instability must be considered. In the other two models the instability arises because of the generation of Alfven waves from growing arc-like structures in the ionospheric conductivity. One model is based on the modulation of precipitating electrons by field-aligned currents of the upward moving Alfven wave. The other model takes into consideration the reflection of Alfven waves from a maximum in the Alfven velocity at an altitude of about 3000 km. The growth of structures in both models takes place when the ionization function associated with upward field-aligned current is shifted from the edges of enhanced conductivity structures toward their centers. Such a shift arises because the structures move at a velocity different from the E×B drift. Although both models may work, the growth rate for the model, based on the modulation of the precipitating accelerated electrons, is significantly larger than that of the model based on the Alfven wave reflection. This mechanism is suitable for generation of <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs</b> with widths of about 1 km and less. The growth rate of the instability can be as large as 1 s- 1 , and this mechanism enables us to justify the development of <b>auroral</b> <b>arcs</b> only in one ionosphere.
