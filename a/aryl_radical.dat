50|$|In {{a general}} scope a Meerwein arylation is any {{reaction}} between an <b>aryl</b> <b>radical</b> and an alkene. The initial intermediate is an aryl enthenyl radical which can react with many trapping reagents such as hydrogen or halogens or with those based on nitrogen or sulfur.|$|E
50|$|In one {{application}} the asymmetry in an atropisomer {{is transferred}} in a chemical {{reaction to a}} new stereocenter. The atropisomer is an iodoaryl compound synthesised starting from (S)-valine and exists as the (M,S) isomer and the (P,S) isomer. The interconversion barrier {{between the two is}} 24.3 kcal/mol (101.7 kJ/mol). The (M,S) isomer can be obtained exclusively from this mixture by recrystallisation from hexanes. The iodine group is homolytically removed to form an <b>aryl</b> <b>radical</b> by a tributyltin hydride/triethylboron/oxygen mixture as in the Barton-McCombie reaction. Although the hindered rotation is now removed in the <b>aryl</b> <b>radical,</b> the intramolecular reaction with the alkene is so much faster than is rotation of the carbon-nitrogen bond that the stereochemistry is preserved. In this way the (M,S) isomer yields the (S,S) dihydroindolone.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} a less common radical 1,2-shift {{can be found in}} the gas phase {{pyrolysis}} of certain polycyclic aromatic compounds. [...] The energy required in an <b>aryl</b> <b>radical</b> for the 1,2-shift can be high (up to 60 kcal/mol or 250 kJ/mol) but much less than that required for a proton abstraction to an aryne (82 kcal/mol or 340 kJ/mol). In alkene radicals proton abstraction to an alkyne is preferred.|$|E
50|$|An {{electron}}-withdrawing group (EWG) on the alkene {{makes it}} electron deficient {{and although the}} reaction mechanism is unclear, involvement of an <b>aryl</b> <b>radical</b> is presumed after loss of nitrogen in the diazonium salt followed by a free radical addition. In the primary reaction product the intermediate alkyl radical is then captured by the diazonium counterion X which is usually a halogen or a tetrafluoroborate. In a subsequent step an elimination reaction liberates HX (for instance hydrochloric acid) and an aryl vinyl compound is formed. The reaction mechanism from the arene's view ranks as a radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution.|$|E

This thesis describes the generation of <b>aryl</b> <b>radicals</b> and their application in organic synthesis, such as the direct arylation of heteroarenes, the synthesis of benzothiophenes, phenanthrenes and the amino arylation of alkenes using visible light photoredox catalysis.

5000|$|In {{the first}} step of the {{proposed}} reaction mechanism the acetyl groups in the iodine compound are replaced with the phenol. This complex dissociates into an <b>aryl</b> <b>radical</b> anion and a phenoxy residue. The two aryl radicals recombine forming a new carbon carbon covalent bond and subsequently lose two protons in a rearomatization step. The immediate reaction product is a diphenoquinone as result of a one-step 4-electron oxidation. It is nevertheless possible to synthesize the biphenol compound via a comproportionation of the quinone with xylenol already present. In this reaction sequence the hypervalent iodine reagent is eventually reduced to phenyliodine.|$|E
50|$|The {{nitrous acid}} is {{typically}} prepared in situ from sodium nitrite and acid. Following two protonation steps, one equivalent {{of water is}} lost to form the nitrosonium ion. The nitrosonium ion then acts as an electrophile in a reaction with an aromatic (or heterocyclic) amine, such as aniline, to form a diazonium salt, proceeding through a nitrosamine intermediate. The substitution of the aromatic diazo group with a halogen or pseudohalogen is initiated by a one-electron transfer mechanism catalyzed by copper(I) to form an <b>aryl</b> <b>radical</b> with loss of nitrogen gas. The substituted arene is formed through a radical mechanism with regeneration of the copper(I) catalyst. This reaction {{is known as the}} Sandmeyer reaction and {{is an example of a}} radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The radical mechanism of the Sandmeyer reaction was resolved through the detection of biaryl byproducts. It proceeds through the following mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reactions involving nitrile anions depend {{primarily on the}} nature of the electrophile involved. Simple alkylations take place by SN2 displacement and are subject to the usual stereoelectronic requirements of the process. Phase-transfer catalysis has been employed in alkylations of arylacetonitriles. Nitrile anions can also be involved in Michael-type additions to activated double bonds and vinylation reactions with a limited number of polarized, unhindered acetylene derivatives.Arylation of nitrile anions is also possible, and can take place through different mechanisms depending on the substrates and reaction conditions. Aryl halides lacking electron-withdrawing groups react through an addition-elimination mechanism involving benzyne intermediates. Aryl phosphates and ammoniums react through the SRN1 pathway, which involves the generation of an <b>aryl</b> <b>radical</b> anion, fragmentation, and bond formation with a nucleophile. Electron transfer to a second molecule of arene carries on the radical chain.Electron-poor aromatic compounds undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution in the presence of nitrile anions.|$|E

40|$|Based on simple {{ideas of}} electron-rich alkenes, {{exemplified}} by tetrakis(dimethylamino) ethene, TDAE, and on additional driving force associated with aromatization, families of very powerful neutral organic super-electron-donors (SEDs) have been developed.

Reduction to <b>aryl</b> <b>radicals</b> allows the initiation of very efficient transition-metal-free coupling of haloarenes to arenes. The donors also reduce alkyl halides, arenesulfonamides, triflates, and triflamdes, Weinreb amides, and acyloin derivatives.

They reduce unactivated benzenes to the corresponding radical anions and display original selectivities in preferentially reducing benzenes over malonates or cyanoacetates.

A competitive cyclisation of an <b>aryl</b> <b>radical</b> to one of two alkyl chains containing olefins ofdiffering electron density was undertaken to determine <b>aryl</b> <b>radical</b> philicity.

A wide range of allyloxy aromatic compounds with different substituents on the two olefins was synthesised. In the course of the required multi-step synthesis many previously unreported compounds were isolated and fully characterised, including crystal X-ray diffraction studies where crystals were obtained. To investigate the effects of different electron density in the aryl ring a further range of competitive cyclisation precursors were synthesised with an ester group para to the site where the <b>aryl</b> <b>radical</b> is formed. Studies into the synthesis of a competitive cyclisation precursor with olefin bearing side chains with no heteroatom were also undertaken. The procedure for the cyclisation reactions and subsequent work-up was optimised under both conventional and microwave methodology.
