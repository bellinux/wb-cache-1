His project was an international first: combining fiduciary security traditions with microprocessing procedures on the worldâ€™s first identity and voter registration smart card, on behalf of the Paraguayan State. Several other similar projects immediately followed in East Africa and in the Gulf.In January 1994, Pierre Delval was appointed by the Iraqi Government to examine the possibility of creating a national official government printing works, capable of halting the wave of forgeries affecting the State in provenance from Asia Minor. Iraq was under international embargo and certain States were attempting to destabilise the Ba'athist economy, which had already been weakened by the long war against Iran and the recent UN economic blockade. Pierre Delval thus spent seven years working in relation with Europe, Iraq and the UN, trying to find the technical, financial and political solutions necessary for putting an arsenal of <b>anti-forgery</b> <b>measures</b> in place in Baghdad, while respecting the conditions set by the UN Security Council.|$|E

Perkins, Fairman and Heath was later renamed, when his son-in-law, Joshua Butters Bacon, bought out Charles Heath and the company was then known as Perkins, Bacon. Perkins Bacon provided banknotes for many banks, and foreign countries with postage stamps. Stamp production started for the British government in 1840 with the 1d black and the 2d blue postage stamps,which incorporated an <b>anti-forgery</b> <b>measure</b> {{in the form of a}} complicated background produced by means of the rose engine.Their stamps were the first known preglued stamps.|$|R
