50|$|Jacome was an inventive and {{successful}} businessman, whose enterprises included a dye-works, a textile mill in Tomar, a paper mill in Elvas, and factories making felt hats in Elvas and Lisbon, {{the building for}} which still exists. The Tomar textile mill {{was the first in}} Portugal to use modern machinery, and created what was until recently the main industry of the town. The hats were made under a monopoly, though he criticises these in his Memoirs, saying that businessmen should be rewarded with titles instead. He traded in cloth, cognac, Bohemian window-glass, and other products. He invested in sea-salt making at Alcochete, near his country estate, and was also responsible for introducing the eucalyptus to Portugal (<b>a</b> rather <b>mixed</b> <b>blessing),</b> as well as the Araucaria ("monkey-puzzle tree"). His memoirs recount how he made designs for a type of water-pump new to Portugal from a Dutch print.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{many of the}} city's slums were demolished, and {{replaced}} with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats.

The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield's industries, along with those of many other areas of the UK. The building of the Meadowhall Centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>blessing,</b> creating much needed jobs but hastening the decline of the city centre.

40|$|The global {{imbalances}} {{of the last}} decade were, everyone now realizes, <b>a</b> decidedly <b>mixed</b> <b>blessing.</b> They enabled China and other emerging markets to export their way to higher incomes. They allowed their central banks to protect themselves from capital‐flow volatility by accumulating war chests of foreign reserves. They supported buoyant asset markets and rising consumption in the advanced economies despite what were, in many cases, slowly‐growing or stagnant real wages. By 2004 observers were characterizing this as a happy complementarity of interests – as a stable and socially‐desirable equilibrium that might run for another 10 or 20 years. 2 In hindsight we now know that the prospects were not so happy. 3 Capital inflows fed excesses in U. S. financial markets that ultimately destabilized banking systems and economies {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. 4 Those excesses bequeathed an overhang of debt and financial problems that now create the prospect of a decade of slow growth, or worse, across much of the advanced‐industrial world. Although the implications for emerging markets have been more positive, here too there are indications that what worked in the past won’t work in the future.

5000|$|In Republic of Ireland, clinics/surgeries are an {{even more}} {{important}} source of publicity and contact for Teachtaí Dála (TDs) and other representatives, as under the PR-STV system {{there are very few}} truly safe seats. One paper published by Queen's University Belfast's Institute of Irish Studies states [...] Clinics, for instance, appear to epitomize personalistic politics -- individuals are asking politicians for personal assistance, and, as they receive it, they become clients of the politician and vote accordingly. The evidence is otherwise. Voters make the rounds of all the politicians, trying to play one off against the other. Even if they are helped, there is no certainty that they will vote for the politician at the next election. Politicians are all well aware that clinics are <b>a</b> very <b>mixed</b> <b>blessing</b> indeed; the major reason given for holding clinics is their publicity value. It is important that voters in an area feel they are getting some attention from the politician; without it, they might decide to transfer their votes to a politician who demonstrates greater concern for the area. Thus, the clinics are part of the general strategy of maximizing a reputation in the local community, rather than a means of obtaining the support of specific individuals.|$|R
40|$|In this {{position}} paper, I argue that standardized tests for elementary science such as SAT or Regents tests {{are not very}} good benchmarks for measuring the progress of artificial intelligence systems in understanding basic science. The primary problem is that these tests are designed to test aspects of knowledge and ability that are challenging for people; the aspects that are challenging for AI systems are very different. In particular, standardized tests do not test knowledge that is obvious for people; none of this knowledge can be assumed in AI systems. Individual standardized tests also have specific features that are not necessarily appropriate for an AI benchmark. I analyze the Physics subject SAT in some detail and the New York State Regents Science test more briefly. I also argue that the apparent advantages offered by using standardized tests are mostly either minor or illusory. The one major real advantage is that the significance is easily explained to the public; but I argue that even this is <b>a</b> somewhat <b>mixed</b> <b>blessing.</b> I conclude by arguing that, first, more appropriate collections of exam style problems could be assembled, and second, that there are better kinds of benchmarks than exam-style problems. In an appendix I present a collection of sample exam-style problems that test kinds of knowledge missing from the standardized tests. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

25|$|A {{broad gauge}} {{ally of the}} South Wales Railway, the Vale of Neath Railway, ran from Neath over the {{watershed}} near Hirwain (now spelt Hirwaun) to Aberdare.

The groups involved will be infinite-dimensional in almost all cases – and not Lie groups – but the philosophy is the same. Of course this mostly speaks to the pedagogical influence of Klein.

A reviewer for Next Generation deemed it [...] "a definite improvement from last year's poor effort", citing the more solid player graphics, faster play, and tougher AI. He further remarked that while Sega's Prime Time NFL was still the best football video game in single player, Madden NFL '96 was the best two-player experience. He gave it four out of five stars.

[...] He also deemed the new Scouting Combine feature [...] "an excellent idea that could nonetheless use some tinkering." [...] However, he praised the rendered character sprites, the widened camera views, and the new moves, and gave the game a recommendation.

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} the line of Supreme Court Sixth Amendment jury right cases that began with McMillan v Pennsylvania in 1986, crescendoed in Blakely v Washington and United States v Booker in 2004 - 2005, and {{continues}} in cases such as Oregon v Ice, is a colossal judicial failure. First, the Court has failed to provide a logically coherent, constitutionally based answer to the fundamental question of what limits the Constitution places on the roles played by the institutional actors {{in the criminal justice}} system. It has failed to recognize that defining, adjudicating, and punishing crimes implicates both the Sixth Amendment Jury Clause and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clauses, and it has twisted the Jury Clause into an insoluble logical knot. Second, the practical effect of the Courts constitutional malpractice has been to paralyze the generally beneficial structured sentencing movement, with the result that promising avenues toward improved substantive and procedural sentencing justice have been blocked. Even the most widely applauded consequence of these cases, the transformation of the federal sentencing guidelines into an advisory system, proves on close inspection to be <b>a</b> decidedly <b>mixed</b> <b>blessing.</b> The Court has made the Constitution not a guide, but an obstacle, to a desirable distribution of authority among the criminal justice systems institutional actors. The Article provides a comprehensive analysis of all the opinions in the McMillan-Apprendi-Blakely-Booker-Ice line, considering both their constitutional reasoning and their practical impact on federal and state sentencing systems. It builds on a careful dissection of the defects in the Courts Sixth Amendment sentencing decisions to develop an alternative constitutional analysis that combines Sixth Amendment and due process principles to suggest a more intellectually coherent and practically desirable constitutional sentencing jurisprudence...|$|R

25|$|Seam bowlers {{can get a}} lot of {{help from}} certain types of pitches. Hard pitches that have a cracked or ridged surface are best for seam bowling since the {{hardness}} makes it easier to bounce the ball without losing speed while the uneven surface adds to the unpredictability of the bounce when the ball hits the pitch. This is known as variable bounce. On rare occasions, an extremely hard and uneven pitch is declared too dangerous to play on, since the batsman cannot predict the ball, and are likely to be hit as a result. Green pitches can also assist the seam bowler since the tiny tufts of grass represent an uneven surface although this is <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>blessing</b> since the green surface also slows the ball slightly. It is difficult for a seam bowler to be effective on a very flat and even-surfaced pitch (known as a flat track in cricket vernacular) and seamers usually resort to aggressive bowling tactics and/or bowling cutters on such surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion that}} Rognvald could {{hand over his}} Northern Isles estates to his brother has been {{interpreted}} in various ways. For example, {{it may be that}} he was aware of ongoing Viking raiding in the area and considered the gift from the king as <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>blessing.</b> This is also {{one of a number of}} instances in which the writer of the Orkneyinga saga attempts to reconcile the conflicting themes of independence from Norway (Rognvald gifts the islands to Sigurd) and dependence on royal authority (Harald formalises the process by confirming Sigurd as earl). Beuermann (2011) speculates that Rognvald's transfer of power to his brother may have been an attempt by the saga writers to imply that the Orkney earldom had more independence from Norway than that of Møre and that Rognvald's holdings in Caithness may have allowed for an even greater degree of freedom of action. Such implications are more likely to be rooted in the writer's interest in emphasising Orcadian independence at the time of writing rather than the 9th/10th century events they purport to describe.|$|E
25|$|The tourism {{has been}} <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>blessing</b> for the {{historic}} center as commercial establishments open, helping the economy, but also push residents out. In the historic center, {{there are over}} 860 retail businesses, mostly restaurants, about 200 of which were established {{in the last five}} years. Residents attribute the growth to Mexico City’s promotion of the area tourism in general as well as the opening of commercial centers in the borough. While the growing business helps the economy, resident groups fear that the area will lose its current character, as many businesses are opening in formerly residential buildings, with questionable legal basis. Currently, most of the borough, especially in historic center, is residential with older adults. Property prices are high, leading to sales not to new families but rather to larger commercial interests, squeezing out smaller businesses along with residents. Neighborhood groups have formed to confront the changes and preserve the historic value of the area. Another serious problem for the area is the traffic jams and serious lack of parking in the historic center. The quantity of cars and the lack of traffic patrols have meant the proliferation of “franeleros” or people who illegally take possession of public areas such as streets to charge for parking.|$|E

He proved correct; at the Salon, critics praised the draftsmanship, but some felt the portrait exemplified Ingres' weakness as a colourist. It was routinely faulted for its [...] "purplish tone"—which the ageing of the oil medium has transformed over time to warm greys and browns.

500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>blessing</b> to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade.
