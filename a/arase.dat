50|$|<b>Arase's</b> launch on the {{enhanced}} Epsilon's maiden flight was originally scheduled for 2015, but was postponed to the 2016 financial year due to satellite development delays.|$|R
30|$|After the deployment, {{the amount}} of {{photoelectron}} emissions from the sphere and the conductive part of the wire should be stable enough for good electric field measurements. Since <b>Arase’s</b> spin axis is set along the axis of the Sun with an angle of ~  15 ° (within 4 – 20 °), the photoelectron emission from the spacecraft and the WPT wire booms is relatively stable. Although the wire boom can obtain dynamical turbulence associated with the fast temperature changes by the eclipse and the spin-axis changes by magnetic torquer operations, we confirm from the dynamical changes in the spacecraft that the maximum excited oscillation of the wire boom is ~  0.2 ° at a frequency of ~  40  s. Currently, {{we do not see}} any problem caused by this dynamical variation in the spacecraft, both in electric and in magnetic fields. We do not expect larger dynamical turbulences till the end of this mission.|$|R

3000|$|WPT-Pre (AC) {{covers the}} {{frequency}} range from 10  Hz to 10  MHz. Its input is isolated from WPT-Pre (DC) by a 220 -pF capacitance and decouples the spacecraft potential with few V to few 10  s V and the spin modulation of the DC electric field with few mV/m to few 100  s mV/m (<b>Arase’s</b> spin rate: ~  1 / 8  Hz). The gain of WPT-Pre (AC) is set to ~  6  dB (high-gain mode) and compensates {{for the loss}} at the connection of WPT-S and WPT-Pre (AC). The capability to measure large whistler waves with intensities {{of more than a}} few tens of mV/m is provided by an input attenuator and a capacitance of 750  pF (low-gain mode). The attenuation level is decided in relation to the antenna impedance and this 750 -pF capacitance. If we assume the typical antenna impedance in vacuum, the expected attenuation level is ~ −  20  dB. Actually, the antenna impedance depends on the local plasma density and its temperature. The antenna impedance can be evaluated using the onboard antenna impedance measurement system, conducted by changing the calibration resistances (1 kΩ, 100 kΩ, 1 MΩ, and 10 MΩ) with the calibration signal from the EWO source clock (Kasahara et al. 2017; Matsuda et al. 2017). Since the low-gain mode can also affect the input impedance of WPT-Pre (DC), the gain and phase curve of WPT-Pre (DC) and EFD are also affected; this is shown in [...] "Electric Field Detector (EFD) in EWO (EFD-WFC-OFA)" [...] in section. (We have not yet used the low-gain mode as of August 2017). The output signal of WPT-Pre (AC) is fed to EWO-WFC/OFA (E), and HFA receives the signal through WFC/OFA (E).|$|R
30|$|Currently, we are {{establishing}} {{the removal of}} the Lorentz electric field based on the accurate spacecraft velocity and magnetic field vector. We are also conducting a detailed calibration of the spacecraft potentials and electric field taken by the four WPT sensors with the EFD receiver. The qualities of these parameters are affected by the antenna resistance or the effective length of the WPT-S antennas, determined by the balance among photoelectrons, ambient inflow electrons, and electrons fed as the bias current. The photoelectron emissivity and secondary electron yields of WPT-S’s sphere surfaces coated with TiAlN were originally be nonuniform before the launch. (No special cleanliness control was applied to the sphere surface.) They can be degraded after the launch, by a long exposure to atomic oxygen around periapsis and solar EUV emissions. We plan to evaluate the trend of the sphere surface characteristics, including our prelaunch evaluation results of the coating, and present it with the data of <b>Arase’s</b> 1 -year full operation, from April 2017 to March 2018. Antenna characteristics also vary with the ambient electron inflow, which depends on the ambient electron density and temperature and the injection of hot and energetic electrons. The following inter-instrument calibration is now being attempted: (1) spacecraft potential (PWE–EFD)—upper hybrid resonance frequency (PWE–HFA) for electron density calibration, (2) the ratio between electric field waveform (PWE–EFD) and magnetic field waveform (PWE–WFC-B + SCM or MGF) in the low-frequency electromagnetic waves for E/B calibration, (3) the DC electric field (PWE–EFD)—low-temperature particle velocity (LEP-i/e) for the electric field calibration (e.g., Kasaba et al. 2006) if the plasma velocity can be provided with enough quality, and (4) the evaluation of the possible effect from the plasma wakes created by the spacecraft motion (e.g., Miyake et al. 2015).|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} above, {{the basic}} geometry {{is similar to}} that of BepiColombo/MMO PWI/WPT-S. Each wire boom is composed of a 15 -m-long conductive wire and a 60 -mm-diameter sphere on its top. The conductive wire is made of stainless steel (SUS 316 L, diameter: 0.18  mm) and covered by a polyimide insulator (diameter: 0.43  mm) except a 0.7 -m-long top-side area, which is coated by Aerodag (a graphite paint). The sphere is an Al alloy (7075 -T 7351) shell with thickness of less than 1  mm attached to the tip of the conductive wire. In this configuration, the conductive top part, i.e., the 60 -mm-diameter sphere and the 0.7 -m-long conductive wire (its cross section: less than 5 % of the sphere’s), become the probe for contact with ambient plasma. Such surfaces are preferred to have uniform conductivity, photoelectron emissivity, and secondary photoelectron yield. The sphere surface, which has a much larger area than that of the conductive wire part, is coated with TiAlN with a Ti:Al ratio of 2 : 1 and thickness of ~  1  μm, as the spherical probe of MMO PWI WPT-S. As the prelaunch test, the nonuniformity of the photoelectron emissivity under the illumination of a deuterium lamp was evaluated using a vacuum chamber with the help of Prof. Kobayashi (Saitama University). In this study, the photoelectron emission from the vacuum ultraviolet light is observed using an electron emission microscope (EEM) (Suharyanto et al. 2006). The sputtered TiAlN and TiN surface exhibits a nonuniformity of 1.2 %, whereas the reference surface, which is a baked carbon coating (baked Aerodag) used in the Geotail PANT spheres, exhibits a nonuniformity of 2.0 %. The evaluation of the performance and degradation of TiAlN in space is one of the objectives for <b>Arase’s</b> WPT, as the pretest of BepiColombo’s WPT. The conductive part of the wire’s top-side area limits the influence of the surface potential of the insulated part on the top sphere. The remaining surface area, covered with polyimide, limits the coupling of the long conductive wire to ambient plasma. Inside of the deployment unit, the wire is covered with a copper-meshed shield (diameter: 0.61  mm).|$|R

40|$|La {{couverture}} de limon carbonaté (loess) présente dans les régions du nord est issue de la sédimentation éolienne qui s’est développée sous climat périglaciaire au cours du Pléistocène. La décarbonatation des loess, active depuis 16000 BP, est essentiellement liée au climat. Ce processus, dans le contexte d’enclos circulaires de l’âge du Bronze sur le site de Lauwin-Planque (Nord), a montré un grand intérêt. Nous exposons ici l’idée selon laquelle, dans une séquence sédimentaire suffisamment épaisse, la limite de décarbonatation conserve l’image de la topographie contemporaine de ce processus. Dans le cas d’occupations anthropiques, les structures et la présence de matière organique liées aux activités humaines sont potentiellement capables d’influencer la décarbonatation. Si les structures ont été utilisées assez longtemps, elles ont pu modifier la profondeur de décarbonatation (en négatif dans les structures en creux et en positif pour les élévations). Afin de découvrir des informations relatives aux élévations des enclos funéraires, une méthode de fouille spécifique a été développée. Elle permet d’enrichir notre connaissance de ces vestiges dans une région où ils ne sont pas conservés, apportant des données équivalentes à celles connues en Angleterre où ils le sont. The {{layer of}} carbonated silt (loess) found in Northern France {{is the result}} of wind sedimentation which developed during the periglacial climate of the Pleistocene. The decarbonatation of loess, active since 16, 000 BP, is mainly climate-related. This process, noticed on the circular enclosure from the Bronze Age at Lauwin-Planque (Nord) is extremely interesting. Fieldwork allowed the discovery of 10 funeral enclosures, one of them not yet excavated. Five of them are really close and could belong to a coherent group. Two others are not very far from the first group and the last two seem isolated. The enclosures are simple, from 19 to 34 m in diameter. The idea expressed here is that, in a thick enough sedimentary sequence, the limit of decarbonatation preserves the image of the topography, contemporary to that process. In the case of anthropic activity, the features and the presence of organic material related to human occupation could {{have an impact on the}} decarbonatation. If they lasted long enough, their implementation could have modified the level of decarbonatation (higher under a built-up feature and lower under dug-out features). In order to collect information on mounds associated with funeral enclosures, a specific excavation method has been developed. First, it is important to know the sedimentary context extremely well. The best solution is the presence of a specialist in the field at the beginning of the work to observe the nature of the ground. After that, all the features which appear on the surface inside and around the enclosure have to be studied, before test pits are placed regularly and all the material collected, with the data recorded in a classic manner. Then four trenches are dug in order to create a cross, in staggered rows from the centre of the circle to several metres outside it. These trenches have to reach the level under the limit of carbonated silt. Observation of the cross-sections provides information regarding potential mounds present inside or outside the enclosures. Finally, the whole enclosure is emptied. In Lauwin-Planque, the excavation allowed a modification of the level of decarbonatation to be observed under the circular Bronze Age enclosures. For enclosure 1, a central mound combined with an embankment is suggested. For enclosures 2 and 5, we can guess at a central mound (which is confirmed by the absence of decarbonatation under the central tomb in enclosure 2). There are two embankments, inside and outside the enclosure. The study of the third and the fourth enclosures showed the presence of a central mound inside and one embankment for the fourth. But these two enclosures do not have embankments outside. A central mound and an external embankment was observed for enclosure 6. The seventh was extremely levelled but the presence of an external embankment was seen. For the last one where observations were made, it is possible to confirm an embankment outside the enclosure and a probable mound inside but the whole area was levelled and a modern path passed through the monument. This entire method provides an opportunity to widen our knowledge of this type of feature by gathering data equivalent to those from Britain. The silt context is really important in collecting this information. The monumental aspect of these enclosures is brought to light by the presence of mounds and embankments. It is thus possible to consider the conception of funeral features in the Bronze Age. Leroy-Langelin Emmanuelle, Collette Olivier, Duvivier Hélène, Samuelian Clara.
