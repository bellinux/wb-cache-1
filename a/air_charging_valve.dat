As the key component of the full hydraulic braking system, {{the parameters of the}} accumulator <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> {{have a significant effect on}} the braking performance. In this article, the key parameters of the <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> are analyzed through the static theoretical and an Advanced Modeling Environment for performing Simulation of engineering systems (AMESim) simulation model of the dual-circuit accumulator <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> is established based on the real structure parameters first.

30|$|The three {{revolute}} joints of each {{hind leg}} use six pneumatic muscles in total, and each pneumatic muscle {{is controlled by}} two high-speed switch valves. Thus, the entire hind limb requires 12 pneumatic high-speed switch valves. We consider the hip joint as an example to explain the working principle of the pneumatic circuit. The body and the thigh crank are connected with a joint shaft. Each end of the crank is hinged to the muscles, and the other ends {{are connected to the}} body frame. During muscle contraction and stretching, the crank (fixed with the thigh frame) rotates relative to the body. To reach the initial position, the <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> 1 and discharging valve 2 are open, and the discharging <b>valve</b> 1 and <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> 2 are closed. The recovery muscle then starts to contract, and the driving muscle stretches until the joint rotates clockwise to the preset position (Figure  6). During the propulsive phase, the hip joint must rotate counterclockwise quickly, and thus the <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> 1 and discharging valve 2 are close, and <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> 1 and the discharging valve 2 are open. The recovery muscle of the hip joint then starts to stretch and the driving muscle contracts. The hip joint rotates counterclockwise quickly to a specific position.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{determined}} and compared urethral pressure measurements using <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and microtip catheters in a prospective, single-blind, randomized trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 64 women referred for urodynamic investigation underwent sequential urethral pressure measurements using an <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and a microtip catheter in randomized order. Patients were blinded {{to the type}} and sequence of catheter used. Agreement between the 2 catheter systems was assessed using the Bland and Altman 95 % limits of agreement method. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients of <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and microtip catheters for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest were 0. 97 and 0. 93, and for functional profile length they were 0. 9 and 0. 78, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficients and Lin's concordance coefficients of <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and microtip catheters were r = 0. 82 and rho = 0. 79 for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest, and r = 0. 73 and rho = 0. 7 for functional profile length, respectively. When applying the Bland and Altman method, <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> catheters gave higher readings than microtip catheters for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest (mean difference 7. 5 cm H(2) O) and functional profile length (mean difference 1. 8 mm). There were wide 95 % limits of agreement for differences in maximum urethral closure pressure at rest (- 24. 1 to 39 cm H(2) O) and functional profile length (- 7. 7 to 11. 3 mm). CONCLUSIONS: For urethral pressure measurement the <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> catheter {{is at least as}} reliable as the microtip catheter and it generally gives higher readings. However, <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and microtip catheters cannot be used interchangeably for clinical purposes because of insufficient agreement. Hence, clinicians should be aware that <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and microtip catheters may yield completely different results, and these differences should be acknowledged during clinical decision making...|$|R
25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: <b>Charging</b> <b>air</b> into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir <b>charging</b> <b>valve,</b> and the brake cylinder release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action, these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|R

40|$|Current {{emphasis}} on decreasing vehicle fuel consumption {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) emission from the automotive sector directs many research efforts towards two gasoline engine technologies, namely, the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines, and the downsized TurboCharged (TC) Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) engines with variable valve timing (VVT). In the HCCI category, many actuation strategies have been proposed with the more popular being the dual-fuel strategies and the high residual recycling. In this thesis, a heat recycling strategy is considered, specifically, a heated-air inlet HCCI engine with two intake throttles that control the cold and hot air streams. To facilitate the control analysis and development, a physics-based crank-angle resolved and a mean-value models are developed for feedback controller design. We discover that the combustion duration defined as the duration between the crank angle of 10 % and 90 % fuel burned, provides a universal set point for all speeds and loads for both combustion stability and fuel efficiency. Based on a novel allocation of two actuators, the hot and cold throttles, a feedback controller is designed and simulated to regulate the combustion duration at a desired value during load changes. In the category of the TC SIDI engines, we address the important problem of reducing the calibration complexity when these engines are intended to run on gasoline (E 0) and/or a blend of up to 85 % ethanol (E 85). Typically, there is variability in the optimal VVT and spark values for every blend of gasoline-ethanol. This variability burdens the calibration task for these engines with many degrees of freedom (throttle, VVT, wastegate, fuel injection timing and duration, and spark timing). We first address the transient coupling between throttle and VVT in controlling the <b>air</b> <b>charge.</b> A model-based <b>valve</b> compensator is designed to improve the transient behavior of cylinder charge and torque during tip-ins and tip-outs with the VVT system transitions from set-points.

Despite all these difficulties, this paper demonstrates that (i) the proposed scheme has better robustness to modelling errors because it provides a closed-loop observer design, and (ii) robust <b>air</b> <b>charge</b> estimation is achievable even without air flow sensors if good (fast) temperature sensors become available.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis details a novel engine evaluation approach utilising real-time simulation and advanced engine testing systems for general applicability to new generations of <b>air</b> <b>charging</b> systems. A novel engine <b>air</b> <b>charging</b> system including a <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> handling unit (CAHU) has been developed which is connected to an engine to emulate advanced boosting system conditions. Significant analytical and development work has focused on generating a real-time turbocharger model such that the CAHU can be effectively controlled to emulate the turbocharger performance under both steady and pulsating conditions. Experimental work was carried out to evaluate this new engine <b>air</b> <b>charge</b> testing system against a production turbocharged baseline engine. The accuracies {{with respect to the}} boost pressure, turbocharger speed, mass air flow, and fuel consumption in the steady state tests are above 95 %, and the level of confidence for the engine back pressure is approximately 90 %. The difference of turbocharger speed between the steady turbocharger model and the pulsation model is also identified. In engine transient tests, the boost pressure and engine torque have shown fast response characteristics {{similar to that of the}} baseline engine. While general transient trends were achieved, some issues were identified with the high speed control of the CAHU interacting with the dSPACE real time turbocharger model. It is proposed that future improvement can be achieved via applying new control algorithms to improve the accuracy and tracking the CAHU control without increasing the system instabilities.
