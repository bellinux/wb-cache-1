The comic, heavy-drinking Shah of Bratpuhr, an outsider to this dystopian corporate United States, is able to ask many questions that an insider would not think to ask, or would cause offense by doing so. For example, when taken to see the artificially intelligent supercomputer EPICAC, the Shah asks it [...] "what are people for?" [...] and receives no answer. Speaking for Vonnegut, he dismisses it as a [...] "false god". This type of <b>alien</b> <b>visitor</b> would recur throughout Vonnegut's literature.|$|E

50|$|So to recap. She-Hulk {{is just a}} sex power fantasy {{rather than}} a {{character}} with agency who from the beginning went down a different path than her cousin, The Hulk.

And God forbid superheroes embrace some goofiness and absurdity.|$|E
