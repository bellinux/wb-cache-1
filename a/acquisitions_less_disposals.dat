40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) conducts a quarterly survey to collect capital expenditure data for various industry groups by asset. It is a statutory survey with a stratified random sample of approximately 26, 000 to 32, 000 businesses selected from the Inter-Departmental Business Register, where the strata are defined by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2003 (SIC 2007 from Q 1 2010) and employment size of the business. The net capital expenditure (<b>acquisitions</b> <b>less</b> <b>disposals)</b> is calculated and is grossed to give estimates for the total population for the industry groups. The estimates are deflated and then chain-linked. Following deflation, chained volume measures and current price series are seasonally adjusted. Results from the survey provide essential information for the National Accounts and feed into the compilation of gross capital formation. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research. Move to Quarterly Acquisitions and Disposals of Capital Assets Survey From quarter 1 2015, the Quarterly Capital Expenditure Survey moved to a more detailed survey called the Quarterly Acquisitions and Disposals of Capital Assets Survey (QCAS). Data and documentation from this new survey will be available from the UK Data Archive Secure Access service under SN 7882. For the third edition (February 2016), all data and documentation has been updated and enhanced. In addition, data files for 2013 q 2 to 2014 q 4 have been added. Main Topics : The survey captures the value of capital assets bought and sold. This includes total acquisitions and disposals; acquisitions and disposals of land and existing buildings, vehicles, computer hardware, and other capital equipment; acquisitions only of new building work (excluding dwellings), or other (construction) work of a capital nature, and computer software. Exploration expenditure is also collected for Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 1110 level...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} so-called 'Feldstein-Horioka paradox' 3, {{according to which}} there exists a significant, close to unity relation between the magnitudes of gross domestic investment and gross domestic saving of an economy. Feldstein and Horioka (1980) 4 found such a close to unity relation for a sample of sixteen developed members of the OECD. Opposite to what common intuition would dictate, the 'FH paradox' as interpreted by FH themselves, seemed to be pointing towards a lack of international capital mobility, in a world thought of as utterly 'globalized', and hence receptive {{to any kind of}} goods and capital flows, especially in the era launched {{by the end of the}} 1973 oil crisis. Due exactly to its paradoxicality the FH finding triggered a long-lasting and vehement controversy, which has revolved around the implementation of ever more sophisticated econometric techniques, based on the conviction that only this way would a conundrum like the 'FH paradox' finally be resolved. This has also been the reason why we have attempted to structure this dissertation, around the axis of the various econometric methods used so far in the relative literature. In the empirical part of the dissertation, we also adopt many of the aforementioned econometric methods met in the literature, but our main contribution resides in our attempt to better define the variables involved in the initial FH specification from an accounting point of view. More specifically, regarding the saving part (right-hand side) of the classical FH regression equation, we use the balancing item of the 'Use of disposable income account' 5 of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) as a proxy for what FH (1980) had called gross domestic saving, deeming it as properly describing the purely domestic constituents of an economy's total saving. Regarding the investment part (left-hand side) of the classical FH regression equation however, we strongly question the extent to which the variable of gross domestic investment which FH (1980) used, really corresponds to an economy's actual gross domestic investment. In fact, FH's gross domestic investment has been the former name of the SNA magnitude of gross capital formation (GCF), which according to the 2008 SNA is ' [...] . measured by the total value of the gross fixed capital formation 6, changes in inventories and <b>acquisitions</b> <b>less</b> <b>disposals</b> of valuables'. Following our electronic correspondence with IMF's specialist on National Accounts and Balance of Payments issues Ms S. Matei 7, and given that actually, the majority of the more recent papers within the FH literature have used GFCF as a proxy for FH's variable of 'gross domestic investment', we are also focusing on GFCF in our analysis, instead of the (broader) magnitude of GCF, deeming it more representative of the purely productive part of an economy's domestic investment. However, based on the accounting definitions of both GCF and GFCF one can realize that numerous foreign capital elements might also be included in them 8. As a means of 'cleansing' GFCF from any foreign fixed capital assets incorporated in it, we propose instead the magnitude of modified gross fixed capital formation (MGFCF), which is derived by subtracting an economy's imports of fixed capital assets destined to GFCF from the economy's GFCF itself. In the empirical part of the dissertation, we use data for three economically developed countries of Northern Europe, namely Norway, Netherlands and Finland. Using various alternative model specifications, apart from the initial FH one, we find that the generally high values of the saving-investment relation must be attributed to the significant autocorrelation latent in them. Using our own variable MGFCF instead, the aforementioned autocorrelation is significantly reduced or even eliminated. Additionally, we use stationarity and cointegration tests for the variables involved under each one of the various FH model specifications tested. An overall conclusion of our tests, is that the degree of international capital mobility for the three countries of our sample is in fact bigger than the one which the 'FH paradox' would imply. Despite the general lack of data for imports of fixed capital assets from which necessarily suffers the approach we propose, promising perspectives for further research in the future can be discerned. ...|$|E

5000|$|Gross {{fixed capital}} {{formation}} (GFCF) is a macroeconomic concept used in official national accounts {{such as the}} United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA), National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) and the European System of Accounts (ESA). The concept {{dates back to the}} National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) studies of Simon Kuznets of capital formation in the 1930s, and standard measures for it were adopted in the 1950s. Statistically it measures the value of acquisitions of new or existing fixed assets by the business sector, governments and [...] "pure" [...] households (excluding their unincorporated enterprises) <b>less</b> <b>disposals</b> of fixed assets. GFCF is a component of the expenditure on gross domestic product (GDP), and thus shows something about how much of the new value added in the economy is invested rather than consumed.|$|R

Moreover, we find little evidence that interstate deregulation affected births, deaths, or marriages, except that the marriage rate rose after the implementation of the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act. Finally, pair-wise temporal causality tests among births, deaths, and marriages show that mergers temporally lead new charters and that failures lead mergers (a demonstration effect) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{post-acquisition}} {{cultural change}} following international acquisitions. Despite the acknowledged {{complexity of the}} cultural encounter in <b>acquisitions,</b> <b>less</b> is known about cultural change following acquisitions by global organizations where a tension between espoused vs. practiced cultures co-exists. Our study leads us to identify the drivers, outcomes and directions of post-acquisition cultural change amid such contexts. In contrast to a seemingly singular, monolithical perspective, we present post-acquisition cultural change as a dyadic, bipolar process, whereby acquired firms cohabit the space between espoused and practiced values. Reflecting the acquirer’s cultural regime, targets align with either the acquirer’s espoused or practiced culture. Further, whereas previous research parallels cultural change with explicit initiatives, we find that cultural change results from all post-acquisition integration activity. Given the power of practiced over espoused culture, the findings call for recognition that in global organizations leveraging culture goes beyond leveraging values only.

30|$|To conclude, {{the results}} {{revealed}} that advanced age can have beneficial as well as detrimental effects on an individual male stickleback’s reproductive traits. Older males were larger (dominance advantage) and had more sperm than their younger brothers. They might be, however, at a disadvantage in terms of mate <b>acquisition</b> (<b>less</b> intense nuptial signal) and fertilisation ability (lower quality sperm). The less developed nuptial colour, testis melanisation and sperm quality could {{be the result of}} oxidative stress to cells and tissues accumulating over time (Harman 1956). However, one has to mention that further investigations are needed to confirm that the results of this explanatory study are really important under natural conditions, especially when stickleback males are confronted with sperm competition and whether this influences males’ fertilisation abilities and reproductive success. Furthermore, given the damaging effects of progressive ageing, {{it is interesting to note}} that most males from the study population do not live long enough to reach a second reproductive phase in the field. Taken together, these observations support ultimate ageing theories suggesting that an age-related decrease in fitness might select for an increased reproductive investment early in life (Medawar 1952; Williams 1957).|$|R
