5|$|The Fasti Ostienses, the Ostian Calendar, {{records that}} {{the same day the}} Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor.

Nerva was old and childless, and had spent much of his career out of the public light, prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in Domitian's assassination.|$|E

5|$|A {{preliminary}} expedition under Mardonius, in 492BC, {{to secure}} the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of Thrace and forced Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom of Persia, the latter which had been a Persian vassal {{as early as the}} late 6th century BC. An amphibious task force was then sent out under Datis and Artaphernes in 490BC, using Delos as an intermediate base at, successfully sacking Karystos and Eretria, before moving to attack Athens.

It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E

5|$|For {{services}} unknown, he {{was rewarded}} with a consulship early in Vespasian's reign in 71. This was <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> honour, not only because he held this office early under the new regime, {{but also because it}} was an ordinary consulship (instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship), making him one of the few non-Flavians to be honoured in this way under Vespasian. After 71 Nerva again disappears from historical record, presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under Vespasian (69–79) and his sons Titus (79–81) and Domitian (81–96).|$|E

The Zarqa River is well known for its amber deposits that date back to the Hauterivian era of the Early Cretaceous (135 m.y.). <b>A</b> <b>remarkable</b> flora and fauna was reported from this amber reflecting tropical paleoenvironmental conditions prevailing during the time of resin deposition (Kaddumi, 2005; 2007).|$|E

If this manuscript has been corrupted from a version, {{it is more}} reasonable to suspect the Coptic, the version {{of the country in}} which it was written. Between this manuscript and both the Coptic and Syriac versions there is <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex by letter A.|$|E

About a decade later, Murchad appears to have driven Echmarcach from Mann, after which he gained the kingship of the Isles. Diarmait's deep-rooted authority in Norse-Gaelic Dublin lasted for two decades, and was <b>a</b> <b>remarkable</b> achievement that no other Irish king had ever accomplished.

He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
