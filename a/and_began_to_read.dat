500|$|In May 2007, Lonsdale {{appeared}} on BBC's Panorama {{program in a}} piece titled [...] "Scientology and Me", and was interviewed about his experiences as a critic of Scientology by journalist John Sweeney. When Sweeney asked Lonsdale why the Church of Scientology was publicizing derogatory things about him, Lonsdale replied: [...] "They are trying to embarrass me. They try to paint you as crazy, {{so that no one}} will listen to you." [...] During their interview, Tommy Davis arrived, opened a folder, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> out loud Lonsdale's criminal record. Later in the program, Sweeney was accused by Scientologist Tommy Davis of giving [...] "convicted sexual pervert Shawn Lonsdale" [...] a [...] "soft interview". Sweeney yelled at Davis and lost his temper, with both men shouting at each other back and forth. A Scientology-produced video of the incident was uploaded to YouTube and viewed over 856,000 times.|$|E

500|$|William Hayden English {{was born}} August27, 1822, in Lexington, Indiana, the only son of Elisha Gale English and his wife, Mahala (Eastin) English. Both {{his parents were}} Kentucky natives from slaveholding {{families}} of English and French Huguenot ancestry. They moved to southern Indiana in 1818. Elisha English quickly became involved in local politics as a Democrat, serving {{in the state legislature}} as well as building a prominent business career. William English was educated in the local public schools, later attending Hanover College. [...] He left college after three years <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> law. In 1840, English was admitted to the bar at the age of eighteen and soon built a practice in his native Scott County.

500|$|By {{the fifth}} Test, the Australian team {{was in sight}} {{of being the first}} Australian team to remain unbeaten {{throughout}} a tour of England. [...] Once again, much of the first day was lost to rain. Determined not to lose, Armstrong attempted to delay commencement after the rain and was heckled by English supporters. [...] He told his three main bowlers, [...] "I won't ask you not to get a man out, but as long as Mead (a notoriously slow scoring batsman) remains at the wicket we can't be beaten". [...] In the last three hours of the Test, Armstrong decided to rest his key bowlers and allowed his part-time bowlers to rotate as they pleased and fielders to configure themselves. During this time, Armstrong picked up a newspaper that had been blown across the field <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> [...] When asked about this later, Armstrong was said to have replied, [...] "I wanted to see who we were playing", although this is claimed to be apocryphal. [...] The Australians drew the Test and won the series three–nil, however they could not maintain their unbeaten record, losing by 28runs to an English XI at Eastbourne and again to C. I. Thornton's XI at Scarborough.|$|E
500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his pocket and pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could tell by the audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bakunin {{grew up in}} Pryamukhino, {{a family}} estate in Tver Governorate, where he moved to study {{philosophy}} <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the French encyclopédistes, leading to enthusiasm for the philosophy of Fichte. From Fichte, Bakunin went on to immerse himself {{in the works of}} Hegel, the most influential thinker among German intellectuals at the time. That led to his embrace of Hegelianism, bedazzled by Hegel's famous maxim, [...] "Everything that exists is rational." [...] In 1840, Bakunin traveled to St. Petersburg and Berlin with the intention of preparing himself for a professorship in philosophy or history at the University of Moscow. In 1842, Bakunin moved from Berlin to Dresden. Eventually he arrived in Paris, where he met Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Karl Marx.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was called}} one of the leading poets of Pueblo in 1884. A brief mention in 1885 says both he and Mrs. Chase went into the {{mountains}} for the summer. He joined the local Swedenborgian church in 1883, attached to its emphasis of a metaphorical interpretation of the Bible and stressed a mystical approach to Jesus and Christianity and its sense of Christianity was much less doctrinal that the Baptist Church of Chase's childhood. [...] However he didn't like the church's view on the Virgin birth of Jesus, and the Denver church was wracked by doctrinal disputes five years later. About that time Chase abandoned it and all other Christian churches. He initiated a broader religious search <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a wide variety of books about religion; Chase read James Freeman Clarke’s classic Ten Great Religions, later said he had taken an interest in Hinduism and for a time accepted the idea of reincarnation.|$|E
