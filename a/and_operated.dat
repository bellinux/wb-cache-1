40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine the relationship between net income <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> cash flows with cash dividends. This research uses data of world top public company (based on OSIRIS data) for 2007 financial statement. Net income <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> cash flows are defined as independence variables and cash dividends as dependence variable. This research uses descriptive statistics analysis, Pearson’s Correlation. The result is a positive significant relationship between net income <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> cash flows with cash dividends. Significant relationship means that the value of cash dividends is influenced significantly by the value of net income <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> cash flows. Positive relationship happens when the value of independent variables which are net income <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> cash flows increase, in that result the increase of the value of dependent variable that is cash dividends...|$|R

40|$|In present {{manufacturing}} environment, {{the manufacturing}} flexibility {{has become one}} of the strategic competitive tools. Flexibility refers to the availability of alternative resources. These resources may have varied parameters, particularly related to physical <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> system. These physical <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> parameters of alternative resources may influence the system's performance with the changing levels of flexibility and operational control parameters such as scheduling rules. Is increase in a flexibility level provides desired improved performance output? If yes, than under what conditions of physical <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> parameters <b>and</b> under which control strategy (CS) ? Is improved performance is present at all increasing levels of flexibility? Flexible manufacturing system (FMS) being consist of numerous physical <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> parameters <b>and</b> complex in nature, the solution to these questions can provide an understanding of the productive levels of flexibility for a given physical <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> parameters of an FMS. This paper establishes the need of modelling of the physical <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> parameters of flexible manufacturing system along with flexibility and presents a simulation study under Taguchi's method analysis of these parameters. The paper contributes an approach to study the impact of variations in physical <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> parameters of an FMS and to identify the level of these variations that do not restrict the advantages of flexibility. The results show that the expected benefits from increasing the levels of flexibility and a superior CS may not be achieved if the physical <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> parameters of alternative machines have variations. Taguchi's method analysis indicates that relative percentage contribution of variations in physical <b>and</b> <b>operating</b> parameters of alternative resources should be negligible or minimum in the performance of FMS. Their increasing relative contribution may restrict the advantages of flexibility. If these variations are higher than increase in flexibility level may be counter productive. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
