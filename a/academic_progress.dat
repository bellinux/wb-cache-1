5|$|Ralph Milne {{was born}} in Dundee, the {{youngest}} of four siblings, on 13 May 1961. He was moved forward a year in primary school due to his remarkable <b>academic</b> <b>progress.</b> He began his football career as a youth with Dundee Celtic Boys Club, where he played initially as a striker and had a prolific goalscoring record.|$|E

5|$|At the Conservatoire, Messiaen made {{excellent}} <b>academic</b> <b>progress.</b> In 1924, aged 15, he {{was awarded}} second prize in harmony, having been taught in that subject by professor Jean Gallon. In 1925 he won first prize in piano accompaniment, and in 1926 he gained first prize in fugue. After studying with Maurice Emmanuel, {{he was awarded}} second prize {{for the history of}} music in 1928. Emmanuel's example engendered an interest in ancient Greek rhythms and exotic modes. After showing improvisation skills on the piano Messiaen studied organ with Marcel Dupré. Messiaen gained first prize in organ playing and improvisation in 1929. After a year studying composition with Charles-Marie Widor, in autumn 1927 he entered the class of the newly appointed Paul Dukas. Messiaen's mother died of tuberculosis shortly before the class began. Despite his grief, he resumed his studies, and in 1930 Messiaen won first prize in composition.|$|E

5|$|He {{was educated}} at Harrow where, {{notwithstanding}} {{the fears of}} his family that a childhood head injury caused by a dangerous fall from a horse had seriously damaged his intellect, he showed aptitude in Greek and Latin. He made good <b>academic</b> <b>progress,</b> but after he had settled a quarrel with another pupil by an organised fist-fight, his father removed him from the school. (Fist fights were tolerated at Harrow: {{it was the fact}} of Brudenell's receiving punishment for unauthorised absence while having a broken bone in his hand attended to by a London surgeon that had annoyed the earl.) He was subsequently educated at home. Here, as the only son among seven sisters, he developed into something of a spoilt child, accustomed to getting his own way. This is seen as a cause of his arrogance and stubbornness in later life.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's <b>academic</b> <b>progress</b> was unremarkable, and in July 1912 {{he became}} an {{apprentice}} to the carpenter at the mission. At Easter 1912, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing catechism. In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu circumcision ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, {{but it was an}} important aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognised as an adult. Asked to take a Christian name, he chose both John and Peter after the eponymous Apostles in the New Testament. The missionaries however insisted that he select only one, and so he chose Johnstone, the -stone being selected because it was a Biblical reference to Peter. Accordingly, he was baptised as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914. After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends. Having completed his apprenticeship to a carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused. Kenyatta then requested that he be recommended for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty.|$|E
25|$|The schools {{primarily}} assess {{students through}} reports on individual <b>academic</b> <b>progress</b> and personal development. The {{emphasis is on}} characterization through qualitative description. Pupils' progress is primarily evaluated through portfolio work in academic blocks and discussion of pupils in teacher conferences. Standardized tests are rare, {{with the exception of}} examinations necessary for college entry taken during the secondary school years. Letter grades are generally not given until students enter high school at 14–15 years, as the educational emphasis is on children's holistic development, not solely their <b>academic</b> <b>progress.</b> Pupils are not normally asked to repeat years of elementary or secondary education.|$|E

25|$|People with {{executive}} dysfunction have {{a slower}} cognitive processing speed and thus often {{take longer to}} complete tasks than people who demonstrate typical executive function capabilities. This can be frustrating for the individual and can serve to impede <b>academic</b> <b>progress.</b> Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette’s syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits. The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Smart {{cars are}} {{promising}} application domain for ubiquitous computing. Context-awareness {{is the key}} feature of a smart car for safer and easier driving. Despite many industrial innovations and <b>academic</b> <b>progresses</b> have been made, we find a lack of fully context-aware smart cars. This study presents a general architecture of smart cars {{from the viewpoint of}} context-awareness. A hierarchical context model is proposed for description of the complex driving environment. A smart car prototype including software platform and hardware infrastructures is built to provide the running environment for the context model and applications. Two performance metrics were evaluated: accuracy of the context situation recognition and efficiency of the smart car. The whole response time of context situation recognition is nearly 1. 4 s for one person, which is acceptable for non-time critical applications in a smart car...|$|R

In 1972, Michael Harrison was the first modern author to re-assess Albert Victor and portray him in a more sympathetic light. In recent years, Andrew Cook has continued attempts to rehabilitate Albert Victor's reputation, arguing that his lack of <b>academic</b> <b>progress</b> was partly due to the incompetence of his tutor, Dalton; that he was a warm and charming man; that there is no tangible evidence that he was homosexual or bisexual; that he held liberal views, particularly on Irish Home Rule; and that his reputation was diminished by biographers eager to improve the image of his brother, George.|$|E

40|$|<b>Academic</b> <b>progresses</b> of {{students}} are measured by using variety of statistical analysis techniques like central tendency, variability, percentiles and others. These measures help the teaching professionals to understand their student progress in their class. A relatively simple technique {{that can be used}} for exploratory data analysis is the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. In this paper the authors describe how the Spearman rank correlation coefficient can be used as a statistical tool to find out the correlation between two different types of assessments for a mathematics unit as a case study. This method is perhaps the simplest method for calculation of coefficient correlation. Is a non parametric technique for evaluating the degree of linear association or correlation between two independent variables. It is operates on the ranks of the data rather than the raw data. The case study result show that existence of a positive correlation of medium order between the formative and summative assessments. That is, increase in formative assessment the summative assessment also increase. In other words, some students who scored high in the formative assessment only managed to get medium scores in the summative assessment and vice versa...|$|R
