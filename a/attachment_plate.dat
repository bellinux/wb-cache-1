40|$|Purpose: Corneal stromal cells {{transform}} to {{precursor cells}} in spheroid culture.

Methods: Spheroid culture {{was performed by}} seeding dissociated stromal cells onto ultra-low <b>attachment</b> <b>plates</b> containing serum-free mesenchymal stem cell culture medium. Spheroids were characterized with phenotype specific markers and stemness transcription factor genes.

Results: Stromal cells formed spheroids in ultra-low <b>attachment</b> <b>plates,</b> but not in polystyrene tissue culture dishes. Keratocan expression and abundance was significantly higher in spheroids as compared to adherent cells whereas alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) was significantly lower.

40|$|Infra-red {{thermography}} {{systems that}} have been developed {{over the last few years}} offer great potential to locate and discover flaws in steel highway bridge structures at a relatively early stage in their development. Under ideal conditions, the use of infra-red instrumentation should allow bridge inspection personnel to rapidly scan the structure and determine if a potential structural problem has developed. If a problem spot is located by the infra-red camera, then the trouble spot can be examined carefully to determine the need for corrective maintenance. The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of sensitive infra-red equipment for detecting fatigue cracks in steel highway bridge structures and components. The performance and sensitivity of one particular infra-red system was explored by conducting tests on two different specimen types in the laboratory, followed by a check of the equipment under field conditions. Crack detection sensitivity in the laboratory was evaluated using a center-hole test coupon geometry as well as a welded <b>attachment</b> <b>plate</b> detail. The test samples were subjected to cyclic loading to initiate and propagate a fatigue crack. Control variables for the infra-red system were then varied to evaluate the optimal conditions. The field tests were conducted to assess the equipment limitations and performance under field conditions. The detail inspected involved a vertical plate that was welded to the web of a beam member and used to attach transverse diaphragm cross-frame members; the diaphragm connection plate was selected for inspection because it was known that fatigue cracks had developed at the end of a number of the vertical plates. It was found that infra-red inspection could be used successfully to detect fatigue cracks in steel bridge members and components if the crack had propagated through the thickness. Consequently, the crack size that could be reliably and consistently detected was not significantly different from that which could be detected from a careful visual inspection. Moreover, a number of difficulties were encountered when using infra-red inspection in the field. Limitations were encountered in the field related to mobility of the equipment, calibration requirements, operator skill level required, and the variable effects of environmental factors that influence the detection capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} has unveiled a subpopulation of highly tumorigenic, multipotent cells capable of self-renewal in {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). These unique cells, named here cancer stem cells (CSCs), proliferate slowly and might be involved in resistance to conventional chemotherapy. We have shown that CSCs are found in perivascular niches and rely on endothelial cell-secreted factors [particularly interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) ] for their survival and self-renewal in HNSCC. Here, we hypothesized that cisplatin enhances the stem cell fraction in HNSCC. To address this hypothesis, we generated xenograft HNSCC tumors with University of Michigan-squamous cell carcinoma 22 B (UM-SCC- 22 B) cells and observed that cisplatin treatment increased (P =. 0013) the fraction of CSCs [i. e., aldehyde dehydrogenase activity high and cluster of differentiation 44 high (ALDHhighCD 44 high) ]. Cisplatin promoted self-renewal and survival of CSCs in vitro, as seen {{by an increase in}} the number of orospheres in ultralow <b>attachment</b> <b>plates</b> and induction in B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi- 1) and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 expression.

Notably, cisplatin-induced Bmi- 1 was inhibited by interleukin- 6 receptor blockade in parental and cisplatin-resistant cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cisplatin enhances the fraction of CSCs and suggest a mechanism for resistance to cisplatin therapy in head and neck cancer...|$|R

We describe the digestion and dissociation of prostate tissue into single-cell suspensions containing both prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, {{the isolation of}} epithelial cells from the parental population via fluorescence activated cell sorting, and the plating conditions and medium for prostate organoid culture. We also describe the serial passaging and freezing of cultures, which can resume growth after thawing. The dissection and dissociation of prostate tissue and the preparation of cells for plating takes 8 - 9 hours. Organoids that can be quantified and analyzed are obtained after 7 - 10 days. Our culture system supports the growth and serial passaging of both normal and transformed organoids, and should be useful for studies of normal prostate as well as prostate cancer. ### Introduction Three-dimensional “organoid” culture techniques {{have been used for}} culture of stem/progenitor cells from tissues including the small intestine, stomach, liver and pancreas (1 - 4). We have developed a novel method for the culture of prostate epithelial organoids that display tissue architecture resembling that of the normal prostate (5). Our culture system supports the growth and serial passaging of prostate luminal cells, which have historically been difficult to grow, and differs from previous “prostasphere” conditions, which favor the growth of prostate basal cells and fail to display a response to androgen deprivation (6). In particular, our organoid culture conditions allow for the growth of prostate organoids from single luminal stem/progenitor cells, as well as mouse tumor organoids, and thus should be widely applicable for studies of prostate biology. Notably, our culture methods are distinct from recently published conditions for prostate organoid culture using defined media conditions (7, 8). In the following protocol, we describe the digestion and dissociation of prostate tissue into single-cell suspensions containing both prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, the isolation of epithelial cells from the parental population via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using antibodies against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, also CD 326) and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin, also CD 324), and the plating conditions and medium for prostate organoid culture using supplemented hepatocyte medium with 5 % Matrigel. We also describe the serial passaging and freezing of cultures, which can resume growth after thawing. ### Materials 1. 1 Prostate dissection and collagenase digestion 1. 1 or 2 male C 57 BL/ 6 mice (or mice of interest) - PBS (for dissection) - 10 x collagenase/hyaluronidase solution (STEMCELL Technologies # 07912) - Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F- 12 (DMEM/F- 12, Gibco # 10565) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) 1. 2 Enzymatic dissociation to single cell suspension 1. 0. 25 % Trypsin/EDTA (STEMCELL Technologies # 07901) - Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution Modified (HBSS, STEMCELL Technologies # 37150), supplemented with 2 % FBS - Dispase 5 mg/mL (STEMCELL Technologies # 07913) - DNaseI 1 mg/mL (STEMCELL Technologies # 07900) - Trypan blue solution 0. 4 % (Gibco # 15250 - 061) - HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 (STEMCELL Technologies # 07171) (Critical: We recommend purchasing ROCK inhibitor from STEMCELL Technologies for consistent results.) 1. 3. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) preparation 1. Anti-mouse EpCAM APC antibody (BioLegend 118214) - Anti-mouse E-Cadherin PerCP-Efluor 710 antibody (eBiosciences 46 - 3249 - 82) - 0. 5 mg/mL DAPI - HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 1. 4. Medium preparation and cell plating 1. 96 -well low-attachment plate (Corning # 3474) - 24 -well flat bottom plate (BD # 353047) (for embedding culture) - Hepatocyte medium (Corning # 355056) (Tip: This reagent has regularly been on back order. Check in advance for availability.) - 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF; comes with Corning # 3555056) - Heat-inactivated, charcoal stripped FBS (Gibco # 12676) (Critical: Charcoal-stripped FBS must be heat-inactivated prior to use by heating in 55 °C water bath for 60 min. Heat-inactivated charcoal-stripped FBS can be aliquoted and stored at - 20 °C.) - 100 x Glutamax (Gibco # 35050) - Thawed matrigel (Corning # 354234) (Critical: After removal of Matrigel from storage at - 20 °C, it must remain on ice at all times until use to prevent polymerization. We recommend placing Matrigel on ice in a 4 °C refrigerator overnight to thaw and keeping it on ice until it is added to media. Unused Matrigel can be refrozen, but avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.) - 5 mM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 - 10 - 5 M dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in ethanol (Sigma #A- 8380) - 100 x antibiotic-antimycotic (Caution: We recommend culturing without antibiotics, but antibiotics can be added during the initial culture period or if there is concern for contamination from other sources.) 1. 5. Passaging and freezing organoids 1. Cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) - 0. 25 % Trypsin/EDTA - HBSS + 2 % FBS - Prepared organoid media (see 2. 4) - Heat-inactivated, charcoal stripped FBS - Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma #D 2650) ### Equipment 1. CO 2 euthanasia chamber - Dissecting microscope - Micro-dissecting instruments - Water baths set at 37 °C and 55 °C - Sterile petri dishes - Eppendorf tubes (1. 5 mL) - Incubator, humidified at 37 °C, with 5 % CO 2 - Laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet - Centrifuges (for Eppendorf and Falcon tubes) - Falcon tubes (15 and 50 mL) - Orbital shaker - Cell strainer 40 uM (Corning # 352340) - Hemocytometer - BD FACSAria cell sorter (or similar) ### Procedure Critical: The volumes detailed below are for dissociation of an intact prostate from an 8 - 12 week wild type mouse. For larger prostate samples such as those from aggressive tumor models, all reagents should be increased proportionally from the volumes suggested below. For example, if a prostate tumor is approximately twice the size of a wild type prostate, 2 x the volume of suggested reagents should be used. 2. 1. Prostate dissection and collagenase digestion 1. In tissue culture hood, combine 200 µL 10 x collagenase/hyaluronidase mixture with 1. 8 mL DMEM/F 12 + 5 % FBS. Place in 37 °C water bath until ready to use. - Resect mouse prostates and transfer to sterile petri dish containing cold PBS for dissection 6. Using a dissecting microscope, fine forceps, and sharp scissors, remove residual fat from prostate tissue. - Fill 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of diluted pre-warmed collagenase/hyaluronidase solution and transfer prostate tissue into the tube. - Using small, sharp sterile scissors, macerate the prostate tissue by rapidly opening and closing the scissors inside the tube to cut the tissue into small pieces. Fill the tube with an additional 400 - 500 µL dilute collagenase/hyaluronidase solution until almost full. - Incubate in 37 °C incubator for 3 hours. (Tip: The Eppendorf tube may be placed on its side in a sterile petri dish to maximize the surface area of prostate tissue exposed to collagenase/hyaluronidase solution. Periodic shaking of the tube to redistribute prostate tissue is helpful.) 2. 2. Enzymatic dissociation to single cell suspension 1. Centrifuge digested tissue at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend pellet in 1. 5 mL cold 0. 25 % trypsin-EDTA and transfer to 50 mL conical tube. Incubate in 4 °C refrigerator for 1 hour. (Caution: To minimize cell death, keep trypsin ≤ 4 °C prior to and during use. Trypsin can be gently thawed overnight with Matrigel and kept on ice. An orbital shaker can be used during the trypsinization step for optimal digestion.) - During trypsinization, place 900 µL dispase in 37 °C water bath at least 10 minutes prior to use. Immediately before use, add 100 µL DNaseI to dispase solution. - After trypsinization is complete (1 hour), add cold HBSS + 2 % FBS (equal to 2 x volume of trypsin) to quench reaction. Centrifuge at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Add 1 mL of pre-warmed dispase/DNaseI solution. Pipette the sample vigorously for 1 - 2 minutes using P 1000 pipette until solution is homogenously translucent with no visible tissue fragments. (Do not allow digestion to continue for more than 2 minutes.) (Critical: To maximize cell dissociation, this pipetting step should be done continuously.) - Add cold HBSS + 2 % FBS (equal to 5 x volume of dispase) to quench reaction. - Filter cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube. - Centrifuge filtered suspension at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend pellet in 1 mL HBSS + 2 % FBS and transfer to 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tube. - Count viable cells using a hemacytometer and trypan blue. - Centrifuge and resuspend cells in HBSS + 2 % FBS at 100 µL/ 1 × 10 e 6 cells. (If fewer than 1 × 10 e 6 cells are obtained, resuspend in 100 µL) 2. 3. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) *Keep cell suspension and reagents on ice until sorting is finished. 1. Divide cell suspension into four 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes as follows - a. Tube 1 (unstained control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - b. Tube 2 (PerCP control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - c. Tube 3 (APC control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - d. Tube 4 (sample for collection) : remaining sample (up to 1 mL) - Add FACS antibodies as follows: - a. Tube 1 : no antibody - b. Tube 2 : 1 µL (1 : 100) anti-mouse E-cadherin PerCP-Efluor 710 antibody - c. Tube 3 : 1 µL (1 : 100) anti-mouse APC-EpCAM antibody - d. Tube 4 : both antibodies at 1 : 100 dilution (1 µL antibody per 100 µL cell suspension). - (Critical: If fewer than 4 × 10 e 6 cells are obtained after enzymatic dissociation, use 10 µL of cell suspension for control tubes 1 - 3 and dilute with 90 µL HBSS + 2 % FBS for a total of 100 µL. Use the same antibody concentrations. Resuspend tubes 1 - 3 in 50 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS instead of 500 µL in step 6 of cell sorting and use 1 µL of dilute DAPI instead of 10 µL.) - Cover with foil and incubate on ice for 25 minutes. - Spin tubes at 350 rcf at 4 °C for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Add 500 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS to all tubes. Spin at 350 rcf at 4 °C for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend all tubes in 500 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632. - Prepare a 1 : 100 dilution of 0. 5 mg/mL DAPI by adding 5 µL DAPI to 495 µL HBSS + 2 % FBS. Add 10 µL of dilute DAPI to each tube. - Transfer each suspension into a labeled round-bottom clear rubber-top plastic test tube for loading into sorter. - Prior to sorting, prepare multiple 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes pre-filled with 500 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 for collecting cells. - Perform sorting via sterile FACS facility (tubes 1 - 3 will be used to set appropriate gates; tube 4 will be used to collect cells for plating). Collecting cells at 60, 000 cells per tube will facilitate easier plating. Keep collected cells on ice until ready to plate. 2. 4. Medium preparation and cell plating 1. Prepare desired amount of culture medium by combining the following components to the indicated final concentrations (a-d can be combined and stored as a 50 mL aliquot at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks; e-h should be added on the day of use based on the amount of media needed) : - a. Hepatocyte medium (47 mL per 50 mL media) - b. 10 ng/mL EGF (100 µL of 5 µg/mL stock per 50 mL media) - c. 5 % heat-inactivated, charcoal-stripped FBS (2. 5 mL per 50 mL media) - d. 1 x Glutamax (500 µL per 50 mL media) - e. 5 % Matrigel (50 µL per 1 mL media) - f. 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 (2 µL of 5 mM stock per 1 mL media) - g. 100 nM DHT (10 µL of 10 e- 5 M stock per 1 mL media) - h. 1 x antibiotic-antimycotic (10 µL per 1 mL media; optional) - Keep prepared culture media at room temperature until use (rapid warming in 37 °C water bath may cause Matrigel to solidify at top of tube). - Centrifuge sorted cells at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspend in prepared media at 5, 000 cells per 100 µL media. (If cells were collected at 60, 000 cells per Eppendorf tube, resuspend in 1. 2 mL media. If there is concern for cell death, count viable cells prior to centrifuging and resuspend accordingly.) - Add resuspended cells to 96 -well low <b>attachment</b> <b>plate</b> at 100 µL per well for a final plating density of 5, 000 cells per well. - Change media every 4 days by adding 100 µL fresh media to each well on days 4 and 8 after plating. On day 12, when wells are full (300 µL), transfer each well to a 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. Remove 200 µL of supernatant and add 100 µL fresh media (total volume will be 200 µL). Transfer onto a new 96 -well plate using P 1000 pipet tip (smaller tips may damage organoids). Alternate every 4 days between either adding 100 µL media or spinning down to remove 200 µL and add 100 µL until ready for passage. (Multiple wells can be pooled prior to centrifuging and redistributed evenly if there are many wells.) 2. 5. Cell plating using embedding conditions 1. Medium preparation is the same as in 2. 4. 1 except that component e is not added. Media can be pre-warmed in a 37 °C water bath. This pre-warmed media will be used to cover the solidified Matrigel ring in 2. 5. 7. - Prepare cold media as in 2. 4. 1 except that component e is not added and f is at a final concentration of 25 µM (5 µL of 5 mM stock per 1 mL media). Keep this media on ice and it will be used to resuspend cells. - Pellet cells as in 2. 4. 3 and resuspend in prepared cold media at 5, 000 cells per 40 µL media. (If cells were collected at 60, 000 cells per Eppendorf tube, resuspend in 480 µL media.) (Tip: For the embedding condition, the number of cells plated can be much lower.) - Mix the 40 µL media containing cells thoroughly with 60 µl Matrigel (If 60, 000 cells are resuspended in 480 µL media, mix with 720 µL Matrigel). Avoid bubbles. This step should be done on ice to prevent Matrigel solidification. - Plate the 100 µL media Matrigel mixture around the ring of a well in a 24 -well plate. - Incubate the 24 -well plate in 37 °C incubator for 30 minutes to allow the Matrigel ring to solidify. - Add 400 µL pre-warmed media as prepared in 2. 5. 1 to each well. (Critical: Make sure that the media is warm enough prior to addition to the well to avoid dissolving the Matrigel ring.) - Change media every 4 days by aspirating the media off the Matrigel ring and adding fresh media. (Tip: Aspiration should be performed {{from the middle of the}} well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel ring.) 2. 6. Passaging and freezing organoids 1. When organoids are large (usually 3 - 5 weeks after plating), prepare organoids for passage by transferring into 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes and spinning at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. (Multiple wells can be pooled.) Discard supernatant. - Wash cells in cold PBS and spin again at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. (Critical: Without this PBS washing step, the trypsin reaction will not be optimal due to residual FBS in the medium, resulting in incomplete dissociation into single cells.) - Add 1 mL warm 0. 25 % trypsin/EDTA and incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 5 minutes. (Tip: In the context of very large organoids or organoids that are difficult to dissociate, step 3 can be replaced by incubation in cold 0. 25 % trypsin/EDTA at 4 °C for 30 minutes.) - Pipette up and down with P 200 pipet tip for 30 seconds to dissociate cells. - Transfer suspension into a 15 mL conical tube prefilled with 2 mL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS. - Centrifuge at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend cell pellet in fresh media and plate into a new low-attachment 96 -well plate. Cells can be plated by either replating 4 x the number of wells passaged in 100 µL per well or by counting viable cells and replating at 5, 000 cells/ 100 µL media per well. - Organoids can be frozen at any point during a passage cycle by centrifuging at 250 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspending in 1 mL freezing media in 1. 8 mL cryo tubes (50 % FBS, 40 % hepatocyte media, 10 % DMSO). Gradual freezing to ≤ - 80 ° using an insulated cryofreezing container is recommended. Organoids should be thawed rapidly in a 37 °C water bath and immediately diluted in 10 mL HBSS + 2 % FBS per 1 mL freezing media. Centrifuge thawed organoids at 250 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspend in organoid culture media for plating. 2. 7. Passaging and freezing of embedded organoids 1. Dissolve the Matrigel ring by adding about 125 µL dispase at 5 mg/mL to each well of the 24 -well plate to make the final concentration of dispase 1 mg/ml. - Incubate in 37 °C incubator for 10 minutes. - If the Matrigel ring dissolves, proceed as in 2. 6. 1. If not, incubate at 37 °C for another 5 minutes. ### Timing It should take approximately 8 - 9 hours (depending on experience) from dissection of mouse tissue to plating of sorted epithelial cells. ### Troubleshooting 3. 1. Incomplete cell dissociation after dispase step 1. Check that all reagents are within the use by date - Make sure to thoroughly mince tissues prior to collagenase/hyaluronidase digestion. - During the dispase step, make sure the solution is pre-warmed at 37 °C for at least 10 minutes and perform vigorous pipetting of sample for up to 2 minutes. 3. 2. Organoids fail to form from plated cells 1. Ensure the DAPI aliquot being used results in optimal exclusion of dead cells during sorting. Replace if necessary. - Decrease the speed and pressure used during sorting. 3. 3. Plated cells form adherent cultures instead of organoids 1. Ensure you are using a low-attachment surface plate. - Some low-attachment brands will still result in adherent cultures. We have found that the Costar plates from Corning are optimal for minimizing cell adherence. ### Anticipated Results Organoid formation from plated cells is a rapid process, and small organoids should be identifiable after about 3 days for organoids from wild-type mice, or within 24 hours for organoids derived from mouse models of prostate cancer. Organoid forming efficiency should be quantitated approximately 7 - 10 days after plating of sorted cells. Wild-type cells should generate large cystic structures, while tumor cells will form more solid organoids. If the EpCAM E-Cadherin sorting strategy is utilized, there should not be any evidence of fibroblast cells in organoid cultures. ### References 1. Sato, T. et al.

This attachment of meiotic telomeres is mediated by the specific distribution of several nuclear envelope components that interact with the <b>attachment</b> <b>plates</b> of the synaptonemal complex. We have determined by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy that the ablation of the kinase CDK 2 alters the nuclear envelope in mouse spermatocytes, and that the proteins SUN 1, KASH 5 (also known as CCDC 155) and lamin C 2 show an abnormal cap-like distribution facing the centrosome. Strikingly, some telomeres are not attached to the nuclear envelope but remain at the nuclear interior where they are associated with SUN 1 and with nuclear-envelope-detached vesicles. We also demonstrate that mouse testis CDK 2 phosphorylates SUN 1 in vitro. We propose that during mammalian prophase I the kinase CDK 2 is a key factor governing the structure of the nuclear envelope and the telomere-led chromosome movements essential for homolog pairin...|$|R

We created contractile cardiac spheroids by plating a mixture of rat neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes, human dermal fibroblasts, and human coronary microartery endothelial cells in ultralow <b>attachment</b> <b>plates.</b> First, the optimal cell ratios for the 3 cell sources were determined. Next, approximately 1 × 104 optimal spheroids were fused into a patch-like construct, and the morphologic characteristics and mechanical functions of these patches were evaluated. Finally, the cardiac patches were grafted into the hearts of F 344 nude rats, and histologic studies were performed after transplantation. ResultsSynchronous beating of the cardiac patch was confirmed electrophysiologically and mechanically. A micronetwork of endothelial cells was also demonstrated in the construct, and the histologic study performed 5 days after transplantation showed the grafts to be viable, with functioning microvascular structures inside the graft tissue. ConclusionsWe consider the application of our scaffold-free 3 -dimensional tissue engineering technology to cardiac regeneration therapy is feasible and expect that this technology will become a promising tool for the treatment of end-stage heart failure...|$|R

Most {{of the gap}} junctions (GJs) seen in the gymnotid-fish cerebellum exhibit an asymmetrical configuration, the electron-opaque cytoplasmic material underlying the junction being more extensive in the dendritic than in the axonal side. In the frog cerebellum, the GJs have a symmetrical distribution of such electron-opaque material. In both species the GJs are encountered at the same synaptic interface as the conventional synaptic zone (CSZ), constituting "mixed synapses" in a morphological sense. The axonal surface covered by CSZs is larger than that covered by GJs. In mammalian cerebellum, GJs are observed only in the molecular layer, between perikarya, dendrites, or perikarya and dendrites of the inhibitory interneurons. These GJs are intermixed with <b>attachment</b> <b>plates</b> and intermediary junctions interpreted as simply adhesive. In the mammalian cerebellum, {{a new type of}} junction which resembles the septate junctions (SJs) of invertebrate epithelia is observed between axonal branches forming the tip of the brush of basket fibers around the initial segment of the Purkinje cell axon.

The conjugate {{is designed to}} be amphiphilic by incorporation of three hydrophobic phenylalanine residues as well as the RGD unit and a short poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain of molar mass 3000 kg mol- 1. Above a critical aggregation concentration, determined by fluorescence measurements, signals of b-sheet structure are revealed by spectroscopic measurements, as well as X-ray diffraction. At high concentration, a self-assembled fibril nanostructure is revealed by electron microscopy. The fibrils are observed despite PEG crystallization which occurs on drying. This suggests that DGRFFF has an aggregation tendency that is sufficiently strong not to be prevented by PEG crystallization. The adhesion, viability and proliferation of human corneal fibroblasts was examined for films of the conjugate on tissue culture plates (TCPs) as well as low <b>attachment</b> <b>plates.</b> On TCP, DGRFFF–PEG 3000 films prepared at sufficiently low concentration are viable, and cell proliferation is observed. However, on low attachment surfaces, neither cell adhesion nor proliferation was observed, indicating that the RGD motif was not available to enhance cell adhesion. This was ascribed to the core–shell architecture of the self-assembled fibrils with a peptide core surrounded by a PEG shell which hinders access to the RGD unit...|$|R

The bipotent progenitor cell line HepaRG has been used as it is known to express various liver specific markers and function in its differentiated state similar to primary human hepatocytes.

40|$|Although early {{detection}} of breast cancer improved in recent years, {{prognosis of patients with}} late stage breast cancer remains poor, mostly due to development of multidrug resistance (MDR) followed by tumor recurrence. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), with higher drug efflux capability and other stem cell-like properties, are concentrated in a side population (SP) of cells, which were proposed to be responsible for MDR and tumor repopulation that cause patients to succumb to breast cancer. Therefore, targeting of CSCs as an adjuvant to chemotherapy should be able to provide a more effective treatment of this disease. Here, we used IMD- 0354, an inhibitor of NF-κB, identified for targeting CSCs, in a combination therapy with doxorubicin encapsulated in targeted nanoparticles. IMD- 0354 did target CSCs, evidenced by a decrease in the SP, demonstrated by the inhibition of the following: dye/drug efflux, reduction in ABC transporters as well as in colony formation in soft agar and low <b>attachment</b> <b>plates.</b> Decrease of stem-like gene expression of Oct 4, Nanog and Sox 2, and apoptosis resistance related to the Survivin gene also was observed after treatment with this compound. In addition, IMD- 0354 targeted non-CSCs as indicated by reducing viability and increasing apoptosis. Targeted drug delivery, achieved with a legumain inhibitor, proved to enhance drug delivery under hypoxia, a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment, but not under normoxia. Together, this allowed a safe, non-toxic delivery of both anticancer agents to the tumor microenvironment of mice bearing syngenei...|$|R

40|$|Welding {{processes}} generally induce {{high tensile}} residual stresses. Along with the service loads, these tensile residual stresses contribute to high local stresses in the HAZ (Heat-Affected Zone) {{and at the}} weld toe, where there are weld imperfections and high local (‘hot-spot’) stresses. It is widely accepted that the reduction of tensile residual stresses by appropriate post-weld treatment will increase the fatigue life in the high-cycle regime. One such post-weld treatment is ultrasonic peening; the redistribution of tensile residual stresses and the relaxation of compressive stresses in the HAZ and weld toe region by ultrasonic peening have not been studied extensively. The residual stresses will be determined {{for a number of}} A 350 grade black mild steel plate T-butt welds. Some will be as-welded (containing residual stresses), others will be ultrasonically peened. The through-thickness residual stresses in both cases will be measured by (non-destructive) neutron diffraction using the Kowari instrument at the ANSTO Bragg Institute, as well as the (destructive) contour method at the ANSTO Institute of Materials Engineering.

40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} (IR) is {{used for}} patients diagnosed with unresectable non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however radiotherapy remains largely palliative due to radioresistance. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), may contribute to drug and radiation resistance mechanisms in solid tumors. Here we investigated the molecular phenotype of A 549 and H 460 NSCLC cells that survived treatment with IR (5 Gy) and are growing as floating tumor spheres and cells that are maintained in a monolayer after irradiation. Non-irradiated and irradiated cells were collected after one week, seeded onto ultra low <b>attachment</b> <b>plates</b> and propagated as tumor spheres. Bulk NSCLC cells which survived radiation and grew in spheres express cancer stem cell surface and embryonic stem cell markers {{and are able to}} self-renew, and generate differentiated progeny. These cells also have a mesenchymal phenotype. Particularly, the radiation survived sphere cells express significantly higher levels of CSC markers (CD 24 and CD 44), nuclear β-catenin and EMT markers (Snail 1, Vimentin, and N-cadherin) than non-irradiated lung tumor sphere cells. Upregulated levels of Oct- 4, Sox 2 and beta-catenin were detected in H 460 cells maintained in a monolayer after irradiation, but not in radiation survived adherent A 459 cells. PDGFR-beta was upregulated in radiation survived sphere cells and in radiation survived adherent cells in both A 549 and H 460 cell lines. Combining IR treatment with axitinib or dasatinib, inhibitors with anti-PDFGR activity, potentiates the efficacy of NSCLC radiotherapy in vitro. Our findings suggest that radiation survived cells have a complex phenotype combining the properties of CSCs and EMT. CD 44, SNAIL and PDGFR-beta are dramatically upregulated in radiation survived cells and might be considered as markers of radiotherapy response in NSCLC. © 2013 Gomez-casal et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cancer {{stem cells}} exhibit close {{resemblance}} to normal stem cells in phenotype {{as well as}} function. Hence, studying normal stem cell behavior is important in understanding cancer pathogenesis. It has recently been shown that human breast stem cells can be enriched in suspension cultures as mammospheres. However, {{little is known about}} the behavior of these cells in long-term cultures. Since extensive self-renewal potential is the hallmark of stem cells, we undertook a detailed phenotypic and functional characterization of human mammospheres over long-term passages. Methodology: Single cell suspensions derived from human breast `organoids' were seeded in ultra low <b>attachment</b> <b>plates</b> in serum free media. Resulting primary mammospheres after a week (termed T 1 mammospheres) were subjected to passaging every 7 th day leading to the generation of T 2, T 3, and T 4 mammospheres. Principal Findings: We show that primary mammospheres contain a distinct side-population (SP) that displays a CD 24 (low) /CD 44 (low) phenotype, but fails to generate mammospheres. Instead, the mammosphere-initiating potential rests within the CD 44 (high) /CD 24 (low) cells, in keeping with the phenotype of breast cancer-initiating cells. In serial sphere formation assays we find that even though primary (T 1) mammospheres show telomerase activity and fourth passage T 4 spheres contain label-retaining cells, they fail to initiate new mammospheres beyond T 5. With increasing passages, mammospheres showed an increase in smaller sized spheres, reduction in proliferation potential and sphere forming efficiency, and increased differentiation towards the myoepithelial lineage. Significantly, staining for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity revealed a dramatic increase in the number of senescent cells with passage, which might in part explain the inability to continuously generate mammospheres in culture. Conclusions: Thus, the self-renewal potential of human breast stem cells is exhausted within five in vitro passages of mammospheres, suggesting the need for further improvisation in culture conditions for their long-term maintenance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHead {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinomas (HNSCC) exhibit a small population of uniquely tumorigenic cancer stem cells (CSC) endowed with self-renewal and multipotency. We have recently shown that IL- 6 enhances the survival and tumorigenic potential of {{head and neck}} cancer stem cells (i. e. ALDHhighCD 44 high cells). Here, we characterized the effect of therapeutic inhibition of IL- 6 with a novel humanized anti-IL- 6 antibody (MEDI 5117) using three low-passage patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of HNSCC. We observed that single agent MEDI 5117 inhibited the growth of PDX-SCC-M 1 tumors (P <. 05). This PDX model was generated from a previously untreated HNSCC. In contrast, MEDI 5117 was not effective at reducing overall tumor volume for PDX models representing resistant disease (PDX-SCC-M 0, PDX-SCC-M 11). Low dose MEDI 5117 (3 mg/kg) consistently decreased the fraction of cancer stem cells in PDX models of HNSCC when compared to IgG-treated controls, as follows: PDX-SCC-M 0 (P <. 001), PDX-SCC-M 1 (P <. 001), PDX-SCC-M 11 (P =. 04). Interestingly, high dose MEDI 5117 (30 mg/kg) decreased the CSC fraction in the PDX-SCC-M 11 model (P =. 002), but not in PDX-SCC-M 0 and PDX-SCC-M 1. MEDI 5117 mediated a dose-dependent {{decrease in the number}} of orospheres generated by ALDHhighCD 44 high cells cultured in ultra-low <b>attachment</b> <b>plates</b> (P <. 05), supporting an inhibitory effect on head and neck cancer stem cells. Notably, single agent MEDI 5117 reduced the overall recurrence rate of PDX-SCC-M 0, a PDX generated from the local recurrence of human HNSCC. Collectively, these data demonstrate that therapeutic inhibition of IL- 6 with low-dose MEDI 5117 decreases the fraction of cancer stem cells, and that adjuvant MEDI 5117 inhibits recurrence in preclinical models of HNSCC...|$|R
