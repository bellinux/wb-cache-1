5|$|In {{the return}} match against Queensland, Harvey made 17 as Victoria took a convincing innings win. In the next match against New South Wales, Harvey played with Neil {{for the first}} time at {{first-class}} level, and pair played together for their state’s two remaining matches of the season, although they never batted together as Merv was <b>always</b> <b>out</b> before Neil came in, usually at No. 6. Merv made 30 and 44, failing to capitalise on his starts to make a big score with a Test vacancy beckoning; incumbent opener Sid Barnes was injured and unavailable for the Fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1947–48 season, Harvey was {{called into the}} Victorian team for the Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales and made his debut {{alongside}} Merv and Neil, who were already established players. Merv opened, while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships as they were <b>always</b> <b>out</b> before the next sibling came in to bat. Ray came in at 5/208 to make 43. Victoria ended with 331 and the Harvey brothers had scored almost half the runs. New South Wales were forced to follow on and Victoria were set 51 for victory. After the fall of Fred Freer at 1/24, captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3, allowing two Harveys to bat {{together for the first}} time at first-class level. Ray and Merv put on an unbeaten partnership of 27 to take Victoria to a nine-wicket win. Merv and Ray ended unbeaten on 12 and 22 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} {{that more than one}} of the {{brothers}} played for Victoria together came in 194647, after Neil was selected to play for the state against Tasmania. At the time, a second-string team was used to play Tasmaniawho were not in the Sheffield Shieldin two first-class matches, while the strongest team played in the regular interstate competition. Neil struck a century in the second match against Tasmania, and was called into the Victorian team to play against New South Wales in a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG, and he played alongside Merv for their state’s three remaining matches of the season. However, the brothers never batted together in these three matches. Merv opened the batting and was <b>always</b> <b>out</b> before Neil came in, usually at No. 6 upon the fall of the fourth wicket. Merv captained at first-class level {{for the first time in}} the last match, a draw against South Australia that was severely shortened by rain.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, the qin {{was played}} in a quiet studio or room by oneself, or with a few friends; or played {{outdoors}} in places of outstanding natural beauty. Nowadays, many qin players perform at concerts in large concert halls, almost <b>always,</b> <b>out</b> of necessity, using electronic pickups or microphones to amplify the sound. Many qin players attend yajis, at which a number of qin players, music lovers, or anyone {{with an interest in}} Chinese culture can come along to discuss and play the qin. In fact, the yaji originated as a multi-media gathering involving the four arts: qin, Go, calligraphy, and painting.|$|E

He also tried his hand at production, with three 15-minute travelogues: Terry-Thomas in Tuscany, Terry-Thomas in the South of France and Terry-Thomas in Northern Ireland. He did not enjoy the producer's role, complaining that [...] "for some extraordinary reason that I could never understand, everybody was <b>always</b> <b>out</b> to do the producer of any film whoever he was. I had to be on the watch the whole time". He worked consistently during 1963, appearing in television programmes {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic; these included Terry-Thomas, a one-off variety show on BBC Television in July that included Donald Sutherland.|$|E

500|$|On May 10, 1983, Howard Emerson, the {{adviser to}} the journalism class, {{submitted}} page proofs of the May 13 issue of the newspaper to principal Robert Eugene Reynolds for approval, a practice that was customary at the time. Reynolds objected {{to two of the}} stories scheduled to run. One was about teen pregnancy, containing interviews with three students who had been pregnant. The story used false names to keep the girls' identities a secret, but Reynolds was concerned that the students would still be identifiable from the text. He was also concerned that the references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for younger students at the school. The second story was about divorce and featured an interview with a student whose parents were divorced, in which she complained that her father [...] "wasn't spending enough time with my mom, my sister, and I ... was <b>always</b> <b>out</b> of town on business or out late playing cards with the guys ... always argued about everything". Reynolds, unaware that the girl's name would also be changed, argued that her family should have been given an opportunity to respond within the story, or to object to its publication.|$|E

He repeatedly asks if it has been returned. When it is eventually returned, there is a commotion amongst the library users who all want the book. This specific incident in the episode is discussed in a 2003 article on the decline of the use of public libraries in Britain by G. K. Peatling.|$|E

2500|$|Among two {{or three}} friends, however, the picture of Rivers is quite different. His conversations were full of {{interest}} and illumination; [...] "he was <b>always</b> <b>out</b> to elicit the truth, entirely sincere, and disdainful of mere dialect." [...] His insistence on veracity made him a formidable researcher, as Haddon puts it, [...] "the keynote of Rivers was thoroughness. Keenness of thought and precision marked all his work." [...] His research was distinguished by a fidelity {{to the demands of}} experimental method very rare in the realms which he was exploring and, although often overlooked, the work that Rivers did in this early period is of immense import as it formed the foundation of all that came later.|$|E

Aldo showed an aptitude for observation, spending hours counting and cataloging birds near his home. Mary would later say of her older brother, [...] "He was very much an outdoorsman, even in his extreme youth. He was <b>always</b> <b>out</b> climbing around the bluffs, or going down to the river, or going across the river into the woods." [...] He attended Prospect Hill Elementary, where he ranked {{at the top of his}} class, and then, the overcrowded Burlington High School.

2500|$|Rogers {{identified}} the [...] "real self" [...] as {{the aspect of}} one's being that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic valuing, needs and receives positive regard and self-regard. It is the [...] "you" [...] that, if all goes well, you will become. On the other hand, {{to the extent that}} our society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency, and we are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, and receive only conditional positive regard and self-regard, we develop instead an [...] "ideal self". [...] By ideal, Rogers is suggesting something not real, something that is <b>always</b> <b>out</b> of our reach, the standard we cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the [...] "I am" [...] and the [...] "I should" [...] is called incongruity.|$|E

In a speech at Chatham House for the launch of the book on 6 September, he advised Thatcher to fight the next general election on a nationalist theme as many Eastern European nations previously under Russian rule were gaining their freedom. At the Conservative Party conference in October, he told a fringe meeting, [...] "I find myself today less on the fringe of that party than I have done for 20 years". After Thatcher resisted further European integration at a meeting at Strasbourg in November Powell asked her parliamentary private secretary Mark Lennox-Boyd to pass to her [...] "my respectful congratulations on her stand... she both spoke for Britain and gave a lead to Europe—in the line of succession of Winston Churchill and William Pitt. Those who lead are <b>always</b> <b>out</b> in front, alone". Thatcher replied, [...] "I am deeply touched by your words. They give me the greatest possible encouragement".|$|E
