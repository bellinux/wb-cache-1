5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body {{and pulls out a}} sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
25|$|In the UK music video, Gary Lightbody lies on {{open ground}} as cameras film him from {{different}} angles. It starts raining, splashing {{his face and}} hands. Gary enters {{a pool of water}} next to him and, {{at the end of the}} video, he gets out of the water, rises to his feet <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the camera as it zooms out overhead.|$|E
500|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), {{recovering}} from his Borg assimilation, visits his family's vineyard in La Barre, France, which {{is run by}} his elder brother Robert (Jeremy Kemp) {{along with his wife}} Marie (Samantha Eggar) and son René (David Birkin). Jean-Luc is considering a position on earth with an underwater research project called Atlantis. Robert has always been jealous of his brother's success and is concerned that Jean-Luc's presence will drive René to also join Starfleet. The two have a bitter argument and end up wrestling each other in a mud puddle, eventually culminating in an emotional reunion, with Jean-Luc admitting his sense of powerlessness and guilt at the things he did while {{under the influence of the}} Borg. Robert states that Jean-Luc will have to learn to live with what he did, regardless of where he goes. [...] Jean-Luc decides to go back to the Enterprise. The two spend the night getting drunk as they resolve their differences. After Jean-Luc leaves, Robert decides to let René follow his dream to join Starfleet as René sits under a tree <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> space.|$|E

500|$|As {{the final}} verse {{of the song}} begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a {{stalking}} cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it {{over her shoulder and}} it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, [...] "Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind".|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the verses}} in Ezekiel and its {{attendant}} commentaries, his vision consists of a chariot made of many heavenly beings driven by the [...] "Likeness of a Man." [...] The base structure of the chariot is composed of four beings. These beings are called the [...] "living creatures" [...] (Hebrew: חיות hayyot or khayyot). The bodies of the creatures are [...] "like that of a human being", but each of them has four faces, corresponding to the four directions the chariot can go (East, South, North and West). The faces are that of a man, a lion, an ox (later changed to a cherub in Ezekiel [...] ) and an eagle. Since there are four angels and each has four faces, there are a total of sixteen faces. Each [...] "Hayyot" [...] angel also has four wings. Two of these wings spread across {{the length of the}} chariot and connect with the wings of the angel on the other side. This creates a sort of 'box' of wings that forms the perimeter of the chariot. With the remaining two wings, each angel covers its own body. Below, but not attached to, the feet of the [...] "Hayyot" [...] angels are other angels that are shaped like wheels. These wheel angels, which are described as [...] "a wheel inside of a wheel", are called [...] "Ophanim" [...] אופנים (lit. wheels, cycles or ways). These wheels are not directly under the chariot but are nearby and along its perimeter. The angel with the face of the man is always on the east side <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the [...] "Likeness of a Man" [...] that drives the chariot. The [...] "Likeness of a Man" [...] sits on a throne made of sapphire.|$|E

60|$|By and by {{we moved}} out, for 'twas eleven o'clock, and stands a bit upon the sidewalk. And {{then the man}} says he must be going home, and invites me and Tobin to walk that way.

60|$|To the civilised poet, {{the fancy}} becomes a {{beautiful}} simile; to a savage poet, {{it would have}} become a material and a very formidable fact. He stands in the valley, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the boulder on the far-off fells. He is puzzled by it. He fears it. At last he makes up his mind. It is alive. As the shadows move over it, he sees it move. May it not sleep there all day, and prowl for prey all night? He had been always afraid of going up those fells; now he will never go. There is a monster there.|$|E
60|$|The two men {{seize the}} two women, and push them, still violently abusing one another, into the house. Sir Pearce {{slams the door}} upon them savagely. Immediately a heavenly silence falls on the summer afternoon. The two sit down out of breath: {{and for a long}} time nothing is said. Sir Pearce sits on an iron chair. O'Flaherty sits on the garden seat. The thrush begins to sing melodiously. O'Flaherty cocks his ears, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> it. A smile spreads over his troubled features. Sir Pearce, with a long sigh, takes out his pipe and begins to fill it.|$|E

There was about half-a-dozen of us {{stretched}} round, and the cat was sitting before the fire fussing itself up.

[...] I signalled to her to keep quiet, and Bill went on with his yarn. When {{he got to the}} part about the sharks, she turned deliberately round and looked at him. I tell you there was an expression of disgust on that cat's face as might have made a travelling Cheap Jack feel ashamed of himself. It was that human, I give you my word, sir, I forgot for the moment as the poor animal couldn't speak. I could see the words that were on its lips: [...] "Why don't you tell us you swallowed the anchor?" [...] and I sat on tenter-hooks, fearing each instant that she would say them aloud.

60|$|Romola's astonishment {{could hardly}} have been greater if the {{stranger}} had worn a panther-skin and carried a thyrsus; for the cunning barber had said nothing of the Greek's age or appearance; and among her father's scholarly visitors, she had hardly ever seen any but middle-aged or grey-headed men. There was only one masculine face, at once youthful and beautiful, the image of which remained deeply impressed on her mind: it was that of her brother, who long years ago had taken her on his knee, kissed her, and never come back again: a fair face, with sunny hair, like her own. But the habitual attitude of her mind towards strangers--a proud self-dependence and determination to ask for nothing even by a smile--confirmed in her by her father's complaints against the world's injustice, was like a snowy embankment hemming in the rush of admiring surprise. Tito's bright face showed its rich-tinted beauty without any rivalry of colour above his black sajo or tunic reaching to the knees. It seemed like a wreath of spring, dropped suddenly in Romola's young but wintry life, which had inherited nothing but memories--memories of a dead mother, of a lost brother, of a blind father's happier time--memories of far-off light, love, and beauty, that lay embedded in dark mines of books, and could hardly give out their brightness again until they were kindled for her by the torch of some known joy. Nevertheless, she returned Tito's bow, made to her on entering, with the same pale proud face as ever; but, as he approached, the snow melted, and when he ventured to look towards her again, while Nello was speaking, a pink flush overspread her face, to vanish again almost immediately, as if her imperious will had recalled it. Tito's glance, on the contrary, had that gentle, beseeching admiration in it which is the most propitiating of appeals to a proud, shy woman, and is perhaps the only atonement a man can make for being too handsome. The finished fascination of his air came chiefly from the absence of demand and assumption. It was that of a fleet, soft-coated, dark-eyed animal that delights you by not bounding away in indifference from you, and unexpectedly pillows its chin on your palm, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> you desiring to be stroked--as if it loved you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{last time}} me and Mrs Boffin saw the poor boy,' said Mr Boffin, warming (as fat usually does) with a {{tendency}} to melt, 'he was a child of seven year old. For {{when he came back}} to make intercession for his sister, me and Mrs Boffin were away overlooking a country contract which was to be sifted before carted, and he was come and gone in a single hour. I say he was a child of seven year old. He was going away, all alone and forlorn, to that foreign school, and he come into our place, situate up the yard of the present Bower, to have a warm at our fire. There was his little scanty travelling clothes upon him. There was his little scanty box outside in the shivering wind, which I was going to carry for him down to the steamboat, as the old man wouldn't hear of allowing a sixpence coach-money. Mrs Boffin, then quite a young woman and pictur of a full-blown rose, stands him by her, kneels down at the fire, warms her two open hands, and falls to rubbing his cheeks; but seeing the tears come into the child's eyes, the tears come fast into her own, and she holds him round the neck, like as if she was protecting him, and cries to me, [...] "I'd give the wide wide world, I would, to run away with him!" [...] I don't say but what it cut me, and but what {{it at the same time}} heightened my feelings of admiration for Mrs Boffin. The poor child clings to her for awhile, as she clings to him, and then, when the old man calls, he says [...] "I must go! God bless you!" [...] and for a moment rests his heart against her bosom, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> both of us, as if it was in pain--in agony. Such a look! I went aboard with him (I gave him first what little treat I thought he'd like), and I left him when he had fallen asleep in his berth, and I came back to Mrs Boffin. But tell her what I would of how I had left him, it all went for nothing, for, according to her thoughts, he never changed that look that he had looked up at us two. But it did one piece of good. Mrs Boffin and me had no child of our own, and had sometimes wished that how we had one. But not now. [...] "We might both of us die," [...] says Mrs Boffin, [...] "and other eyes might see that lonely look in our child." [...] So of a night, when it was very cold, or when the wind roared, or the rain dripped heavy, she would wake sobbing, and call out in a fluster, [...] "Don't you see the poor child's face? O shelter the poor child!"--till in course of years it gently wore out, as many things do.' ...|$|E
