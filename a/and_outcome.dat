5|$|Debate exists {{over the}} {{significance}} <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> of the battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking {{power of the}} 5th Guards Tank Army, but {{they were unable to}} take Prokhorovka or break through into open ground before developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. For the Soviet side, the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July.|$|E

At present, its greatest clinical value is likely to be as a predictive variant for severity and onset of Alzheimer's disease and cystic fibrosis.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the quality of nursing diagnoses, interventions, <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> in an acute care hospital following the implementation of an educational program. METHOD: In a pretest-posttest experimental design study, nurses from 12 wards of a Swiss hospital received an educational intervention [...] an introductory class and consecutive classes, using a case discussion method [...] to implement nursing diagnoses, interventions, <b>and</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Two sets of 36 randomly selected nursing records were evaluated before and after implementation. The quality of documented nursing diagnoses, interventions, <b>and</b> nursing-sensitive patient <b>outcomes</b> was assessed by 29 Likert-type items with a 0 - 4 scale instrument, called Quality of Nursing Diagnoses, Interventions, <b>and</b> <b>Outcomes</b> (Q-DIO) <b>and</b> tested using t-tests. FINDINGS: Significant enhancements in the quality of documented nursing diagnoses, interventions, <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> were found following the implementation of a planned educational program. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of NANDA, NIC, and NOC (NNN) nursing diagnoses, interventions, <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> led to higher quality of nursing diagnosis documentation, etiology-specific nursing interventions, <b>and</b> nursing-sensitive patient <b>outcomes.</b> IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Educational measures support nurses to improve documentation of diagnoses, interventions, <b>and</b> <b>outcomes.</b> The Q-DIO is a useful audit tool...|$|R
40|$|Provider payment {{systems for}} mental health care that incentivise cost control and quality {{improvement}} have been a policy focus {{in a number of}} countries. In England, a new prospective provider payment system is being introduced to mental health that should encourage providers to control costs <b>and</b> improve <b>outcomes.</b> The aim of this research is to investigate the relationship between costs <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> to ascertain whether there is a trade-off between controlling costs <b>and</b> improving <b>outcomes.</b> The main data source is the Mental Health Minimum Data Set (MHMDS) for the years 2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13. Costs are calculated using NHS Reference Cost data while outcomes are measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS). We estimate a bivariate multi-level model with costs <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> simultaneously. We calculate the correlation and plot the pairwise relationship between residual costs <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> at the provider level. After controlling for a range of demographic, need, social and treatment variables, residual variation in costs <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> remains at the provider level. The correlation between residual costs <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> is negative, but very small suggesting that cost-containment efforts by providers should not undermine outcome-improving efforts under the new payment system...|$|R

5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention <b>and</b> <b>outcome.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked {{there for two}} years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew {{on the development of}} diagnostic tests for echinococcosis. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on the frequency <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited).|$|E
5|$|Most {{parts of}} the {{fortress}} were finished during the First World War, and many minor works were started and completed {{during the course of}} the war. Even though Sweden remained neutral during the First and Second World War, the start <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> of both had large impact on the fortress. Finland's independence during the First World War created a buffer state between Sweden and Imperial Russia's successor state, the Soviet Union, which radically changed the strategic value of northern Sweden, put the usefulness of Boden Fortress into question. Only the most basic needs were satisfied during the interwar period; even apparent needsbased on the experiences from the warsuch as better air defence and fortifications to halt or temporarily impede attacks by armoured forces were neglected. Thanks to local commanders, construction of new fortifications and improvements to already existing ones were done with the help of garrisoned troops. Engineer companies built new shelters and trenches as training, and the telephone network was improved and completed by the garrisoned telegraph company. This cut the cost drastically as the only expenditure was the needed material.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{management}} of diabetes between 2001 and 2007 in the United Kingdom and to assess whether changes {{in the quality of}} care reflect existing temporal trends or are {{a direct result of the}} implementation of the quality <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> framework. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 147 general practices (annual list size over 1 million) across the UK. Patients People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual prevalence of diabetes and attainment of process <b>and</b> clinical <b>outcomes</b> over the three years before and the three years after the introduction of the quality <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> framework. RESULTS: Significant improvements in process <b>and</b> intermediate <b>outcome</b> measures were observed during the six year period, with consecutive annual improvements observed before the introduction of incentives. However, the current diagnostic case definition for the quality <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> framework does not capture up to two thirds of people with type 1 diabetes and a third of people with type 2 diabetes. After the introduction of the quality <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> framework, existing trends of improvement in glycaemic control, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure were attenuated, particularly in people with diabetes who did not meet the case definition of the quality <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> framework. The introduction of the quality <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> framework did not lead to improvement in {{the management of}} patients with type 1 diabetes, nor to a reduction in the number of patients with type 2 diabetes who had HbA(1 c) levels greater than 10 %. Introduction of the quality <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> framework may have increased the number of patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA(1 c) levels of <or= 7. 5 %; odds ratio 1. 05 (95 % confidence interval 1. 01 to 1. 09; P= 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: The management of people with diabetes has improved since the late 1990 s, but the impact of the quality <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> framework on care is not straightforward; upper thresholds may need to be removed or targets made more challenging if people are to benefit. Many patients in whom care may be suboptimal may not be captured in the quality <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> framework assessment...|$|R

25|$|Valve added random skin rewards {{as part of}} {{an update}} to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in 2013, believing that players would use these to trade with other players and bolster both the player {{community}} and its Steam marketplace. A number of websites were created to bypass monetary restrictions Valve set on the Steam marketplace to aid in high-value trading and allowing users to receive cash value for skins. Some of these sites subsequently added the ability to gamble on the results of professional matches or in games of chance with these skins, which in 2016 was estimated to handle around $5 billion of the virtual goods. These sites, along with Valve and various video game streamers, have come under scrutiny due to ethical and legal questions relating to gambling on sporting matches, underage gambling, undisclosed promotion, <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> rigging. Evidence of such unethical practices was discovered in June 2016, and led to two formal lawsuits filed against these sites and Valve in the following month. Valve subsequently has taken steps to stop such sites from using Steam's interface for enabling gambling, leading to about half of these sites to close down, while driving more of the skin gambling into an underground economy.|$|E
