Not long after he graduated college, McHale pitched {{the idea for the}} film, among other concepts, to Cartoon Network. At the time, the network was considering the creation of a department for feature films, though this never came to fruition. McHale was <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to adapt the idea for Tome of the Unknown to feature length. This proved unsuccessful as he felt it needed to be episodic, laying out plans for a full television series consisting of three seasons.|$|E

It came to the court’s attention that Tobias Andersson, a future witness in the case, was in the court where he was later asked to leave the room. When it was movie industry lawyer Monique Wadsted’s turn, she introduced new evidence without warning.

25|$|England {{obviously}} {{needed to}} do something to maintain their hold on the Ashes and three changes were made to the team. The first was forced as Godfrey Evans had broken his middle finger and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman made his Test debut. This was not so much of a loss as first thought, Evans had not batted well for some years and Swetman had impressed behind the stumps throughout the tour and his batting had improved beyond all hopes. Peter Richardson had failed repeatedly as an opening batsman in the Tests and was replaced by his old opening partner Arthur Milton, even though he had broken his finger at Christmas. Willie Watson was dropped in favour of the newly arrived Cambridge and Sussex batsman Ted Dexter, who was also a more than useful swing bowler. May also had his final trump card, the fast bowler Fred Trueman, who had been ill at Brisbane and left out at Melbourne. He is widely considered to be England's greatest fast bowler and with good reason; he was the first man to take 300 wickets in Tests—307 at (21.57)—had tremendous stamina and bowled with a near perfect side on action that produced late swing at high pace. He was full of confidence and believed that he could get any batsman out on any wicket. Australia made changes as well, dropping Lindsay Kline who had taken 0/77 in two Tests and Bobby Simpson who had made a duck but was retained as twelfth man for his fielding. Instead they brought in the dual purpose fast-medium seamer and off-spinner Keith Slater, who had been twelfth man in the Second Test, but who had been accused of throwing by the MCC and Keith Miller. Mel McInnes kept his place as umpire even though Peter May and Freddie Brown had pointedly <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary for him to officiate in all the Tests.|$|E

When <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> exhausting to promote socialist reforms Folkvord said, [...] "It is. But I think in some ways easier than before [...] fake socialist regimes have collapsed". Another opinion of his was that [...] "capitalism destroys the natural environment around us making the bourgeois society planners understand that there must be something new in the future. This provides inspiration to win support for socialist beliefs in Norway". Folkvord's first contact with anti-capitalist beliefs came when he joined the Workers' Communist Party. The party told him about [...] "capitalist barbarism" [...] and how the wealthy controlled everything. Folkvord said he believed that [...] " [...] can't be the end of human development", and that he believes humans are destined to create another more-just system.|$|E

His requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens. These would be a test of his theory: previously aspects such as coloration {{of plants and animals}} had often been regarded as having no adaptive function. For example, Thomas Henry Huxley was strongly influenced by German idealism and in 1856 had <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "to be supposed for a moment that the beauty of colour and outline... are any good to the animals?... Who has ever dreamed of finding an utilitarian purpose in the forms and colours of flowers... ?" [...] Darwin had, and in the orchids he tackled the most difficult case.

500|$|Pfefferberg, {{one of the}} Schindlerjuden, made it his life's {{mission to}} tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg {{attempted}} to produce a biopic of Oskar Schindler with MGM in 1963, with Howard Koch writing, but the deal fell through. In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel Schindler's Ark, which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980. MCA president Sid Sheinberg sent director Steven Spielberg a New York Times review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> true.

[...] "What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?"

In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.|$|E

500|$|Following Peddle's resignation, Leech wrote a conciliatory {{letter to}} Palmer, who responded regretting {{that the three}} of them had not worked together, rather than at cross-purposes.

[...] Barber prepared sketches and rejected the idea, stating that the building would appear a mere streak on the coin in the required low relief. [...] Instead, he favored a sketch prepared by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan, showing a kneeling woman spinning flax, with a distaff in her hands. [...] Leech was not fully satisfied with the proposal, stating that the juxtaposition of Isabella on the obverse and the Morgan reverse was [...] "too much woman". Before accepting Morgan's design, Leech wanted Barber to produce some reverses himself, which the chief engraver did, and Bosbyshell forwarded them to Leech on April 11 and 12. [...] These showed various uses of a heraldic eagle. [...] After considering these efforts, Leech decided on Morgan's design and wrote to Palmer accordingly, stating that [...] "the distaff is used in art to symbolize patient industry, and especially the industry of women." [...] In response, the Lady Managers suggested the use of the building's portal, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to place a living person on the coin.
