5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{other parts}} of the myth, the {{resolution}} is complex and varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.|$|E

25|$|On the {{simplest}} level, Hogarth portrays {{the inhabitants of}} Beer Street as happy and healthy, nourished by the native English ale, and {{those who live in}} Gin Lane as destroyed by their addiction to the foreign spirit of gin; but, <b>as</b> <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of Hogarth's works, closer inspection uncovers other targets of his satire, and reveals that the poverty of Gin Lane and the prosperity of Beer Street are more intimately connected than they at first appear. Gin Lane shows shocking scenes of infanticide, starvation, madness, decay and suicide, while Beer Street depicts industry, health, bonhomie and thriving commerce.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> UK canals, {{the arrival}} of the {{railways}} led to the decline of the canal. By 1845, the spectre of railway competition was looming large, and the proposals for the Trent and Mersey Company to merge with a railway company were causing concern. It was discussed at the 1845 general meeting, as it seemed likely that such a move would be detrimental to the Macclesfield Canal. They tried to cut costs by reducing the number of staff and lowering their wages, all the while reducing tolls in an attempt to retain traffic. They had ceased to pay dividends to the shareholders after a final payment of £1.50 in 1840.|$|E
25|$|Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} western edge of the Pennsylvania frontier. The pacifist Quakers {{generally}} had good relations with the Native Americans—but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to relocate further west. Boone received his first rifle in 1749, beginning his lifelong love of hunting. Folk tales often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone is hunting in the woods with some other boys. The scream of a panther scatters the boys, except for Boone, who calmly cocks his squirrel gun and shoots the animal through the heart just as it leaps at him. <b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> tales about Boone, the story may or may not be true, but it was told so often that it became part of the popular image of the man.|$|E

50|$|The Exercitationes excited much attention, {{though they}} contain {{little or nothing}} beyond what others had already {{advanced}} against Aristotle. The first book expounds clearly, and with much vigour, the evil effects of the blind acceptance of the Aristotelian dicta on physical and philosophical study; but, <b>as</b> occurs <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of the anti-Aristotelian works of this period, the objections show the usual ignorance of Aristotle's own writings. The second book, which contains the review of Aristotle's dialectic or logic, throughout reflects Ramism in tone and method.

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> late Elizabethan {{conspiracy}} theories Spanish calculations {{may have been}} of less importance {{than those of the}} queen's councillors. At the outset in 1599 Essex had realised he was taking a risk in departing the court and leaving the field open to Cecil, a risk that would pay off only if he defeated O'Neill. The Irish campaign proved far more difficult than anticipated - Essex was the last English commander of the age to underestimate rebel capability - and the situation at court deteriorated rapidly, with Cecil gaining an overwhelming influence over the queen. The private parley with O'Neill was especially significant at a time when Cecil was preparing the succession of the Scots king, James VI, to Elizabeth's throne. Essex's flight from Ireland was a desperate attempt to interfere with those preparations, and once this had failed his subsequent treason was down to his refusal to accept that it was Cecil, and not he, who would determine the succession.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to their suitability for racing, in terms of power-to-weight, Ossa motorcycles soon gained a reputation for reliability {{on and off the}} track. Despite this growing enthusiasm for the beautifully crafted and rugged bikes themselves, the firm suffered from a disorganized and sparse dealer network in the important American market. Ironically, the motorcycle boom that created a new market and allowed the European makers to reap great financial rewards, was also the seed of their own demise, and that of the numerous smaller firms, such <b>as</b> Ossa. <b>With</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> choices for both buyers and dealers, sales and service networks were not sustainable, and attempts to improve manufacturing by investing in new factories back home put Ossa, like virtually every other European firm, deep into the red.|$|R

Pooley became angry at this, banging the table to show he had no feeling in his fingers and that it was cricket rather than [...] "rheumatics" [...] that had put him in the workhouse. [...] He took Pullin outside to show he could still catch a ball. [...] Pooley lived on until 1907, dying in poverty, while his team mates from the 1877 tour were lauded as the first Test cricketers.|$|E

She would think of the squire, and resolve to reject Frank; and would then remember Lady Arabella, and resolve to accept him. Her resolutions, however, were most irresolute; and so, when Frank appeared in person before her, carrying his heart in his hand, she did not know what answer to make to him.

60|$|In {{this case}} the old belief of rudiments having been created to {{complete}} the scheme of nature is so far from holding good, that all ordinary rules are completely broken through. The view which seems the most probable is that some early progenitor of Onitis acquired, like other Lamellicorns, horns {{on the head and}} thorax, and then transferred them, in a rudimentary condition, <b>as</b> <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> existing species, to the female, by whom they have ever since been retained. The subsequent loss of the horns by the male may have resulted through the principle of compensation from the development of the projections on the lower surface, whilst the female has not been thus affected, as she is not furnished with these projections, and consequently has retained the rudiments of the horns on the upper surface. Although this view is supported by the case of Bledius immediately to be given, yet the projections on the lower surface differ greatly in structure and development in the males of the several species of Onitis, and are even rudimentary in some; nevertheless the upper surface in all these species is quite destitute of horns. As secondary sexual characters are so eminently variable, {{it is possible that the}} projections on the lower surface may have been first acquired by some progenitor of Onitis and produced their effect through compensation, and then have been in certain cases almost completely lost.|$|E
60|$|It may be {{observed}} in Tables 4.23 to 4.25 {{that some of the}} illegitimate unions yielded during neither year a single seed; but, judging from the long-styled plants, it is probable, if such unions were to be effected repeatedly by the aid of insects under the most favourable conditions, some few seeds would be produced in every case. Anyhow, it is certain that in all twelve illegitimate unions the pollen-tubes penetrated the stigma in the course of eighteen hours. At first I thought that two kinds of pollen placed together on the same stigma would perhaps yield more seed than one kind by itself; but we have seen that this is not so with each form's own two kinds of pollen; nor is it probable in any case, as I occasionally got, by the use of a single kind of pollen, fully as many seeds as a capsule naturally fertilised ever produces. Moreover the pollen from a single anther is far more than sufficient to fertilise fully a stigma; hence, in this <b>as</b> <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> other plants, more than twelve times as much of each kind of pollen is produced as is necessary to ensure the full fertilisation of each form. From the dusted condition of the bodies of the bees which I caught on the flowers, it is probable that pollen of various kinds is often deposited on all three stigmas; but from the facts already given with respect to the two forms of Primula, there can hardly be a doubt that pollen from the stamens of corresponding length placed on a stigma would be prepotent over any other kind of pollen and obliterate its effects,--even if the latter had been placed on the stigma some hours previously.|$|E
