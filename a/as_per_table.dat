50|$|The {{permissible}} built-up {{construction in}} the area allotted to AIIMS is 50.92 per cent <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>Table</b> 14.2 of the notified Master Plan. The Building Construction Regulation Bye Laws 2014, restricts the ground coverage of such institutional buildings to 35 per cent as per clause 26 (1) (c). Therefore, the AIIMS construction would cover a maximum area of 35 per cent of the plot area and leave the balance 65 per cent as open space. The wetlands, hills, rivers, natural streams, forest constitute only 20.25 per cent of the plot area. Hence this area obviously need not be touched at all.|$|E

In the first experiment four different applications are subjected to a non-bursty workload, i.e., exponential session arrivals, over a planning horizon of 4 h with a resource allocation interval of 1 h. In each resource allocation interval, the number of database instance cores is kept constant at 1 for each application. Initially, all applications are allocated one web server instance in each resource allocation interval. The maximum number of available web server instances per resource allocation interval is set to 7.

Getting the systems ip address in a LAN and decides the source, destination and the intermediate systems for our routing process. Using any database form the routing table with columns like source address, destination address and router addresses. After creating the routing table enters the ip {{address in the}} respective columns. As per this procedure by comparing ip addresses in the routing table the packet will be forward to next ip address. The ip addresses in the routing table, are the path selected by the user according to the respective path the packet will be forward and finally reach destination. Source generate a packet and forward to ip address which is in router ip <b>as</b> <b>per</b> in routing <b>table.</b> Source need {{to know whether the}} packet received by authenticated router or not thus each router send an acknowledgement packet to the source. Thus each and every router follows the same procedure to avoid unauthenticated router access in a routing process. As per acknowledgement received from each router source finds out the unauthenticated router access. As per security concern added the signature scheme in a routing process. Before send the packet, source generates the signature with peer ID of destination then forwards the packet to the ip address <b>as</b> <b>per</b> routing <b>table.</b> The packet will be decrypted only the system matched with the signature otherwise just forwards the packet to the next system. Tracer routing is to find out the unauthorized router access in a routing process. This is verifying by getting acknowledgment from each and every router in the routing process by a source. Then source compare the acknowledgement with the predefined routing table if any ip mismatch then it will be consider as unauthorized ip...|$|R
