There is no laboratory test for {{post-polio syndrome}}, nor <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> specific diagnostic criteria. Three important criteria are recognized, including: previous diagnosis of polio, long interval after recovery and the gradual onset of weakness.|$|E
25|$|Censure is {{the public}} reprimanding of a public {{official}} for inappropriate conduct or voting behavior. When the president is censured, it serves only as a condemnation and has no direct effect on the validity of presidency, nor <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> particular legal consequences. Unlike impeachment, censure has no basis in the Constitution or in {{the rules of the}} Senate and House of Representatives. It derives from the formal condemnation of either congressional body of their own members.|$|E

Induction supposes similarity among phenomena; [...] and when such similarity is discovered, it reduces the phenomena [...] under a common statement. The similarity of terrestrial gravity to [...] celestial attraction enables the two to be expressed as one [...] phenomenon. The similarity between capillary attraction, solution, [...] the operation of cements, etc., leads to their being regarded not as [...] a plurality, but as a unity, a single causative link, the operation [...] of a single agency.... If it be asked whether we can merge gravity [...] itself in some still higher law, the answer must depend upon the [...] facts. <b>Are</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> forces, at present held distinct from [...] gravity, that we may hope to make fraternize with it, so as to join [...] in constituting a higher unity? Gravity is an attractive force; and [...] another great attractive force is cohesion, or the force that binds [...] together the atoms of solid matter. Might we, then, join these two [...] in a still higher unity, expressed under a more comprehensive law? [...] Certainly we might, but not to any advantage. The two kinds of force [...] agree in the one point, attraction, but they agree in no other; [...] indeed, {{in the manner of}} the attraction, they differ widely; so [...] widely that we should have to state totally distinct laws for each. [...] Gravity is common to all matter, and equal in amount in equal masses [...] of matter, whatever be the kind; it follows the law of the diffusion [...] of space from a point (the inverse square of the distance); it [...] extends to distances unlimited; it is indestructible and invariable. [...] Cohesion is special for each separate substance; it decreases [...] according to distance much more rapidly than the inverse square, [...] vanishing entirely at very small distances. Two such forces have not [...] sufficient kindred to be generalized into one force; the [...] generalization is only illusory; the statement of the difference [...] would still make two forces; while the consideration of one would [...] not in any way simplify the phenomena of the other, as happened in [...] the generalization of gravity itself.” ...|$|E
