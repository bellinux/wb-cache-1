40|$|Pulverised {{coal firing}} {{has been the}} {{dominant}} technology for generating power in utility boilers for almost a century. During this period, boiler designs have evolved through an accumulating collection of knowledge {{that has led to}} many empirical relationships that still guide current and future design directions to some degree. In the late 1940 s the developed nations began to undertake coal research based on scientific principles to ensure the most efficient use of the primary energy resource represented by coal. As the body of scientific knowledge on the physics and chemistry of coal combustion grew, it was used to direct the improvements to efficiency required and, later, the control of pollutants produced during the combustion of coal. This involves not only the control of emissions of particulates, SOx and oxides of nitrogen but also of trace elements, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and, increasingly, CO 2. There {{have been a number of}} developments in the coal-fired power generation sector including cofiring with secondary fuels, particularly biomass and waste and the development of radically different combustion systems (for example, oxyfuel) to meet carbon capture and storage requirements. This report sets out the recent advances in this area of coal science and how they are being brought to bear on the current challenges in the field of pulverised coal combustion. <b>Acronyms</b> <b>and</b> <b>abbreviation...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrently, {{with the}} rise of online communities, {{communication}} has shifted away from traditional modes that have long been based on face-to- face models of interaction, to a more digital approach such as social networks. Thus the acquisition of online literacy in social networks such as Facebook might create a gap or linguistic difference that distinguishes generation Y aged from 20 to 30 years old who are the active users of Facebook from the baby boomers aged from 40 years and above who are adopters of social network. Hence, the aim {{of this study is to}} examine topics they post, use of non standard language and the use of multimedia application in social network to highlight the issues that could allow misunderstandings to occur in social network conversation. The data is derived from the ‘status’ of selected Facebook users and analyzed qualitatively. The pilot findings show that there are differences in term of spelling innovations <b>and</b> capitalization, <b>acronym</b> <b>and</b> <b>abbreviation,</b> emoticons <b>and</b> punctuations. In the matter of content, baby boomers posts are more informative, direct and in order compared to generation Y. Baby boomers are also more likely to respond to the comments that are relevant to their post compared to generation Y. This study proposes that in order to minimize the differences and bridge the communication gaps generation Y need to formalize their writing and avoid unnecessary spelling innovations, capitalization, <b>abbreviation,</b> emoticons <b>and</b> punctuations that can course uncertainty to baby boomers. At the same time baby boomers should also be aware of the online literacy to mingle with the future generations...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: Abbreviations are an {{important}} type of terminology in the biomedical domain. Although several groups have already created databases of biomedical abbreviations, these are either not public, or are not comprehensive, or focus exclusively on acronymtype abbreviations. We have created another abbreviation database, ADAM, which covers commonly used <b>abbreviations</b> <b>and</b> their definitions (or long-forms) within MEDLINE titles and abstracts, including both <b>acronym</b> <b>and</b> non-acronym <b>abbreviations.</b> Results: A model of recognizing <b>abbreviations</b> <b>and</b> their long forms from titles and abstracts of MEDLINE (2006 baseline) was employed.

We propose a new character-level edit distance sensitive to prefixes called root distance and a token-level similarity algorithm for fuzzy acronym detection. Additionally, a WSD strategy using an ontology-based semantic relatedness measure is used to solve the inherent ambiguity of some entities.

Euphemism is a study on sociolinguistics concerned with polite meaning that is inferred from an utterance of sentence. The researcher used descriptive qualitative research. The data are in the form of utterances or words from the World View section of Newsweek magazine published on 1 st, 8 th, 22 nd and 29 th of January 2007. In the data analysis, the researcher used some processes of analysis they are: (1) categorizing the data which are euphemism types, style and function. (2) analyzing the data then interpreting the data, and (3) the last process is making conclusion from the analysis.
