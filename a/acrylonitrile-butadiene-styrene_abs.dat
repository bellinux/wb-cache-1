50|$|The A-1 is {{the high}} {{technology}} standard bearer of the landmark Canon amateur level A-series SLRs. The {{other members of the}} A-series are the Canon AE-1 (released 1976), AT-1 (1977), AV-1 (1979), AE-1 Program (1981) and AL-1 (1982). They all use the same compact aluminum alloy chassis, but with differing feature levels and outer cosmetic <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (<b>ABS)</b> plastic panels. By sharing most major components, and an inexpensive horizontal cloth-curtain shutter, costs could be spread out over a larger production volumes. The A-1 represented Canon's bid to defeat Nikon through more features and the cheapest price.|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} its {{cost-cutting}} philosophy, Canon designed the AE-1 {{to use a}} significant amount of structural plastic for a lighter and cheaper camera at the expense of being less impact resistant. Canon went to great effort to disguise the use of plastic - the injection-molded <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (<b>ABS)</b> for the top panel finished with ether satin chrome (or black enameled) to give {{the look and feel of}} metal. The bottom plate were made of brass and then finished with satin chrome (or black enameled). Extensive use of electronics also allowed simpler modular internal construction instead of mechanical linkages. Five major and 25 minor internal modules reduced the individual parts count by over 300. Modular construction, in turn, allowed automated production lines in order to reduce cost. Unfortunately, cost concerns also resulted in the use of plastic in some of the moving/operating mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} compact F-series SLRs, the FA used a plastic top plate: {{fiberglass}} reinforced polycarbonate {{for the black}} bodies, <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (<b>ABS)</b> for the chrome ones. The FA also used the ultra-fast, bearing-mounted, honeycomb-patterned, titanium-bladed shutter and through-the-lens (TTL) off-the-film (OTF) electronic flash automation of the FE2, but added a digital liquid crystal display (LCD) information panel at the top left of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, through-the-lens (TTL) light meter versus the actual camera settings. Depending on the set exposure mode, the LCD would display +/- over/underexposure markers, HI/LO out of metering range warnings, shutter speed and/or f-stop. Unfortunately, the LCD could not be illuminated in low ambient light situations. The FA also had a removable finger grip, {{similar to the one}} introduced on the Nikon FG, and an eyepiece blind. However, the FA's real claim to fame was the AMP meter.|$|E

EMAA, PEGMA and EVA display superior healing or load recovery compared with ABS, SEBS and PVB with increasing healing events. For EMAA and PEGMA this is attributed to a pressure delivery mechanism, while for EVA, it is attributed to increased viscous flow and a highly elastomeric response to damage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (<b>ABS),</b> {{owing to}} its {{multiphase}} heterogeneity, has good service properties, especially, impact resistance.
