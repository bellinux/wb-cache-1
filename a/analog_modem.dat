50|$|A DSL filter or {{microfilter}} is {{an analog}} low-pass filter installed between analog devices (such as telephones or <b>analog</b> <b>modems)</b> and a {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) line. The DSL filter prevents interference between such devices and a {{digital subscriber line}} (DSL) service connected to the same line. Without DSL filters, signals or echoes from analog devices {{at the top of their}} frequency range can reduce performance and create connection problems with DSL service, while those from the DSL service at the bottom of its range can cause line noise and other problems for analog devices.|$|R

40|$|The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) 1 {{provides}} point-to-point digital {{communications and}} its most attractive feature {{is its ability}} to simultaneously transmit voice, images, video and data on existing telephone lines. The existing <b>analog</b> <b>modems</b> are suitable mainly for batch oriented and low speed telecomputing tasks but for tasks like high speed telecomputing and WWW browsing, they are ineffective. Leased circuits if used usually have higher installation and other recurring costs. For such applications ISDN presents an attractive technology that delivers the required speed in a cost effective, viable manner. In this paper we evaluate several ISDN applications and compare their performance with other current technologies.

5000|$|In 1999, the Portuguese {{fixed-line}} telephone market {{was set to}} be deregulated, ending the monopoly of Portugal Telecom, which prompted Sonaecom, then mainly a mobile phone operator through its brand Optimus, to enter that market. Clix was launched on October 27 of that year as a residential Internet Service Provider (ISP), together with sister brand Novis ({{fixed-line telephone}} service and business ISP). Both brands were supported on the merger of Sonae Redes de Dados (IT consultancy and network management) with IP Global, an ISP which had been acquired earlier in the same year. The initial service offer of Clix consisted of Freeserve-type free Internet access, collecting a proportion of the standard telephone line charges, by <b>analog</b> <b>modem</b> or ISDN, and an advertising-supported web portal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to examine the}} {{possibility}} of creating network topology maps automatically. The growth of the Internet introduces a number of practical problems an Internet Service Provider (ISP) has to face. The number of customers is still growing at the same time, as faster and faster connections are required. In just a few years home users changed from <b>analog</b> <b>modems</b> to Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line modems (ADSL-modems). This development implies that the backbone network of an ISP is in constant change. ISPs need tools to make development, planning and maintenance of networks easier. One useful tool is to have topology maps over the backbone networks, maps that contain as detailed information as possible about the hardware components in a network. This report studies a network, in this report called ISPNet, which is an Internet Protocol (IP) based network that provides Internet services. ISPNet shows how the backbone network of an ISP located in Sweden could be designed. I explore the structure and the design of ISPNet; based on this study I describe th...|$|R

40|$|Although new {{technologies}} such as xDSL and PONs will soon permit a direct and continuos access to Global Information Infrastructures, such as the Internet, of residential and SOHO (small office-home office) users, dial-up access via <b>analog</b> <b>modems</b> over PSTN remains the most frequent approach. The ever increasing number of Internet users adopting this access modality is leading to two kind of problems: (1) a dimensioning problem for the ISPs which have to properly define the number of modems to guarantee a low refuse probability for the incoming traffic (dial-up connections); (2) terrible implications on dimensioning problems of the PSTN which was designed {{on the basis of}} assumptions strongly modified by the new statistical nature of ISP access connections. The paper presents an extensive measurement analysis carried out collecting traffic data offered to an Internet Dial-up access server. The characterisation of the arrival process and the Call Holding Time (CHT) distribution is presented.
