However, they suffer from <b>link</b> <b>vibrations,</b> especially when operated {{at high speeds}} followed by sudden stops. This limitation has been addressed using techniques such as adaptive filters, adaptive strain feedback gain, state feedback control, etc. This article presents a filtered inverse controller for the mitigation of <b>link</b> <b>vibrations</b> in a multi-link flexible manipulator. To this end, the plant model, developed and linearized in Maple/Maplesim was inverted in MATLAB. The internal dynamics of the inverse model were stabilized using the state feedback technique. For safe and high-speed operations, the inverse model was augmented with a low pass filter to form the filtered inverse which was used as feedforward controller.

40|$|Trajectory {{planning}} {{is an effective}} feed-forward control technology for vibration suppression of flexible manipulators. However, the inherent drawback makes this strategy inefficient when dealing with modeling errors and disturbances. An optimal trajectory planning approach is proposed and applied to a flexible piezoelectric manipulator system in this paper, which {{is a combination of}} feed-forward trajectory planning method and feedback control of piezoelectric actuators. Specifically, the joint controller is responsible for the trajectory tracking and gross vibration suppression of the link during motion, while the active controller of actuators is expected to deal with the <b>link</b> <b>vibrations</b> after joint motion. In the procedure of trajectory planning, the joint angle of the link is expressed as a quintic polynomial function. And the sum of the <b>link</b> <b>vibration</b> energy is chosen as the objective function. Then, genetic algorithm is used to determine the optimal trajectory. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulation and experiments. Both the settling time and peak value of the <b>link</b> <b>vibrations</b> along the optimal trajectory reduce significantly, with the active control of the piezoelectric actuators...|$|R
30|$|Yet another {{vibration}} control measure {{is the use}} of digital filters and wave shaping. Conditioning of the manipulator excitation signal can reduce the <b>link</b> <b>vibration.</b> In [7], the authors employ a lowpass digital filter to attenuate some frequency contents on the input signal thereby suppressing <b>link</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters with bandstop frequency response have also been designed to eliminate the dominant strain frequencies in the feedback loop. The main limitation of these fixed frequency response filters is that changes in loading and trajectories may introduce new modes different from the design frequencies or shift the frequency response of the manipulator.|$|R

40|$|The Xemxija Bay area on {{the northeastern}} coast of Malta, Central Mediterranean, {{is an area of}} touristic, {{cultural}} and recreational importance whose geomorphological features are determined by the lithology and tectonics, namely a soft, clay stratum (Blue Clay) underlying a surface layer of hard limestone (Upper Coralline Limestone), and the presence of a parallel suite of normal faults that have produced a typical horst-and-graben topography. These features, together with the coastal environment, have resulted in an area of cliff instability, edge-parallel fractures and landslide bodies. The seismic site response of the area has been investigated by measuring the HVSR (horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio) of ambient noise at a set of points covering the range of different geological/geomorphological formations. The results indicate that the dynamic response of potentially unstable slopes can be very complex, exhibiting a considerable amplification as well as directional effects. HVSR curves indicate (a) in the landward, stable zone, a consistent 1 Hz – 2 Hz peak associated with the buried Blue Clay layer; (b) in the cliffedge zone, the presence of spectral ratio peaks linked both to the clay layer as well as the existence of fractures in the rock, and partly detached blocks; (c) on the landslide body, complex HVSR patterns which can be distinctly attributed both to stratigraphical boundaries as well as to natural oscillations of detached blocks. Directivity effects were analysed by rotating the horizontal components of the spectral ratios in steps of 10 o between 0 oN and 180 oN.

30|$|Passwords and PINs {{have the}} benefit of being {{familiar}} to users, as well as being easy to use and implement, even in legacy systems. In order to retain these benefits, research has been performed to attempt to strengthen passwords and PINs rather than replacing them. Vibrapass uses haptic interaction with a separate mobile device to improve the secrecy of entering a password or PIN into an easily observed public terminal, such as an ATM [21]. The mobile device, which is linked to the terminal during the interaction, vibrates to indicate that the user should enter an incorrect secret (i.e., an incorrect character in a password or PIN), while lack of vibration indicates that a correct entry is expected. Their study showed that the system was acceptable to users with about half the characters as incorrect secrets, while providing a higher security level. Such a system could easily be used for password and PIN entry on a mobile device, as was studied by Bianchi et al. in creating the Phone Lock method [22]. Phone Lock takes advantage of smartphone sensors to add non-visual audio and haptic cues, such as spoken numbers audible via earphones and <b>vibrations</b> <b>linked</b> to numbers, to PINs of various lengths. Their goal is to provide a PIN entry mechanism that is resistant to shoulder-surfing attacks, but retains the familiarity and ease-of-use attributed to PINs. Their results showed that the users were significantly faster entering the PIN via audio rather than vibration cues, and that the error rate remained insignificantly different between the two modalities [22]. These methods provide valuable insight into how passwords and PINs may be strengthened by using sensor information, but are not necessarily useful for transparent authentication. It may be argued that these methods are more invasive than simple passwords or PINs because they require additional knowledge or interaction as the price for increased security.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to generate the knowledge required to design compliant mechanisms that (1) attenuate undesired small-motion angular vibrations in rotational power transmission systems and (2) preserve the desired transmission of large-motion torque/angle inputs. This thesis investigates the design of vibration attenuating compliant mechanisms that are directly integrated into the load path of rotational systems. These devices enable designers to attenuate the amplitude of undesirable vibrations while simultaneously optimizing the transmission of torque inputs. The design, modeling, fabrication and experimental validation of two Compliant Vibration Attenuator (CVA) concepts will be presented. The first device, the Small Amplitude Vibration Isolator (SAVI), is a non-linear compliant device that isolates a resonating or non-resonating rotational system from vibrations by acting as a mechanical lowpass filter. The second device, the Damping <b>Vibration</b> <b>Link</b> (DVL) utilizes compliance and damping to attenuate undesired vibrations due to resonance. A linear lumped parameter model was created in Matlab® to simulate the static and dynamic characteristics of rotational power transmission systems. This model enables one to determine the dynamic characteristics of a system for a given set of inputs, thereby making it possible to (1) understand the requirements for the CVA and (2) ascertain the effect of the CVA on the system. Finite-element simulations were conducted to verify an empirical, parametric model that describes the performance of a SAVI as a function of its stiffness parameters. (cont.) Proof-of-concept prototypes were tested to verify performance predictions and to determine the practical issues related to implementation. The thesis concludes with a case study which demonstrates the effectiveness of a SAVI when integrated into the steering system of a light-duty pickup truck. The SAVI was shown to offer a 60 % reduction in vibration amplitude by trading off 7 ms of delay in steering wheel-vehicle response. by Spencer E. Szczesny. Thesis (S. M.)
