50|$|Tommy Thompson {{was born}} in Toronto on October 15, 1913. The second son of Casa Loma head {{gardener}} Robert Thompson, he was born {{on the grounds of}} one of Toronto's most famous landmarks. He graduated from the Ontario <b>Agricultural</b> College in <b>Botany</b> in 1936. He became the horticulturist for the Toronto General Burying Grounds in 1936 and later worked as the Director of Research and Development for Cedarvale Tree Experts until he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1943 as a navigator bombardier. Tommy Thompson was Superintendent of Parks and Recreation for the City of Port Arthur from 1946 to 1951. He returned to Toronto to become the Adviser on Parks and Recreation Facilities in the Community Services Branch of the Ontario Department of Education in 1951. Tommy Thompson joined the newly formed Metro government in 1955 where he was appointed the first Commissioner of Parks until his retirement in 1978. He acted as Interim General Director of the Metro Toronto Zoo from 1976 and continued as General Director from 1978 until his second retirement in 1981.

40|$|Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) {{is home to}} a {{world-class}} taxonomy program based on Canada's national <b>agricultural</b> collections for <b>Botany,</b> Mycology and Entomology. These collections contain valuable resources, such as type specimen for authoritative identification using approaches that include phenotyping, DNA barcoding, and whole genome sequencing. These authoritative references allow for accurate identification of the taxonomic biodiversity found in environmental samples in fields such as metagenomics. AAFC's internally developed web application, termed SeqDB, tracks the complete workflow and provenance chain from source specimen information through DNA extractions, PCR reactions, and sequencing leading to binary DNA sequence files. In the context of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of environmental samples, SeqDB tracks sampling metadata, DNA extractions, and library preparation workflow leading to demultiplexed sequence files. SeqDB implements the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG) Darwin Core standard Wieczorek et al. 2012 for Biodiversity Occurrence Data, as well as the Genome Standards Consortium (GSC) Minimum Information about any (X) Sequences (MIxS) specification Yilmaz et al. 2011. When coupled with the built-in data standards validation system, this has led to the ability to search consistent metadata across multiple studies. Furthermore, the application enables tracking the physical storage of the aforementioned specimens and their derivative molecular extracts using an integrated barcode printing and reading system. All the information is presented using a graphical user interface that features intuitive molecular workflows as well as a RESTful API that facilitates integration with external applications and programmatic access of the data. The success of SeqDB has been due to the close collaboration with scientists and technicians undertaking molecular research involving the national collection, and the centralization of their data sets in an access controlled relational database implementing internationally recognized standards. We will describe the overall system, and some of our lessons learned in building it...|$|R

It is {{under the control of}} the Coffee Board of India, an autonomous body, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, which was set up under an Act of the Parliament with the objective of promoting “research, development, extension, quality up gradation, market information, and the domestic and external promotion of Indian coffee.” It was established near Balehonnur in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka, in the heartland of coffee plantations. Prior to establishing this institute, a temporary research unit was established in 1915 at Koppa primarily to evolve solutions to crop infestation by leaf diseases. This was followed by the field research station established by the then Government of Mysore, titled [...] "Mysore Coffee Experimental Station," [...] in 1925. This was handed over to the Coffee Board which was formed in 1942, and regular research started at this station from 1944. Dr L. C. Coleman is credited as the founder of coffee research in India. The Coffee Board of India is an autonomous body, functioning under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. The Board serves as a friend, philosopher and guide of the coffee industry in India. Set up under an Act of the Parliament of India in the year 1942, the Board focuses on research, development, extension, quality up gradation, market information, and the domestic and external promotion of Indian coffee.The research activities covered by the Institute constitute research in seven disciplines such as Agronomy, Soil Science and <b>Agricultural</b> Chemistry, <b>Botany,</b> Entomology/Nematology, Plant Physiology, Biotechnology and Post Harvest Technology with the basic aim of increasing productivity and quality of coffee grown in India. The institute has 60 scientific and technical personnel involved in research activities. The institute has a well established farm land of 130.94 ha for carrying out crop research, out of which 80.26 ha are dedicated to coffee research (51.32 ha of arabica and 28.94 ha of robusta), 10 ha are used for growing CXR, 12.38 ha are apportioned for nurseries, roads and buildings, and the balance area of 12.38 ha is a reserve area for future expansion.
