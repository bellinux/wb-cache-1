The game was directed by Toshio Akiyama and produced by Takashi Tokita. [...] Character designs were provided by Akira Oguro while the in-game 2D dot versions were created by Kazuko Shibuya. Takashi Tokita explained the game was meant to transcend the expectations of RPGs in cellphones. The team set the theme of a scenario of creating another game for the SNES. The team also added several references to previous games such as Sarah and Matoya being references to the original Final Fantasy game and Dusk and Alba being reminiscent of Palom and Porom from Final Fantasy IV. When asked about the high pricing for the game, the team explained their reasons stating, [...] "This title offers about 50 hours of gameplay, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> our community can enjoy the contents of this game as much as they would a console title. Also, we have set the price where it is because this title was developed specifically for the mobile platform, as opposed to just being a port of an older console or handheld game." [...] When developing the smartphone version, Takashi Tokita changed the structure of selling a group of episodes rather than individually.|$|E

2500|$|Supporters {{of the ban}} {{state that}} boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal. Dr. Bill O'Neill, boxing {{spokesman}} for the British Medical Association, has supported the BMA's proposed ban on boxing: [...] "It is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> {{we must have a}} total ban on boxing." [...] Opponents respond that such a position is misguided opinion, stating that amateur boxing is scored solely according to total connecting blows with no award for [...] "injury". They observe that many skilled professional boxers have had rewarding careers without inflicting injury on opponents by accumulating scoring blows and avoiding punches winning rounds scored 10-9 by the 10-point must system, and they note that there are many other sports where concussions are much more prevalent.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the chapter}} [...] "Analytic of the Beautiful" [...] of the Critique of Judgment, Kant states that beauty {{is not a}} {{property}} of an artwork or natural phenomenon, but is instead a consciousness of the pleasure that attends the 'free play' of the imagination and the understanding. Even though it appears that we are using reason to decide what is beautiful, the judgment is not a cognitive judgment, [...] "and is consequently not logical, but aesthetical" [...] (§ 1). A pure judgement of taste is in fact subjective insofar as {{it refers to the}} emotional response of the subject and is based upon nothing but esteem for an object itself: it is a disinterested pleasure, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> pure judgements of taste, i.e. judgements of beauty, lay claim to universal validity (§§20–22). It {{is important to note that}} this universal validity is not derived from a determinate concept of beauty but from common sense (§40). Kant also believed that a judgement of taste shares characteristics engaged in a moral judgement: both are disinterested, and we hold them to be universal. In the chapter [...] "Analytic of the Sublime" [...] Kant identifies the sublime as an aesthetic quality that, like beauty, is subjective, but unlike beauty refers to an indeterminate relationship between the faculties of the imagination and of reason, and shares the character of moral judgments in the use of reason. The feeling of the sublime, itself officially divided into two distinct modes (the mathematical and the dynamical sublime), describes two subjective moments, both of which concern the relationship of the faculty of the imagination to reason. Some commentators, however, argue that Kant's critical philosophy contains a third kind of the sublime, the moral sublime, which is the aesthetic response to the moral law or a representation thereof, and a development of the [...] "noble" [...] sublime in Kant's theory of 1764. The mathematical sublime is situated in the failure of the imagination to comprehend natural objects that appear boundless and formless, or appear [...] "absolutely great" [...] (§ 23–25). This imaginative failure is then recuperated through the pleasure taken in reason's assertion of the concept of infinity. In this move the faculty of reason proves itself superior to our fallible sensible self (§§ 25–26). In the dynamical sublime there is the sense of annihilation of the sensible self as the imagination tries to comprehend a vast might. This power of nature threatens us but through the resistance of reason to such sensible annihilation, the subject feels a pleasure and a sense of the human moral vocation. This appreciation of moral feeling through exposure to the sublime helps to develop moral character.|$|E

And the same applies still more obviously to the sounds which can be elicited by rapping the table.|$|E

60|$|Be it next {{observed}} that the reflection of all near objects is, by our fifth rule, not an exact copy of the parts of them which we see above the water, but a totally different view and arrangement of them, that which we should get if {{we were looking at}} them from beneath. Hence we see the dark sides of leaves hanging over a stream, in their reflection, though we see the light sides above, and all objects and groups of objects are thus seen in the reflection under different lights, and in different positions with respect to each other from those which they assume above; some which we see on the bank being entirely lost in their reflection, and others which we cannot see on the bank brought into view. Hence nature contrives never to repeat herself, and the surface of water is not a mockery, but a new view of what is above it. And this difference in what is represented, as well as the obscurity of the representation, is one of the chief sources by which the sensation of surface is kept up in the reality. The reflection is not so remarkable, it does not attract the eye in the same degree when it is entirely different from the images above, as when it mocks them and repeats them, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the space and surface have color and character of their own, and that the bank is one thing and the water another. It is by not making this change manifest, and giving underneath a mere duplicate of what is seen above, that artists are apt to destroy the essence and substance of water, and to drop us through it.|$|E
