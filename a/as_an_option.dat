40|$|Argues for a {{judicial}} interpretation of ERISA that encourages employers to select <b>a</b> default investment <b>option</b> for automatically enrolled participants that is broadly diversified in the equity markets, {{rather than a}} low-earning money market fund. Another potential conflict of interest arises when an employer includes company stock <b>as</b> <b>an</b> investment <b>option,</b> {{which can lead to}} potential breaches of the employer 2 ̆ 7 s duty of loyalty under ERISA. The question presented to the federal court is whether Employer has satisfied its fiduciary duty of prudence by selecting company stock <b>as</b> <b>an</b> investment <b>option.</b> Policy Analysis: Employer 2 ̆ 7 s Duty of Prudence in Selecting Company Stock <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Investment <b>Option</b> - The same list of questions presented after the first hypothetical generally are applicable to the second hypothetical. Inclusion of company stock <b>as</b> <b>an</b> investment <b>option</b> creates the potential for undue influence by the employer when participants 2 ̆ 7 votes are weighted according to their ownership of company stock. Certain additional rules apply to plans that offer company stock <b>as</b> <b>an</b> investment <b>option.</b> First, company stock offered <b>as</b> <b>an</b> investment <b>option</b> must be publicly traded. It is not unreasonable for employers who do decide to include company stock <b>as</b> <b>an</b> investment <b>option</b> to expect that they will be held accountable for this fiduciary decision...|$|R

Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (<b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>option),</b> and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E

5|$|In February 2011, Dugan {{demonstrated}} an automixer card, marketed by Yamaha, to plug into the accessory slot of a Yamaha digital mixer {{such as the}} O1V96, LS9, M7CL or PM5D. This card, the Dugan-MY16, could mix up to 16 channels of microphone inputs, assigned to selected inserts in the mixer's graphic user interface. Like the Model E-1, the automixer could be adjusted through a web browser interface, allowing remote control with an iPad, touchscreen computer or laptop over wireless network. The Dugan algorithm moved inside Yamaha's QL-eeries of mixers in March 2014, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> on the graphic equalizer processing page. This internal version could mix 8 or 16 microphones.|$|E

5|$|The {{base engine}} was {{a version of}} the older Simca Type 180 2.0-litre with {{increased}} displacement, as also featured in the Matra Murena. It was unrelated to either the American Chrysler K or PSA Douvrin 2.2-litre engines. Available trim levels were designated GL and GLS. The GL was the only model to feature the four-speed manual transmission, and have power steering <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> as opposed to standard. It was first to be dropped, for the 1983 model year.|$|E
5|$|The first 747-100s {{were built}} with six upper deck windows (three per side) to {{accommodate}} upstairs lounge areas.

The -100 was equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A engines. No freighter version of this model was developed, but many 747-100s were converted into freighters. A total of 167 747-100s were built.|$|E
5|$|A few modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} murder <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>option.</b> Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley's {{death on the}} grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive {{and that he was}} the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal. Against this idea {{it has been argued that}} he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position. The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c.1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal of Matters of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth. This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip, poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.|$|E
