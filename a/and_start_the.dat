5|$|Serie A {{was dealt}} another blow by the 2006 Italian {{football}} scandal which involved alleged widespread match fixing implicating league champions Juventus, {{and other major}} teams including Milan, Fiorentina, Lazio, and Reggina.

5|$|The player's {{health is}} {{represented}} by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies. If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one life <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>the</b> level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets. The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels. Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition {{can be found in}} hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered. The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its ports the player can only save between levels.|$|E

25|$|A {{pattern of}} two breaths per diver should be {{established}} {{as soon as possible}} and then terminate the dive <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>the</b> ascent as soon as possible, as air consumption while buddy breathing is usually more than double the normal rate. Most demand valves will only drain correctly if the hose is to the user's right, and in these cases the divers should align themselves to allow convenient movement of the demand valve from donor to recipient and back. When the divers need to ascend or swim horizontally, it requires co-ordination and some skill, which is best practiced in a low hazard environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{technique for}} buddy breathing {{is for the}} divers to alternately breathe from the demand valve, usually each taking two breaths before exchanging the DV, but {{it is common for}} the receiver to be out of breath {{at the start of the}} procedure, and they may need a few more breaths to stabilize. Once a rhythm has been established, it is usual to terminate the dive <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>the</b> ascent, so buddy breathing training will usually include assisted ascents. Assisted ascents using a secondary demand valve are simpler than buddy breathing ascents, and this skill is quicker to learn.|$|E

The demographic decline of the 17th century had been reversed. It was a middle-ranking power with great power pretensions that could not be ignored. But time was to be against it.|$|E

25|$|As per the {{instructions}} in Akilam, the Swamithope pathi conducts daily festival (i.e.) every day is considered as a festival day. So the ritual practices conducted during festival days are conducted here throughout the year, though not in a grand scale as during the other festivals. The daily Panividai starts {{very early in the}} morning. Everyday, around 3:00 A.M the Payyans and the people staying at the temple go to Muthirikkinaru and take a holy bath. Then, they return to the Pathi <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>the</b> panividai. The Payyan chant Ukappatippu, and the devotees repeat it. Then, they open the door of sanctum sanctorum. It is considered sanctifying to witness this scene with the sounding of a dozen temple bells and conch. Then, there is the Vahana pavani.|$|E
25|$|Despite her {{attempt on}} his life, which Bennet survived {{with the help}} of Emile Danko, he refuses to start hunting down superhumans as a vigilante, preferring instead to try <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>the</b> new Company under better pretenses.

However, Bennet offers her a unique opportunity to simply walk away; if she does, he pledges to get Danko off her trail—permanently. After recruiting The Haitian to erase Danko's memories, Tracy shows up to kill him, only to find that Danko no longer remembers her. As she leaves, she hears Danko being attacked by an unknown assailant, Edgar, from the carnival, only to be attacked herself. Afterwards, she calls Bennet who discovers a key the assailant was after on Danko's body.|$|E
25|$|After 1830, {{abolitionist}} and minister William Lloyd Garrison promoted emancipation, characterizing slaveholding as {{a personal}} sin. He demanded that slaveowners repent <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>the</b> process of emancipation. His position increased defensiveness {{on the part of}} some southerners, who noted the long history of slavery among many cultures. A few abolitionists, such as John Brown, favored the use of armed force to foment uprisings among the slaves, as he did at Harper's Ferry. Most abolitionists tried to raise public support to change laws and to challenge slave laws. Abolitionists were active on the lecture circuit in the North, and often featured escaped slaves in their presentations. The eloquent Frederick Douglass became an important abolitionist leader after escaping from slavery. Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) was an international bestseller and aroused popular sentiment against slavery. It also provoked the publication of numerous anti-Tom novels by Southerners in the years before the American Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Ponting {{was in a}} rich vein of form {{against the}} South Africans. After scoring 71 and 53 in the drawn First Test in Perth, Ponting scored 117 on Boxing Day in the Second Test at the MCG.

Reliever Miguel Socolovich was optioned to AAA-Memphis. The club {{will be the last}} team in the Majors to employ a sixth starting pitcher this season when Mayers takes the mound. The need to find a fill-in starter {{was the result of the}} Cardinals having to play a doubleheader on July 20, and then a 16-inn. game on July 22. He was destroyed by the Dodgers, giving up 9 runs, all earned, 8 hits (one Double, two HRs), walking two, striking out only one in just 1.1 IP. He endured the shortest start by a pitcher making his Major League debut in 12 years, and the first Cardinals pitcher in 92 years to allow six first-inning runs in his debut. His early exit meant that a bullpen two days removed from covering 10 innings had to shoulder another 7 2/3. Seth Maness threw a career-high 53 pitches over 3 2/3 innings to settle things.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, when Fairless {{was still}} President of USS, {{he met with}} a mining {{engineer}} named Mack Lake. Lake told Fairless that he believed there was iron ore in Venezuela, south of the Orinoco River. He asked Fairless to subsidize the research for the ore and Fairless agreed. Lake proved there was massive quantities of high grade ore in that area. U.S. Steel bought and developed the Orinoco Ore Mine. Under pressure from the Truman Administration to increase steel capacity as a pre-emptive measure {{in response to the}} Cold War, U.S. Steel and Fairless began drawing up plans for a totally new and modern steel mill on the East Coast {{to take advantage of the}} Venezuela Orinoco ore. A site was chosen on the east border of Pennsylvania on the Delaware River 30 mile north of Philadelphia, near Morrisville, Pa. Ore ships could steam from Venezuela and up the Delaware to unload without travelling the Panama Canal, saving shipping costs. Ben Fairless oversaw every aspect of the new mill's design and construction. The new Fairless Works was named after him.
