5|$|The {{amount of}} energy needed to remove or add an {{electron}}—the electron binding energy—is {{far less than the}} binding energy of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus. Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.|$|E

The Judith River Group preserves the remains of many aquatic amphibians and reptiles, including frogs, salamanders, turtles, Champsosaurus and crocodilians. Terrestrial lizards, including whiptails, skinks, monitors and alligator lizards have also been discovered.

5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E

5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil partnership or marriage.

5|$|Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a {{distributed}} computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> molecular dynamics. The project uses the idle processing resources {{of thousands of}} personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its main purpose {{is to determine the}} mechanisms of protein folding, which is the process by which proteins reach their final three-dimensional structure, and to examine the causes of protein misfolding. This is of significant academic interest with major implications for medical research into Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and many forms of cancer, among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to predict a protein's final structure and determine how other molecules may interact with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande Laboratory at Stanford University, under the direction of Prof. Vijay Pande, and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.|$|E

5|$|Lavagna {{proposed}} to slow {{economic growth and}} control inflation. Kirchner rejected this, promoting wage increases to reduce economic inequality and extending unemployment insurance <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> social welfare. Public services such as public transportation, electricity, gas and water supply were subsidized and kept at low prices. Food industries were subsidied as well. The subsidies eventually expanded to several uncommon areas. This increased the economic activity, but also increased inflation and reduced the private investment in those areas. Unable to control inflation, the government influenced the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina, which under-reported it, as well as poverty (which was calculated with the inflation figures). The superpowers law, sanctioned during the crisis, was prorrogated and eventually made permanent in 2006; this law allowed the president to rearrange the budget with supervision from the Congress. Kirchner sought {{to win over the}} Argentine Workers' Central Union and leaders of more moderate piquetero factions to reduce the chances of strikes and protests. He nevertheless continued to oppose hard-line elements of the piquetero movement, such as that of Raúl Castells. Kirchner's policy helped to fragment the piqueteros, with some declaring their allegiance to him and others continuing to oppose him. Their usual system of protest (blocking streets) made them highly unpopular. However, Kirchner refused to suppress the piquetero demonstrations to avoid the risk of further violence.|$|E
