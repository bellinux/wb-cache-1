Missions vary from {{the first team to}} steal 3 hard drives to the {{offensive}} team having to hack the servers the defensive team is protecting in a limited amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing {{they wanted to}} make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Davidson was {{in strong}} all round {{form in the}} 1961–62 Australian season, which was a purely {{domestic}} one. Against Victoria in Sydney, he scored 106 in a hard hitting innings with the tail. He made 58 of the 59runs <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> last wicket partnership with Doug Ford, the other being a leg bye. The partnership lasted only 44 balls and Davidson managed to farm the strike and face 41 of these. The effort helped {{to set up a}} ten-wicket win. The following week against Western Australia in Perth, he made 108 after New South Wales had slumped to 6/38 to help the visitors recover to 218. New South Wales struggled in their second innings and Western Australia needed only 175 for victory. However, Davidson took his career best innings bowling figures of 7/31 to bowl out the hosts for 106 and seize a victory. In both matches against Queensland, Davidson took four quick wickets in the second innings to secure narrow victories after bold declarations. New South Wales won the Shield in that season with 64 of a maximum possible 80 points, playing aggressive cricket under Benaud. It was their ninth title in a row. Davidson was a key factor in the dominance, scoring 521runs at 40.07 and taking 42 wickets at 13.62.|$|E

5|$|Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, {{took the}} raw ore and {{dissolved}} it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. Ether was then <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> liquid–liquid extraction process {{to separate the}} impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide. By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides. Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This {{became known as the}} Ames Project, and its Ames process became available in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux and James Leach came up {{with the}} idea of {{creating}} a Theme game based on a hospital, but Molyneux was not directly involved in development due to his work on Dungeon Keeper. Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time pressures on the team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> patch. The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. Theme Hospital was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the PlayStation in 1998. A Sega Saturn version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on GOG.com in 2012 and Origin in 2015, and the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010. Revival attempts have been made with the development of open-source remakes such as CorsixTH.|$|E
5|$|With his assistance, DedSec {{manages to}} expose the {{corruption}} of the FBI and numerous Silicon Valley corporations through the hacking of their data facilities. Learning that Blume is planning to install a satellite network designed to bypass undersea data cables, which would effectively give Blume a monopoly on the entire world's electronic data and stock exchanges, they infiltrate the launch area of one of the satellites to install a backdoor. In order to bring down Blume and Dušan for good, Marcus breaks into all of Blume's international headquarters and lastly their San Francisco headquarters and hacks their servers, exposing the existence of Bellwether and Dušan's corruption. Dušan is arrested for fraud and Blume is put under investigation, though DedSec resolve to continue their fight against Blume. In an extended ending scene <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> post-release patch, two unidentified individuals note that more DedSec cells and hacktivist groups have been emerging worldwide in response to the San Francisco Blume scandal, and {{that it is time to}} put their own plans into motion.|$|E

The authors note, however, that the areas where ratios close to the golden ratio were found {{are not part of}} the original construction, and theorize that these elements were <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reconstruction.|$|E

25|$|A {{new game}} mode, Dropshot, was <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> March 2017 update. It {{takes place on}} an arena without any goals and a field made of {{hexagonal}} tiles, and uses a ball that becomes electrified after successful strikes or passes. Players use the ball to mark tiles on the opposing's {{side of the field}} while the ball is electrified; marked tiles are then removed from the field when the electrified ball hits them, or marked tiles in contact with it, creating a goal for the team. Once a team scores, the floor resets to normal.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature in}} the previous Serious Sam games was cooperative gameplay, in which multiple players could play the single-player campaign together. Serious Sam 2 focused on this game mode even more than its predecessors, {{as it was the}} only multiplayer mode to be included when the game was released, although deathmatch was later <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> patch. The PC version allows up to sixteen people to play together, while the Xbox version allows four players, either via Xbox systemlink or Xbox Live. Unlike the previous games, Serious Sam 2 does not support split-screen gameplay on the PC nor the Xbox.|$|E
25|$|The Draught of Peace {{provides}} personal comfort, calms {{anxiety and}} soothes agitation. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Snape sets the potion {{as one of}} his lessons. It is a very difficult potion to make as the ingredients have to be <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very specific order, the mixture has to be stirred exactly the right number of times and the heat of the flames on which it is simmering has to be lowered to exactly the right level for the right number of minutes before the final ingredient is added.

25|$|The Institutes proved {{instantly}} popular, {{with many}} {{asking for a}} revised edition. In 1539, Calvin published a much larger work, with seventeen chapters of about the same length as the six chapters of the first edition. It includes many references to classical authors and Church fathers, {{as well as many}} additional references to the Bible. Calvin's epistle to the reader indicates that the new work is intended for theological students preparing for ministry. Four chapters were <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> third edition in 1543, and a 1550 edition was published with only minor changes. The fifth and final edition with which Calvin was involved, and which is used by scholars as the authoritative text, is 80% larger than the previous edition and was published in Geneva in 1559.|$|E
25|$|In August 1939, Stalin {{accepted}} Hitler's proposal into a non-aggression {{pact with}} Nazi Germany, negotiated {{by the foreign}} ministers Vyacheslav Molotov for the Soviets and Joachim von Ribbentrop for the Germans. Officially a non-aggression treaty only, an appended secret protocol, also reached on 23 August, divided the whole of eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. The USSR was promised {{the eastern part of}} Poland, then primarily populated by Ukrainians and Belarusians, in case of its dissolution, and Germany recognised Latvia, Estonia and Finland as parts of the Soviet sphere of influence, with Lithuania <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second secret protocol in September 1939. Another clause of the treaty was that Bessarabia, then part of Romania, was to be joined to the Moldovan SSR, and become the Moldovan SSR under control of Moscow.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the dish but a common one is made by soaking cooked rice in water overnight. Rice is boiled the usual way. Then phaen or starch is strained away. Rice is cooled in air temperature for 3–4 hours. Then cool water is <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that about an inch of water rises above the rice. Rice is generally covered with a light piece of fabric. 12–24 hours later panta bhat is ready. Care {{must be taken to}} cover the dish during the long soaking to avoid contamination. The soaked rice is usually eaten in the morning with salt, lime, chili (either raw or roasted) and onions (sliced or whole) mostly for flavor. Water is discarded before consumption. Sometimes edible oils may be added.|$|E
