500|$|In 1953, {{the city}} opened a {{laboratory}} {{to monitor pollution}} that would become its Department of Air Pollution Control. The department quantified pollution with an air quality index, a single number based on combined measurements of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and haze or smoke levels in the air. The city laboratory recorded the presence of those three pollutants, as measured by <b>amount</b> (<b>concentration</b> in parts-per-million, or ppm) and duration (time). The data for those three pollutants were combined into a single number using a formula developed by department co-founder Moe Mordecai Braverman. The index average was 12, with an [...] "emergency" [...] level if the index was higher than 50 for a 24-hour period. The average, 12, was determined from data collected between 1957 and 1964, and the [...] "emergency" [...] level of 50 was announced in 1964. The index system used by the city in 1966 is not in use anywhere today and was unique to the city even at the time; the 1966 smog itself prompted scientists to reexamine and improve the city's methodology for recording air-pollutant levels.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, {{measurements}} at two wavelengths yields two equations in two unknowns {{and will}} suffice {{to determine the}} <b>amount</b> <b>concentrations</b> c1 and c2 {{as long as the}} molar attenuation coefficient of the two components, ε1 and ε2 are known at both wavelengths. This two system equation can be solved using Cramer's rule. In practice it is better to use linear least squares to determine the two <b>amount</b> <b>concentrations</b> from measurements made at more than two wavelengths. Mixtures containing more than two components can be analyzed in the same way, using a minimum of N wavelengths for a mixture containing N components.|$|R
50|$|The {{division}} by {{the standard}} molality bo or the standard <b>amount</b> <b>concentration</b> co is necessary to ensure that both the activity and the activity coefficient are dimensionless, as is conventional.|$|E
50|$|For a {{substance}} in solution (solute), the standard {{state is the}} hypothetical state it would have at the standard state molality or <b>amount</b> <b>concentration</b> but exhibiting infinite-dilution behavior. The reason for this unusual definition is that {{the behavior of a}} solute at the limit of infinite dilution is described by equations which are very similar to the equations for ideal gases. Hence taking infinite-dilution behavior to be the standard state allows corrections for non-ideality to be made consistently for all the different solutes. Standard state molality is 1 mol&thinsp;kg&minus;1, while standard state <b>amount</b> <b>concentration</b> is 1 mol&thinsp;dm&minus;3.|$|E

5000|$|Each {{congener}} {{has been}} given a toxicity equivalence factor (TEF). This indicates its relative toxicity as compared with TCDD. Most TEFs have been extracted from in vivo toxicity data on animals, but if these are missing (e.g. in case of some PCBs), less reliable in vitro data have been used. After multiplying the actual <b>amount</b> or <b>concentration</b> of a congener by its TEF, the product is the virtual <b>amount</b> or <b>concentration</b> of TCDD having effects of the same magnitude as the compound in question. This multiplication is done for all compounds in a mixture, and these [...] "equivalents of TCDD" [...] can then simply be added, resulting in TEQ, the <b>amount</b> or <b>concentration</b> of TCDD toxicologically equivalent to the mixture.|$|R
50|$|The main derived {{quantity}} in which {{amount of substance}} enters into the numerator is amount of substance concentration, c. This name is often abbreviated to <b>amount</b> <b>concentration,</b> except in clinical chemistry where substance concentration is the preferred term to avoid ambiguity with mass concentration. The term molar concentration is incorrect, but commonly used.|$|E
50|$|The {{cationic}} (unbound) form {{is green}} / red {{and has an}} absorption spectrum maximum historically held to be at 465 nm. The anionic (bound) form of the dye has an absorption spectrum maximum historically held to be at 595 nm. The increase of absorbance at 595 nm {{is proportional to the}} amount of bound dye, and thus to the <b>amount</b> (<b>concentration)</b> of protein present in the sample.|$|E
5000|$|For any substance, {{the number}} density can be {{expressed}} in terms of its <b>amount</b> <b>concentration</b> c (in mol/m3) aswhere [...] is the Avogadro constant. This is still true if the spatial dimension unit, metre, in both n and c is consistently replaced by any other spatial dimension unit, e.g. if n is in cm−3 and c is in mol/cm3, or if n is in L−1 and c is in mol/L, etc.|$|E

30|$|There are two {{drawbacks}} to this study. One is {{that all}} of the subjects were non-traumatically deceased patients. In traumatic cases where chest compression is not effective, such as multiple rib fracture and significant loss of blood volume from bleeding, contrast-enhancement would be insufficient {{due to the lack of}} effective perfusion of the contrast media in the body. Another drawback is that it is uncertain whether the injected <b>amounts,</b> <b>concentrations,</b> and flow rate of the contrast media and the time of chest compression we performed were optimal for resuscitation CEPMCT.|$|R

5000|$|In chemistry, {{concentration}} is {{the abundance of}} a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture. Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: mass concentration, molar concentration, number concentration, and volume concentration. The term concentration {{can be applied to}} any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently it refers to solutes and solvents in solutions. The molar (<b>amount)</b> <b>concentration</b> has variants such as normal concentration and osmotic concentration.|$|E
5000|$|The Beer-Lambert law can be {{expressed}} in terms of attenuation coefficient, but in this case is better called Lambert's law since <b>amount</b> <b>concentration,</b> from Beer's law, is hidden inside the attenuation coefficient.

5000|$|Molar concentration, {{also called}} molarity, <b>amount</b> <b>concentration</b> or {{substance}} concentration, {{is a measure}} of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any chemical species, in terms of amount of substance in a given volume. A commonly used unit for molar concentration in chemistry is the molar which is defined as the number of moles per litre (unit symbol: mol/L or [...] ). A solution with a concentration of 1 mol/L is equivalent to 1 molar (1 [...] ).|$|E
5000|$|The {{boiling point}} of a {{solution}} of an involatile solute is {{higher than that of}} the pure solvent, and the boiling-point elevation (ΔT) is directly proportional to the <b>amount</b> <b>concentration</b> for dilute solutions.

30|$|We {{surmise that}} {{increased}} intravascular CT values would be obtained with increased <b>amounts</b> and <b>concentrations</b> of contrast media.

The optimum imaging conditions should be further investigated.|$|R
5000|$|A solute in dilute {{solution}} usually follows Henry's law {{rather than}} Raoult's law, {{and it is}} more usual to express {{the composition of the}} solution in terms of the <b>amount</b> <b>concentration</b> c (in mol/L) or the molality b (in mol/kg) of the solute rather than in amount fractions. The standard state of a dilute solution is a hypothetical solution of concentration co = 1 mol/L (or molality bo = 1 mol/kg) which shows ideal behaviour (also referred to as [...] "infinite-dilution" [...] behaviour). The standard state, and hence the activity, depends on which measure of composition is used. Molalities are often preferred as the volumes of non-ideal mixtures are not strictly additive and are also temperature-dependent: molalities do not depend on volume, whereas amount concentrations do.|$|E
