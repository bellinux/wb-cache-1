5|$|An {{important}} {{area of research}} concerned the Wigner effect. Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon <b>atoms</b> <b>in</b> the graphite moderator can be knocked out of the graphite's crystalline structure. Over time, this causes the graphite to heat and swell. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.|$|E

5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium <b>atoms</b> <b>in</b> a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium <b>atoms</b> <b>in</b> an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E

5|$|In 1864, Scottish {{organic chemist}} Alexander Crum Brown began to draw {{pictures}} of molecules, {{in which he}} enclosed the symbols for <b>atoms</b> <b>in</b> circles, and used broken lines to connect the atoms together {{in a way that}} satisfied each atom's valence.|$|E
5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of <b>atoms</b> <b>in</b> 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the <b>atoms</b> <b>in</b> the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E

5|$|Therefore, the {{autocorrelation}} function c(r) {{of the electron}} density (also known as the Patterson function) can be computed directly from the reflection intensities, without computing the phases.

5|$|After Von Laue's {{pioneering}} research, {{the field}} developed rapidly, most notably by physicists William Lawrence Bragg {{and his father}} William Henry Bragg. In 1912–1913, the younger Bragg developed Bragg's law, which connects the observed scattering with reflections from evenly spaced planes within the crystal. The Braggs, father and son, shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in crystallography. The earliest structures were generally simple and marked by one-dimensional symmetry.
