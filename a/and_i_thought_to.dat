500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself, 'People have to hear this stuff'. What I had to offer was the music and I figured if we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{influenced}} so greatly by {{a television show}} in igniting the passion that I had as being a prosecutor, and it was Perry Mason … In one of the episodes, {{at the end of}} the episode … Perry said to the prosecutor, [...] "It must cause you some pain having expended all that effort in your case to have the charges dismissed." [...] And the prosecutor looked up and said, [...] "No. My job as a prosecutor is do justice and justice is served when a guilty man is convicted and when an innocent man is not." [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself that's quite amazing to be able to serve that role … ...|$|E
2500|$|Gubby's single {{attempt to}} {{participate}} in a Formula One World Championship race, the 1965 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, also ended with problems in practice. At the Woodcote corner, his Lotus jumped out of sixth gear at 170mph, and Gubby was forced to hold the gear lever in position whilst cornering at high speeds. He decided there and then to retire from the sport, and did not attend the following day's practice session. He later recalled, [...] "I was driving on a shoestring, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself, 'Brian, you've got a family to look after and you'll end up killing yourself'." [...] He had entered the 1965 Mediterranean Grand Prix, but withdrew his entry and sold his Lotus to Stirling Moss for use by a film company working with Steve McQueen.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album is}} {{actually}} {{built around the}} [...] "And Then So Clear" [...] song. He says [...] "... In one day, actually, I pretty much finished it ... I liked it so much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> how <b>I</b> am going release this song, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>I</b> have <b>to</b> write some others." ...|$|R
60|$|The ceremonies of {{the dinner}} were long <b>and</b> weary, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> seemed <b>to</b> be more fully entered into by a flourishing official, who stood at the mayor's back, than by any other person present.|$|R
6000|$|I saw you in Ireland piling slates {{against a}} rock just in this way. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself--"That is {{something}} like Madam How's work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, at Blore Heath; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> win my spurs on the Copeland banner, {{but even}} as I was making my way to it and the recreant that bore it, I was {{stricken}} across my steel cap and dazed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here Larico {{paused to}} allow this great news to sink into the minds of his hearers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself that when I died I would choose to be {{gathered}} to any bosom rather than {{to that of the}} Sun, which put me in mind of hell. Then he went on: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{let me try}} to {{show you}} how matters stand. We will suppose that your suspicions were correct <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> fit <b>to</b> make {{representations}} to the Government of this country. What do you think would happen?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. G. No. I've done my accounts, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I'd like <b>to</b> {{see what}} you're doing.|$|R
6000|$|We {{walked up}} and down the long aisles, and groped out into the cloisters; <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>to</b> get the full ghostliness of the thing, we would go up the old, ruined {{staircase}} into the long galleries, that ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure and I {{thought as}} much when young Allen {{was telling me}} about it," [...] the mate said. [...] "I have seen Mr. Atherton at work before this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself that unless those fellows' skulls were made of iron, and thick at that, they must have gone in when he brought them together." ...|$|E
60|$|With the bloody, blind film {{before my}} eyes, {{there was a}} still {{stranger}} hum in my head, as if a hornet were there; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself, Great God! this is Death! Yet these thoughts were unmixed with alarm. Like frost-work that flashes and shifts its scared hues in the sun, all my braided, blended emotions were in themselves icy cold and calm.|$|E
6000|$|I {{could not}} answer because I had no breath. All my {{strength}} was gone. Still I sat up, supporting myself {{with my hand}} and hoping that it would come back. Quilla turned her face towards me, or rather towards the sound that I had made in moving, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself how sad {{it was that she}} should be blind. Presently she spoke again and now her voice quavered: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} her husband, who was {{stalking}} grimly about the room, looking like a retired soldier with the gout; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>to</b> be in the society of such a person {{was enough to make}} anyone miserable.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm a {{domestic}} man," [...] he said suddenly. [...] "A domestic {{man in a}} serious line of life; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have anything like this in my family--never! It's been--well, I can't tell you what it's been!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my pupil," [...] said I, as {{the ominous}} {{sounding}} gate swung to behind us--"Well, I have found you again: a month's search has seemed long, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> little <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have discovered my lost sheep straying amongst graves." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{spite of}} these thoughts, and spite of the {{metropolitan}} magnificence around me, I was mysteriously alive to a dreadful feeling, which I had never before felt, except when penetrating into the lowest and most squalid haunts of sailor iniquity in Liverpool. All the mirrors and marbles around me seemed crawling over with lizards; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself, that though gilded and golden, the serpent of vice is a serpent still.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the first}} time, it {{occurred}} to me that we had forgotten an obstacle in our way, when we distributed our photographs of the knife. We had none of us remembered that a certain proportion of cutlers might be placed, by circumstances, out of our reach--either by retiring from business or by becoming bankrupt. I always carried a copy of the photograph about me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself, [...] "Here is the ghost of a chance of tracing the knife to Mr. Deluc!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Louis!' cried James, 'I {{could not}} help it! I had been striving against it all along; but if you could imagine how I was tried! You never would come to plead your own cause, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> work for you, but my words are too near the surface. I cut myself short. I have bitterly reproached myself ever since, but I {{did not know the}} harm I had done you. Can you forgive me? Can you--No, it is vain to ask; you never can be happy.' ...|$|E
60|$|Struggling in my father’s hands, Striving {{against my}} {{swaddling}} bands, Bound <b>and</b> weary, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> best <b>To</b> sulk upon my mother’s breast.|$|R

60|$|Remembering {{what you}} do of Sunderland, you will be {{surprised}} that our profit there was very considerable. I read in a beautiful new theatre, <b>and</b> (<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself) quite wonderfully. Such an audience I never beheld for rapidity and enthusiasm. The room in which we acted (converted into a theatre afterwards) was burnt to the ground {{a year or two}} ago. We found the hotel, so bad in our time, really good. I walked from Durham to Sunderland, and from Sunderland to Newcastle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} it was. I lost weight. I lost I don't {{know how many}} pounds, the first year I was married to that woman. She hated me to eat. Why, one of her great accusations against me, at the last, was when she said: 'I've looked round the larder,' she said to me, 'and seen it was quite empty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself: Now he can't cook a supper! And then you did!' There! What {{do you think of}} that? The spite of it! 'And then you did!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Doctor," [...] {{said the}} grave-digger, laughing; [...] "it would crack better teeth than mine, old and crumbly as it is. And yet I {{meant to do}} {{something}} with it that is akin to eating; for my oven needs a new floor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> take this stone, which would stand the fire well. But here," [...] continued he, scraping away the snow with his shovel, a task in which little Ned gave his assistance,--"here is the headstone, just as I have always seen it, and as my father saw it before me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} Felix and Nedda {{have told you}} about yesterday," [...] he said. [...] "Stanley <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it best <b>to</b> come over." [...] Kirsteen answered: ...|$|R
60|$|They blew {{a trumpet}} at the cross, Some forty men, both foot and horse. A'body cam {{to hear and}} see, And wha, among the rest, but me.

6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth, I was afraid the news might {{distress}} and excite you. You couldn't do anything until Monday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it better <b>to</b> let you spend to-day in peace." ...|$|R
6000|$|My reason {{told me that}} I {{should do}} well to drown as quickly as possible, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself that I would not try to swim, but would sink at once. Yet love of life was too strong for me, and so soon as I touched the water, I struck out and began to swim {{along the side of}} the ship, keeping myself in her shadow, for I feared lest de Garcia should cause me to be shot at with arrows and musket balls. Presently as I went I heard him say with an oath: ...|$|E
6000|$|BLY. There's {{a case in}} point. Her {{instincts}} was starved goin' on {{for three}} years, because, mind you, they kept her hangin' about in prison months before they tried her. I read your article, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> meself after I'd finished: Which would I feel smallest--if I was--the Judge, the Jury, or the 'Ome Secretary? It was a treat, that article! They ought to abolish that in'uman [...] "To be hanged by the neck until she is dead." [...] It's my belief they only keep it because it's poetry; that and the wigs--they're hard up {{for a bit of}} beauty in the Courts of Law. Excuse my 'and, sir; I do thank you for that article.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{there was}} a tall red-haired chap--leastways I hear as he's tall and red-headed, and is a tailor by trade; his name is Suggs. It seems as how he got knocked down in the scrummage, and {{was so bad that}} the police, who came up after you left, took him to hospital; they brought him round all right, but it seems as how {{the bridge of his nose}} was broke, and it will be flat to his face for the rest of his life. Now I fancy that's a piece of your handiwork, Mr. Norris; I saw jist such a chap as that go down when you hit him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself at the time what a onener it was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{lay still}} afterward, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he'd gone <b>to</b> sleep. Then the cabin {{seemed to grow}} strangely quiet, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> got up {{to look at him}} I saw that he was dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are too reasonable, Jack," [...] he concluded, [...] "to let an {{antipathy}} {{against a}} name that was your mother's, interfere with your sense of right. I know that some unpleasant questions arose concerning your succession to my aunt's fortune, {{but that was all}} settled in your favour twenty years ago, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> your entire satisfaction." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the reason}} he did not openly accuse Sampson, the secret of his reticence <b>and</b> fear--these <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> best <b>to</b> try to learn at some later time, after I had {{consulted}} with Steele.|$|R
