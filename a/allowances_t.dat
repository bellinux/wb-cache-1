40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of research conducted in Europe and elsewhere except in Pakistan indicates that the in-service teacher education programmes facilitated in the implementation and institutionalization of change at school level geared towards the school improvement process (Dalin et. al, 1992). In the past, the in-service education programmes for teachers in Pakistan received little attention of the government since its focus was on the quantitative expansion rather than qualitative augmentation of education. The teachers who attended in-service education programmes found their experiences as a ‘luxury activity’. Most {{of them seemed to}} be interested in their traveling and daily <b>allowances</b> (<b>T.</b> A. /D. A.) rather than professional development (Warwick and Remiers, 1995). In order to depart from the traditional in-service teacher education programmes, the government sector generally and particularly the private sector have launched some reflective and practial in-service teacher education programmes in Pakistan. These programmes allow teachers to reconceptualize their teaching practice that might lead to equality improvement in their schools. The Institute for Educational Development of the Aga Khan University, organized an eight week in-service teacher education programme for Balochistan primary school teachrs from three districts (Quetta, Kallat and Killa Saifullah) from January 5 – March 6, 1997. This programme was known as Visiting Teachers (VT) programme. Among other practices and processes used in this programme for the professional development of these teachers leading to school improvement, reflective journal was used to develop their critical thinking which is essential for the effective teaching and learning process. In other contexts, reflective journals have been used effectively in various teaching and learning situations for different purposes. In this case the purpose of using reflective journals was to allow teachers to think critically and analyze their thinking and actions for making necessary modification in their teaching behaviour that is required for improving quality education. Furthermore, reflective journal helped them to see relationship between written account and reasoning and raise critical issues to their learning for their professional development. This paper aims to underline the importance of reflective journal as a useful device for VTs to ‘unfreeze’ their age old notions of their teaching and learning, question the relevance of new ideas to their practical life, initiate ‘change’ and ‘refreeze’ new practices which are required for sustainable change for school improvement (Cheng 1996) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{challenges}} that Zimbabwean rural schools face in recruiting and retaining qualified teachers cannot be overemphasized. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate some the challenges associated with teachers and teaching in rural Zimbabwean communities as well as identifying strategies that can be implemented to improve the working conditions of teachers as well as teaching in rural areas of Zimbabwe. The descriptive survey research methodology was adopted for this study. Data for the study was gathered by means of questionnaires and interviews with teachers (80) and school heads (20) posted in Gokwe district rural secondary schools who were selected by a method of cluster sampling The study established that Zimbabwean rural areas are characterized by various {{challenges that}} negatively influence the delivery of quality education such as poor socio economic background, lack of basic infrastructure for teaching and learning, the problem of attracting and keeping qualified teachers in rural schools, poor funding and limited resources. Furthermore the low status accorded to the teaching profession, poor salaries of teachers, inadequate accommodation, limited career and professional development opportunities as well as poor working conditions were cited as obstacles to quality and effective teaching. In order to address challenges to achieve quality education in rural schools the following strategies were suggested: awarding financial bonuses, incentives and a hardship and retention <b>allowance</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} from the long-term corrosion test program of candidate materials for the high-level radioactive waste packages that would be emplaced in the potential repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The present waste package design {{is based on a}} multi-barrier concept having an inner container of a corrosion resistant material and an outer container of a corrosion <b>allowance</b> material. <b>Test</b> specimens have been exposed to simulated bounding environments that may credibly develop {{in the vicinity of the}} waste packages. Corrosion rates have been calculated for weight loss and crevice specimens, and U-bend specimens have been examined for evidence of stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Galvanic testing has been started recently and initial results are forthcoming. Pitting characterization of test specimens will be conducted in the coming year. This test program is expected to continue for a minimum of five years so that long-term corrosion data can be determined to support corrosion model development, performance assessment, and waste package design...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} was to study the effect of feeding system on meat quality characteristics of Small East African (SEA) goats and their crosses with Norwegian (SEA×N) goats finished under small scale farming conditions. Twenty four castrated goats {{at the age of}} 18 months with live body weight of 16. 7 ± 0. 54 kg from each breed (SEA and SEA×N) were distributed in a completely randomized design in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement (two breed, and three dietary treatments). The dietary treatments were; no access to concentrate (T 0), 66 % access to ad libitum concentrate <b>allowance</b> (<b>T</b> 66) and 100 % access to ad libitum concentrate allowance with 20 % refusal (T 100) and {{the experiment}}al period was for 84 days. In addition, all goats were allowed to graze for 2 hours daily and later fed grass hay on ad libitum basis. Daily feed intakes were recorded for all 84 -days of experiment after which the animals were slaughtered. Feed intake of T 100 animals was 536 g/d, which was 183 g/d higher than that of T 66 group. Supplemented goats had significantly (p 0. 05) for dressing percentage and carcass conformation among supplemented goats except fatness score, total fat depots and carcass fat which increased (p< 0. 05) with increasing concentrate levels in the diet. Increasing level of concentrate on offer increased meat dry matter with subsequent increase of fat in the meat. Muscle pH of goats fed concentrate declined rapidly and reached below 6 at 6 h post-mortem but temperature remained at 28 °C. Cooking loss and meat tenderness improved (p< 0. 05) and thawing loss increased (p< 0. 05) with ageing period. Similarly, meat tenderness improved (p< 0. 05) with concentrate supplementation. Shear force of muscles varied from 36 to 66, the high values been associated with Semimembranosus and Gluteobiceps muscles. The present study demonstrates that there are differences in meat quality characteristics of meat from SEA goats and their crosses with Norwegian breeds finished under small scale farming conditions in rural areas. Therefore, concentrate supplementation of goats of both breeds improves meat quality attributes...|$|R
40|$|Since {{agriculture}} directly {{contributes to}} global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, integrating trees into agricultural landscapes through agroforestry systems {{is a viable}} adaptive strategy for climate change mitigation. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the carbon (C) sequestration and financial benefits of C sequestration according to Quebec’s Cap-and-Trade System for Greenhouse Gas Emissions <b>Allowances</b> (C & <b>T</b> System) or the Système de plafonnement et d’échange de droits d’émission de gaz à effet de serre du Québec (SPEDE) program for two experimental 10 -year-old tree-based intercropping (TBI) systems in southern Quebec, Canada. We estimated total C stored in the two TBI systems with hybrid poplar and hardwoods and adjacent non-TBI systems under agricultural production, considering soil, crop and crop roots, litterfall, tree and tree roots as C stocks. The C sequestration of the TBI and adjacent non-TBI systems were compared and the market value of the C payment was evaluated using the net present value (NPV) approach. The TBI systems had 33 % to 36 % more C storage than adjacent non-TBI systems. The financial benefits of C sequestration after 10 years of TBI practices amounted to of $ 2, 259 –$ 2, 758 CAD ha− 1 and $ 1, 568 –$ 1, 913 CAD ha− 1 for St. Edouard and St. Paulin sites, respectively. We conclude that valorizing the C sequestration of TBI systems could be an incentive to promote the establishment of TBI for the purpose of GHG mitigation in Quebec, Canada...|$|R
40|$|Gel {{dosimetry}} {{is a new}} dosimetry method {{applied in}} radiation therapy. Gel dosimeters consist of a radiation sensitive gel, which can integrate absorbed doses from several radiation sources or beams. The dose to the gel can be evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a procedure that {{is the focus of}} the present thesis. A robust tool for the evaluation of the nonuniformity in MRI has been developed, the Deviation Image method. Unlike previously presented methods, the Deviation Image method includes all nonuniformity variations across a phantom surface and is insensitive to stochastic noise. Methods for the estimation of stochastic noise were analyzed in terms of sensitivity to nonuniformities. A method that averages the stochastic noise level over five regions over the phantom surface, and a method that assesses the stochastic noise level from the background, were found to be the methods of choice. Pronounced MR image nonuniformity variation with repetition and T 1 relaxation time was observed in the spin-echo T 1 measurement protocol. These variations were caused by nonuniform RF transmission in combination with the inherent differences in the <b>allowance</b> of <b>T</b> 1 relaxation for different repetition times. Neither the T 1 calculation itself, the uniformity optimized repetition times, nor the correction methods could sufficiently correct for these nonuniformities. The nonuniformities were found to vary considerably less with inversion time for the inversion-recovery pulse sequence, resulting in a T 1 image with considerably lower nonuniformity. A multi-spin-echo pulse sequence using the 3 D volume acquisition technique was developed that was capable of evaluating polyacrylamide gel dosimeters with an equal resolution of 1 mm in all three spatial dimensions. Expected advantages for the 3 D technique in favor of the 2 D techniques, could not be achieved in the actual measurements. Further development and studies of the 3 D technique are therefore required, prior to its application to polyacrylamide gel dosimetry. An image processing computer software was developed, intended to integrate the image processing for the three-dimensional gel dosimetry treatment plan verification. The resulting PMRelax image processing software was found to be capable of performing the necessary image processing tasks. The image processing tasks were further associated with a graphical user interface in order to support routine gel dosimetry use. Two image-processing methods for spatial registering and relocation of absorbed dose distributions in two and three dimensions were studied. One method used inherent absorbed dose information as references and the other external references. Using the absorbed dose reference method, uncertainties associated with the spatial registering and relocation method were found difficult to predict, which warranted a need for external reference. Using fiducial markers, an accurate spatial registering and relocation in three dimensions was performed. Influence from spatial registering and relocation uncertainties could thereby be reduced as a source of error for the absorbed dose distributions obtained with gel dosimeters and treatment planning systems...|$|R
