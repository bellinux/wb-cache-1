5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, there was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> {{he would not be}} informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{began his}} {{campaign}} for re-election in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate favored by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly of a heart attack. With the Democratic primary already over, the Democratic State Central Committee was charged with selecting a candidate to run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had favored Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of winning, but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the Republican candidates.|$|E
25|$|Chee contested in the Bukit Batok by-election, 2016. He {{garnered}} 38.8% of {{the total}} votes cast, bringing a swing of -11.78% to the votes favouring the ruling party's hold in the Bukit Batok constituency {{as compared to the}} 2015 general elections result. On his election loss, Chee was more opinionated than introspective. In an interview immediately after the announcement of the election results, Chee was critical of the 'vicious campaign' and personal attacks by leaders from the ruling party and the mainstream media. Sympathizers of this view have started an online petition (Singaporeans Against Gutter Politics) during the period leading up to the polling day. He asserts that he would have had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> if Singapore were a fair and democratic society.|$|E

5000|$|Jesner {{sustained}} a critical head injury during a suicide bomb {{attack on a}} Tel Aviv bus. His parents signed their consent to detaching him from life support and donating his organs. The recipient was Yasmin Abu Ramila, a 7-year old Palestinian girl from East Jerusalem born with kidney failure. Most of her life, her parents had her to West Jerusalem {{several times a week}} for treatment by Israeli doctors. She had been waiting to receive a transplant for two years. Yoni's brother Ari spoke to the media about the family decision. He said: [...] "I think the most important principle here is that life was given to another human being." [...] Scott Simon commented on the symbolism of Yoni's wish to become a doctor never becoming a reality, yet still saving a life even in his death: [...] "Yoni Jesner will not live to become a doctor, but just as surely, he will be remembered as a healer. Yasmin Rumeileh's father, Abu, who runs a tea and coffee shop in East Jerusalem, said this week, [...] "We are one family. They saved my daughter. Part of their son is living in my daughter. We are all one people." [...] After the surgery Yasmin was doing well and doctors believed she had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chances</b> to live <b>a</b> normal life.|$|R
500|$|Although Cambridge {{had arrived}} at Putney as clear favourites to win, Oxford's {{improvements}} during the build-up to the race had shortened their odds: as the rowing correspondent in The Manchester Guardian suggested, [...] "anything might happen". The rowing correspondent for The Times reported that Cambridge were [...] "quoted as even" [...] but would [...] "still start [...] race as favourites". [...] Moreover, the crews were [...] "extraordinarily evenly matched, but Oxford have <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of breaking the run of Cambridge wins." ...|$|E

50|$|The first {{fifteen minutes}} {{of the second half}} {{featured}} a complete onslaught by the undermanned Germany. With chances coming one after another, confused and disorganized Serbia was completely pushed back despite having an extra player on the pitch. The German offensive culminated in the 60th minute when Vidić needlessly handled the ball in the Serbian penalty area leading to the penalty shot being awarded to Germany. However, Lukas Podolski's low shot was parried by Stojković while Subotić then provided a key clearance to deny Mesut Özil a chance to get a shot away off the rebound. The penalty save provided an injection of confidence for Antić's team as it finally began to play in the second half. Even then, 10-man Germany still had the initiative but Serbia created <b>a</b> few <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chances</b> as well such as Žigić's header bouncing off the crossbar. Serbia eventually won the match 1-0 and brought back hopes of progression with it.|$|R

The House is everything to me,--meat and drink; employment and recreation; and I can tell you I'm not going to lose my seat if I can help it. You came in for the second chance, Sir Thomas; and <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> second <b>chance</b> it was if you'd just have allowed others who knew what they were about to manage matters for you. That chance is over now, and according to all rules that ever I heard of in such matters, you ought to surrender. Isn't that so, Mr. Trigger?" ...|$|R
5000|$|One area {{of concern}} for English clubs is the {{practice}} of third-party ownership. Under this model, companies or wealthy individuals buy a percentage of a young player {{in the hope that}} if his value increases in the future they will make a profit based on their percentage. The advantage for clubs is that they can make big savings from not having to pay the full transfer value of a player and can also make other financial gains, that is, from selling on a player’s image rights. Following the problems caused by the sale of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano to West Ham United in 2006, third party ownership was banned in the Premiership, although it is widely used in South America and Europe and is permissible under FFP. Following the introduction of FFP, the Premiership unsuccessfully lobbied UEFA to review the situation to avoid English clubs being disadvantaged, and in October 2011, the leading sports lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont told the BBC that the Premier League's third-party ownership rules were not legitimate and that a legal challenge to overturn them would have <b>a</b> [...] "very, <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of succeeding".|$|R
2500|$|As {{the stadium}} {{is owned by}} the City of Toronto, their consent is {{required}} for any modifications. [...] The City insisted that any renovations included making the playing surface longer to fit a CFL field so it could house the Argonauts, who had to vacate their current home Rogers Centre by the end of 2017 season. [...] Mark Grimes, Chairman of Exhibition Place's Board, began negotiating with MLSE on the project and said [...] "I think I have Mr. Leiweke's ear in that I am a big CFL fan and that {{we need to get the}} Argos on stable ground." [...] Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly said that [...] "the Argos have got to play there" [...] and that [...] "I think there is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> that they will." [...] On February 25 Grimes said that a deal was [...] "getting close" [...] and could be reached [...] "in the next couple weeks". [...] Preliminary plans were released to the public on March 5.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile, Sir John Bellamy {{was being}} {{examined}} in court, and, notwithstanding the almost aggressive innocence of his appearance, {{he was not}} having <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> time. It <b>chanced</b> that he {{had fallen into the}} hands of a rival lawyer, who hated him like poison, and had good reason to hate him. It is wonderful, by the way, how enemies do spring up round a man in trouble like dogs who bite a wounded companion to death, and on the same principle. He is defenceless. This gentleman would insist on conducting the witnesses' examination on the basis that he knew all about the fraud practised with reference to the supposed death of Arthur Heigham. Now, it will be remembered that Sir John, in his last interview with Lady Bellamy, had declared that there was no tittle of evidence against him, {{and that it would be}} impossible to implicate him in the exposure that must overtake her. To a certain extent he was right, but on one point he had overshot himself, for at that very inquest Mr. Fraser stated on oath that he (Mr. Fraser) had spoken of Arthur Heigham's death in the presence of Sir John Bellamy, and had not been contradicted.|$|R
