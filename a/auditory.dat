5|$|<b>Auditory</b> camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and {{can be seen as a}} form of <b>auditory</b> camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or velcro to reduce noise.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{communicate}} using primarily {{visual and}} <b>auditory</b> signals. Signals can be interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species).|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the <b>auditory</b> radiation to the <b>auditory</b> cortex.|$|E
5|$|<b>Auditory</b> {{defenses}} {{can also}} be used, which {{in the case of}} the Grizzled skipper refers to vibrations generated by the butterfly upon expanding its wings in an attempt to communicate with ant predators.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{need not}} involve visual mimicry, but can employ {{deception}} {{of any of}} the senses. While visual signals have attracted most study, some moths mimic the ultrasound warning signals sent by unpalatable moths to bat predators, constituting <b>auditory</b> Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Predators may {{identify}} their prey by sound {{as well as}} sight; mimics have accordingly evolved to deceive the hearing of their predators. Bats are nocturnal predators that rely on echolocation to detect their prey. Some potential prey are unpalatable to bats, and produce an ultrasonic aposematic signal, the <b>auditory</b> equivalent of warning coloration. In response to echolocating red bats and big brown bats, tiger moths such as Cycnia tenera produce warning sounds. Bats learn to avoid the harmful moths, but similarly avoid other species such as some pyralid moths that produce such warning sounds as well. Acoustic mimicry complexes, both Batesian and Müllerian, may be widespread in the <b>auditory</b> world.|$|E
5|$|The human ear can {{generally}} hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (the audio range). Sounds {{outside this}} range are considered infrasound (below 20Hz) or ultrasound (above 20kHz) Although hearing requires an intact and functioning <b>auditory</b> {{portion of the}} central nervous system as well as a working ear, human deafness (extreme insensitivity to sound) most commonly occurs because of abnormalities of the inner ear, rather than in the nerves or tracts of the central <b>auditory</b> system.|$|E
5|$|While {{the popular}} {{consensus}} is that olfaction {{is very important for}} hunting, two studies that experimentally investigated the role of olfactory, <b>auditory,</b> and visual cues found that visual cues are the most important ones for hunting in red foxes and coyotes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auditory</b> {{neuropathy}} (AN) is {{a variety}} of hearing loss in which the outer hair cells within the cochlea are present and functional, but sound information is not faithfully transmitted to the <b>auditory</b> nerve and brain properly. Also known as <b>auditory</b> neuropathy/auditory dys-synchrony (AN/AD) or <b>auditory</b> neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD).|$|E
25|$|<b>Auditory</b> {{processing}} deficits {{have also}} been proposed {{as a cause of}} stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, and stuttering may be reduced when <b>auditory</b> feedback is altered, such as by masking, delayed <b>auditory</b> feedback (DAF), or frequency altered feedback. There is some evidence that the functional organization of the <b>auditory</b> cortex may be different in people who stutter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auditory</b> {{hallucinations}} (also {{known as}} paracusia) are {{the perception of}} sound without outside stimulus. <b>Auditory</b> hallucinations {{are the most common}} type of hallucination. <b>Auditory</b> hallucinations can be divided into two categories: elementary and complex. Elementary hallucinations are the perception of sounds such as hissing, whistling, an extended tone, and more. In many cases, tinnitus is an elementary <b>auditory</b> hallucination. However, some people who experience certain types of tinnitus, especially pulsatile tinnitus, are actually hearing the blood rushing through vessels near the ear. Because the <b>auditory</b> stimulus is present in this situation, it does not qualify as a hallucination.|$|E
25|$|The human {{inner ear}} {{develops}} during week 4 of embryonic development from the <b>auditory</b> placode, a thickening of the ectoderm which {{gives rise to}} the bipolar neurons of the cochlear and vestibular ganglions. As the <b>auditory</b> placode invaginates towards the embryonic mesoderm, it forms the <b>auditory</b> vesicle or otocyst.|$|E
25|$|Brainstem <b>auditory</b> evoked {{potentials}} {{are small}} AEPs that are recorded {{in response to}} an <b>auditory</b> stimulus from electrodes placed on the scalp.|$|E
25|$|A {{neuropathy}} usually {{refers to}} a disease of the peripheral nerve or nerves, but the <b>auditory</b> nerve itself is not always affected in <b>auditory</b> neuropathy spectrum disorders.|$|E
25|$|The nucleus geniculatus {{medialis}} receives axons from <b>auditory</b> axons. From the cochlea, peripheral <b>auditory</b> information goes to {{the cochlear}} nucleus. From there, through the cochlear nerve, axons reach the superior olivary complex of both sides. Axons from there constitute the lateral lemniscus which ends in the inferior colliculus. Axons from the inferior colliculus constitute the brachium of the inferior colliculus and end in the medial geniculate. The thalamocortical axons from the medial geniculate nucleus end in the primary <b>auditory</b> cortex located {{in the center of}} the superior temporal plane. See <b>auditory</b> system.|$|E
25|$|An agnosia {{that affects}} hearing, <b>auditory</b> sound agnosia, is broken into subdivisions based on level of {{processing}} impaired, and a semantic-associative form is investigated within the <b>auditory</b> agnosias.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{clinical}} testing of subjects with <b>auditory</b> neuropathy, the disruption {{in the stream}} of sound information has been localized {{to one or more}} of three probable locations: the inner hair cells of the cochlea, the synapse between the inner hair cells and the <b>auditory</b> nerve, or a lesion of the ascending <b>auditory</b> nerve itself.|$|E
25|$|Tests of <b>auditory</b> system (hearing) {{function}} include {{pure tone}} audiometry, speech audiometry, acoustic reflex, electrocochleography (ECoG), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), and the <b>auditory</b> brainstem response test.|$|E
25|$|Articulatory and {{acoustic}} feedback signals {{are used for}} generating somatosensory and <b>auditory</b> feedback information via the sensory preprocessing modules, which is forwarded towards the <b>auditory</b> and somatosensory map. At {{the level of the}} sensory-phonetic processing modules, <b>auditory</b> and somatosensory information is stored in short-term memory and the external sensory signal (ES, Fig. 5, which are activated via the sensory feedback loop) can be compared with the already trained sensory signals (TS, Fig. 5, which are activated via the phonetic map). <b>Auditory</b> and somatosensory error signals can be generated if external and intended (trained) sensory signals are noticeably different (cf. DIVA model).|$|E
25|$|<b>Auditory</b> {{processing}} (Ga) is {{the ability}} to analyze, synthesize, and discriminate <b>auditory</b> stimuli, including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions.|$|E
25|$|Tests of <b>auditory</b> system (hearing) {{function}} include pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, acoustic-reflex, electrocochleography (ECoG), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), and <b>auditory</b> brainstem response test (ABR; {{also known}} as BER, BSER, or BAER).|$|E
25|$|The American Academy of Audiology {{notes that}} APD is {{diagnosed}} by difficulties {{in one or}} more <b>auditory</b> processes known to reflect the function of the central <b>auditory</b> nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{possible}} after a test battery, that must necessarily include the following: the <b>auditory</b> brainstem response and otoacoustic emissions. <b>Auditory</b> brainstem response {{should be tested}} with both polarities (helps in identifying cochlear microphonics).|$|E
25|$|Acquired APD can {{be caused}} by any damage to or {{dysfunction}} of the central <b>auditory</b> nervous system and can cause <b>auditory</b> processing problems. For an overview of neurological aspects of APD, see Griffiths.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auditory</b> {{neuropathy}} {{is diagnosed}} {{when a person}} has present otoacoustic emissions and/or cochlear microphonics in combination with absent or abnormal <b>auditory</b> brainstem response. Changing the polarity of the stimulus will result in an inversion of the cochlear microphonic. Patients with <b>auditory</b> neuropathy spectrum disorders have to date never {{been shown to have}} normal middle ear muscle reflexes at 95 dB HL or less despite having normal otoacoustic emissions.|$|E
25|$|Birds have an <b>auditory</b> system {{similar to}} that of mammals, {{including}} a cochlea. Reptiles, amphibians, and fish do not have cochleas but hear with simpler <b>auditory</b> organs or vestibular organs, which generally detect lower-frequency sounds than the cochlea.|$|E
25|$|Neuroplasticity is {{involved}} in the development of sensory function. The brain is born immature and it adapts to sensory inputs after birth. In the <b>auditory</b> system, congenital hearing impairment, a rather frequent inborn condition affecting 1 of 1000 newborns, has been shown to affect <b>auditory</b> development, and implantation of a sensory prostheses activating the <b>auditory</b> system has prevented the deficits and induced functional maturation of the <b>auditory</b> system. Due to a sensitive period for plasticity, there is also a sensitive period for such intervention within the first 2–4 years of life. Consequently, in prelingually deaf children, early cochlear implantation, as a rule, allows the children to learn the mother language and acquire acoustic communication.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be caused}} by {{increased}} neural activity in the <b>auditory</b> brainstem, where the brain processes sounds, causing some <b>auditory</b> nerve cells to become over-excited. The basis of this theory is that many with tinnitus also have hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|Several studies over {{recent decades}} {{have looked at}} the neural {{mechanisms}} underlying birdsong learning by performing lesions to relevant brain structures involved in the production or maintenance of song or by deafening birds before and/or after song crystallization. Another recent experimental approach was recording the bird's song and then playing it back while the bird is singing, causing perturbed <b>auditory</b> feedback (the bird hears the superposition of its own song and a fragmented portion of a previous song syllable). After Nordeen & Nordeen made a landmark discovery as they demonstrated that <b>auditory</b> feedback was necessary for the maintenance of song in adult birds with crystallized song, Leonardo & Konishi (1999) designed an <b>auditory</b> feedback perturbation protocol in order to explore the role of <b>auditory</b> feedback in adult song maintenance further, to investigate how adult songs deteriorate after extended exposure to perturbed <b>auditory</b> feedback, and to examine the degree to which adult birds could recover crystallized song over time after being removed from perturbed feedback exposure. This study offered further support for role of <b>auditory</b> feedback in maintaining adult song stability and demonstrated how adult maintenance of crystallized birdsong is dynamic rather than static.|$|E
25|$|When {{diagnosing}} {{someone with}} <b>auditory</b> neuropathy, {{there is no}} characteristic level of functioning either. People can present relatively little dysfunction other than problems of hearing speech in noise, or can present as completely deaf and gaining no useful information from <b>auditory</b> signals.|$|E
25|$|While <b>auditory</b> {{feedback}} {{is most important}} during speech acquisition, it may be activated less if the model has learned a proper feedforward motor command for each speech unit. But {{it has been shown}} that <b>auditory</b> feedback needs to be strongly coactivated in the case of <b>auditory</b> perturbation (e.g. shifting a formant frequency, Tourville et al. 2005). This is comparable to the strong influence of visual feedback on reaching movements during visual perturbation (e.g. shifting the location of objects by viewing through a prism).|$|E
25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. <b>Auditory</b> hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. <b>Auditory</b> hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her back. Like <b>auditory</b> hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, <b>auditory</b> hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} ventral pathway being {{important}} for visual processing, {{it is also}} important for processing <b>auditory</b> information. During processing, when sound waves enter the ear, this information is transduced into an unanalyzed <b>auditory</b> object. The subcortical <b>auditory</b> pathway then relays the information to the <b>auditory</b> cortex in the dorsal superior temporal gyrus (dSTG). In the dSTG, it is then divided into its constituent phones. These phones are then recognized into phonetic words in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). The information first enters the ventral stream at the posterior middle temporal gyrus and the posterior inferior temporal sulcus p(MTG+ITS). Here the <b>auditory</b> words are converted into semantic words. These words are then converted into a semantic phrase by the first combinatorial net at the anterior portion of the middle temporal lobe and then converted into a syntactic noun phrase at the second combinatorial net. This second combinatorial net is location in the anterior inferior temporal gyrus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auditory</b> {{hallucinations}} are {{the most}} prevalent type of hallucinations. They include hearing voices and music. Many times an individual suffering from <b>auditory</b> hallucinations will hear a voice or voices saying the individual's own thoughts out loud, commenting on all their actions, or commanding and ordering the individual around. These voices tend to be negative and critical toward the individual. People who suffer from schizophrenia and have <b>auditory</b> hallucinations will often speak to the voice {{as though they are}} speaking to a second person.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{synchrony}} is {{not necessary}} for the McGurk effect to be present. Subjects are still strongly influenced by <b>auditory</b> stimuli even when it lagged the visual stimuli by 180 milliseconds (point at which McGurk effect begins to weaken). There was less tolerance {{for the lack of}} synchrony if the <b>auditory</b> stimuli preceded the visual stimuli. In order to produce a significant weakening of the McGurk effect, the <b>auditory</b> stimuli had to precede the visual stimuli by 60 milliseconds, or lag by 240 milliseconds.|$|E
25|$|Hearing {{begins in}} utero, but the central <b>auditory</b> system {{continues}} to develop {{for at least}} the first decade. There is considerable interest in the idea that disruption to hearing during a sensitive period may have long-term consequences for <b>auditory</b> development. One study showed thalamocortical connectivity in vitro was associated with a time sensitive developmental window and required a specific cell adhesion molecule (lcam5) for proper brain plasticity to occur. This points to connectivity between the thalamus and cortex shortly after being able to hear (in vitro) as at least one critical period for <b>auditory</b> processing. Another study showed that rats reared in a single tone environment during critical periods of development had permanently impaired <b>auditory</b> processing. ‘Bad’ <b>auditory</b> experiences, such as temporary deafness by cochlear removal in rats leads to neuron shrinkage. In a study looking at attention in APD patients, children with one ear blocked developed a strong right-ear advantage but were not able to modulate that advantage during directed-attention tasks.|$|E
