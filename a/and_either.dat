5|$|In Japan, {{the game}} was {{originally}} scheduled to be released for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on March 23, 2017, but was delayed to March 30, 2017, due to certain circumstances.

5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.holopus. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a pinkish color, but has no reaction with the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) has no reaction on the cap surface, <b>and</b> <b>either</b> no reaction or a brownish reaction with the flesh. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution does not have a reaction on the cap surface, <b>and</b> <b>either</b> no reaction to slightly olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The Spectrum {{is based}} on a Zilog Z80 A CPU running at 3.5MHz (or NEC D780C-1 clone). The {{original}} model has 16KB (16×1024 bytes) of ROM <b>and</b> <b>either</b> 16KB or 48KB of RAM.

5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed <b>and</b> <b>either</b> four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E

5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome <b>and</b> <b>either</b> decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|A pulmonic {{consonant}} is a consonant made by obstructing the glottis (the {{space between}} the vocal cords) or oral cavity (the mouth) <b>and</b> <b>either</b> simultaneously or subsequently letting out air from the lungs. Pulmonic consonants make {{up the majority of}} consonants in the IPA, as well as in human language. All consonants in the English language fall into this category.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} still much debate about the origins of lemurs on Madagascar, it is {{generally}} accepted that a single rafting event, similar to the one that brought New World monkeys to South America, occurred around 50–80million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the Mozambique Channel and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160million years ago. The resulting founder effect <b>and</b> <b>either</b> non-existent or inferior competition resulted in speciation as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded niches. Today, the endemic primate fauna of Madagascar contains over three-quarters of the extant species of the suborder Strepsirrhini, which had been abundant throughout Laurasia and Africa during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.|$|E

5|$|An Octopus card may store {{a maximum}} value of HK$1,000, with an On-Loan card having an initial deposit value of HK$50 and a Sold card having no initial deposit value. Negative value is {{incurred}} on a card {{if it is}} used with insufficient funds—both types of cards may carry a maximum negative value of HK$35 before value needs {{to be added to}} them again for use. At the time, the maximum cost of a trip on any of the rail networks except the Airport Express and first class of the MTR East Rail line was HK$34.8, the cost of travelling between East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Lo Wu Station; the current maximum cost is HK$55.3, the cost of travelling between Disneyland Resort Station <b>and</b> <b>either</b> Lo Wu Station or Lok Ma Chau Station.|$|E
5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, <b>and</b> <b>either</b> ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers <b>and</b> <b>either</b> a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E
