60|$|The instant, however, {{that the}} {{cessation}} of fire informed the garrison the ship was captured, a tremendous cannonade was opened by the guns of the fortress. The lightning was flashing vividly, and this enabled the gunners to direct their <b>aim</b> <b>upon</b> the ship. Over and over again she was struck, and one shot destroyed the steering wheel, cut the tiller rope, and killed two men who were steering. The single sail was not sufficient to assist in steering her, and {{the men in the}} boats rowed with such energy that the ropes continually snapped.|$|E

60|$|As soon {{as these}} advanced, a heavy fire was opened by the besieged with {{crossbow}} and arquebus. The parapet was high and, while they exposed only {{their heads to}} fire, and were altogether sheltered while loading, the assailants were completely exposed. Orders were given that the defenders should entirely disregard the fire of the matchlock men, and should direct their <b>aim</b> <b>upon</b> the storming parties. These suffered heavily but, urged forward by their officers, they gained {{the edge of the}} moat, pushed the planks across, and placed the ladders; but as fast as these were put into position, they were hurled down again by the defenders who, with long forked sticks, thrust them out from the wall and hurled them backwards; sometimes allowing them to remain until a line of men had climbed up, and then pouring a pail of boiling water over the wall upon them.|$|E
60|$|An evil blow {{it was for}} Alleyne, but a worse {{one still}} for him who struck it. The Spanish slinger, seeing the youth lie slain, and judging from his dress {{that he was no}} common man, rushed forward to plunder him, knowing well that the bowmen above him had {{expended}} their last shaft. He was still three paces, however, from his victim's side when John upon the cliff above plucked up a huge boulder, and, poising it for an instant, dropped it with fatal <b>aim</b> <b>upon</b> the slinger beneath him. It struck upon his shoulder, and hurled him, crushed and screaming, to the ground, while Alleyne, recalled to his senses by these shrill cries in his very ear, staggered on to his feet, and gazed wildly about him. His eyes fell upon the horses, grazing upon the scanty pasture, and in an instant all had come back to him--his mission, his comrades, the need for haste. He was dizzy, sick, faint, but he must not die, and he must not tarry, for his life meant many lives that day. In an instant he was in his saddle and spurring down the valley. Loud rang the swift charger's hoofs over rock and reef, while the fire flew from the stroke of iron, and the loose stones showered up behind him. But his head was whirling round, the blood was gushing from his brow, his temple, his mouth. Ever keener and sharper was the deadly pain which shot like a red-hot arrow through his side. He felt that his eye was glazing, his senses slipping from him, his grasp upon the reins relaxing. Then with one mighty effort, he called up all his strength for a single minute. Stooping down, he loosened the stirrup-straps, bound his knees tightly to his saddle-flaps, twisted his hands in the bridle, and then, putting the gallant horse's head for the mountain path, he dashed the spurs in and fell forward fainting with his face buried in the coarse, black mane.|$|E

Cole, each commanded whaleboats that daily engaged in the difficult and dangerous clearing of Spanish mines from Guantánamo Bay. Dolphins captain, Henry W Lyon later wrote of Stirling and Cole's small boat forays, [...] "It was as plucky an enterprise as ever I witnessed.

This action forced Shigetane, who was unprepared, to strengthen his defenses. However, the forces of Shimazu arrived earlier than the Otomo initially anticipated, and therefore Shigetane was desperately placed in a dilemma: on one hand he had no more than 763 men, and as the opposition respectively wielded around 50,000 soldiers, no form of defense could be utterly possible, considering that such a mass of military might was additionally set on solely besieging Iwaya castle, as opposed to splitting and assaulting from a different direction. And as the circumstances would naturally have it, Shigetane was overwhelmed relatively immediately, but the forces in Iwaya somehow managed to survive for over two weeks before initially seeing that the situation was far beyond any length of salvation, forcing Shigetane to commit suicide there and then, who was consequently praised by the Shimazu for his bravery and conviction, despite being in a situation that entirely contradicted any means of victory.|$|E

We have applied a high-throughput RNA-interference (RNAi) screen of 19, 470 double-stranded (ds) RNAs in cultured cells {{to characterize the}} function of nearly all (91 %) predicted Drosophila genes in cell growth and viability. We found 438 dsRNAs that identified essential genes, among which 80 % lacked mutant alleles. A quantitative assay of cell number was applied to identify genes of known and uncharacterized functions. In particular, we demonstrate a role for the homolog of a mammalian acute myeloid leukemia gene (AML 1) in cell survival. Such a systematic screen for cell phenotypes, such as cell viability, can thus be effective in characterizing functionally related genes on a genome-wide scale...|$|E

40|$|The {{restructuring}} {{of higher education}} according to neo-liberal market principles has constructed the student consumer as a social category, thereby altering the nature, purpose and values of higher education. In the United Kingdom, a key government attempt to champion {{the rights of the}} student consumer has taken the form of institutional charters which indicate the level of services students can expect to receive and what they will be expected to do in return. Pierre Bourdieu’s conceptual framework is applied to analyse dynamics of practice in universities, paying particular attention to the impact on students and learning processes, and on the academic practices of faculty. By studying the production of institutional information created to enhance the workings of the market, we suggest a particular image of higher education is promoted to prospective students which simultaneously regulates current student expectations. We argue that the balance of the concept of higher education as a public and private good is reconstructed according to the changed social, economic and political environment. We conclude that a focus on consumerism places externally-driven instrumental <b>aims</b> <b>upon</b> universities which, in turn, reinforce current notions of education as a private investment...|$|R
