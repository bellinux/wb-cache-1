For the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest, ERT decided again to hold <b>a</b> <b>televised</b> national final after failing to secure a big name artist: As every other year since his first participation in the 2004 contest, ERT asked Sakis Rouvas to represent Greece {{but he did not}} accept.

5|$|As a {{condition}} of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral.

Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be pulled back slightly in the menus.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{approach}} to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers {{take to the}} streets for two days in protests over high fees, unregulated competition and rising fuel costs. Similar protests in China were frequently suppressed—sometimes forcefully—with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation. Bo's government instead held <b>a</b> <b>televised</b> roundtable dialogues with the protesters and citizens, and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union. His handling of the situation earned him praise as a comparatively restrained and progressive leader.|$|E
5|$|During <b>a</b> <b>televised</b> {{address on}} 20 April, Nixon {{announced}} {{the withdrawal of}} 150,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam during the year.

5|$|During the 1950s the FA Cup final was {{the only}} {{football}} match to be televised nationally, resulting in heightened media attention for the players and clubs involved. The Players' Union successfully requested an additional £5 per man for appearing in <b>a</b> <b>televised</b> match, the first time such appearance money had been paid. Birmingham's players signed an exclusive contract with the BBC committing them to appear only on BBC programmes in {{the weeks leading up}} to the final, though their post-match celebration would be covered live by the regional commercial station ATV. The match itself attracted a television audience of fivemillion, a high figure for the period.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during <b>a</b> <b>televised</b> interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During <b>a</b> <b>televised</b> concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E

During <b>a</b> <b>televised</b> hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.|$|E
