50|$|Consider a {{collaborative}} editing session with three participants, named Bill, Steve, and Scott, as depicted by the figure. There {{is also a}} fourth user, named Sam, who does {{not participate in the}} session. The document which the users collaboratively edit is Collaboration.txt. User Scott is the owner and publisher of it. Note that users Steve and Bill work on Microsoft Windows OS, whereas Scott uses Mac OS X and Sam Linux OS. Note that the blue color always denotes the text written by the local user of the <b>ACE</b> <b>instance.</b> The color to matching a participant is depicted in the participants view of the GUI.|$|E
5000|$|Single cards: Any {{card from}} the deck, ordered by rank with suit being the tie-breaker. (For <b>instance,</b> <b>Ace</b> of Spades will beat the Ace of Diamonds, which will beat the King of Spades.) The red Joker {{is the highest}} single.|$|R
50|$|The {{selection}} of long-acting active ingredients over short-acting ones may also reduce pill burden. For <b>instance,</b> <b>ACE</b> inhibitors {{are used in}} the management of hypertension. Both captopril and lisinopril are examples of ACE inhibitors. However, lisinopril is dosed once a day, whereas captopril may be dosed 2-3 times a day. Assuming that there are no contraindications or potential for drug interactions, using lisinopril instead of captopril may be an appropriate way to limit pill burden.|$|R
40|$|This sixth {{supplement}} to the original and invaluable Index Filicum continues the tradition of cross-referencing all basionyms to their new names. It covers the period from 1976 to 1990, a mere 15 years in the nearly 250 years that separate us from Linnaeus. Yet it contains 344 pages full of new species and new combinations (statistics on the numbers of each category are not provided). The dates for this volume are not very strict: important publications before 1976 that were not fully indexed in the previous volume have been incorporated in the main body, not in the Addenda, Corrigenda et Emendanda (<b>ACE).</b> Compare, for <b>instance,</b> the mere 16 new combinations in Sphaeropteris made by R. M. Tryon in 1970 listed in the previous Supplement with the nearly 100 listed here! For {{the first time in}} pteridological history, pteridologists now also have access to infraspecific names, and have less excuse to ignore some of them quietly. Whether this is an advantage remains to be seen. Records only go back to 1976 (although some older infraspecific names are listed in the ACE), which means that lots and lots of older names (and all their corresponding autonyms) are still waiting to take up their proper place in the priority. With nomenclatural rules on infraspecific names as intricate as they are now, and without the excuse of ignorance, it is very temping {{to move away from the}} use of infraspecific categories altogether...|$|R
