Eighteen virgin olive oil samples with fatty <b>acid</b> <b>alkyl</b> ester contents and fatty acid ethyl ester/methyl ester ratios (FAEE/FAME) ranging from 3 to 100 mg kg– 1 and from 0. 3 to 2. 6, respectively, were submitted to tests with time domain resolution of 1 ps. The results obtained in test set validation demonstrated that this new and fast analytical approach is able to predict FAME, FAEE, and FAME + FAEE contents with R 2 values of 0. 905, 0. 923, and 0. 927, respectively. Further measurements on mixtures between olive oil and FAAE standards confirmed that the prediction {{is based on a}} direct influence of fatty <b>acid</b> <b>alkyl</b> esters on the TDR signal.

In this study sulfamic acid (H 2 NSO 3 H, SA) was used as an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters (FAEEs and FAMEs) under different conditions (fatty acid type, molar ratio, temperature, and % catalyst). Esterification using methanol and ethanol resulted in a higher fatty <b>acid</b> <b>alkyl</b> ester yield. The best result was obtained with ethanol, which yielded 91. 2 – 97. 7 % FAEEs.

40|$|International audienceThe {{therapeutic}} {{potential of}} gallic acid and its derivatives as anti-cancer, antimicrobial and antiviral agents is well known. We {{have examined the}} mechanism by which natural gallic acid and newly synthesized gallic <b>acid</b> <b>alkyl</b> esters and related protocatechuic <b>acid</b> <b>alkyl</b> esters inhibit HIV- 1 protease to compare {{the influence of the}} aromatic ring substitutions on inhibition. We used Zhang-Poorman’s kinetic analysis and fluorescent probe binding to demonstrate that several gallic and protecatechuic <b>acid</b> <b>alkyl</b> esters inhibited HIV- 1 protease by preventing the dimerization of this obligate homodimeric aspartic protease rather than targeting the active site. The tri-hydroxy substituted benzoic moiety in gallates was more favorable than the di-substituted one in protocatechuates. In both series, the type of inhibition, its mechanism and the inhibitory efficiency dramatically depended on the length of the alkyl chain: no inhibition with alkyl chains less than 8 carbon atoms long. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborated the kinetic data and propose that gallic esters are intercalated between the two N- and C-monomer ends. They complete the β-sheet and disrupt the dimeric enzyme. The best gallic ester (14 carbon atoms, Kid of 320 nM) also inhibited the multi-mutated protease MDR-HM. These results will aid the rational design of future generations of non-peptide inhibitors of HIV- 1 protease dimerization that inhibit multi-mutated proteases. Finally, our work suggests the wide use of gallic and protocatechuic alkyl esters to dissociate intermolecular β-sheets involved in protein-protein interactions. - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
