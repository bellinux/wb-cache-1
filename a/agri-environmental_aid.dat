Tarkastelun kohteena ovat maatalouden ympäristöoikeudellisen ohjauksen tavoitteet ja keinot sekä niiden toteuttamiseksi annetut säädökset, näissä ilmenevät ja niitä sovellettaessa käytettävät ympäristöoikeudelliset, lähinnä EY:n perustamissopimuksen 174 artiklan, periaatteet ja yleiset oikeusperiaatteet. Maatalousoikeuden ja maatalouspoliittisen lainsäädännön yhtymäkohdat ympäristöoikeuteen ovat tarkastelun keskiössä. Ympäristötavoitteita ja -periaatteita tarkastellaan sekä ympäristöoikeuden yleisten oppien näkökulmasta että maataloudellista ympäristönsuojelua koskevien eri säännösten soveltamisen yhteydessä. Jälkimmäisiin kuuluvat varsinkin ympäristönsuojelulain vesien ja maaperän suojelua, ympäristölupia sekä pilaantuneen ympäristön puhdistamista koskevat säännökset sekä sanotun lain nojalla annetut asetustasoiset säännökset, kuten mm. vesien suojelemista nitraattien aiheuttamalta pilaantumiselta koskeva ns. nitraattiasetus. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan viljelijöiden vapaaehtoisiin sitoumuksiin ja sopimuksiin perustuvien ympäristötukien käyttöä. Lisäksi selvitellään ympäristövaikutusten arviointimenettelyyn, kunnan ympäristönsuojelumääräyksiin, ympäristövahinkojen korvaamiseen ja ympäristörikoksiin liittyviä säännöksiä sekä tulevien alueittaisten vesienhoitosuunnitelmien ja tavoiteohjelmien merkitystä. Tarkastelussa on myös mukana GMO- ja tavanomaisten viljelykasvien keskinäiseen rinnakkaiseloon liittyvät ongelmat vielä valmisteilla olevassa lainsäädännössä. Tutkimuksen loppuosassa esitetään de lege ferenda -kehittämisehdotuksia. Nämä lähinnä oikeuspoliittiset ehdotukset painottuvat nitraattiasetuksen tiukentamiseen, täydentämiseen fosforilannoitusta koskevilla säännöksillä ja parempaan alueelliseen kohdentamiseen sekä ympäristölupajärjestelmän kehittämiseen, ympäristötukien tehokkaampaan suuntaamiseen ja käyttämiseen pitkällä tähtäimellä lähinnä siirryttäessä tiukempaan pakolliseen sääntelyyn samoin kuin eräiden uusien ohjauskeinojen luomiseen. This {{dissertation}} {{on the environmental}} liability of agriculture first provides information about the circumstances and specific nature of the agriculture as an occupation and as elementary production, {{as well as its}} connection to certain basic human rights, and generally looks at rural law and environmental law and their intertwined relationship in current agricultural policy in addition to the relationship between agri-environmental liabilities and property rights. The study then concentrates on the legislative environmental directing of agricultural activities especially within cultivation and the various relevant principles represented in the agri-environmental sector of law. The last part is comprised of the main results of the study with some de lege ferenda proposals for addressing obvious shortcomings in the efficiency of current agri-environmental legislation. The dissertation adopts a broad concept of agricultural environmental liability that includes both compulsory and voluntary based legal obligations to prevent and minimize pollution, and to compensate for environmental damage or restore contaminated or polluted environments. Elements of the environment subjected to pollution include surface and ground water and soil, as well as air and even climate. Agricultural activities causing pollution are mainly fertilizing, manure spreading and storage, cattle pasturing and the use of pesticides. For watercourses it is mostly a diffuse type of pollution, appearing as eutrophication, and for ground water and soil it is usually point source pollution and contamination. Environmental protection has since 1980 s and 1990 s significantly modified the Common Agricultural Popolicy (CAP) of the EU and its legislation. The CAP was strongly shaped by the Uruguay Round with its WTO Agricultural Agreement, and is still {{under the influence of the}} prolonged Doha Round, which aims to renegotiate that agreement for the further liberalization of trade. The latest reform of the CAP created the Single Payment System (SPS) by Council Regulation (EC) 1782 / 2003, with the aim of decoupling the CAP supports from production. The SPS includes additional aid conditions the purpose of which are to ensure that fields are kept in good condition with regard to the environment and further cultivation. In addition, special agri-environmental supports – also of a voluntary nature, though based on legislation – have alongside LFA aid and special national support allowed to Finland after joining the EU in 1995, played a central role in the national adaptation to the CAP. The compulsory agri-environmental legislation, based on the targets and principles of article 174 of the EC Treaty, is mainly comprised of the measures of Directive 91 / 676 /EEC that concerns the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. It is implemented nowadays in pursuance to the Environmental Protection Act (86 / 2000, EPA) by Government Decree 931 / 2000, which stipulates that the actions in it, including instructions for good agricultural practices, refer to the Nitrate Directive´s action programme. The programme is being put into effect throughout the country. Finland thus chose to free itself from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones in accordance with article 3 (5) article of the directive. The provisions of the Nitrate Decree concern the volume and other conditions for storage of animal manure, and the use of manure and nitrogen fertilizers having seasonal, areal and quantitative restrictions. For instance, animal manure may be applied on a field as fertilizer equivalent to a maximum of 170 kg/ha/year of nitrogen. The use of maximum amounts of nitrogen on fields as fertilizer, contained in mineral fertilizer, animal manure and organic fertilizers, is allowed, for example, as follows: for grassland and pasture, silage and horticultural plants, 250 kg of nitrogen/ha/year (highest); for winter cereals, up to 200 kg of nitrogen/ha/year, of which normally 30 kg are used in the autumn and 170 kg in the spring; and for spring cereals, sugar beet, oilseed crops and other crops, up to 170 kg /ha/year. In addition, Annex 3 of the decree makes some special recommendations on procedures related to the use of animal manure. The Nitrate Directive is now connected to the water policy framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC (with its planning system and action programmes) which is implemented mainly by the Act on Arrangement of Water Management (1299 / 2004). This system does not hinder the developing and tightening of the rules of the nitrate legislation also separately, if needed. The role of private law measures is restricted in the agricultural sector mainly to the Act of Compensation for Environmental Damage (737 / 1994) and the Adjoining Properties Act (26 / 1920). Both of these are based on objective liability. The principles in the Environmental Protection Act (86 / 2000) are not understood quite in the same way as the environmental principles in article 174 (2) of the treaty. This particularly concerns the principle of caution and care in section 4. 1. 2 of the act compared to the precautionary principle of the treaty with its heavier weight and larger area of application, as conventionally interpreted in the European Court of Justice. Environmental principles, in any case, work very much towards common goals. From a systematic point of view it would be reasonable in Finnish law to combine the principle of prevention together with that principle of caution and care into a larger main principle, a “principle of prevention and precaution”, for instance. The results from agri-environmental measures in Finland have been insufficient. Although the use of nitrogen fertilizing has generally decreased – the average balance of nitrogen in fields been reduced from 80 kg to 50 kg per hectare and the nitrogen flow potential for watercourses has decreased especially in eastern and middle Finland – the least and most insufficient decrease has occured in the coastal areas, where in many rivers and especially in the Archipelago Sea and Gulf of Finland no reductions in the nitrogen load has been found. The reason is due to national circumstances, the overly high maximum amounts of nitrogen fertilizing allowed in the Nitrate Decree, actually already in the Nitrate Directive, and the fact that Finland by choosing to establish and apply the action programme relating to article 5 of the directive throughout its national territory exempted itself from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones. Additionally, the Nitrate Directive and Decree do not regulate or directly affect the use of phosphorous fertilizers. Therefore, reaching more concrete results in the protection of watercourses against eutrophication caused by agriculture is left to be managed by the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>aid</b> scheme, which covers over 90 per cent of all active farms in Finland but has not in this respect been effective enough. Neither the polluter pay- principle and the precautionary principle nor the principle of prevention have sufficiently materialized for Finnish farming in terms of the protection of surface waters. Instead of the polluter pays principle prevails, through the scheme of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>aid</b> the so-called provider gets principle. On the other hand, the ground water and soil situation is good, thanks to the ground water pollution and soil contamination prohibitions in section 7 and 8 of the EPA, as well as the prohibitions, warnings and measures prescribed for the use of plant protection and bioside products in accordance with the harmonized legislation in these areas. Still, a lack of harmony is noticeable between environmental aid payed on the basis of the “agreements for cultivation of ground water areas” and the groundwater pollution prohibition in the EPA. The recommendations forming part of the Nitrate Decrees regulations should be transformed into regulations. Limits for maximum nitrogen fertilization should be lowered in watercourse zones especially vulnerable to pollution, as well as to those parts of the country from which the heaviest loads still issue into the Archipelago Sea and Gulf of Finland. Conditions for all <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>aid</b> should include more onerous conditions for phosphorous fertilization. The aid should also be based more on agreements tailored and negotiated to fit the activities and special characteristics of each farm. There are also grounds for lowering the limits of livestock installations requiring environmental permits for their establishment or enlargement, and for placing on these permits – in accordance with the principle that damage should as a priority be rectified at the source, and to enhance agricultural structure – the condition of having in one´s possession, by ownership or long-term lease, sufficient field area for the application of manure near enough to the installation. One possible economical measure to alleviate the diffuse pollution into waters could be a payment system that would be based on the arable land area under active cultivation and each farm´s number of livestock and thus on the farm´s estimated yearly surplus balance of nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization. In general, it would be reasonable in terms of achieving a more genuine application of the polluter pays principle and also the principles of prevention and precaution to put more weight on using the compulsory legal measures and additional conditions in the CAP as well as national agri-aid instead of special <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>aid.</b> The trend of rising cereal prices, as well as possible increasing demand for other agricultural products, could help in the adoption of these measures. Agri-environmental aids should in the long run be mainly used temporarily and as an incentive during transitional periods for the implementation and adaptation of new and stricter legal environmental obligations...|$|E
