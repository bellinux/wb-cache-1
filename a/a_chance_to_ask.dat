Stewie decides to spend the whole day with the cast, which includes stealing Cleveland's van, having lunch at McDonald's, going bowling, and going to a carnival. However, they complain about minor things and greatly annoy Stewie, who beams everyone back after stating that they have ruined Star Trek: The Next Generation for him, and that he hopes they all die.|$|E

50|$|As was {{the custom}} in Presbyterian polity {{toward the end}} of the 19th century and the early 20th century, the church did not {{hesitate}} to call before the Session any member who was guilty of breaking a commandment. The accused party was given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> confess and <b>ask</b> forgiveness for his or her sin. After due consideration by the Session, a decision was made whether a suspension or vindication was in order. Records show that most parties confessed, asked forgiveness, and were vindicated.|$|R
40|$|One of {{communication}} type {{used by the}} manager of CV. Rizky Mandiri as mentioned before is vertical communication, where it is done from the upper level to lower level and from the lower level to the upper level or in other words is communication from the leader to subordinate and from subordinate to the leader reciprocally. Communication is one of important components in approaching workers. Manager of CV. Rizky Mandiri realizes this matter, so he often communicates with workers about their work, whether there is any constraint or not. Manager goes around to give instructions to his workers about the work. Workers are also given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> question if the given instruction is not clear. The theory used in this research is X and Y theory, where the concept about people’s behavior in an organization is defendable and more strength, because this concept apparently can explain many observable nature of human’s behavior. While, assumption of Y theory suggested that human being could be good in work at organization is not only affected by factors assumed in X theory, {{but it is also}} determined by workers’ confidence level and freedom to expressed in accomplishing his/her job. This research uses explanatory research type with quantitative approach, that is a research giving priority to variable measurement by using calculation (numeral) or statistical test. Data collecting technique is conducted by distributing questionnaire to respondents. Data analysis uses double linear regression analysis, reliability and validity test. Based on the conducted research, it is obtained results as follow: validity test, {{it can be seen that}} all items on variables are valid.

50|$|Another {{organisational}} feature form many larger general assemblies is {{to limit}} speaking mainly just to representatives of smaller working groups. This means that each individual gets <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> speak and <b>ask</b> questions at work group level, while at assembly level the discussions are kept at a manageable length. In the smaller assemblies, anyone {{is able to}} make proposals for discussion. In larger assemblies, the audience get to make brief spoken responses to proposals from working groups. A queuing based system called a stack {{can be used to}} manage this, with the facilitators indicating when it is a particular occupiers turn to speak. Even at the largest assemblies, individuals can always feed back to speakers and the crowd by means of hand signals.|$|R

When, {{still in}} his dusty bulbous gray sack suit, he hesitated out of his {{pleasant}} room, he found that Father had changed to dinner coat and a stock, which {{he was old enough}} to wear with distinction. Harris was firmly introduced to Mr. Lyman Ford, sole owner and proprietor of the Lipsittsville Ozone. He was backed into a corner, and filled with tidings about the glories of Mr. and Mrs. Seth Appleby, their social position and athletic prowess and financial solidity, and the general surpassing greatness of Lipsittsville. In fact, Mr. Ford overdid it a little, and Mr. Hartwig began to look suspicious--like a man about to sneeze, or one who fears {{that you are going to}} try to borrow money from him.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to Bernard that--by some mysterious impulse--she was suddenly presenting him with <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her {{the question that}} Blanche Evers had just suggested. Two or three {{other things as well}} {{occurred to}} him. Captain Lovelock had been struck with the fact that she favored Gordon Wright's addresses to her daughter, and Captain Lovelock had a grotesque theory that she had set her heart upon seeing this young lady come into six thousand a year. Miss Evers's devoted swain had never struck Bernard as a brilliant reasoner, but our friend suddenly found himself regarding him as one of the inspired. The form of depravity into which the New England conscience had lapsed on Mrs. Vivian's part was an undue appreciation of a possible son-in-law's income! In this illuminating discovery everything else became clear. Mrs. Vivian disliked her humble servant because he had not thirty thousand dollars a year, and because at a moment when it was Angela's prime duty to concentrate her thoughts upon Gordon Wright's great advantages, a clever young man of paltry fortune was a superfluous diversion.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the camp}} is without a watch-wher and minor {{accidents}} keep delaying the work. Despite the protests from Tarik and his group, Natalon decides to trade an entire winter's worth of coal for <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for Kindan <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> queen watch-wher for an egg. He succeeds and begins {{the difficult task of}} raising a nocturnal animal. As no records exist on how to raise or train the watch-wher, Kindan has no clue but is luckily aided by the mysterious Nuella. Together, they train Kisk and, in the process, learn a great deal about this species. This proves to be vital as, {{towards the end of the}} novel, Kisk's abilities will save many lives, including that of the camp leader, Natalon.|$|R

Harry tries to call Julie on a pay phone, but only reaches her answering machine, where he leaves an apology. When the phone rings moments later he picks it up, hearing a frantic man (presumed {{to be in a}} missile silo) telling his dad that nuclear war is about to break out in less than seventy minutes. When Harry finally gets <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> talk and <b>asks</b> who's calling, the caller realizes he has dialed the wrong area code.

60|$|Meanwhile, as the mirth grew {{fast and}} furious, the graver {{members of the}} party began to escape {{as well as they}} could. David Deans {{accomplished}} his retreat, and Butler anxiously watched an opportunity to follow him. Knockdunder, however, desirous, he said, of knowing what stuff was in the new minister, had no intention to part with him so easily, but kept him pinned to his side, watching him sedulously, and with obliging violence filling his glass to the brim, as often as he could seize an opportunity of doing so. At length, as the evening was wearing late, <b>a</b> venerable brother <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Mr. Archibald when they might hope to see the Duke, tam carum caput, as he would venture to term him, at the Lodge of Roseneath. Duncan of Knock, whose ideas were somewhat conglomerated, and who, it may be believed, was no great scholar, catching up some imperfect sound of the words, conceived the speaker was drawing a parallel between the Duke and Sir Donald Gorme of Sleat; and being of opinion that such comparison was odious, snorted thrice, and prepared himself to be in a passion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How in {{the world}} should I know her?' That was the answer {{he would have been}} tempted to give. He felt very much out of Cousin Maria's circle. The foreign gentleman fingered his {{moustache}} and looked at him sidewise. The Marquise was a very pretty woman, fair and slender, of middle age, with a smile, a complexion, a diamond necklace, of great splendour, and a charming manner. Her greeting to her friends was sweet and familiar, and was accompanied with much kissing, of a sisterly, motherly, daughterly kind; and yet with this expression of simple, almost homely sentiment there was something in her that astonished and dazzled. She might very well have been, as the foreign young man said, the most distinguished woman in France. Dora had not rushed forward to meet her with nearly so much empressement as Effie, and this gave him <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the former who she was. The girl replied that she was her mother's most intimate friend: to which he rejoined that that was not a description; what he wanted to know was her title to this exalted position.|$|E
60|$|His father's {{answer was}} a blow {{he could not}} understand. At times he thought his father {{imagined}} he could get work to do in America without any trouble, and was minded to let him try it and cure himself of his radicalism by hard, cold, disenchanting experience. That seemed the most plausible theory, yet he could not content himself with it. A theory that pleased him better was, that this cablegram would be followed by another, of a gentler sort, requiring him to come home. Should he write and strike his flag, {{and ask for a}} ticket home? Oh, no, that he couldn't ever do. At least, not yet. That cablegram would come, it certainly would. So he went from one telegraph office to another every day for nearly a week, and asked if there was a cablegram for Howard Tracy. No, there wasn't any. So they answered him at first. Later, they said it before he had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> Later still they merely shook their heads impatiently as soon as he came in sight. After that he was ashamed to go any more.|$|E
60|$|So it went. The {{word was}} passed along. Men {{shouldered}} in to ask after friends and partners, {{and in turn}} were shouldered out, too stunned for blasphemy. By the time Montana Kid gained the bank {{he was surrounded by}} several hundred fur-clad miners. When he passed the Barracks he was the centre of a procession. At the Opera House he was the nucleus of an excited mob, each member struggling for <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> after some absent comrade. On every side he was being invited to drink. Never before had the Klondike thus opened its arms to a che-cha-qua. All Dawson was humming. Such a series of catastrophes had never occurred in its history. Every man of note who had gone south in the spring had been wiped out. The cabins vomited forth their occupants. Wild-eyed men hurried down from the creeks and gulches to seek out this man who had told a tale of such disaster. The Russian half-breed wife of Bettles sought the fireplace, inconsolable, and rocked back and forth, and ever and anon flung white wood-ashes upon her raven hair. The flag at the Barracks flopped dismally at half-mast. Dawson mourned its dead.|$|E
30|$|While {{the program}} {{includes}} developing {{the capacity of}} teacher leaders to conduct the PD, {{it is important to}} assess the extent of their leadership experience and skills and to take this information into account in designing preparation and support activities. Although video is being used more widely in practice-based professional development (van Es et al. 2014), it is likely that VBDs will be unfamiliar to many novice TLs. Our experiences working with UUSD point out the value of designing leadership preparation sessions that include time to model how to conduct a VBD, an opportunity to unpack the VBD by debriefing the facilitator(s) who modeled it, and then space for TLs to plan and rehearse a VBD with a specific protocol-based debrief that reduces anxiety and supports their growth. In their end-of-year interviews, several of the TLs commented on the value of these activities when asked which activities in the TLP sessions most helped them prepare to facilitate VBDs. One TL shared her thoughts about the value of the modeling and debriefing, “When [one of the Stanford team] would come in and debrief you about what you did and how it felt, it dawned on me pretty quickly that you were modeling {{what we were going to}} be doing. Your insights into what you were thinking, how it worked, what you were trying to get at with this activity and the line of questioning, I found it all very, very helpful.” Another explained that the rehearsals “gave us <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> practice <b>asking</b> questions beforehand and got us thinking, ‘Is that the right question we wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask?</b> Did it work or did it not work?’ so it just gave us <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> tweak what we needed to do....” Similar to novices preparing for professional practice in the clergy and clinical psychology, these novice TLs benefitted from the representations, decompositions, and approximations of practice we incorporated into the leadership preparation sessions (Grossman et al. 2009).|$|R

The Captain would, in a booming echoing voice, give an explanation of how he'd do a superhero-esque revenge in answer to the problems, such as dealing with a store by unleashing the Horsemen of the Apocalypse to lay waste to it and leaving horse manure everywhere. Then, presenter Dec would say [...] "or..." [...] and, in a small voice, Captain Justice would give a more realistic answer, such as simply asking for their money back.|$|R

Finally, the panel of judges has the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions of the first team, either to clarify a point, or to elicit a team's viewpoint on an ethical aspect raised in their response. The judges then proceed to evaluate the first teams' response and the second team's comment based on the following criteria: clarity and intelligibility, focus on ethically relevant factors, avoidance of ethical irrelevance, and deliberative thoughtfulness.
