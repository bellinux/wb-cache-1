It has United States slavery-era relics, nineteenth- and twentieth-century artifacts, and archival materials, including the diaries of sea explorer Captain Harry Dean. The DuSable collection includes works from scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, sociologist St. Clair Drake, and poet Langston Hughes. The African American art collection contains selections from the South Side Community Art Center students Charles White, Archibald Motley, Jr., Gus Nall, Charles Sebree, and Marion Perkins, as well as numerous New Deal Works Progress <b>Administration</b> <b>period</b> and 1960s Black Arts Movement works. The museum also owns prints and drawings by Henry O. Tanner, Richmond Barthé, and Romare Bearden, and has an extensive collection of books and records pertaining to African and African American history and culture.|$|E
25|$|Strength {{improvements}} {{in the range of}} 5–20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the <b>administration</b> <b>period.</b> Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600nbsp&mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. This dose is sufficient to significantly improve lean muscle mass relative to placebo even in subjects that did not exercise at all. The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent.|$|E

40|$|To {{construct}} a sensory neuropathy model, excess pyridoxine (150 mg/kg s. i. d.) was injected subcutaneously in dogs {{over a period}} of 7 days. During the <b>administrations</b> <b>period,</b> the dogs experienced body weight reduction and proprioceptive loss involving the hindquarters. After pyridoxine administration was completed, electrophysiological recordings showed that the M wave remained at a normal state, but the H-reflex of the treated dogs disappeared at 7 days. The dorsal funiculus of L 4 was disrupted irregularly in the axons and myelin with vacuolation. The dorsal root ganglia of L 4, and sciatic and tibial nerves showed degenerative changes and vacuolation. However, the lateral and ventral funiculi of L 4 showed a normal histopathologic pattern. Although this subcutaneous administration method did not cause systemic toxicity and effectively induced sensory neuropathy, this study confirmed the possibility of producing a pyridoxine-induced sensory neuropathy model in dogs with short-term administration...|$|R

The present study focuses on {{the long-term effects of}} repeated low-level exposure to diazinon, propoxur, and chlorpyrifos (CPF) on cardiac function in rabbits. The yearly based experimental scheme of exposure consisted of two oral <b>administration</b> <b>periods,</b> lasting 3 months and I month each, interrupted by an 8 -month washout period (total duration 12 months). At the end of the experimental scheme, the rabbits underwent an echocardiographic evaluation under sedation, after which they were killed and the tissue and serum samples were collected. A mild localized cardiotoxic effect was established by echocardiography for the three pesticides tested. Severe histological alterations were identified, especially in the diazinon-treated animals in agreement with increased persistence of this pesticide established in the cardiac tissue. In addition, all pesticides tested increased the oxidative stress and oxidative modifications in the genomic DNA content of the cardiac tissues, each one following a distinct mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hypotension {{occurs in}} 20 % of {{hemodialysis}} procedures. Aim: To study {{the effects of}} midodrine on hypotension during hemodialysis. Patients and methods: Ten patients on chronic hemodialysis and with a history of hypotension during the procedure, were studied. They received midodrine 10 mg per os or placebo during 5 dialytic procedures each, in a double blind cross over design. Results: Blood pressure levels prior to dialysis were similar during the midodrine or placebo <b>administration</b> <b>periods.</b> During dialysis, systolic blood pressure fell 19. 3 ± 28 mmHg with midodrine and 23. 4 ± 28 mmHg with placebo. Diastolic blood pressure fell 7. 3 ± 11. 5 mmHg with midodrine and 11. 1 ± 12 mmHg with placebo. The reduction in median arterial pressure was also less pronounced with midodrine. Conclusions: Midodrine lessens the fall in arterial pressure during hemodialysis, in patients with symptomatic hypotension (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 1009 - 13...|$|R

40|$|Psoriasis is {{a common}} chronic and {{disabling}} inflammatory disease that has an enormous physical, functional and psychosocial impact on patients’ quality of life. To date several conventional therapies are available {{for the treatment of}} this condition (eg, cyclosporine, methotrexate, retinoids, and psoralen plus ultraviolet A) which, although providing clinical response, do not maintain long-lasting disease remission and at times show poor tolerability with potential toxicity thus limiting their use. A challenge in psoriasis management is to utilize precociously an adequate therapy and to achieve effective and safe maintenance of its clearance by improving both skin and joint manifestations as well as to prevent joint destruction and disability. Recent improvement in the knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease was fundamental for the development of novel targeted treatment options that may be effective, safer and well tolerated on long-term <b>administration</b> <b>periods,</b> thus improving patient’s quality of life.
