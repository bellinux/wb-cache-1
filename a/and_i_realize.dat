6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Crewe, [...] "of course I don't {{want to be}} unreasonable, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> {{the pressure}} that's put upon you. But {{when you consider the}} importance of the work I came down here to do--" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "There {{were times}} when <b>I</b> sat down <b>and</b> told my guitar how <b>I</b> felt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> had created a song," [...] Warren remembers.|$|R

6000|$|He {{tried to}} conceal his anxiety from Ruth, but she guessed it. She said, one evening: [...] "Sometimes I think we two are unusual, because {{we really want to}} be free. And then a thing like this war comes and our bread and butter and little pink cakes are in danger, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> we're not free at all; that we're just like all the rest, prisoners, {{dependent}} on how much the job brings and how fast the subway runs. Oh, sweetheart, we mustn't forget to be just a bit mad, no matter how serious things become." [...] Standing very close to him, she put her head on his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{remember}} saying that. I said it because I {{was afraid of}} myself. I was shaken by meeting you again. I thought you must be hating me--you {{had every reason to}} hate me, and you spoke as if you did--and I did not want to show you what you were to me. It wasn't true, Peter. Five years ago I may have thought it, but not now. I have grown to understand the realities by this time. I have been through too much to have any false ideas left. I have had some chance to compare men, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that they are not all kind, Peter, even sometimes, when they happen to think of it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Now it was {{possible}} to see faint gleams of light coming through the cracks of the floor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that the newcomers had with them a lantern.|$|R
60|$|Paul Sampson was {{speaking}} like a sensible lad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> it fully. He, the boy ignorant of woodcraft, {{should have been}} the leader, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wished most devoutly I had consulted with him before setting out on this wild-goose chase.|$|R
5000|$|She {{later said}} that this {{encounter}} marked the moment [...] "when my {{view of the world}} changed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> there were many good people on this planet. <b>I</b> also <b>realized</b> how precious life is." [...] Soon she and her family were living in South Korea.|$|R
6000|$|... "You better! Because I'm {{going to}} carve him, and paint him, and {{possibly}} spoil him. The creating of a man--of {{one who knows}} how to handle life--is so much more wonderful than creating absurd pictures or statues or stories. I'll nag him into completing college. He'll learn dignity--or perhaps lose his simplicity and be ruined; and then I'll marry him off to some nice well-bred pink-face, like Jeff Saxton's pretty cousin--who may turn him into a beastly money-grubber; and I'm monkeying with destiny, and I ought to be slapped, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> it, and I can't help it, and all my latent instinct as a feminine meddler is aroused, and--golly, I almost went off that curve!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Always have I {{been taught}} differently," [...] replied Ghek; [...] "but since I have known {{this woman and}} you, of another race, I {{have come to believe}} that there may be other {{standards}} fully as high and desirable as those of the kaldanes. At least I have had a glimpse of the thing you call happiness <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that it may be good even though I have no means of expressing it. I cannot laugh nor smile, and yet within me is a sense of contentment when this woman sings--a sense that seems to open before me wondrous vistas of beauty and unguessed pleasure that far transcend the cold joys of a perfectly functioning brain. I would that I had been born of thy race." ...|$|E
60|$|HYPATIA. No it wouldnt. If you all sat in silence, as if {{you were}} waiting for {{something}} to happen, then there would be hope even if nothing did happen. But this eternal cackle, cackle, cackle about things in general is only fit for old, old, OLD people. I suppose it means something to them: theyve had their fling. All I listen for is some sign of it ending in something; but just when it seems to be coming to a point, Johnny or papa just starts another hare; and it all begins over again; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that it's never going to lead anywhere and never going to stop. Thats when I want to scream. I wonder how you can stand it.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the end of}} my {{military}} service, I {{was able}} to look back on that experience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that war is not about :protecting our freedoms; war is big business with a high cost of human life and suffering...|$|R
5000|$|By the mid-1950s, Wilson was {{increasingly}} focusing on producing expressionist landscapes. Of this period, Wilson said: [...] "In 1956 <b>and</b> 7, <b>I</b> {{found myself in}} one of those lucid moments that occurs every twenty years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> wasn't a second generation Abstract Expressionist. I looked at the ingredients of what <b>I</b> was painting <b>and</b> felt an uncontrollable allegiance to subject matter, and to landscape in particular." ...|$|R

60|$|Wonderful {{to go out}} on {{a frozen}} road, to see the grass in shadow bluish with hoar-frost, to see the grass in the yellow winter-sunrise beams melting and going cold-twinkly. Wonderful the bluish, cold air, and things {{standing}} up in cold distance. After two southern winters, with roses blooming all the time, this bleakness and this touch of frost in the ringing morning goes to my soul like an intoxication. I am so glad, on this lonely naked road, I don't know what to do with myself. I walk down in the shallow grassy ditches under the loose stone walls, I walk on the little ridge of grass, the little bank on which the wall is built, I cross the road across the frozen cow-droppings: and it is all so familiar to my feet, my very feet in contact, that I am wild as if I had made a discovery. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that I hate lime-stone, to live on lime-stone or marble or any of those limey rocks. I hate them. They are dead rocks, they have no life--thrills for the feet. Even sandstone is much better. But granite! Granite is my favorite. It is so live under the feet, it has a deep sparkle of its own. I like its roundnesses--and I hate the jaggy dryness of lime-stone, that burns in the sun, and withers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] agreed Uncle Chris cheerily. [...] "You see, I {{have seen}} {{something}} {{of all this}} sort of thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> the importance of it. I know what all this modern rush and strain of life is for a woman in your position. Parties every night ... dancing ... a thousand and one calls on the vitality ... bound {{to have an effect}} sooner or later, unless--unless," [...] said Uncle Chris solemnly, [...] "one takes steps. Unless one acts in time. I had a friend--" [...] His voice sank--"I had a very dear friend over in London, Lady Alice--but the name would convey nothing--the point is that she was in exactly the same position as you. On the rush all the time. Never stopped. The end was inevitable. She caught cold, hadn't sufficient vitality to throw it off, went to a dance in mid-winter, contracted pneumonia...." [...] Uncle Chris sighed. [...] "All over in three days," [...] he said sadly. [...] "Now at that time," [...] he resumed, [...] "I did not know what I know now. If I had heard of Nervino then...." [...] He shook his head. [...] "It might have saved her life. It would have saved her life. I tell you, Mrs. Peagrim, that there is nothing, there is no lack of vitality which Nervino cannot set right. I am no physician myself, I speak as a layman, but it acts on the red corpuscles of the blood...." ...|$|E

3000|$|The {{speaking}} exam was the hardest. For instance, even if I {{knew what}} I {{wanted to say}} {{in response to the}} question, I often couldn’t find the words to reply well <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>I</b> couldn’t convey myself very well (P 1) [...]...|$|R

5000|$|The {{term was}} used by {{undergraduate}} student Karissa Kilgore at Seton Hill University in 2004 ("Since {{all of us in}} EL150 have blogging portfolios to do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that there is some pressure to have comments and whatnot, I suggest some sort of a blog rally to make sure we get decent feedback" [...] from the instructor.), to describe a last-minute push by students to complete blogging homework for an English class.|$|E
5000|$|Abruptly, the man {{switches}} from song to {{speech as}} he awakens in prison: [...] "Then I awake {{and look around}} me, at four grey walls that surround me. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that I was only dreaming." [...] He is, indeed, on death row. As the singing resumes, we learn that the man is waking {{on the day of}} his scheduled execution ("there's a guard, and there's a sad old padre, arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak"), and he will return home only to be buried: [...] "Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree, as they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home." ...|$|E
5000|$|.....in 1992 {{everything}} changed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>I</b> {{was living in}} a war in which sex was used as part of a war strategy to humiliate women and thereby cause the destruction of an ethnic group. 20,000 women were systematically raped in Bosnia during the war." ...|$|R
60|$|These {{were not}} {{exactly the kind of}} words best {{calculated}} to give a lad courage, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that by listening to her many seconds I should become cowardly.

5000|$|Hamilton: I {{wrote that}} line on bass, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> should {{think of some}} guitar parts for it if I {{was ever going to}} get a chance to present it to the band.

"Many of {{you have}} asked about the return of “Zane’s Sex Chronicles” on Cinemax for a third season <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> {{that a lot of}} you ordered the channel just for me.

But, you can still purchase the first season on Amazon.com or rent it from Blockbuster or NetFlix. For those of you who got really caught up in the characters, there is a tie-in book for the series that digs deeper into their backgrounds and relationships. It is entitled “Zane’s Sex Chronicles,” exactly like the show." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} comedians worked for Jason {{over time as}} drivers to the Borscht Belt hotels, {{including}} the comedian Kenny Kramer, who {{was used as the}} basis for the character from the American sitcom Seinfeld. Kramer is quoted as saying: “Through a friend of mine, I ended up getting a job as a chauffeur for a comedian named Jay Jayson,who was very popular in the Catskills. I used to drive Jay to his gigs, and carry his wardrobe, and I started writing jokes for Jay. Jay is doing my jokes and they’re getting great laughs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize,</b> hey, I could do these jokes myself. So on November 7, 1971, I stepped on a stage for the first time as a comedian…” Jason's nephew, Sid Roth, host of a noted messianic radio and television show, also drove Jason to the hotels in the Catskills.|$|E
60|$|When I awoke, {{the western}} sky was {{an ocean of}} saffron and gold.
