The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> effect on the English language.|$|E

40|$|There is a digraph {{corresponding}} to every square matrix over ℂ. We generate a recurrence relation using the Laplace expansion {{to calculate the}} characteristic <b>and</b> the <b>permanent</b> polynomials of a square matrix. Solving this recurrence relation, {{we found that the}} characteristic <b>and</b> the <b>permanent</b> polynomials can be calculated in terms of the characteristic <b>and</b> the <b>permanent</b> polynomials of some specific induced subdigraphs of blocks in the digraph, respectively. Interestingly, these induced subdigraphs are vertex-disjoint and they partition the digraph. Similar to the characteristic <b>and</b> the <b>permanent</b> polynomials; the determinant <b>and</b> the <b>permanent</b> can also be calculated. Therefore, this article provides a combinatorial meaning of these useful quantities of the matrix theory. We conclude this article with a number of open problems which may be attempted for further research in this direction...|$|R

5|$|After the First Opium War, Hong Kong was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and {{the colony}} {{soon became a}} popular {{stopover}} for missionaries travelling onwards to China. The parish was established in 1842 by Theodore Joset, the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong, and work began on a new <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> church soon afterwards. The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street. Construction was completed in 1843. Within the next few years, the number of Catholics in the parish grew significantly, {{partly due to the}} emigration of people from neighbouring Macau. The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline, and many people who resided there sought better opportunities in the young and prospering colony of Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, recruitment and retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists <b>and</b> <b>Permanent</b> Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E
5|$|By 1927, Yorkshire {{wished to}} appoint a more {{competent}} <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> captain, instead of continuing the succession of ineffective amateurs, and planned to ask Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional, to take the post. Frederick Toone encouraged Rhodes to offer his resignation as senior professional, possibly {{with a view to}} installing a new regime, but Rhodes declined. Meanwhile, the proposed appointment of Sutcliffe caused controversy; some members of the county believed Rhodes should be appointed. Rhodes pointed out he had not been offered the captaincy, nor had his views been sought. He felt unappreciated when he was not offered first refusal of the captaincy. A poll of Yorkshire members showed a marked preference for Rhodes over Sutcliffe as captain; the disagreements persuaded Sutcliffe to decline the offer, and another amateur was appointed.|$|E
