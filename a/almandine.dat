25|$|Because the {{chemical}} composition of garnet varies, the atomic bonds in some species {{are stronger than}} in others. As a result, this mineral group shows a range of hardness on the Mohs scale of about 6.5 to 7.5. The harder species like <b>almandine</b> are often used for abrasive purposes.|$|E
25|$|Because {{strontium}} titanate {{and glass}} are too soft to survive {{use as a}} ring stone, they {{have been used in}} the construction of composite or doublet diamond simulants. The two materials are used for the bottom portion (pavilion) of the stone, {{and in the case of}} strontium titanate, a much harder material—usually colorless synthetic spinel or sapphire—is used for the top half (crown). In glass doublets, the top portion is made of <b>almandine</b> garnet; it is usually a very thin slice which does not modify the stone's overall body color. There have even been reports of diamond-on-diamond doublets, where a creative entrepreneur has used two small pieces of rough to create one larger stone.|$|E
25|$|Named after Mount Ainslie, Australian Capital Territory {{where their}} type {{location}} occurs, the Ainslie Volcanics {{are composed of}} Dacitic ignimbrite and minor volcaniclastic and argillaceous sediments. The lithology is bluish grey dacitic tuff, which can be massive or foliated, also dacitic agglomerate and shale. These volcanics contain chloritised cordierite and some have red <b>almandine</b> garnet. Jasper is found on low hills {{on the north side}} of the Molonglo River. The thickness is at least 700 metres. The magma was formed by melting an aluminiumrich pelitic sediment. The eruption came from a volcano into shallow sea water. The deposits built above sea level as they progressed. The underlying sediments now make up the Canberra Formation. Between Hall and Namina Hill on Spring Range, the Mount Painter Volcanics lie unconformably on top.|$|E
25|$|The aluminosilicates –bkyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite, all Al2SiO5 – are {{structurally}} {{composed of}} one 4− tetrahedron, and one Al3+ in octahedral coordination. The remaining Al3+ {{can be in}} six-fold coordination (kyanite), five-fold (andalusite) or four-fold (sillimanite); which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions. In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as tephroite, Mn2SiO4. The garnet group has a general formula of X3Y2(SiO4)3, where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group. The pyralspite garnets have Al3+ in the Y position: pyrope (Mg3Al2(SiO4)3), <b>almandine</b> (Fe3Al2(SiO4)3), and spessartine (Mn3Al2(SiO4)3). The ugrandite garnets have Ca2+ in the X position: uvarovite (Ca3Cr2(SiO4)3), grossular (Ca3Al2(SiO4)3) and andradite (Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3). While there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Almandine,</b> {{sometimes}} incorrectly called almandite, is {{the modern}} gem known as carbuncle (though originally almost any red gemstone was known by this name). The term [...] "carbuncle" [...] {{is derived from}} the Latin meaning [...] "live coal" [...] or burning charcoal. The name <b>Almandine</b> is a corruption of Alabanda, a region in Asia Minor where these stones were cut in ancient times.

2500|$|All {{species of}} garnets possess similar {{physical}} properties and crystal forms, but differ in chemical composition. [...] The different species are pyrope, <b>almandine,</b> spessartine, grossular (varieties {{of which are}} hessonite or cinnamon-stone and tsavorite), uvarovite and andradite. The garnets make up two solid solution series: pyrope-almandine-spessartine and uvarovite-grossular-andradite.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} pyrope from Macon County, North Carolina is a violet-red shade {{and has been}} called rhodolite, Greek for [...] "rose". In {{chemical}} composition it may be considered as essentially an isomorphous mixture of pyrope and <b>almandine,</b> {{in the proportion of}} two parts pyrope to one part <b>almandine.</b> Pyrope has tradenames some of which are misnomers; Cape ruby, Arizona ruby, California ruby, Rocky Mountain ruby, and Bohemian garnet from the Czech Republic. Another intriguing find is the blue color-changing garnets from Madagascar, a pyrope-spessartine mix. The color of these blue garnets is not like sapphire blue in subdued daylight but more reminiscent of the grayish blues and greenish blues sometimes seen in spinel. However, in white LED light, the color is equal to the best cornflower blue sapphire, or Dblock tanzanite; {{this is due to the}} blue garnet's ability to absorb the yellow component of the emitted light.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of jewellery in the 6th-7th century made intensive use of flat, cut <b>almandine</b> garnets {{in gold and}} garnet cloisonné (or [...] "cellwork") but occasionally glass was also cut and inset as gems. The colours used were almost entirely limited to blue and green. Occasionally red glass {{has been used as}} a substitute for garnet, for example in some of the Sutton Hoo objects, such as the purse-lid and blue glass in the shoulder clasps. The 7th-century Forsbrook Pendant also mixes garnet and blue glass inlays. Anglo-Saxon enamel was also used in the production of jewellery, with coloured glass melted in separate cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Almandine</b> {{is widely}} distributed. Fine rhombic {{dodecahedra}} {{occur in the}} schistose rocks of the Zillertal, in Tyrol, and are sometimes cut and polished. An <b>almandine</b> in which the ferrous oxide is replaced partly by magnesia is found at Luisenfeld in German East Africa. In the United States there are many localities which yield <b>almandine.</b> Fine crystals of <b>almandine</b> embedded in mica-schist occur near Wrangell in Alaska. The coarse varieties of <b>almandine</b> are often crushed for use as an abrasive agent.|$|E

50|$|Chemically, the {{rhodolite}} {{is a mix}} of pyrope and <b>almandine</b> garnets, part of the pyrope-almandine solid-solution series, with {{an approximate}} garnet composition of Py70Al30.|$|E
50|$|The {{composition}} of pure pyrope is Mg3Al2(SiO4)3, although typically other elements {{are present in}} at least minor proportions—these other elements include Ca, Cr, Fe and Mn. Pyrope forms a solid solution series with <b>almandine</b> and spessartine, which are collectively known as the pyralspite garnets (pyrope, <b>almandine,</b> spessartine). Iron and manganese substitute for the magnesium in the pyrope structure. The resultant, mixed composition garnets are defined according to their pyrope-almandine ratio. The semi-precious stone rhodolite is a garnet of ~70% pyrope composition.|$|E
