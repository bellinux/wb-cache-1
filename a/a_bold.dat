5|$|After {{the capture}} of Sevastopol, Hitler felt Manstein was the right man to command the forces at Leningrad, which had been under siege since September 1941. With {{elements}} of the 11th Army, Manstein {{was transferred to the}} Leningrad front, arriving on 27 August 1942. Manstein again lacked the proper forces to storm the city, so he planned Operation Nordlicht, <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> plan for a thrust to cut off Leningrad's supply line at Lake Ladoga.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1945–1946, Slotin shocked {{some of his colleagues}} with <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> action. He {{repaired}} an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen. A dose of 1 Gy (~100 roentgen) can cause nausea and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.|$|E
5|$|No {{members of}} the Leader class survived the 1950s and only the numberplates of No. 36001 and No. 36002 are known to exist. The numberplate for No. 36001 {{is located in the}} National Railway Museum, {{although}} a locomotive builder's plate intended for the locomotive, but never fitted in service, was sold at auction in 2008. The Leader was <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> attempt at pushing back the boundaries of contemporary steam locomotive design and, if successful, would have prolonged the life of steam on Britain's Railways.|$|E

5|$|Starting on June 6, a major Russian push was {{directed}} against the 40km line between Kołki and Kostiuchnówka, {{with the aim of}} taking the position and then advancing towards Kovel. With Polish legionnaires staying put and holding the ground, more Russian reinforcements were thrown in, while the battle of Kostiuchnówka had become one of the major struggles in the area during World War I. Polish forces launched a counterattack, pushing back the Russians – who had not expected such <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> move – on the night of June 8 and 9.|$|E
5|$|The heroine, Annis, {{is one of}} Heyer's {{more modern}} characters. Her wealth and spinsterhood allow her a level of freedom that is unusual in a Heyer novel, {{as it was in}} the Regency period. Many of the actions Annis takes, such as moving to a {{different}} city despite her family's objections, were common among women living in the 1970s when the novel was written, but in a Regency setting they mark Annis as <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> and unusually independent woman.|$|E
5|$|This was <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> venture. Planning for the Saint-Etienne railway {{preceded the}} Liverpool and Manchester Railway, opened in 1830, {{which was used}} as the {{prototype}} by other pioneering railways, so many new technical problems had to be solved. In fact the steep section from Rive-de-Gier to Saint-Etienne was beyond the power of steam traction engines of the day.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{all this}} time Mitchell was making a {{reputation}} as <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> and efficient officer, passing out top of Staff College and serving as GSO1 {{on the staff of}} Chief of the Defence staff, Lord Mountbatten.

5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E

5|$|Around 1279BC, Ramesses II, {{also known}} as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, {{and went on to}} build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more {{children}} than any other pharaoh in history. <b>A</b> <b>bold</b> military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh (in modern Syria) and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty, around 1258BC. With both the Egyptians and Hittite Empire proving unable to gain the upper hand over one another, and both powers also fearful of the expanding Middle Assyrian Empire, Egypt withdrew from much of the Near East. The Hittites were thus left to compete unsuccessfully with the powerful Assyrians and the newly arrived Phrygians.|$|E
5|$|By September 1944, Allied {{forces had}} {{successfully}} broken {{out of their}} Normandy beachhead and pursued shattered German forces across Northern France and Belgium. Although Allied commanders generally favoured a broad front policy to continue the advance into Germany and the Netherlands, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery proposed <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> plan to head north through the Dutch Gelderland, bypassing the German Siegfried Line defences and opening a route into the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr. Initially proposed as a British and Polish operation codenamed Operation Comet, the plan was soon expanded to involve most of the First Allied Airborne Army and a set piece ground advance into the Netherlands, codenamed Market Garden.|$|E
5|$|Chandler feared Laffoon, who {{controlled}} the State Democratic Central Committee, {{would attempt to}} hand-select the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by calling a nominating convention instead of holding a primary election, and he used <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> move to circumvent Laffoon's ability to carry out such an action. Under the Kentucky Constitution, Chandler became acting governor any time Laffoon left the state. When Laffoon traveled to meet with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, D. C. on February 6, 1935, Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill requiring that each party's gubernatorial candidates be chosen by a primary rather than a nominating convention. Laffoon returned to the state {{the next day and}} challenged Chandler's authority to make the call, but Chandler's actions were validated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on February 26.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{significant}} military advantage {{the allied}} armies encountered immediate setbacks. Denmark–Norway was quickly {{knocked out of}} the war by <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> Swedish landing on Humlebæk resulting in the Peace of Travendal. After this development, the Swedish army under Charles XII was free to sail east across the Baltic sea to tackle the remaining opponents, Russia and Saxony. In response to this threat, Augustus lifted the siege of Riga and marched back across the Düna river in order to observe the Swedish movements. Charles then decided to march against Peter I of Russia, who was besieging Narva, with the aim of saving the city. Shortly later the two armies met in the battle of Narva. This ended in a decisive Swedish victory which greatly crippled the Russian army, forcing them to abandon their campaign in Swedish territory and withdraw to Russia.|$|E

For the more remote matters, the aged can relate to you but as many things as happened lately, and within our lifetime, these, I a young man will relate to you, I mean those after death, those after the burial of the martyr, those which happened while he remained {{in the suburbs of}} the city....|$|E
5|$|Monotype later created <b>a</b> <b>bold</b> {{and bold}} italic (called a {{semi-bold}} in some digitisations) {{to match the}} roman and italic of the original release. (True bold type {{did not exist in}} Kis's time.) Released in 1967, Fleet Titling was a capitals-only alphabet intended to serve as a companion for titling use. It was created by Monotype's occasional collaborator John Peters, a Cambridge University Press designer who also worked as a private printer. Monotype used it for their logo and letterhead. More oddly, Monotype in the 1960s used Ehrhardt as a base for printing in the Initial Teaching Alphabet. This alphabet system, intended to be used to teach children to read, used alternative characters for different sounds spelled with the same letter, like t's and c's dropped below the baseline of the text.|$|E
