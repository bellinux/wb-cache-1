5|$|The mission did {{fail and}} the {{internal}} settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>on</b> 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.

5|$|D'Eyncourt, who had {{departed}} Brazil in October {{immediately after the}} contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>on</b> Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Leão had convinced the recently elected President Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns {{in favor of a}} smaller ship. The credit may not have laid with Leão alone, though; da Fonseca was already dealing with multiple issues. Most importantly, he {{had to deal with the}} fallout from a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the Revolt of the Lash), which had seen three of the new vessels just purchased by the navy, along with one older coast-defense ship, mutiny against the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
