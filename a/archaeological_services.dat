5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Services</b> {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey. These first excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that it was indeed the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not been entirely robbed of stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 2012, the University of Leicester and Leicester City Council, in {{association}} with the Richard III Society, announced that they had joined forces to begin a search for the remains of King Richard. The search for Richard III was led by Philippa Langley of the Society's Looking For Richard Project with the archaeological work led by University of Leicester <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Services</b> (ULAS). Experts set out to locate the lost site of the former Greyfriars Church (demolished during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries), and to discover whether his remains were still interred there. By comparing fixed points between maps in a historical sequence, the search located the Church of the Grey Friars, where Richard's body had been hastily buried without pomp in 1485, its foundations identifiable beneath a modern-day city centre car park.|$|E
5|$|The Hallaton Helmet is a {{decorated}} iron Roman cavalry parade helmet originally {{covered in a}} sheet of silver and decorated in places with gold leaf. It was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton, Leicestershire after Ken Wallace, {{a member of the}} Hallaton Fieldwork Group, found coins in the area. Further investigation by professional archaeologists from University of Leicester <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Services</b> discovered that the site appeared to have been used as a large-scale Iron Age shrine. Nine years of conservation and restoration has been undertaken by experts from the British Museum, supported by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £650,000. The helmet is now on permanent display at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough alongside other artefacts from the Hallaton Treasure hoard.|$|E

5|$|The helmet was {{discovered}} by 71-year-old Ken Wallace, a retired teacher and amateur archaeologist. He {{and other members of}} the Hallaton Fieldwork Group had found fragments of Roman pottery on a hill near Hallaton in 2000. He visited the site with a second-hand metal detector late one afternoon and found about 200 coins, which had been buried in a series of small pits dug into the clay. He also found another artifact, which he left in the ground overnight. The following day he returned to examine his discovery and found it that it was a silver ear. He reported the find to Leicestershire's county archaeologist, who called in the University of Leicester <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Services</b> (ULAS) to excavate the site. The dig took place in the spring of 2003.|$|E

25|$|With the {{discovery}} of the Mantle site by Lebovic Enterprises, <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Services</b> Inc. was contracted to complete an evaluation of the site's significance. A decision was made to preserve about 5% of the original Mantle site, primarily along the bank of the creek. The site was documented and over 150,000 artifacts were removed for study and interpretation at McMaster University and the University of Toronto. Because of their national significance, the artifacts will be safeguarded by the Canadian Museum of Civilization. The archaeological site-work took three years to complete (2003–2005). Most of the site is now a storm water pond; the homes on the south-west corner of Lost Pond Crescent are also on the village site. A small cemetery found outside the village walls has been preserved and protected in accordance with the provincial cemeteries act and in consultation with First Nations. The consequent development of {{the west side of the}} creek in the Fieldgate River Ridge subdivision around James Ratcliff Avenue was delayed significantly. The village ossuary, a mass grave with an expected 300 to 400 skeletal remains, has not been yet been located. The Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville is planning further housing development immediately south of the Mantle site in the town's Phase Two development plan.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{exploratory}} overflight in 1988, local amateur historians recognised {{the traces of}} a large tumulus in a field 300 m south of the oppidum. Between 1994 and 1997, the State <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Service</b> of Hesse excavated it.|$|R
500|$|Wressle Castle {{is now a}} Grade I listed ruin and a {{scheduled}} monument. The remains include earthworks indicating the moat, and {{some parts of the}} castle: the remains of the two towers of the south range; and a building fragment, thought to have been a bakehouse. According to Historic England, the site was first investigated archaeologically in 1993, when Humberside Archaeology Unit held a watching brief. The state of the site deteriorated to the point at which in 1999 Wressle Castle was included on the Heritage at Risk register. Historic England, Natural England and the Country Houses Foundation invested [...] £500,000 in repairing the castle and in 2015 Wressle was no longer considered ‘at risk’ and was removed from the register. This included architectural and landscape surveys carried out by Ed Dennison <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Services,</b> with funding from the Castle Studies Trust for the landscape survey.|$|E
500|$|A {{search for}} Richard's body began in August 2012, {{initiated}} by the Looking for Richard project {{with the support of}} the Richard III Society. The archaeological excavation was led by the University of Leicester <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Services,</b> working in partnership with Leicester City Council. On the first day a human skeleton belonging to a man in his thirties was uncovered showing signs of severe injuries. The skeleton, which had several unusual physical features, most notably a severe curvature of the back, was exhumed to allow scientific analysis. Examination showed that the man had probably been killed either by a blow from a large bladed weapon, probably a halberd, which cut off the back of his skull and exposed the brain, or by a sword thrust that penetrated all the way through the brain. Other wounds on the skeleton had probably occurred after death as [...] "humiliation injuries", inflicted as a form of posthumous revenge.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010 {{a five-year}} {{excavation}} {{began on the}} site, {{carried out by the}} University of Leicester School of Archaeology & Ancient History with the University of Leicester <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Services</b> (ULAS). According to Dr Patrick Clay research in the 1990s and 2000s on farmsteads and undefended settlements had revealed much about Iron Age Leicestershire, however the role of hillforts in the county was less clear. The excavations aimed {{to address the issue of}} the purpose of hillforts in the region, and also acted as a training dig for students at the university. The hillfort is a Scheduled Monument, which means it is a [...] "nationally important" [...] structure and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. Assessing the progress of the excavations after the first three years of excavations, John Thomas who is in charge of the project remarked ...|$|E
2500|$|During their excavations, {{archaeologists have}} {{discovered}} a large thermal complex, {{in close proximity to}} its sources. On a lower terrace, to the west, was the Arch of Campanus, probably built in the 1st century, and more downstream, a second terrace carried the temple said to be dedicated to Diana, which had replaced a more ancient circular edifice by the 2nd century, which was probably contemporary with the Arch of Campanus. Remains of a necropolis have been cleared north of the temple. The Parc des Thermes, and various other locations scattered in the town, contain numerous and very varied remains, such as remains of the necropolis and pottery, etc. However, there is no centrepiece which would have led to extensive archaeological excavations. Otherwise, we know nothing of the Gallo-Romans of the Aquae vicus, in scope or in the provision of the habitat. Where did the [...] "Romans" [...] live? Where were their farms, the villages of their staff; What were the activities of the vicus? The mystery is still present. The only clues come from the archaeological map of the remains by <b>archaeological</b> <b>services</b> of the DRAC, and for archaeologist Alain Canal to conclude, [...] "Paradoxically, if Aix has delivered many documents illustrating the age of the site {{and the quality of the}} monumental town planning from the beginning of the Roman Empire, we have no precise knowledge about the order of this town." ...|$|E
