This clumped deployment is detrimental to objectives as the satellites end up blocking each other 2 ̆ 7 s signals and optics; as such, effective <b>attitude</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>systems</b> for small spacecraft are highly desirable. Such a {{system has been}} developed at Utah State University (USU) that utilizes micro-hybrid rocket motor technology along with the 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 monopropellant, Hydroxylammonium Nitrate (HAN) that provides relatively low-power, low-temperature ignition and allows for multiple restarts of the thruster without replenishing propellants: an ideal system for providing thrust capabilities to small satellites.

The <b>attitude</b> <b>adjustment</b> is a significant theme for locust jumping and considerable progress has been accomplished recently in bio-locust SAA study. Firstly, based on the morphological characteristics of the locust locomotion, the SAA model was established. In addition, it was validated qualitatively by an exercise testing and simulation. Finally, a prototype was developed and the SAA mechanism was validated qualitatively. This work proved that the mechanism of bio-locust SAA is an effective method for bio-robot air-righting...|$|R
