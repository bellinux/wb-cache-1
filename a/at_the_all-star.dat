In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, Davis {{was elected}} to start the 2013 All-Star Game, his first ever appearance. He was the leading vote-getter with 8,272,243 votes. Davis was also chosen to {{participate}} in the Home Run Derby for the first time, by American League captain Robinson Canó. Davis advanced to the second round and hit a total of 12 home runs. However, a blister broke on his hand, leaving him unable to hit enough homers to advance to the third and final round. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> Game the next night, July 16, 2013, Davis went 1-3, with a fly out, a single and a strikeout. Davis's single against Patrick Corbin advanced Miguel Cabrera to third, where he would score the game's first run on José Bautista's sacrifice fly.|$|E

5|$|Once the 1999 season started, {{a moment}} of peace {{occurred}} between the fans. Yankees manager Joe Torre returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer. While the managers were exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which he tipped his cap. Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Yankee manager Joe Torre, manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter. Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him (they also embraced each other at this time). Later in the game, {{when he came to}} bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance. Nine years later, in a similar fashion, Red Sox manager Terry Francona managed the American League team <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> Game at Yankee Stadium, in the stadium's final season.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{entered the}} 1976 {{season as the}} {{pitching}} staff ace and took over Larry Dierker's position as the Opening Day starter for the Astros. In his first start of the season, Richard gave up four runs in four innings against the defending World Series champion Cincinnati Reds on April 8. He followed this inauspicious beginning with wins in five of his next six decisions. One of them included a 10-inning shutout effort {{that led to a}} 16-inning 1–0 Astros victory against the Dodgers. By the end of May, however, Richard was sitting even with a 5–5 record, loser of four straight decisions. He closed {{the first half of the}} season by winning a 10-inning shutout against the Mets on July 6, and an eight-inning start against the Expos four days later. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> break, Richard had a 9–9 record with a 2.88ERA in over 153innings of work.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{entered the}} 1978 {{season as the}} Astros' Opening Day starter. In {{the first game of}} the season, he gave up seven runs on 11 hits and just made it into the fifth inning before being {{replaced}} in a loss to the Cincinnati Reds. He recovered from the loss by pitching a complete game two-hit shutout in his next outing against the Dodgers. In an eight-start period from April 26 to June 4, Richard threw six complete games, including two back-to-back shutouts, and lowered his ERA from 4.15 to 3.05. He struck out 67 and gave up only 39hits in the 63total innings he pitched. On a June 9 start against the Cardinals, Richard struck out 12batters but also walked six and gave up five earned runs. By the end of the first half of the season Richard had pitched back-to-back games with nine and 12 strikeout performances, against the Reds and Dodgers, respectively. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> break, he had an 8–9 record with a 3.49ERA but also had 157strikeouts in 139innings of work.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 2012, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> Game Wade {{recorded}} {{what was}} only the third triple-double {{in the history of}} the contest, posting 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, joining Michael Jordan and LeBron James as the only players ever to record the prestigious stat (at the 1997 and 2011 games respectively). On March 10, 2012, Wade made the game-winning shot against the Indiana Pacers, giving the Heat a 93–91 overtime win. Wade finished the season averaging 22.1 points, 4.8 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game. In the playoffs, the Heat defeated the New York Knicks in 5 games in the first round, then defeated the Indiana Pacers in 6 games in the second round. Wade heated up in Game 6 of the second round, recording 41 points and 10 rebounds.

They lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1 of the finals but won the next four games, and Wade secured his second NBA title. Wade averaged 22.6 points per game in the series. The Heat became the first team in NBA history to win a championship after trailing in three different playoff series.|$|E

25|$|The Braves {{made their}} move in July, going 14-10.

25|$|One {{positive}} for the Dodgers amidst their increasingly forlorn season was when Matt Kemp and Clayton Kershaw were selected to represent the team <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> Game.

25|$|With Rafael Furcal out for {{the season}} due to injury, and Jon Jay {{starting}} the season slowly, the Cardinals clamored for productivity from their leadoff hitters.
