25|$|A {{group of}} lawyers {{requested}} court injunctions against the Toronto Police Service from using newly purchased Long Range <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Devices</b> (LRAD), {{also known as}} sound cannons, during protests.

25|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of pingers along coastlines effectively excludes cetaceans such as porpoises from prime habitat and resources. Cetaceans which are extremely sensitive to noise are effectively being driven from their preferred coastal habitats by the use of <b>acoustic</b> <b>devices.</b> In poorer quality habitat, harbour porpoises are subjected to increased competition for resources. This situation is recognized as range contraction which can be a result of climate change, anthropogenic activity, or population decline. Large scale range contractions are considered indicative of impending extinction. A similar form of deterrent is noise pollution originating from vessel traffic.|$|E
25|$|Russolo built these {{instruments}} {{to perform the}} music outlined in his Art of Noises manifesto. The instruments were completely acoustic, not electronic. The boxes had various types of internal construction to create different types of noise. Often a wheel was touching a string attached to a drum. The wheel rattled or bowed the strings, while the drum functioned as an acoustic resonator. Many of the instruments featured a handle {{on top of the}} box, which was used to vary the string tension. Pulling the handle raised the tone, and the horn attached to the box amplified the sound. Intonarumori ('noise makers' in Italian) made noise, but not at a very loud volume, since they were all <b>acoustic</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Acoustic Seismic Intrusion Detector (ACOUSID), {{combined}} {{the operations of}} both seismic and <b>acoustic</b> <b>devices,</b> with the added ability to transmit sound from a built-in microphone. The ACOUSID had three switchable detection modes: in the C mode, a line spectrum detector determined the presence of enemy vehicles and had an effective range of an I Mode which was activated by sounds picked up by its internal microphone and could detect personnel at a range of and a B Mode that combined both of the above abilities and operated in a continuous real-time mode of 40 activations per hour with a battery life of 30 days.|$|E
500|$|Physical {{pest control}} {{involves}} trapping or killing pests such as insects and rodents. Historically, local people or paid rat-catchers caught and killed rodents using dogs and traps. On a domestic scale, sticky flypapers {{are used to}} trap flies. In larger buildings, insects may be trapped using such means as pheromones, synthetic volatile chemicals or ultraviolet light to attract the insects; some have a sticky base or an electrically charged grid to kill them. Glueboards are sometimes used for monitoring cockroaches and to catch rodents. Rodents can be killed by suitably baited spring traps and can be caught in cage traps for relocation. Talcum powder or [...] "tracking powder" [...] {{can be used to}} establish routes used by rodents inside buildings and <b>acoustic</b> <b>devices</b> can be used for detecting beetles in structural timbers.|$|E
500|$|The ISU {{created a}} {{security}} perimeter, {{beginning with the}} outer boundary, specifically bordered by King Street to the north, Lake Shore Boulevard to the south, Yonge Street to the east, and Spadina Avenue to the west, where vehicles would be restricted during the summit dates. Residents who lived within the security zone were issued registration cards prior to the summit and other pedestrians who wished to enter the security zone were only {{able to do so}} at one of 38 checkpoints, where they were required to present two pieces of photo identification and provide justification for entry. The area surrounding the Metro Toronto Convention Centre itself was fenced and off-limits to civilians and protesters. The [...] high fence, contracted to SNC-Lavalin by Public Works and Government Services Canada and installed by two Gormley, Ontario-based companies, was built at a cost of [...] and installation began on June 7. The Toronto Police Service installed 77 additional closed-circuit television security cameras in the area and purchased four Long Range <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Devices</b> which were to be in use exclusively during the summit. The ISU decided on also using water cannons for riot control.|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the Hartmann-type stem and cavity air jet acoustic generator coupled with a twin-fluid air-assist atomizer has been used to form a unique practical device for atomization, emulsification and combustion applications. The effects of acoustic and fluid dynamic fields on the atomization parameters have been investigated theoretically. These results have been employed to evolve a step-by-step procedure for designing the important parameters of the twin-fluid <b>acoustic</b> <b>device.</b> Detailed experimental work has been performed to study the effect of various flow and fluid properties on the mean drop size of the spray.
