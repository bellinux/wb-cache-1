5|$|As it {{progresses}} into residential subdivisions, the Hanlon Expressway encounters an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection,</b> with Downey Road travelling to {{the west}} and Kortright Road West to the east. Continuing north, the route crosses to {{the east side of the}} Hanlon Road right-of-way as it intersects Stone Road West {{to the west}} of the Stone Road Mall. Before crossing the Speed River, the expressway meets College Avenue West, an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> at the southwest corner of Centennial Park Arena.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April 2012, an {{intersection}} with Dunreath Drive was opened. This traffic light controlled <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> allowed {{access to and}} from the international terminal of Perth Airport, bypassing Tonkin Highway's intersections with Leach Highway and Kewdale Road/Horrie Miller Drive. The intersection was later removed on 16 July 2015 upon the commissioning of two nearby interchanges as part of Gateway WA.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several traffic circles {{have been}} {{modified}} or replaced along Route 73. The Marlton Circle at Route 70 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run directly {{straight through the}} circle. This circle became known for traffic backups and was replaced with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. A traffic circle that existed {{at the intersection of}} Route 38 and Route 41 in Maple Shade Township was removed by the 1960s and replaced by the current set of interchanges. In addition, the Berlin Circle in Berlin was replaced by an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> between August 2005 and September 2006 at a cost of $73 million.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s, {{construction}} {{began on}} a northward extension of the Conestoga Parkway from King Street to Northfield Drive; this was completed by 1977. By then, construction was underway on a two lane bypass of St. Jacobs east of the original route, connecting with the Conestoga Parkway at Northfield Drive, then an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{intersection}} of Highway 33 and Prince Edward County Road 1 (Scoharie Road) near Picton saw {{the introduction of}} a traffic roundabout, the first ever constructed on a provincial highway in the province, to replace the <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection.</b> The MTO felt that the area had reached its operational threshold due to high tourist and recreational activity, particularly during the busy summer months, and so felt a traffic roundabout was needed.|$|E
5|$|Conn. M-13 {{starts at}} exit164 along I-75/US23 north of Bay City. At the {{interchange}} that marks its southern terminus, the connector route continues {{to the north}} while the main I-75 freeway turns northwesterly. About three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) north, there is an interchange for Wilder Road. Traffic running southbound on the connector that wishes to continue northbound on I-75/US23 has to use Wilder Road to connect to the latter freeway. The connector route is bordered by fields and residential subdivisions as it continues north to the community of Kawkawlin. The freeway ends at an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> with M-13.|$|E

5|$|State Route251 (SR251), {{now known}} as the Northport–Boundary Road or Boundary Highway, began in Northport at an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> at Center Street, known as SR25. The highway turned north from SR25 and {{followed}} the Columbia River upstream as well a railroad owned by the Kettle Falls International Railway. The highway traveled northeast, then east through a series of hairpin turns before turning north to Boundary, an unincorporated community in Stevens County, where SR251 entered Canadian customs and continued into British Columbia as British Columbia Highway 22A (BC22A).|$|E
5|$|The {{expressway}} {{portion of}} M-63 is {{a relic of}} a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph–Benton Harbor area. The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000–2002, with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001, {{and one of the}} two grade-separated interchanges, at Klock Road, demolished and downgraded to an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> in 2002. Today, there are only two overpasses over smaller roads existing on this stretch of expressway.|$|E
5|$|The road {{heads into}} {{commercial}} {{areas in the}} southern part of Denton. The road turns northeast into woods and intersects the eastern terminus of MD 404 Bus. (Franklin Street/Gay Street) at an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection.</b> Past this intersection, MD 313 and MD 404 become a limited-access road and head north, passing residential neighborhoods and woodland along the eastern side of Denton. The road turns to the west and comes to a diamond interchange where MD 313 splits from MD 404 by heading north on two-lane undivided Greensboro Road and MD 619 heads south into Denton on Sixth Street.|$|E

5|$|This {{interchange}} {{was originally}} a traffic circle that was removed {{in the early}} 1970s. The numerous lanes from the stack interchange to the west begin to converge between residential subdivisions east of Dorchester Road, gradually narrowing to four through lanes at the Drummond Road interchange. After passing beneath Portage Road, the route widens on approach to an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> with Stanley Avenue. This intersection is {{the eastern end of}} both the freeway segment of the route and the signed King's Highway 420; east of Stanley Avenue the route is signed as Niagara Regional Road420 and known as Falls Avenue.|$|E
5|$|West of I-87, {{the route}} crosses the Blue Line of Catskill Park and becomes the Onteora Trail. Although still four lanes wide, the route {{is no longer}} a limited-access highway as it has an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> with Modica Lane, a local {{dead-end}} street, just west of where it passes over the Thruway. Not long afterward, the highway meets US209 by way of a cloverleaf interchange. Past US209, the highway enters a rural area as it heads northwest {{into the center of the}} state park.|$|E
5|$|All intersections found {{along the}} route are grade separated, except for a single <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> {{currently}} regulated by traffic lights; a new route is planned to bypass this intersection. As of June 2012, there were tenexits and twoservice areas {{along the route}}. The motorway is currently toll-free except for the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar-Rogovići section. However, most of the motorway is potentially a toll road using a ticket system, with each exit including a toll plaza except those of Veprinac, Opatija, and Matulji. The toll system of the A8/A9 Istrian Y is integrated: no ticket needs to be turned in, gotten, or exchanged when going from the A8 to the A9 or vice versa.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a freeway was {{proposed}} by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission to alleviate traffic on US 130 between Camden and Burlington. This freeway was originally planned as a parkway between the two cities in 1932 that never materialized. The proposed freeway, which was to connect the Ben Franklin Bridge to I-295 near the Assicunk Creek, was to cost $53 million and mostly follow a Conrail railroad line between the two cities. However, the NJDOT never followed through with the proposal. In 2009, the Collingswood Circle at the southern terminus of the US 30 concurrency was replaced with an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> with jughandles.|$|E
5|$|RE 255 enters Newton County {{traveling}} eastward. The highway proceeds eastward before bending northeasterly {{and entering}} dense forest. Continuing eastward, the road reaches an intersection with SH 87. The route continues east, passing the Mitchell Cemetery. The highway intersects {{a couple of}} county routes and turns east before crossing over a small cove on the Toledo Bend Reservoir. RE 255 the enters the community of South Toledo Bend. It travels parallel to the reservoir, passing several small neighborhoods before shifting eastward. RE 255 passes the Shady Oaks Marina and the Sam Forse Collins Recreational Area before reaching its eastern terminus at an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> with FM 692.|$|E
5|$|Since 1953, {{many changes}} have {{occurred}} to Route 70. Several traffic circles that had existed on the road had been either modified or replaced by at-grade intersections. The Marlton Circle at Route 73 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run directly straight through the circle. This circle became known for traffic backups and was replaced with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. Also, the Race Track Circle at the intersection with CR 644 (Haddonfield Road) was eventually replaced by an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection.</b> The Laurelton Circle at Route 88, built in 1937, {{was replaced by the}} 1990s. The Ellisburg Circle at Route 41 and Route 154, was replaced by an intersection with jughandles. The Brielle Circle at the eastern terminus was also converted to an intersection with jughandles in 2001. In conjunction with eliminating the Brielle Circle, Route 70 was also widened between the intersection with Jack Martin Boulevard in Brick Township and the former circle. In July 2004, floods caused by heavy rain washed away a bridge along the route in Southampton Township, leading for it to be replaced. The New Jersey Department of Transportation replaced the September 11th Memorial Bridge over the Manasquan River in a $52 million project that increased capacity on the bridge and added monumental decorations and increased pedestrian access. Construction was scheduled to be complete in December 2010; however, the project was completed ahead of schedule in September 2008.|$|E

After passing over State Street, the freeway curves {{to the east and}} passes between woods to the south and residential and commercial development to the north. The road crosses over the marshy St. Jones River and continues east-northeast, passing between a residential neighborhood to the south and the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) headquarters to the north before coming to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance at Bay Road. Immediately after the Bay Road interchange, the Puncheon Run Connector merges into northbound DE 1 a short distance to the north of Dover Air Force Base.|$|E

Curving back around to the northeast, I-194 meets Business Loop I-94 (BLI-94, Dickman Road). Here the AADT counts average 24,400vehicles a day. The freeway ends at an <b>at-grade</b> <b>intersection</b> with Hamblin Avenue, and continuing north of the intersection, the highway becomes just M-66. BLI-94 runs east of the freeway end on Hamblin Avenue to connect to Michigan Avenue.
