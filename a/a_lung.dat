30|$|In {{the present}} study, the PLL-modified MNPs were {{constructed}} to label human <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells. Compared with previous studies [34, 35], {{the present study}} attempted to use cationic transfection agent PLL coupled with MNPs to enhance the cellular uptake of nanoparticles in human <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells. Furthermore, the effects of magnetic labeling on the biological properties of <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells, including cell viability, proliferation capacity, cytoskeletal disruption, cell cycle, and apoptosis, were investigated separately. The morphology {{and structure of the}} PLL-MNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and vibrating sample magnetometry. The iron uptake of magnetically labeled <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells was confirmed with histological Prussian blue staining. The viability of magnetically labeled <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells was assessed by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) double staining. The cytoskeletal disruption and apoptosis rate of magnetically labeled <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells was assayed by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and fluorescent bisbenzimide dye (Hoechst H 33258). The cell cycle of the labeled <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Taken together, this study provides insights into the effects of magnetic labeling on the biological properties of <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells and facilitates the MRI-assisted tracking and in vivo monitoring of their survival, migration, and transformation, which would be of great interest for targeted lung cancer cell treatment.|$|R

5|$|After Metternich's {{studies in}} Vienna, the Prince's death in September 1797 allowed Metternich to {{participate}} in the Congress of Rastatt. Initially his father took him as a secretary while ensuring that, when proceedings officially started in December 1797, he was named the representative of the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia. A bored Metternich remained at Rastatt in this role until 1799 when the congress was finally wound down. During this period Eleonore had chosen to live with Metternich at Rastatt and gave birth to sons Francis (February 1798) and, shortly {{after the end of the}} Congress, Klemens (June 1799). Much to Metternich's anguish Klemens died after only a few days, and Francis soon contracted <b>a</b> <b>lung</b> infection from which he would never recover.|$|E
5|$|Dmowski was {{a deputy}} to the 1919 Legislative Sejm, but he {{attended}} {{only a single}} session, seeing the Sejm as too chaotic for him to exert much influence; he also spent much of that year either in Paris or recuperating from <b>a</b> <b>lung</b> infection, in Algeria. He reorganized endecja into a new party, Popular National Union (Związek Ludowo-Narodowy). During the Polish-Soviet War {{he was a member}} of the Council of National Defense and a vocal critic of Piłsudski's policies. In the aftermath of the war, Polish eastern borders were similar, if somewhat smaller, from what became known as the Dmowski's Line.|$|E

40|$|SummaryA 26 -year-old {{woman was}} {{admitted}} to the hospital after experiencing fever, cough and shortness of breath for one week. Despite active rescue remedies, the patient died. To make a definite diagnosis, an autopsy was performed.

The diagnosis mainly relies on case history and lung biopsy.

5|$|He also {{experienced}} stomach disease, having a low production of gastric acids. This was worsened by harsh military conditions, including long periods with little food. The first {{references to the}} disease {{that would lead to}} his death, a case of edema, are from a year before, in a letter directed to Álvarez Thomas. He declared having problems in the chest, <b>a</b> <b>lung,</b> and his right leg. A later letter to Sarratea confirmed his situation, and specified that it started on 23 April 1819. The gravity of his condition led the doctor Francisco de Paula Rivero to diagnose an advanced dropsy. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires, where he died. He was embalmed by Joseph Redhead and Juan Sullivan. Sullivan performed the autopsy; it revealed high levels of fluid in multiple edemas and a tumor in the right epigastrium. The liver and spleen had grown beyond normal levels, there were hamartomas in the kidneys, and problems with the lungs and heart.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} years of his life, Blancornelas lived as a virtual prisoner, always {{accompanied}} by an escort of fifteen armed guards. He died in the border city of Tijuana, Baja California on November 23, 2006 in Del Prado Hospital, from complications caused by stomach cancer, possibly caused by the embedded bullets he received when he was shot. Blancornelas was taken to the hospital on November 19 after his son confessed that his father had <b>a</b> <b>lung</b> defect that dated back to his youth. Prior to his death, Blancornelas stopped reporting directly for the Zeta magazine since February 2006 but still sent information to the magazine, particularly on issues covering drug trafficking. Beginning to doubt Zetas ability to foster change, Blancornelas considered closing the magazine with his death. Editor Adela Navarro Bello and his son César René Blanco Villalón persuaded him to let the magazine continue, however, and succeeded him as the magazine's co-publishers.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, the PLL-MNPs were {{fabricated}} with excellent superparamagnetic properties and {{were used to}} label human <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells. The effects of magnetic labeling on the biological behavior of <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells were also analyzed. The results showed that, in comparison with previous studies, the fabricated PLL-MNPs could enhance the cellular uptake in <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells, the low concentrations of the PLL-MNPs used to label cells {{did not affect the}} cell proliferation, viability, and cytoskeleton (F-actin) organization in comparison with unlabeled counterparts, and that cell apoptosis was slightly affected by high concentrations of the PLL-MNPs. In general, the present study provides the detailed insights into the efficient magnetic IONP labeling of <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells and sheds light on the effects of magnetic labeling on the biological behavior of these cells. The results presented herein provide a new perspective for the application of magnetic IONPs in the cell-targeted labeling and noninvasive tracking behavior of <b>A</b> 549 <b>lung</b> cancer cells, as well as offering a promising approach for cell-based lung cancer treatment.|$|R

5|$|LeDuc {{spent many}} years {{traveling}} between Florida and Tennessee, and he won belts in both locations as a singles wrestler and as a tag team competitor. He also spent time on wrestling tours of Japan and New Zealand. One of LeDuc's biggest storylines was with manager Oliver Humperdink, whom LeDuc had accused of stealing his money. This led to a feud, during which LeDuc won the NWA Television Championship from one of Humperdink's wrestlers. LeDuc continued to split his time between singles and tag team wrestling, and he resumed his feud with Lawler in Tennessee. In his later career, LeDuc competed in Puerto Rico and had a brief stint in the World Wrestling Federation. Altogether, LeDuc held 32 championships—15 singles belts and 17 tag team titles.

The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E
