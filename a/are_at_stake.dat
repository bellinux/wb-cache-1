25|$|His {{two main}} {{findings}} are that leaders actually do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely than autocrats to lie to their own people. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising that Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that George Bush and some of his key advisors did lie to the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely to lie to their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He says that it is difficult for leaders to lie to other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake,</b> and you need trust for lying to be effective. He says that it is easier for leaders to lie to their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E

In a new introduction, in which Holmes directly addressed his opponents, he wrote: [...] "I had rather rescue one mother from being poisoned by her attendant, than claim to have saved forty out of fifty patients to whom I had carried the disease."

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said the prospect of playing on Sunday and Monday was a disadvantage to his and other clubs' chances in Europe.

2500|$|On appeal, a panel {{composed}} of judges Fred I.

For the panel, Parker elaborated on the defendants' minimal expectation of privacy {{on the property}} where they were arrested, saying it was irrelevant that the media were not generally allowed there: [...] "DOC employees ... are generally aware that it is their employer's prerogative, not their own, to decide who may have access to DOC grounds ... could have no reasonable expectation that other County employees would be excluded from access to DOC property merely because [...] had been arrested."

2500|$|The Court in its {{decision}} {{wrote that the}} standards it outlined will allow involuntary medication [...] {{for the sole purpose}} of rendering the defendant competent to stand trial only in rare instances.

Therefore, in each case the facts and circumstances must be considered individually, balancing the government's responsibility to ensure timely prosecution with an equal interest in making sure a defendant obtains a fair trial. The court must weigh these factors and decide if forced medication will significantly further or hinder these conflicting interests of the state.|$|E
2500|$|Ongoing {{research}} and development involving extraction technology and processing methods have slowly chipped away at many of the barriers to bitumen production. [...] Many Canadian oil companies {{have a lot of}} exposure to heavy oil through assets in Alberta and so they will benefit when research into more efficient and cost effective solutions yields positive results (Petrobank has numerous patents related to extraction technology that at least one major engineering firm considers 17% more efficient than the widely used steam assisted gravity drainage). [...] In the summer of 2010 a research team at Hokkaido University revealed that they had discovered a catalyst that significantly improves the efficiency while lowering costs related to the processing of bitumen. [...] Also among major Canadian producers, interest in new energy technologies is rising, a direct result of both heightened interest in raising the proportion of the oil sands that can be recovered (10%, which means [...] <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake)</b> and the growing value of licensing rights. [...] That has resulted in a shift in focus over to patent producing {{research and}} development. [...] Cenovus Energy has used its patents as a tool to negotiate deals.|$|E

[...] The second, and corollary, danger is to speech from the chilling effect of individual thought and expression. [...] That danger is especially real in the University setting, where the State acts against a background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition. [...] In ancient Athens, and, as Europe entered into a new period of intellectual awakening, in places like Bologna, Oxford, and Paris, universities began as voluntary and spontaneous assemblages or concourses for students to speak and to write and to learn. [...] The quality and creative power of student intellectual life to this day remains a vital measure of a school's influence and attainment.

2500|$|The ethical and/or moral {{premises}} of healthcare {{are complex and}} intricate. To consolidate such {{a large segment of}} moral philosophy, it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, {{it can be said that}} healthcare itself is a [...] "special" [...] institution within society. With that said, healthcare ought to [...] "be treated differently from other social goods" [...] in a society. It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a coma, then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that [...] "elsewhere" [...] has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|In a case {{involving}} a review of a Russian district court decision, the ECHR found nothing in the judgments to suggest that any form of improper pressure or undue influence was applied. It noted: [...] "On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation." [...] The court said: [...] "The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, {{is vital to the}} principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others." [...] However, the court acknowledged that coercion by the group to reject blood transfusion may be involved, stating [...] "even though the Jehovah's Witnesses whose opposition to blood transfusions was cited in evidence were adults having legal capacity to refuse that form of treatment, the findings of the Russian courts can be understood to mean that their refusals had not been an expression of their true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on them by the applicant community. The Court accepts that, given that health and possibly life itself <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in such situations, the authenticity of the patient's refusal of medical treatment is a legitimate concern." ...|$|E
