25|$|The common {{heritage}} of humanity principle in international law has been viewed as one solution to {{the tragedy of the}} commons dilemma described in an influential article by that name written by Garrett Hardin in the journal Science in 1968. The article critically analyzes a dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest, ultimately destroy a shared limited resource even when each acknowledges that outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed, created controversy particularly through his deprecation of the role of conscience in achieving justice and equality in society. Hardin's views have been noted by scholars and policy-makers supporting privatization of common spaces and suggesting economic rationalism on such social and ecosystems. Though there are many that point out that <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are seeking is a social contract, privatisation would actually annihilate any possibility of rational use - the land would simply be in enclosure. Hardin's views are based on malthusian ideas of competition and over population, we have now accepted that it is the nature of man's consumption (not his numbers) that is causing the destruction of the environment. Hardin, like many who criticise principles of commonality, have to rely on long debunked 18th century ideas to make their point.|$|E

[...] In {{a review of}} the early novels in the sequence, Arthur Mizener wrote: [...] "Powell makes his great egoists, for all their absurdity, something not essentially different from all the rest of us; even Widmerpool, the most extravagant of the lot, is not. However sublimely ridiculous he becomes, he continues to remind us, not so much, perhaps, of what we have done, <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have, in our time, known we might do".|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the filming}} used a single, fixed, Arri 535B camera, {{with almost no}} {{handheld}} usage, and few cuts. Tracking shots relied on a track-mounted dolly, rather than Steadicam, to create calm, predictable camera movement. The crew paid special attention to lighting. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and director Alfredson invented a technique they called [...] "spray light". In an interview, van Hoytema describes it as follows: [...] "If you could capture dull electrical light in a can and spray it like hairspray across Eli’s apartment, it {{would have the same}} result <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> created". For the emotional scenes between Oskar and Eli, van Hoytema consistently diffused the lighting.|$|E

500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success {{is that we}} do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, he hopes to show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do for ourselves. It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Russo {{brothers}} and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely working on Avengers: Infinity War and Phase Three, they saw [...] "a through line from Winter Soldier, through Civil War, right to Infinity War", with films like Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok laying {{groundwork for the}} [...] "culmination" [...] in Infinity War. Subsequently, they talked [...] "to the directors and writers of the other Phase 3 movies on an almost weekly basis, {{to make sure everything}} lines up right." [...] Similarly, when developing the crossover miniseries The Defenders, showrunner Marco Ramirez consulted with the creators of all the individual Marvel Netflix series, having them read each of the scripts for The Defenders and provide insight into the individual character's world. In April 2017, along with his announcement that he was returning to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, James Gunn revealed he would be working with Marvel [...] "to help design where these stories go, and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have created so far." ...|$|E
500|$|Following [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] on the Sgt. Pepper album (as first {{released}} on LP in the UK and years later worldwide on CD) is a high-frequency 15-kilohertz tone and some randomly spliced Beatles studio chatter. The frequency is best understood <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{know as a}} dog whistle as the frequency is {{picked up by a}} dog's ear and was part of their humour. They joked about picturing barking dogs should they be present when the album would finish. [...] Recorded two months after the mono and stereo masters for [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] had been finalised, the studio chatter (titled in the session notes [...] "Edit for LP End") was added to the run-out groove of the initial British pressing. There are even a few variations of the chatter, though the best known one is them saying during the laughter and chatter [...] "never could see any other way." [...] The Anthology 2 album includes an early, pre-orchestral version of the song and Anthology 3 includes a version of [...] "The End" [...] that concludes by having the last note fade into the final chord of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (reversed, then played forwards). The Love version has the song starting with Lennon's intro of [...] "sugar plum fairy", with the strings being more prominent during the crescendos.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are fine}} tuning {{arguments}} that are naturalistic. As modern cosmology developed, various hypotheses have been proposed. One is an oscillatory universe or a multiverse, where {{fundamental physical constants}} are postulated to resolve themselves to random values in different iterations of reality. Under this hypothesis, separate parts of reality would have wildly different characteristics. In such scenarios, the issue of fine-tuning does not arise at all, as only those [...] "universes" [...] with constants hospitable to life (such <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> observe) would develop life capable of contemplating {{the question of the}} origin of fine-tuning.|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey Overstreet {{adds that}} [...] "the scenes in which Chigurh stalks Moss are as suspenseful as {{anything}} the Coens have ever staged. And that {{has as much}} to do with what we hear <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> see. No Country for Old Men lacks a traditional soundtrack, but don't say it doesn't have music. The blip-blip-blip of a transponder becomes as frightening as the famous theme from Jaws. The sound of footsteps on the hardwood floors of a hotel hallway are as ominous as the drums of war. When the leather of a briefcase squeaks against the metal of a ventilation shaft, you'll cringe, and the distant echo of a telephone ringing in a hotel lobby will jangle your nerves." ...|$|E

The same survey stated that about 30% of adults reported they consumed a vitamin C dietary supplement or a multi-vitamin/mineral supplement that included vitamin C, and that for these people total consumption was between 300 and 400 mg/d.|$|E

2500|$|Henry's {{philosophy}} {{goes on to}} aver that we undergo life in {{a radical}} passivity, we are reduced to bear it permanently <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have not wanted, and that this radical passivity of life is the foundation {{and the cause of}} suffering. No-one has ever given himself life. At the same time, the simple fact of living, of being alive and of feeling oneself instead of being nothing and of not existing is already the highest joy and the greatest happiness. Suffering and joy belong to the essence of life, they are the two fundamental affective tonalities of its manifestation and of its [...] "pathetic" [...] self-revelation (from the French word pathétique which means capable of feeling something like suffering or joy).|$|E
2500|$|At the hearings, Rushmore {{testified against}} Edward G. Robinson, Charles Chaplin, Clifford Odets and Dalton Trumbo as {{potential}} or real communists: [...] "the Daily Worker regarded Charles Chaplin and Edward G. Robinson <b>as</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{call in the}} newspaper business 'sacred cows,' people you trust favorably. I don't {{know whether or not}} [...] is a Communist, but for ten years he has been joining front organizations and is still doing it." [...] Unknown to the public at large, since 1943 the US Army Signal Intelligence Service was decrypting Soviet intelligence traffic through the Venona project, which revealed that most Soviet agents operated east of the Mississippi. While Soviet agents like Otto Katz operated propaganda fronts like the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League in the 1930s, Venona failed to reveal any Soviet agent working in Hollywood directly involved with espionage or sabotage, though members and former members of the CPUSA did work in the film industry, many of whom would be blacklisted by the major studios. The public's unawareness of Venona enabled Rushmore to exaggerate the threat of communists in Hollywood. But at the HUAC hearings, Rushmore did correctly identify Gerhart Eisler, ostensibly an anti-Nazi refugee from Germany, as the probable Soviet leader of the CPUSA. The opening of the Soviet archives decades later showed that Eisler, a Comintern agent, used his political authority to make Earl Browder the American [...] "leader" [...] of the CPUSA during a mid-1930s leadership dispute.|$|E
