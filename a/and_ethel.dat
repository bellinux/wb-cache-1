In a codicil, Druitt senior instructed his executors to deduct the money he had advanced to his son from the legacy of £500. Montague received very little money, if any, from his father's will, although he did receive some of his father's personal possessions. Most of Dr Druitt's estate went to his wife Ann, three unmarried daughters (Georgiana, Edith <b>and</b> <b>Ethel),</b> and eldest son William.|$|E

The film starred Louise Fazenda, Dorothy Phillips <b>and</b> <b>Ethel</b> Wales and was shot in early 1927. The film was released in May 1927 and was a minor hit. For many years it was believed to be a lost film until film director Peter Bogdanovich discovered a print in 20th Century Fox's film vaults, although the print was missing part of reel three and all of reel four.|$|E

Robey <b>and</b> <b>Ethel</b> resided briefly in Circus Road, St John's Wood, until the birth of their first child Edward in 1900. They then moved to 83 Finchley Road in Swiss Cottage, Hampstead. Family life suited Robey; his son Edward recalled many happy experiences with his father, including the evenings when he would accompany him to the half-dozen music halls at which he would be appearing each night.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs, {{a member of}} the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass, <b>and</b> <b>Ethel</b> and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like George Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades. The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore. The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.|$|E

5|$|While other spies such as Julius <b>and</b> <b>Ethel</b> Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them {{with the impression that}} he might have been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|With so {{many people}} involved, {{security}} was a difficult task. A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the Manhattan Project's security issues.

The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada.

5|$|Baltimore's early jazz pioneers {{included}} Blanche Calloway, one of {{the first}} female jazz bandleaders in the United States, and sister to jazz legend Cab Calloway. Both the Calloways, like many of Baltimore's prominent black musicians, studied at Frederick Douglass High School with William Llewellyn Wilson, himself a renowned performer and conductor for the first African American symphony in Baltimore. Baltimore was also home to Chick Webb, one of jazz's most heralded drummers, who became a musical star despite being born hunchbacked and crippled at the age of five years. Later Baltimoreans in jazz include Elmer Snowden, <b>and</b> <b>Ethel</b> Ennis. After Pennsylvania Avenue declined in the 1950s, Baltimore's jazz scene changed. The Left Bank Jazz Society, an organization dedicated to promoting live jazz, began holding a weekly series of concerts in 1965, featuring the biggest names in the field, including Duke Ellington and John Coltrane. The tapes from these recordings became legendary within the jazz aficionados, but they did not begin to be released until 2000, due to legal complications.|$|E

It co-starred Alan Bunce as Albert.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{transition}} of the young bands from being local attractions to touring extensively in the UK, major record labels' A agents still did not recognise the rising new trend. Thus, most new bands signed contracts with small independent labels, which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution. Many other bands, including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Diamond Head, self-produced their first releases and sold them through mail order or at concerts. Saxon {{were the first to}} sign with an internationally distributed label, the French Carrere Records, followed by Def Leppard with Phonogram in August 1979, and Iron Maiden with EMI in December 1979. In early 1980, EMI tested the market with the Neal Kay-compiled album Metal for Muthas and a UK tour of the bands that had contributed to the compilation, eventually signing Angel Witch (who were dropped after the release of their first single) <b>and</b> <b>Ethel</b> the Frog.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{started on}} June15, {{although}} an unnamed storm developed {{about a week}} prior over the western North Atlantic Ocean. A later storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on June12 alleviated drought conditions in the south-central United States. Hurricane Anna developed in late July and hit Mexico. Tropical storms Carla <b>and</b> <b>Ethel</b> both formed near the Bahamas and moved northeastward until dissipating. The lone hurricane that hit the contiguous United States was Hurricane Flossy. One of the final storms of the year, Greta, was an unusually large hurricane that produced high waves from Florida to the Lesser Antilles. It developed in the western Caribbean and moved {{across much of the}} southeastern United States, causing $24.8million in damage and 15deaths. There were also several tropical depressions, as well as one subtropical cyclone, in the season.|$|E
5|$|Under {{interrogation}} by MI5 officer William Skardon at {{an informal}} meeting in December 1949, Fuchs initially denied being a spy {{and was not}} detained. In January 1950, Fuchs arranged another interview with Skardon and voluntarily confessed {{that he was a}} spy. Three days later, he also directed a statement more technical in content to Michael Perrin, the deputy controller of atomic energy within the Ministry of Supply. Fuchs told interrogators that the NKGB had acquired an agent in Berkeley, California, who had informed the Soviet Union about electromagnetic separation research of uranium-235 in 1942 or earlier. Fuchs's statements to British and American intelligence agencies were used to implicate Harry Gold, a key witness in the trials of David Greenglass and Julius <b>and</b> <b>Ethel</b> Rosenberg in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Although the Igor Gouzenko and Elizabeth Bentley affairs {{had raised}} the issue of Soviet espionage as far back as 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply {{increased}} the sense of threat from Communism in the United States. The Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected. That same year, Mao Zedong's Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing Kuomintang. In 1950, the Korean War began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China. The following year also saw several significant developments regarding Soviet Cold War espionage activities. In January 1950, Alger Hiss, a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run out for that crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Great Britain, Klaus Fuchs confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during the War. Julius <b>and</b> <b>Ethel</b> Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 on charges of stealing atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.|$|E
