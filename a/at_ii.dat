5|$|The 1st Armoured Division was {{subsequently}} reformed, {{and became a}} mobile reserve in south eastern England. It was tasked with counter-attacking an invading German army, and the 1st Support Group was given two Canadian infantry battalions for this purpose. In November 1940 Morgan was appointed Brigadier General Staff (BGS) <b>at</b> <b>II</b> Corps, based in Norfolk. Morgan was promoted major-general in 1941 and in late February given command of the Devon and Cornwall County Division, a static formation created for coastal defence, lacking artillery, engineers and divisional troops. In October he assumed command of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division, a first-line TA formation serving as part of Southern Command and later Northern Command. Despite being a first-line formation, the division included {{a large number of}} second-line units, due mainly to the division splitting with its second-line duplicate, the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, on a geographical basis. The division was placed on the Lower Establishment in January 1942, losing much of its artillery, engineers and divisional troops and receiving a low priority for modern equipment.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Brigade {{moved up}} to the line to relieve the 2nd and Rifle Brigades and {{remained}} there until the division was withdrawn to a training area in late October, following the relief of II ANZAC Corps by the Canadian Corps. The division suffered heavy losses on 12 October: about 845 men were killed and a further 1,900 wounded in the worst defeat in New Zealand military history. Although Russell blamed himself for {{the outcome of the}} attack and wrote to politicians in New Zealand stating so, in his private correspondence {{he made it clear that}} planning and preparation by Godley and his staff <b>at</b> <b>II</b> ANZAC Corps was inadequate and did not take into account the poor ground conditions at Passchendaele.|$|E
25|$|The Hevajra Tantra {{has some}} {{material}} {{in common with}} other sources: II iii 29 of the Hevajratantra {{is the same as}} XVI 59c-60b of the Guhyasamajatantra, and an Apabhraṃśa couplet <b>at</b> <b>II</b> v 67 of the Hevajratantra appears in one of Saraha's songs. In the case of the Guhyasamaja, it is safe to assume that the Hevajra version is later, but the case is not as clear cut with the Saraha quote, since the relative dates are harder to establish with any certainty.|$|E

25|$|Following attacks near Miraumont {{and then}} Oppy, during which Lance Corporal James Welch {{was awarded the}} Victoria Cross (VC), the battalion, badly understrength, {{thereafter}} remained in a quiet sector of the front {{for most of the}} year, and was temporarily merged with the 23rd (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers. Dempsey was soon posted as a staff officer <b>at</b> <b>II</b> Corps HQ, before returning to the 1st Royal Berkshires, this time in command of 'A' Company. In late November the battalion attacked Bourlon Wood as part of the Battle of Cambrai. On 12 March 1918, as the Germans prepared to launch their Spring Offensive, they laid down a heavy mustard gas barrage on Dempsey's battalion, which was now at La Vacquerie with Dempsey commanding 'D' Company. Dempsey, along with 10 officers and 250 other ranks, was wounded and later evacuated to England, where he had a lung removed. Returning to the battalion in July, where, with the tide of the war having turned, the 1st Royal Berkshires took part in the Hundred Days Offensive until the war ended on 11 November 1918. By then the battalion was at Escarmain. Dempsey was awarded the Military Cross (MC), which was gazetted in the King's Birthday Honours list in June 1919.|$|E
500|$|Early in October 1943, {{a special}} staff was {{established}} <b>at</b> <b>II</b> Corps Headquarters {{to study the}} Japanese supply system. It did not include an officer with experience in maintaining a large force over a native carrier line, and therefore took time to realise that the Japanese force could not be maintained over an inland track, as was first assumed. Operations soon confirmed that the Japanese were dependent on a coastal supply line. During the Battle of Sattelberg, the Allies set out to cut this supply line. A three-pronged approach was taken: ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his achievements, Vasey {{was twice}} {{passed over for}} promotion. In November 1943, the {{announcement}} of the appointment of Lieutenant General Iven Mackay as High Commissioner to India, and the subsequent elevation of Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead to command New Guinea Force and Second Army, created a vacancy <b>at</b> <b>II</b> Corps, which was filled by Vasey's old rival, Frank Berryman. Then in February 1944, the appointment of Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, led to a vacancy at I Corps, for which General Blamey nominated both Vasey and Major General Stanley Savige, but recommended the latter. Army Minister Frank Forde queried Blamey's recommendation, which was very unusual, and asked who was the senior officer. On being informed that Savige was senior to Vasey—although not as senior as Arthur [...] "Tubby" [...] Allen or James Cannan—he dropped his objection. General Douglas MacArthur considered Vasey's supersession [...] "outrageous". Yet Blamey had not lost faith in Vasey; asked at a social function about his opinion of Vasey, Blamey called out to him across the room. [...] "There, ladies and gentlemen," [...] Blamey declared, [...] "is my ideal fighting commander." ...|$|E

500|$|After El Alamein, Morshead and the 9th Division were {{recalled}} to the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). Morshead {{arrived in}} Fremantle on 19 February 1943 {{where he was}} welcomed home by Lieutenant General Gordon Bennett, who had been his divisional commander in Sydney between the wars. Morshead then flew to Melbourne where he was met by Lady Morshead, Sir Winston Dugan and Sir Thomas Blamey, who informed Morshead {{that he would take}} over command of a corps. In March 1943, Morshead became commander of [...] II Corps, handing over command of the 9th Division to Major General George Wootten. The association between Morshead and the 9th Division was not entirely broken however, as it formed part of his corps, along with the 6th and 7th Divisions, all three of which were undergoing jungle warfare training on the Atherton Tableland for upcoming battles in New Guinea. It was Blamey's intention that Morshead would spend some time learning the art of jungle warfare before his II Corps replaced Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring's I Corps in New Guinea. Morshead's chief of staff <b>at</b> <b>II</b> Corps was Brigadier Henry Wells, who had been his chief of staff at El Alamein.|$|E
2500|$|Antithrombin I (AT I) {{refers to}} the {{absorption}} of thrombin onto fibrin after thrombin has activated fibrinogen. Antithrombin II (<b>AT</b> <b>II)</b> refers to a cofactor in plasma, which together with heparin interferes with the interaction of thrombin and fibrinogen. Antithrombin III (AT III) refers to a substance in plasma that inactivates thrombin. Antithrombin IV (AT IV) refers to an antithrombin that becomes activated during and shortly after blood coagulation. Only AT III and possibly AT I are medically significant. AT III is generally referred to solely as [...] "Antithrombin" [...] and it is Antithrombin III that is discussed in this article.|$|E
