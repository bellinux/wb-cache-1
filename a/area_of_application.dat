25|$|Indian Remote Sensing {{satellites}} (IRS) are {{a series}} of earth observation satellites, built, launched and maintained by ISRO. The IRS series provides remote sensing services to the country. The Indian Remote Sensing Satellite system is the largest constellation of remote sensing satellites for civilian use in operation today in the world. All the satellites are placed in polar Sun-synchronous orbit and provide data in a variety of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions to enable several programmes to be undertaken relevant to national development. The initial versions are composed of the 1 (A, B, C, D) nomenclature. The later versions are named based on their <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> including OceanSat, CartoSat, ResourceSat.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of strong reciprocity implies that systems developed based purely on material self-interest may be missing important motivators in the marketplace. This section gives {{two examples of}} possible implications. One <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> is {{in the design of}} incentive schemes. For example, standard contract theory has difficulty dealing with the degree of incompleteness in contracts and the lack of use of performance measures, even when they are cheap to implement. Strong reciprocity and models based on it suggest that this can be explained by people's willingness to act fairly, even when it is against their material self-interest. Experimental results suggest that this is indeed the case, with participants preferring less complete contracts, and workers willing to contribute a fair amount beyond what would be in their own self-interest.|$|E
25|$|As {{was shown}} by Einstein, the only form of {{accelerated}} motion that cannot be described {{is the one}} due to gravitation, since special relativity is not compatible with the Equivalence principle. Einstein was also unsatisfied {{with the fact that}} inertial frames are preferred over accelerated frames. Thus {{over the course of several}} years (1908–1915), Einstein developed general relativity. This theory includes the replacement of Euclidean geometry by non-Euclidean geometry, and the resultant curvature of the path of light led Einstein (1912) to the conclusion that (like in accelerated frames) the speed of light is not constant in extended gravitational fields. Therefore, Abraham (1912) argued that Einstein had given special relativity a coup de grâce. Einstein responded that within its <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> (in areas where gravitational influences can be neglected) special relativity is still applicable with high precision, so one cannot speak of a coup de grâce at all.|$|E

25|$|In September 2003, Bombardier {{gave the}} Class 185 family a brand name, TRAXX, {{intended}} to allude {{to the terms}} 'traction', 'track' and 'attraction'. The acronym stands for Transnational Railway Applications with eXtreme fleXibility. The first letter of TRAXX type designations provides for differentiation according to the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> with F for freight and P for passenger. The original system also tentatively included H for heavy-haul and S for high-speed, but no actual vehicles were delivered under this designation. The number following the first letter indicates the top speed of the locomotive in kilometers per hour. The next two letters indicate the supply system, with AC for alternating current electric locomotives, DC for direct current electric locomotives, MS for multi-system locomotives capable of operating both under AC and DC overhead wires, and DE was foreseen from the start for an eventual Diesel-electric version. An extra P letter at the end was to designate powerheads (traction heads), that is locomotives with one driving cabin for push-pull operation. An also optional number at the end designates different versions, later used for the designation of generations.|$|E
500|$|Mechanical-electrical analogies {{are useful}} in general where the system {{includes}} transducers between different energy domains. [...] Another <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> is the mechanical parts of acoustic systems such as the pickup and tonearm of record players. [...] This was of some importance in early phonographs where the audio is transmitted from the pickup needle to the horn through various mechanical components entirely without electrical amplification. [...] Early phonographs suffered badly from unwanted resonances in the mechanical parts. [...] It was found that these could be eliminated by treating the mechanical parts as components of a low-pass filter which {{has the effect of}} flattening out the passband.|$|E

2500|$|Many applied {{mathematics}} programs (as opposed to departments) consist of primarily cross-listed courses and jointly appointed faculty in departments representing applications. [...] Some Ph.D. programs in {{applied mathematics}} require {{little or no}} coursework outside mathematics, while others require substantial coursework in a specific <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>application.</b> [...] In some respects this difference reflects the distinction between [...] "application of mathematics" [...] and [...] "applied mathematics".|$|E
2500|$|The {{basis for}} rival {{approaches}} {{tends to be}} the denial that sound theory can be made without some concrete linking with its <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>application.</b> Both the 19th century Historical School and the 20th Century Institutionalists argue in this way. Mitchell (1936) noted that those working in [...] "specialized fields" [...] had little use for kind of qualitative theory postulated by Marshall and Jevons. Mitchell suggested that knowledge of [...] "real markets," [...] would cause the complexion and content of economic theory (Mitchell 1937, 26–28). Friedman shared this view that theoretical concepts might or rather should arise out of the analysis of real world data. For both Mitchell and Friedman economics should involve an interaction between examining data and formulating hypotheses.|$|E
