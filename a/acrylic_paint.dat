25|$|Color field, curiously {{enough or}} perhaps not, became a viable way of {{painting}} {{at exactly the}} time that <b>acrylic</b> <b>paint,</b> the new plastic paint, came into being. It {{was as if the}} new paint demanded a new possibility in painting, and the painters arrived at it. Oil paint, which has a medium that is quite different, which isn't water-based, always leaves a slick of oil, or puddle of oil, {{around the edge of the}} color. <b>Acrylic</b> <b>paint</b> stops at its own edge. Color field painting came in at the same time as the invention of this new paint.|$|E

25|$|Joan Miró {{was one of}} {{the first}} and most {{successful}} stain painters. Although staining in oil was considered dangerous to cotton canvas in the long run, Miró's example during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s was an inspiration and an influence on the younger generation. One of the reasons for the success of the Color Field movement was the technique of staining. Artists would mix and dilute their paint in buckets or coffee cans making a fluid liquid and then they would pour it into raw unprimed canvas, generally cotton duck. The paint could also be brushed on or rolled on or thrown on or poured on or sprayed on, and would spread into the fabric of the canvas. Generally artists would draw shapes and areas as they stained. Many different artists employed staining as the technique of choice to use in making their paintings. James Brooks, Jackson Pollock, Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Paul Jenkins and dozens of other painters found that pouring and staining opened the door to innovations and revolutionary methods of drawing and expressing meaning in new ways. The number of artists who stained in the 1960s greatly increased with the availability of <b>acrylic</b> <b>paint.</b> Staining <b>acrylic</b> <b>paint</b> into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Acrylic</b> <b>painting</b> {{techniques}} are {{different styles of}} manipulating and working with polymer-based <b>acrylic</b> <b>paints.</b> <b>Acrylics</b> differ from oil paints in that they have shorter drying times (as little as 10 minutes) and are soluble in water. These types of paint {{eliminate the need for}} turpentine and gesso, and can be applied directly onto canvas. Aside from painting with concentrated color <b>paints,</b> <b>acrylics</b> can also be watered down to a consistency that can be poured or used for glazes.|$|R

25|$|Painting {{the human}} body in black is also {{employed}} in low-key photography using non-toxic dyes or pigments in order to darken and enhance {{as much as possible}} the colour of the subjects photographed, and to achieve the desired effects. In order to achieve the effect of reflection of light that creates a white contour of the painted body, as well as a high contrast between black and white, various dyes mixed with body creams are used. These usually include henna, tempera or <b>acrylic</b> <b>paint.</b> Liquid latex, which is composed of natural latex and dyes, is also used.|$|E
25|$|Magna, {{a special}} artist use <b>acrylic</b> <b>paint</b> was {{developed}} by Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden in 1947 and reformulated in 1960, specifically for Morris Louis and other stain painters of the color field movement. In Magna pigments are ground in an acrylic resin with alcohol-based solvents. Unlike modern water-based acrylics, Magna is miscible with turpentine or mineral spirits and dries rapidly to a matte or glossy finish. It was used extensively by Morris Louis, and Friedel Dzubas and also by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. Magna colors are more vivid and intense than regular acrylic water-based paints. Louis used Magna to great effect in his Stripe Series, where the colors are used undiluted and are poured unmixed directly from the can.|$|E

500|$|The both {{versions}} of the game, for the PC and the Amiga, were developed separately and simultaneously, {{in order to make}} the best possible product for each platform rather than a quick port from one system to another. A version for the Amiga CD32 had also been planned. The game mixes backgrounds hand-drawn with <b>acrylic</b> <b>paint</b> and then digitized by the Mohr, and sprite bitmap graphics made in Deluxe Paint and Brilliance on the Amiga with some rotoscoped animations. The animators Billy Allison and Stuart Atkinson created [...] "huge" [...] DPaint-made character sequences but they had to implement them in game in more efficient way due to computer memory limitations. In addition, the PC version used the full 8-bit color of a 256 color palette, but the Amiga version had to be downscaled to only 32 colors (including 24 colors for the background and eight colors for the main character; the other characters had to be drawn with these colors). The game also uses various digitized sound effects. Allison said, [...] "there were whole sections that never made it in, like a roller skating frankenstein, that shattered into loads of tiny versions of him if you 'killed' him, I did the sprites etc, it just never made it to the game." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some airbrushes use {{pressures}} {{as low as}} 20 psi (1.38 bar) {{while others}} use pressures {{in the region of}} 30-35 psi (2-2.4 bar). Larger [...] "spray guns" [...] as used for automobile spray-painting need 100 psi (6.8 bar) or more to adequately atomize a thicker paint using less solvent. They are capable of delivering a heavier coating more rapidly over a wide area. Even with small artist airbrushes using <b>acrylic</b> <b>paint,</b> artists must be careful not to breathe in the atomized paint, which floats in the air for minutes and can go deep into the lungs. With commercial spray guns for automobiles, it is vital that the painter have a clean air source to breathe, because automotive paint is far more harmful to the lungs than acrylic. Certain spray guns, called High-Volume Low-Pressure (HVLP) spray guns, are designed to deliver the same high volumes of paint without requiring such high pressures.|$|E
