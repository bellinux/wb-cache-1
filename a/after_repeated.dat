40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{identify}} prognostic factors in patients who developed recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) <b>after</b> <b>repeat</b> hepatectomy and to elucidate the role of multicentric occurrence in the second tumor after a first hepatectomy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: A repeat hepatectomy for recurrent HCC has been established as the most effective treatment modality, whenever it is possible. However, the prognostic factors for recurrent HCC <b>after</b> <b>repeat</b> hepatectomy have yet to be clarified. METHODS: Forty-one patients who underwent a curative repeat hepatectomy were retrospectively studied. Patient survival and disease-free survival after recurrence were univariately and multivariately analyzed using 38 clinicopathologic variables. The histologic grade of HCC at repeat hepatectomy was also compared with that at first hepatectomy. RESULTS: Patient survival <b>after</b> <b>repeat</b> hepatectomy did not differ substantially from that in 312 patients undergoing primary hepatectomy. However, the disease-free survival <b>after</b> <b>repeat</b> hepatectomy was significantly lower than that in patients with only a primary hepatectomy (p < 0. 05). Multivariate analysis revealed only portal vein invasion in the first hepatectomy to be an independent and significantly poor prognostic factor. Regarding multicentric occurrence at repeat hepatectomy, only 6 of 40 patients (15 %) whose specimens could be evaluated histologically were determined to be Edmondson and Steiner's Grade 1. CONCLUSIONS: The only prognostic factor identified in patients with recurrent HCC <b>after</b> <b>repeat</b> hepatectomy was portal vein invasion in the first hepatectomy. Most second tumors after the first hepatectomy are considered to be caused by metastatic recurrence, not by multicentric occurrence...|$|R

5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem {{at this time}} was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour <b>after</b> <b>repeated</b> use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than quinine.

40|$|Mycoplasma genitalium is an {{established}} cause of sexually transmitted infections. Studies of disease associations are often performed on archived specimens, but {{little is known}} about the effect of storage of specimens on the detection of M. genitalium. Genital swab and first-void urine specimens submitted for detection of M. genitalium were tested on the day of receipt. Remnants of positive original specimens as well as DNA preparations were stored at − 20 °C for up to 18 months. A total of 361 M. genitalium-positive specimens were available. PCR <b>after</b> <b>repeat</b> DNA preparation was performed for 262 specimens. The sensitivity <b>after</b> <b>repeat</b> DNA preparation was 90 %, and the median decrease in DNA load was 155 genome equivalents (geq) (P < 0. 0001). For 327 specimens, PCR could be repeated on the primary DNA preparation. The sensitivity of PCR after storage was 95 %, and the median decrease in DNA load was 13. 5 geq (P < 0. 0001). The specimens yielding negative results at repeat testing had a significantly lower median DNA load in the primary analysis than those with a repeat positive test (P < 0. 0001). For 228 specimens, PCR could be performed both on the primary DNA preparation and <b>after</b> <b>repeat</b> DNA preparation. The median DNA load was lower <b>after</b> <b>repeat</b> DNA extraction than <b>after</b> <b>repeat</b> testing of the stored DNA extract (P < 0. 0001). In conclusion, the M. genitalium DNA load as well as the detection rate decreased after storage. This was more pronounced in clinical specimens stored frozen than in stored DNA extracts, particularly in those with an initial low DNA load...|$|R
5|$|The Barrier (later {{known as}} the Ross Ice Shelf) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed {{significantly}} in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales after {{the large number of}} whales seen there. Shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might calve into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. <b>After</b> <b>repeated</b> efforts to approach this coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, Nimrod was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Rhodesian Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Garfield Todd, began removing restrictions imposed on native Africans. The civil service opened more positions to blacks, the title for male Africans was changed from 'AM' (African male) to Mr., and diners and restaurants were allowed to be multiracial; Welensky, as Transport Minister, allowed for railway dining cars to be multiracial. However, when it came to liberalising alcohol restrictions on blacks, Welensky argued against doing so, stating that such an action would cause the UFP to lose the next election. <b>After</b> <b>repeated</b> failed attempts to secure Dominion status for the federation, Prime Minister Huggins opted not to stand again for his party's leadership at their September 1956 conference.

The site was inaugurated in August 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall. In May 2013 a judge ruled that the 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the wall should not be deemed as disturbing the public order.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>repeated</b> {{attempts}} to reach Derek on his phone, Sharon finds Derek {{at the hospital}} and suspects that he and Lisa had an affair, as Lisa claims. LAPD Detective Monica Reese (Christine Lahti) at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims, due to inconsistencies in her side of the story, and informs Derek of her belief in him. Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up for dinner and finally reconcile. Meanwhile, Lisa tricks the babysitter Samantha (Scout Taylor-Compton) into letting her in under the pretense of being one of Sharon's friends. When Derek and Sharon return home after dinner, they discover that Lisa had been in the house and seemingly abducted Derek and Sharon's infant son, Kyle (Nathan and Nicolas Myers). Derek goes to his car with the intent to pursue Lisa, only to find the baby is safely sitting in the back seat. He and Sharon immediately take Kyle to the hospital for a check-up. When Derek and Sharon return home from the hospital, they find Lisa has trashed their bedroom and removed Sharon's face from their family portrait. Sharon leaves a threatening voice message on Lisa's phone, and she and Derek set up a home alarm system.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Persian wars in 299, co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius traveled from Persia to Syrian Antioch (Antakya). The Christian rhetor Lactantius records that, at Antioch some time in 299, the emperors were engaged in sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices, diviners of omens from sacrificed animals, were unable to read the sacrificed animals and failed to do so <b>after</b> <b>repeated</b> trials. The master haruspex eventually declared that this failure was the result of interruptions in the process caused by profane men. Certain Christians in the imperial household had been observed making {{the sign of the cross}} during the ceremonies and were alleged to have disrupted the haruspices divination. Diocletian, enraged by this turn of events, declared that all members of the court must make a sacrifice themselves. Diocletian and Galerius also sent letters to the military command, demanding that the entire army perform the sacrifices or else face discharge. Since there are no reports of bloodshed in Lactantius's narrative, Christians in the imperial household must have survived the event.|$|E
