5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
500|$|When {{the band}} completes touring for California, {{they plan to}} take time off and begin {{recording}} their eighth studio album. [...] "Somehow, Blink has had this resurgence like we never expected," [...] Hoppus told Kerrang! in July 2017. [...] "I count myself lucky to have been [...] <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{believed}} that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises have added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes {{has been compared to}} the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter has noted, [...] "The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have, I am used to it." [...] He later stated that the helmets in their current iteration are fitted with ventilators to prevent overheating.|$|E

500|$|Landis {{felt that}} the Black Sox scandal had been {{initiated}} by people involved in horse racing, and stated that [...] "by God, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{have anything to do}} with this game, they'll never get another hold on it." [...] In 1921, his first season as commissioner, New York Giants owner Charles Stoneham and manager John McGraw purchased Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba. Landis gave Stoneham and McGraw an ultimatum—they could not be involved in both baseball and horse racing. They quickly put the track back on the market.|$|E
500|$|... "both my {{children}} and I have but one dream: to return! To return to that stupendous New World, which makes you almost guiddy [...] because of its immencity, [...] its noise, its striving, its fearful impetuous [...] to get on, to do always more, always bigger, quicker, more astonishingly a restless, flaring great world, where I think everything can be realised... I know, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> live, breathe and think, the love for America will beautify my life and thoughts... Perhaps Fate will allow me one day {{to go back to}} America." ...|$|E
500|$|The Charity Shield was {{presented}} to Bruce by former Arsenal manager Billy Wright. Wright died barely a year later, aged 70. Graham assumed both clubs would share the trophy, so {{when it came to}} a penalty shoot-out he entrusted his players to decide their order. He described Wright's goal as [...] "brilliant" [...] and felt it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] that Seaman missed: [...] "For a goalkeeper, he normally takes great penalties. He normally hits them hard but he decided to try and place this one and it didn't work." [...] Wright was unashamed of his penalty miss, [...] "…just <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> don't do it when it is important".|$|E

500|$|To this end, Welensky {{organised}} {{a conference}} in February 1949 to investigate {{the idea of a}} federation. Held at the Victoria Falls Hotel (a common venue for Rhodesian political conferences), representatives from the Northern and Southern Rhodesian Governments were present, but native Africans and the British Government were not. It was agreed that continued pushes for amalgamation would fail, with both the British and native Africans opposed. Welensky suggested that the Constitution of Australia be used as a basis for the proposed federal constitution, and pushed the idea of 'partnership' between blacks and whites. However, he insisted that [...] "for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can see, in that partnership [...] will be senior partners".|$|E
500|$|Lowell had {{intended}} never to remarry {{after the death}} of his wife Maria White. However, in 1857, surprising his friends, he became engaged to Frances Dunlap, who many described as simple and unattractive. Dunlap, niece of the former governor of Maine Robert P. Dunlap, was a friend of Lowell's first wife and formerly wealthy, though she and her family had fallen into reduced circumstances. Lowell and Dunlap married on September 16, 1857, in a ceremony performed by his brother. Lowell wrote, [...] "My second marriage was the wisest act of my life, & <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am sure of it, I can afford to wait till my friends agree with me." ...|$|E
500|$|Zola {{himself was}} happy with his {{achievements}} to the Chelsea side, but when asked if his substitution was all projected, he denied it, stating: [...] "It wasn't planned. In the moment, I used my positive strength and I got a reward for the passion, the work not only I, but the masseur Mimmo Pezza did together in Rimini. The injury should take one month to heal, Mimmo Pezza helped me be fit in less than half that. I thank this man for a beautiful moment which will be in my heart for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can remember." [...] Their victory meant Aston Villa gained {{a place in the}} 1998–99 UEFA Cup.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, Princess, I won't do your Preface. Nothing would induce {{me to say}} a word {{in print}} about you. I'm in fact not sure I shall ever mention you in any manner at all <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> live." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{the second}} verse {{of the song}} begins, {{childhood}} pictures of Jared and Shannon with their mother Constance are shown. Takes of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and other confessions follow, including clips from Corey Feldman's early work as a child actor. Feldman discusses how he started working at age three and how his family relied on him to pay the bills. Ashley Olsen opines on the fleeting nature of fame, while Juliette Lewis and James Franco talk about managing dreams and expectations. As the song ends, Christopher Lloyd Dennis sums up, [...] "Do I think I'm gonna {{make it in the}} industry? <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> keep believing, it will happen." [...] The short film ends with the various personalities introducing themselves.|$|E
500|$|In July 2007, it was {{announced}} that Jackson had signed a recording contract with Island Records, after her five-album deal with Virgin Records America was fulfilled with the release of her album 20 Y.O. Jackson's tenth studio album, Discipline, which was an acknowledgment of Jackson's commitment, focus and dedication to her career, was released on February 26, 2008 under the supervision of label head L. A. Reid. Jackson commented, [...] "I wanted to name the album Discipline because {{it has a lot of}} different meanings for me but the most important would be work—to have done this for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have... And to have had the success that I've had—not excluding God by any means—but it takes a great deal of focus." ...|$|E
500|$|Late in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote {{a letter}} to Johannes Stricker, one which he {{described}} to Theo as an attack. Within days he left for Amsterdam. Kee would not meet him, and her parents wrote that his [...] "persistence is disgusting". In despair, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: [...] "Let me see her for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can keep my hand in the flame." [...] He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.|$|E

500|$|Dormand later {{described}} himself as [...] "a republican for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can remember having an interest in politics" [...] and was a long-serving secretary of the all-party Parliamentary republican group. He spoke out {{in opposition to the}} monarchy, declaring in 1971 that [...] "the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow". He extended his criticism to the hereditary peerage in February 1973. In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP Willie Hamilton took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it. The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for [...] "scores of miners" [...] to be honoured as they were just as worthy.|$|E

500|$|In 1943 Judge Green {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Corps, the {{predecessor}} to the United States Air Force. At the time, the armed forces were still segregated. Green was initially [...] "optimistic that the military {{was going to be}} a good life," [...] until his unit was shipped from Fort Lee, Virginia to Keesler Field (now Keesler Air Force Base), in Mississippi. When the unit arrived at Keesler they were driven past the barracks to what Green would later describe as [...] "a tent city." [...] It was then that Green [...] "realized for real that I was really in a segregated army, and there was always, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was in the service, two standards, one quite unacceptable and the other as acceptable as could be considering the fact that the country was at war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have no fear}} of the march, Colonel. The Sikhs have {{volunteered to}} carry a {{stretcher}} for me. I shall, of course, not get into it, unless I feel that I cannot go another foot farther; but {{the mere fact that}} it is there, and in readiness for me, will help me to keep on. The Sikhs have done just <b>as</b> <b>long</b> a march <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have, and I hope that I shall be able to hold on <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> they can. <b>I</b> should hate to be beaten by a native." ...|$|R

500|$|Barkley {{is known}} for his {{compulsive}} gambling. In an interview with ESPN's Trey Wingo, Barkley revealed that he lost approximately $10 million through gambling. In addition, he also admitted to losing $2.5 million [...] "in a six-hour period" [...] while playing blackjack. Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit. When approached by fellow TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson about the issue, Barkley replied, [...] "It's not a problem. If you're a drug addict or an alcoholic, those are problems. I gamble for too much money. <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can continue to do it I don't think it's a problem. Do I think it's a bad habit? Yes, I think it's a bad habit.

500|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese ultranationalists, and threatening notes on {{her car and}} also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book [...] "made Iris sad". Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined. Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California.
