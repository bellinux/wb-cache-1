40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the optimization of maintenance workforce scheduling at Afam power station in Nigeria. The {{objective is to}} determine the optimum schedule to satisfy growing maintenance labour requirements with minimum cost and highest efficiency. Three alternative maintenance workforce schedules are compared. The first <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> to continue with the traditional five-day workweek schedule currently being practiced by Afam power station maintenance line. The second <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> to switch to a seven-day workweek schedule for the morning shift only. The third <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> to use a seven-day workweek schedule for all three work shifts. The third <b>alternative</b> <b>is</b> chosen, as it is expected to save 11 % of the maintenance labour cost. Keywords: Power Station, Maintenance, Optimization, Labour Scheduling. 1...|$|R
