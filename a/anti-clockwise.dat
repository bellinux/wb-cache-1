5|$|The {{exterior}} of the Royal Albert Hall (built in 1867–1871 to the designs of Francis Fowke and Henry Young Darracott Scott) is embellished with a mosaic frieze composed of sixteen separate designs by multiple artists. This was assembled from 800 slabs prepared by attendees of the South Kensington Museum's mosaic class; the terracotta was manufactured by Minton, Hollins and Company. The designs are listed below in <b>anti-clockwise</b> order from the north.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Circle line {{services}} began serving the station. Originally operating as a loop-line using tracks {{constructed by the}} MR and the DR and serving only the station in Praed Street, the Circle line's route was altered to include the Hammersmith branch to increase train frequency on the branch and improve the regularity of Circle line trains. Trains run in a spiral <b>anti-clockwise</b> from Edgware Road around the loop, back to Edgware Road {{and then on to}} the Hammersmith branch.|$|E
5|$|The River Weaver is a river, navigable in {{its lower}} reaches, {{running in a}} curving route <b>anti-clockwise</b> across west Cheshire, {{northern}} England. Improvements to the river to make it navigable were authorised in 1720 and the work, which included eleven locks, was completed in 1732. An unusual clause in the enabling Act of Parliament stipulated that profits {{should be given to}} the County of Cheshire for the improvement of roads and bridges, but the navigation was not initially profitable, and it was 1775 before the first payments were made. Trade continued to rise, and by 1845, over £500,000 had been given to the county.|$|E
5|$|The CLR's {{ability to}} manage its high {{passenger}} numbers was constrained by the service interval that it could achieve between trains. This was {{directly related to the}} time taken to turn around trains at the termini. At the end of a journey, a locomotive had to be disconnected from the leading end of the train and run around to the rear, where it was reconnected before proceeding in the opposite direction; an exercise that took a minimum of 2½minutes. Seeking to shorten this interval, the CLR published a bill in November 1900 for the 1901 parliamentary session. The bill requested permission to construct loops {{at each end of the}} line so that trains could be turned around without disconnecting the locomotive. The loop at the western end was planned to run <b>anti-clockwise</b> under the three sides of Shepherd's Bush Green. For the eastern loop the alternatives were a loop under Liverpool Street station or a larger loop running under Threadneedle Street, Old Broad Street, Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate and returning to Threadneedle Street. The estimated cost of the loops was £800,000 (approximately £ today), most of which was for the eastern loop with its costly wayleaves.|$|E
5|$|The inner ward {{was created}} during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug {{to the west}} of the {{innermost}} ward, effectively doubling the castle's size. HenryIII created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day. Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt. Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward. The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a gatehouse, most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by EdwardI. The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans. The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13towers that stud the curtain wall. <b>Anti-clockwise</b> from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower. While these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making longbows, crossbows, catapults, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night.|$|E

25|$|The main {{pattern to}} {{the flow of}} water in the North Sea is an <b>anti-clockwise</b> {{rotation}} along the edges.|$|E
25|$|Just as in {{the other}} convention, right-handedness {{corresponds}} to a clockwise rotation and left-handedness corresponds to an <b>anti-clockwise</b> rotation.|$|E

25|$|The {{first nine}} Trunk Roads (T1, T2, T3, T4, T4a, T5, T6, T7, T8) {{radiated}} out from Dublin (with the T8 branching off the T7 at Enniscorthy) and followed an <b>anti-clockwise</b> pattern. This pattern {{was similar to}} the existing <b>anti-clockwise</b> pattern which the National routes and motorways radiating out of Dublin now follow. The pattern was interrupted by the T35 (Dublin-Cavan-Donegal route) which came between the T2 and the T3 and the T42 (now N81), T43 and T44 which came between the T5 (T6) and the T7 routes.|$|E
25|$|Circular {{polarization}} may {{be referred}} to as right-handed or left-handed, and clockwise or <b>anti-clockwise,</b> depending on the direction in which the electric field vector rotates. Unfortunately, two opposing historical conventions exist.|$|E
25|$|The London-bound M40 {{enters with}} four lanes, with a lane drop for the M25 exit, leaves with three lanes, and the {{westbound}} M40 enters with lanes and gains a lane from the <b>anti-clockwise</b> M25.|$|E
25|$|When {{determining}} if {{the wave}} is clockwise or <b>anti-clockwise</b> circularly polarized, one again takes {{the point of}} view of the receiver and, while looking toward the source, against the direction of propagation, one observes the direction of the field’s temporal rotation.|$|E
25|$|Continuing <b>anti-clockwise,</b> now {{heading south}} are the {{majority}} of the islands within the Harbour as well as several small channels and inlets. To the west is Arne Bay and the Wych channel. The majority of land in this area is heathland, and there are few settlements, as opposed to {{the eastern part of the}} Harbour. Directly south is Long Island, Round Island and Ower Bay. Green Island, Furzey Island and Brownsea Island (in that order) are to the east, with Newton Bay and Brands Bay (this area has several oil wells) to the south. This area of water is known as the South Deep. Continuing <b>anti-clockwise</b> comes back to the entrance to the Harbour and to Poole Bay, with Studland beach immediately south-east.|$|E
25|$|When {{expressed}} in this way, the real number ρ becomes an expansion factor. It indicates how repulsive the fixed point γ1 is, and how attractive γ2 is. The real number α is a rotation factor, indicating {{to what extent the}} transform rotates the plane <b>anti-clockwise</b> about γ1 and clockwise about γ2.|$|E
25|$|Each player now sets aside any Flowers or Seasons {{they may}} have drawn and takes turns to draw {{replacement}} piece(s) from {{the wall in the}} <b>anti-clockwise</b> direction. If a player gets any Flowers or Seasons tiles in the replacement draw, the players must wait for the next turn to draw replacement tiles.|$|E
25|$|This was an {{extremely}} busy service for passengers transferring from suburban trains at Central, particularly prior {{to the opening of}} the city underground railway lines in 1926. Trams operated from Central station down Castlereagh Street to Circular Quay and back up Pitt Street in a large <b>anti-clockwise</b> loop. These tracks were also used as the city route for some eastern and south-western routes during busy periods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-clockwise</b> {{direction}} from the M25, the main carriageway continues directly on to the M26 at junction 5. To remain on the M25, traffic must turn on to the slip road which connects to the M25 spur coming north from Sevenoaks, which is multiplexed with the A21. The awkwardness of junction 5 {{is a result of}} the history of the two motorways' planning and construction.|$|E
25|$|From 9 November 2008, all trains (with the {{exception}} of those departing the city after midnight, all services after midnight run direct from Flinders Street) operate via the City Loop (in a clockwise direction from Jolimont station on weekdays and <b>anti-clockwise</b> on weekends and public holidays). On most occasions, Hurstbridge line trains operate express between Jolimont and Clifton Hill, with the South Morang trains serving the intermediate stations.|$|E
25|$|The dealer throws three dice in {{the square}} wall and sums up the total. Counting <b>anti-clockwise</b> so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have double throws to {{increase}} randomness. In the case of double throws, the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} route {{started from}} Cathedral Square and ran along Colombo Street, Armagh Street, Park Terrace, through the Carlton Mill area, and up Rossall Street to {{the intersection of}} Glandovey Road and Strowan Road. From here, buses alternated between travelling in a clockwise or <b>anti-clockwise</b> direction around the circuit formed by Glandovey Road, Idris Road, Wairakei Road (previously Wairarapa Road), and Strowan Road. Inbound services entered Cathedral Square from Worcester Street rather than Colombo Street. Timetabled services ran Monday to Saturday, no Sunday service.|$|E
25|$|Cistern 5 (located {{under the}} south eastern {{corner of the}} upper platform) — a long and narrow chamber, with a strange <b>anti-clockwise</b> curved section at its north western corner, and {{containing}} within it a doorway currently blocked by earth. The cistern's position and design is such {{that there has been}} speculation it had a function connected with the altar of the Second Temple (and possibly of the earlier Temple), or with the bronze sea. Charles Warren thought that the altar of burnt offerings was located at the north western end.|$|E
25|$|On 6 March, the PAVN {{began moving}} westward toward Thailand along Lao Route 23. The Thai fire base, fearing Communist {{infiltration}} behind the Royalist front lines, retired to {{the junction of}} Routes 13 and 23 on the Mekong River bank. On 8 March, two PAVN battalions reinforced by T-34 tanks pushed the Thai battalions out of Laongam and back upon the fire base. At about the same time, the PAVN 39th Regiment sent two battalions forth from Salavan in a southwestern <b>anti-clockwise</b> move {{around the base of}} the Plateau.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the same}} total on the dice (or {{the total of}} the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend {{to the left side}} player's stack.) This determines the {{location}} where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for himself, and players in <b>anti-clockwise</b> order draw blocks of four tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that the stacks decrease clockwise. Each player then draws one last tile to make a 13-tile hand.|$|E
25|$|The Viennese Waltz is a rotary dance {{where the}} dancers are {{constantly}} turning {{either in a}} clockwise (natural) or <b>anti-clockwise</b> (reverse) direction interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation. A true Viennese waltz consists only of turns and change steps. Other moves such as the fleckerls, American-style figures and side sway or underarm turns are modern inventions and are not normally danced at the annual balls in Vienna. Furthermore, in a properly danced Viennese Waltz, couples do not pass, but turn continuously left and right while travelling counterclockwise around the floor following each other.|$|E
25|$|As a {{specific}} example, {{refer to the}} circularly polarized wave in the first animation. Using this convention that wave is defined as right-handed because when one points one's right thumb {{in the same direction}} of the wave’s propagation, the fingers of that hand curl in the same direction of the field’s temporal rotation. It is considered clockwise circularly polarized because {{from the point of view}} of the source, looking in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, the field rotates in the clockwise direction. The second animation is that of left-handed or <b>anti-clockwise</b> light using this same convention.|$|E
25|$|Like before, each {{station was}} {{assigned}} a unique alphanumeric symbol. However under this revamped system map, the letter in each symbol denotes the line instead and the number increases in ascending order from East to West (East West Line), North to South (North South Line), South West to North East (North East Line), in an <b>anti-clockwise</b> direction (Circle Line), in a clockwise direction from the North-west to the South-east (Downtown Line), and from the Thomson stretch in the North to the East Coast stretch in the East (Thomson-East Coast). Interchange stations will then {{have at least two}} or three codes.|$|E
25|$|The two Bickerton Hills lie {{south-west}} of the Peckforton Hills. They {{form the}} southern end and high point of the Mid Cheshire Ridge, which runs broadly north–south through Cheshire from Beacon Hill near Frodsham. The {{southern part of the}} ridge, including both Bickerton Hills, has been designated an Area of Special County Value. The ridge line continues north–south over the northerly Bickerton Hill, turning approximately 30° to the west over the southerly hill. The two hills are separated by a valley through which the A534 runs. The nearest settlements are (<b>anti-clockwise</b> from the south) Duckington, Brown Knowl, Fuller's Moor, Harthill, Bulkeley, Gallantry Bank and Bickerton.|$|E
25|$|The British Rallycross Circuit at Brands Hatch was {{designed}} and constructed by four-times British Rallycross Champion Trevor Hopkins. It is approx. 0.9 miles long and completed around 1981. Unlike earlier rallycross courses at Brands Hatch, cars start on the startline then veer right and downhill on the loose at Paddock Hill Bend. Through the left-right Esses at the bottom, the circuit rejoins the Indy Circuit to travel up and round Druids hairpin, before a 90-degree left through Langley's Gap and across the knife-edge, rejoining the Indy Circuit, but travelling <b>anti-clockwise.</b> From Cooper Straight, the cars swoop up the old link road and back to Paddock.|$|E
25|$|Using this convention, {{polarization}} {{is defined}} {{from the point}} of view of the source. When using this convention, left or right handedness is determined by pointing one's left or right thumb away from the source, in the same direction that the wave is propagating, and matching the curling of one's fingers to the direction of the temporal rotation of the field at a given point in space. When determining if the wave is clockwise or <b>anti-clockwise</b> circularly polarized, one again takes the point of view of the source, and while looking away from the source and in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, one observes the direction of the field’s temporal rotation.|$|E
25|$|After {{weeks of}} fighting, on 9 January 1973 the two Royalist regiments began {{to retreat to}} the west. On 12 January, Groupement Mobile 33 (GM 33)inserted from {{neighboring}} Military Region 3route marched from Paksong to Tha Theng to relieve Groupement Mobile 43 (GM 43), arriving on the 13th. GM 43 then circled north in an <b>anti-clockwise</b> direction to assault Salavan from the east. GMs 41 and 42 moved in from the west. The Royalists reclaimed part of the town as the fighting continued through early February. However, the PAVN reinforced with tanks. The Royalists retreated back down Route 16 to Khong Sedone on the Mekong River. There the ceasefire found them on 22 February 1973.|$|E
25|$|Motorcycle speedway, usually {{referred}} to as speedway, is a motorcycle sport involving four and sometimes up to six riders competing over four <b>anti-clockwise</b> laps of an oval circuit. Speedway motorcycles use only one gear and have no brakes and racing takes place on a flat oval track usually consisting of dirt or loosely packed shale. The United Kingdom has three domestic leagues, the Elite League. the Premier League, and the National League. The Speedway Grand Prix is the main world championship for standalone riders with an event taking place in Cardiff each year. The Speedway World Cup takes place once a year and England hosts a semi final stage in Peterborough and more recently in King's Lynn.|$|E
25|$|A leg {{break is}} bowled by holding the cricket {{ball in the}} palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the wrist is rotated to the left and the ball flicked by the ring finger, giving the ball an <b>anti-clockwise</b> spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the left from the bowler's perspective; this is to the right from the batsman's point of view, or towards the off side of a {{right-handed}} batsman. The ball spins away from the leg side, and this is where it gets the name leg break, meaning it breaks away from the leg. The turn is mostly when the ball pitches.|$|E
25|$|The rows of shining lathe turned pillars {{that support}} {{the ceiling of the}} mantapa is a Hoysala-Chalukya {{decorative}} idiom. The mantapa has many deeply domed inner ceiling structures adorned with floral designs. The outer parapet wall of the open mantapa has a total of hundred and forty panel sculptures with depictions from the Hindu epics. Unlike many Hoysala temples where the panels are small and carvings in miniature, these panels are comparatively larger. The Ramayana is sculpted on the south side wall on seventy panels, with the story proceeding quite unusually, in <b>anti-clockwise</b> direction. On the north side wall, all depictions are clockwise, a norm in Hoysala architectural articulation. Twenty five panels depict the life of the Hindu god Krishna and the remaining forty five panels depict scenes from the epic Mahabharata.|$|E
25|$|Bengali and Odia {{style is}} worn without any pleats. Traditionally the Bengali style is worn without pleats where the saree is wrapped around in an <b>anti-clockwise</b> {{direction}} {{around the waist}} and then a second time from the other direction. The loose end is a lot longer and that goes around the body over the left shoulder. There is enough cloth left to cover the head as well. The modern style of wearing a saree originates from the Tagore family. Jnanadanandini Devi, the wife of Rabindranath Tagore's elder brother Satyendranath {{came up with a}} different way to wear the saree after her stay in Bombay. This required a chemise or jacket (old name for blouse) and petticoat to be worn under the saree and made it possible for women {{to come out of the}} secluded women's quarters in this attire.|$|E
25|$|The European {{influence}} on Cuba's later musical development {{is represented by}} danzón, an elegant musical form that was once more popular than the Son in Cuba. It is a descendent of the creollized Cuban contradanza. The danzón marks the change from the communal sequence dance style of the late 18th century to the couple dances of later times. The stimulus for this was {{the success of the}} once-scandalous walz, where couples danced facing each other, independently from other couples and not as part of a pre-set structure. The danzón was the first Cuban dance to adopt such methods, though {{there is a difference between}} the two dances. The walz is a progressive ballroom dance where couples move round the floor in an <b>anti-clockwise</b> direction; the danzón is a 'pocket-handkerchief' dance where a couple stays within a small area of the floor.|$|E
