50|$|Gernsback made {{significant}} contributions to the growth of early broadcasting, mostly through his efforts as a publisher. He originated the industry of specialized publications for radio with Modern Electrics and Electrical Experimenter. Later on, and more influentially, he published Radio News, which would have the largest readership among radio magazines in radio broadcasting’s formative years. He edited Radio News until 1929. For a short time he hired John F. Rider to be editor. Rider was a former engineer working with the US Army Signal Corps and a <b>radio</b> engineer for <b>A.</b> <b>H.</b> Grebe, <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> manufacturer. However Rider would soon leave Gernsback and form his own publishing company, John F. Rider Publisher, New York around 1931.|$|R

5000|$|The new {{entertainment}} features {{added to}} the 2009 model year included the optional Ford SYNC, and an all-new DVD-based voice-activated, multi-entertainment/navigational system with liquid crystal touch display. The rearview camera system is now integrated to show the video feed through the navigation screen instead for the rearview mirror, however, the rearview mirror is still used to show images on Expeditions not equipped with the navigation system. The new navigation system features up to 10 gigabytes of storage space for more than 2400 songs, a jukebox function, a screened photo display, iPod/Zune capability for downloading and recharging, ripping CDs, and integrated compatibility for cellphones and Bluetooth; the newly compatible Sirius Travel Link, which allow drivers to access traffic, weather, sports, and local movie listings; and a [...] "Route Guidance" [...] mode for road and street information. The steering wheel also has a tilt feature and radio controls, including Ford SYNC buttons, allowing the driver to press the button and use voice commands to activate the system, which became standard on Eddie Bauer, Limited, and King Ranch.

Single-spike potentials evoked by either depolarizing current pulses applied through the recording micro-electrode or stimulation of the hypogastric nerves were followed by <b>an</b> after-hyperpolarization (<b>a.</b> <b>h.).</b> The spike <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> in 40 % of the neurones, referred to herein as type I, had a relatively short duration (less than 50 ms) and exhibited a monophasic decay with a mean time constant (tau) of 11. 4 ms. In the remaining cells (type II), the spike was followed by <b>a</b> long <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> (greater than 100 ms) having a double-exponential decay; the fast and slow components of the <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> are termed <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> f and <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> s, respectively, and they had mean tau values of 11. 4 and 74 ms, respectively. <b>A.</b> <b>h.</b> f and <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> s of type II neurones were reduced by membrane hyperpolarization and reversed their polarities between - 80 and - 90 mV. The reversal potentials shifted in a manner closely predicted by the Nernst equation as external K+ concentration was increased. Superfusion of low-Ca 2 + high-Mg 2 + solution to type II neurones reduced the <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> f and <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> s by 32 and 82 %, respectively, indicating that <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> s is largely Ca 2 +-dependent. Application of (+) -tubocurarine (10 - 100 microM) reversibly suppressed the <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> s without affecting <b>a.</b> <b>h.</b> f in <b>a</b> concentration-dependent manner. Following a short train of action potentials evoked from type II neurones, the post-tetanic hyperpolarization (p. t. h.) was similarly depressed by (+) -tubocurarine in a dose-dependent manner. (+) -tubocurarine did not significantly change the amplitude of Ca 2 +-dependent spike potentials evoked in neurones bathed in Na+-free high-Ca 2 + plus tetraethylammonium (5 - 10 mM) solution.
