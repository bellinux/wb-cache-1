The user could only select what type of content to display on the home screen and whether to organize by <b>author,</b> <b>title,</b> or download date. Kindle software version 2.5 allowed for the organization of books into [...] "Collections" [...] which behave like non-structured tags/labels: a collection can not include other collections, and one book may be added to multiple collections. These collections are normally set and organized on the Kindle itself, one book at a time. The set of all collections of a first Kindle device can be imported to a second Kindle device that {{is connected to the}} cloud and is registered to the same user; as the result of this operation, the documents that are on the second device now become organized according to the first device's collections. There is no option to organize by series or series order, as the AZW format does not possess the necessary metadata fields.|$|E
