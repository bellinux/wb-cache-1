5|$|Mir {{was based}} upon the Salyut series of space {{stations}} previously launched by the Soviet Union (seven Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971), and was mainly serviced by Russian-manned Soyuz spacecraft and Progress cargo ships. The Buran space shuttle was anticipated to visit Mir, but its program was canceled after its first unmanned spaceflight. Visiting US Space Shuttles used an Androgynous Peripheral Attach System docking collar originally designed for Buran, mounted on <b>a</b> <b>bracket</b> originally designed for use with the American Space Station Freedom.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern gable wall of the presbytery that still stands to its full height. Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design is so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a great circle of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; <b>a</b> <b>bracket</b> projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E

25|$|But little {{reference}} {{can be made}} to {{the domestic}} side of the period which ended with the dawn of the 16th century, because so few remains exist.

25|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} is when {{two or more}} holes are too close for independent standard bushings.

Another possibility is to make a custom bushing with an eccentric hole and then notches {{on the outside of the}} head are used to locate the proper position of the bushing for each location (the middle example in the image). Another common need for a custom bushing is when the hole needed is perpendicular jig plate; in this case <b>a</b> <b>bracket</b> bushing is used. It is a hardened piece of right angle steel that bolts to the jig plate and is located with dowel pins.|$|E
25|$|The College Football Playoff National Championship is a post-season college {{football}} bowl game, {{used to determine}} a national champion of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), which began play in the 2014 {{college football}} season. The game serves as {{the final of the}} College Football Playoff, <b>a</b> <b>bracket</b> tournament between the top four teams in the country as determined by a selection committee, which was established as a successor to the Bowl Championship Series and its similar BCS National Championship Game. Unlike the BCS championship, the participating teams in the College Football Playoff National Championship are determined by two semi-final bowls—hosted by two of the consortium's six member bowls yearly—and the top two teams as determined by the selection committee do not automatically advance to the game in lieu of other bowls.|$|E

25|$|The Clarence Moore House is {{a classic}} example of the Beaux Arts {{architectural}} style and features a Louis XV-style exterior. The -story structure includes a basement and comprises brick walls, a concrete floor, and a steel roof. The building measures 79.5 feet (24.2m) in height and the walls are made of Roman brick. A limestone Tuscan entablature with <b>a</b> <b>bracket</b> cornice separate the third and fourth floors. The building's north entrance on Massachusetts Avenue has a 6x6foot (1.8x1.8m) stoop flanked by limestone balustrades. Above the entrance and ground floor windows are limestone corbels and guttae. The corbels support limestone second floor balconies and a vase balustrade. The third floor balconies are made of limestone and feature cast iron railings. The second, third, and fourth floor window and architraves are set in a quoined limestone ground. Six limestone chimneys, capped with Tusance entablature, are visible from the ground level. Two chimneys are located at the front and back of the house and a chimney is located on the eastern and western sides. The slate mansard roof has a limestone and metal ridge.|$|E
25|$|Prodrive Racing Australia {{scored a}} one-two finish at the Wilson Security Sandown 500, with Mark Winterbottom and Steve Owen taking victory ahead of {{teammates}} Chaz Mostert and Cameron Waters. The Tekno Autosports pairing of Shane Van Gisbergen and Jonathon Webb finished in third place. Jamie Whincup and Paul Dumbrell started from pole position and led {{for the majority}} of the race, but a puncture, caused by <b>a</b> <b>bracket</b> dislodged by a pit crew member during a pit stop, saw them finish in fifteenth place. Russell Ingall returned to the series to substitute for the injured James Courtney. Ingall partnered Jack Perkins, the pair finishing ninth after starting from twenty-fourth place on the grid. The pairings of Will and Alex Davison and Todd Kelly and Alex Buncombe both finished multiple laps down, the former pair due to a starter motor problem at a pit stop and the latter due to Buncombe running off the track. The only retirement during the race was the car of Nick Percat and Oliver Gavin with steering failure. Winterbottom extended his championship lead over Mostert to 198 points, while David Reynolds, who finished fifth with Dean Canto, moved up to third place in the standings after Craig Lowndes and Steven Richards only managed to finish thirteenth. Winterbottom was fined $3000 for performing a celebratory burnout on the main straight after he finished the race.|$|E
25|$|In the LNB All-Star Game, Vassallo {{played for}} the Foreign-Star team, leading all scorers with 22 points and 7 rebounds. Paris opened {{the second half of}} the season with a win over Chorale Roanne Basket and two losses against Strasbourg IG and Entente Orléanaise. Vassallo {{continued}} scoring in double figures during this period, recording 14, 10 and 18 points. From this point onwards, Paris would play in rematches against the team faced during the early part of the first half. During the following weeks, the team defeated Poitiers and Dijon, but lost against SLUC Nancy and ÉS Chalon-sur-Saône. Vassallo contributed 14, 13, 11 and 19 points and recovered 18 collective rebounds. On February 26, 2010, Le Mans was able to limit him to 5 field goal attempts and 1 rebound, but he was able to record a season-high 6 assists. In victories over ASVEL, Rouen and Hyères-Toulon, Vassallo scored 21, 29 and 15 points and recovered 14 rebounds. In April he entered a brief offensive slump, only being successful in 13 out of 34 field-goal attempts in games against Cholet Basket and STB Le Havre. Vassallo recovered by scoring 21, 29 and 12 points. Paris advanced to the playoffs, being placed in <b>a</b> <b>bracket</b> against Le Mans. The team lost both games, but Vassallo scored 40 points and recovered 7 rebounds. During the off-season, Vassallo announced that he had been invited to the 2010 NBA Summer League and would also participate in a Toronto Raptors try-out, preventing his participation in the 2010 Centrobasket. However, prior to the event's inauguration, he signed a contract with ASVEL.|$|E

40|$|Research {{based on}} treebanks is ongoing for many natural {{language}} applications. However, the work involved {{in building a}} large-scale treebank is laborious and time-consuming. Thus, speeding up {{the process of building}} a treebank has become an important task. This paper proposes two versions of probabilistic chunkers to aid the development of <b>a</b> <b>bracketed</b> corpus. The basic version partitions part-of-speech sequences into chunk sequences, which form <b>a</b> partially <b>bracketed</b> corpus. Applying the chunking action recursively, the recursive version generates <b>a</b> fully <b>bracketed</b> corpus. Rather than using a treebank as a training corpus, a corpus, which is tagged with part-of-speech information only, is used. The experimental results show that the probabilistic chunker has a correct rate of more than 94 % in producing <b>a</b> partially <b>bracketed</b> corpus and also gives very encouraging results in generating <b>a</b> fully <b>bracketed</b> corpus. These two versions of chunkers are simple but effective and can also be applied to many natural language applications...|$|R
