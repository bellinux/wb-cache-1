40|$|The {{extremely}} narrow pulses {{with the}} order of nanoseconds and multipath in Time Hopping Ultra Wide Band system result in long mean <b>acquisition</b> {{time as well as}} low <b>acquisition</b> precision. A novel Variable Step <b>Acquisition</b> scheme, which aims to improve both mean <b>acquisition</b> time and <b>acquisition</b> precision, is proposed. The proposed <b>acquisition</b> scheme employs nonconsecutive search and adjusts searching steps according to several thresholds, which makes the <b>acquisition</b> process a fast <b>acquisition</b> with variable steps, i. e., from large steps to small ones. The mean <b>acquisition</b> time performances of the proposed scheme and conventional <b>acquisition</b> schemes are evaluated and compared.
