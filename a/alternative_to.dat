40|$|The <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> {{the public}} {{criminal}} prosecution {{have changed the}} criminal laws. Contrary to the traditional way of settling the disputes which puts emphasis on analyzing the committed crimes, the most significant factor in <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> the public prosecution is the conditions, in which the crime happens. The present research seeks to evaluate the problems and challenges {{in the way of}} developing and increasing the <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> the criminal prosecution by taking the England’s laws into consideration. The <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> the criminal prosecution are an intermediate approach that are substituted for criminal prosecution and filing the criminal record away unconditionally. In this way, the aim of the punishments is achieved without imposing the punishment. The <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> the criminal prosecutions are based on the ideological, criminological and practical principles. There are many similar cases of imposing <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> the criminal prosecutions on the defendants in Islamic teachings. But the <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> the criminal prosecutions have not properly developed in Iran. Their development faces with many theoretical and practical challenges. According the investigations, we can define the theoretical challenges faced with <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> the criminal prosecutions as the series of the factors and reasons that impede the development of this idea and runs it into the problem. In other words, lack of intention and will <b>to</b> apply these <b>alternatives...</b>|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> {{allogeneic}} blood {{continues to}} rest on the principles that blood transfusions have inherent risks, associated costs, and affect the blood inventory available for health-care delivery. Increasing evidence exists of a fall in the use of blood because of associated costs and adverse outcomes, and suggests that the challenge for the use of <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> blood components will similarly be driven by costs and patient outcomes. Additionally, the risk-benefit profiles of <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> blood transfusion such as autologous blood procurement, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and haemostatic agents are under investigation. Nevertheless, the inherent risks of blood, along with the continued rise in blood costs are likely to favour the continued development and use of <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> blood transfusion.
