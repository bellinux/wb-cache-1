40|$|Traditional fiscal {{indicators}} {{focused on}} measures of current deficits and debt miss the potentially important implications of current policies for future public finances. This could be problematic, including {{in the case of}} Europe, where population aging is expected to pose additional fiscal costs not captured by such indicators. To better gauge the state of public finances in the EU 27 countries, this paper derives forward-looking fiscal measures of intertemporal net worth both directly from the European Commission’s Aging Working Group’s long-run indicators and using a comprehensive public-sector balance sheet approach. These measures could be used as an "early warning" mechanism and also as a communication device with the public. Current estimates indicate that, on existing policies, the intertemporal net worth of the EU 27 is deeply negative, even in excess of its GDP level, and is projected to worsen further over time. This suggests that Europe’s current policies need to be significantly strengthened to bring future liabilities in line with the EU governments’ capacity to generate assets.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} {{redistribution}} and welfare effects {{of increasing the}} flexibility of individual pension take-up. We use an overlapping-generations model with Beveridgean pay-as-you-go pensions, where individuals differ in ability and life span. We find that introducing flexible pension take-up can induce a Pareto improvement when the initial pension scheme contains within-cohort redistribution and induces early retirement. Such a Pareto-improving reform entails the application of uniform actuarial <b>adjustment</b> of <b>pension</b> entitlements based on average life expectancy. Introducing actuarial non-neutrality that stimulates later retirement further improves such a flexibility reform. ...|$|R

This raises {{the issue to}} what extent unobserved tastes for retirement - which may correlate with job selection and through that route with financial incentives - play a role and can be controlled for. Using a stated rather than a revealed preferences approach, we contribute to this debate. Fielding a survey questionnaire in the Dutch DNB Household Survey we derive empirical estimates of <b>pension</b> <b>adjustment</b> and <b>pension</b> wealth effects. Our main finding is that retrenchments of pension arrangements {{to the effect of}} raising the standard retirement age by 1 year induce people on average to postpone retirement by about half a year. Retirement postponement varies across people, depending prominently on earnings and non-pension wealth; affluent {{people are more likely to}} capitalize on increased pension wealth through earlier retirement, whereas they more readily accept a lower pension benefit in case of a decrease in pension wealth.

30|$|Summarizing, {{the earlier}} {{literature}} suggests that raising the exit age is only welfare enhancing if the de iure retirement age is too low and the pension system provides disincentives to prolonging labor market activity beyond the official legal limit. If increased retirement age yields an actuarially neutral <b>adjustment</b> in <b>pension</b> benefits, welfare gains are more equally spread across cohorts. There is also evidence that increasing the retirement age {{may be more effective}} in easing the fiscal tension. Some studies argue that such policy generates greater welfare gain than reducing the pension benefits or increasing the contribution rates. These insights, however, mainly concern analyses within one pension system, most frequently the pay-as-you-go DB systems.

40|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen a wave of reforms to {{retirement}} income systems around the world. This paper describes the reform packages {{that have taken place}} in 38 industrialised economies, some of them involving incremental changes to existing provision, others, an overhaul of the entire retirement income system. The changes had many objectives. First, improved coverage of the pension system, especially of voluntary private pensions, was a common goal. Second, some reforms aimed to improve the adequacy of retirement benefits to combat old age poverty. Third, the pressure of population ageing and the maturing of pension schemes meant that fiscal sustainability of public pensions – primarily through reductions in future benefits – were very common. Often, the improvement to long-term finances will be achieved through encouraging people to work longer, through increases in pension eligibility ages and <b>adjustments</b> to <b>pension</b> incentives to retire. Finally, some reforms aimed at streamlining the administration of retirement income provisions and to improve the security of benefits in the face of different risks and uncertainties. ...|$|R

Evidence from longitudinal data on pension and annuity incomes of retirees suggests that pension COLAs are less important in the 1980 s than in the 1970 s, but that through 1987 they continued to cover about half of {{cost of living}} increases. Data from a longitudinal sample of pension benefit formulae and COLA provisions collected by the Wyatt Company for the fifty largest industrial companies indicate that if the 1968 - 78 decade persisted, cost of living adjustments would increase basic pension benefits for retirees by a half; while if the inflation experience were that of the 1978 - 88 period, pension COLAs would raise the present value of pensions by only fourteen percent. Simulation analysis allows an examination of the effects of pension COLA provisions on the key incentives emphasized in the pension literature, incentives affecting the retirement, turnover and shirking decisions. Pension COLAs are found to have very small effects on these incentives. Finally a simulation analysis demonstrates that when the contribution side of COLAs is taken into account, pension COLAs do not necessarily dampen the variation among generations in real incomes realized under alternative inflation shocks. ...|$|R

But even if this (very limited) understanding of the scope of (in)equality is accepted, ambiguities remain as to who is to be equalized to whom. To illustrate, consider an example from pension policy. Here, the question is: Which universe do we want to equalize across? The answer can be, first, that all pensioners should receive the same (i.e., a flat rate) pension; second, that, in a longitudinal perspective, levels of individual transfers should mirror the relative income position that the pensioner has occupied previously during his or her active years, thus equalizing, in line with the “Bismarckian” ideal, relative status over biographical time slices; third, it can mean that the cohorts of present pensioners should be allowed to partake in the economic gains made by the presently active cohorts, as in any “dynamic”, or indexed, pension system with regular <b>adjustments</b> of <b>pensions</b> to increases of current real wages, a method that equalizes income gains from growth across the entire adult population.

This article aims {{to shed light on}} the technical details in order to help our readers to determine for themselves what the "right" adjustments are. This depends, as so often, on the view of the beholder. Judged from the view of a public retirement insurance, which applies a very low discount rate, the German adjustments are indeed about actuarially correct. All other points of view, however, require substantially higher adjustments than currently legislated. To be incentive neutral, the actuarial adjustments should be at least 50 % higher since workers are likely to use discount rates which are at least as high as the capital market interest rate and probably much higher. Higher adjustments are also implied by economic growth and majority voting considerations. ...|$|R

Critics of the present German system argue that the downward <b>adjustment</b> of the <b>pension</b> for early retirees is too small compared with a 'fair' system and thus encourages early retirement. We discuss several notions of 'fairness' of early-retirement provisions and propose a concept called 'distributive neutrality', which states that the ratio between total benefits and total contributions should not depend systematically on the individual's ability. By applying this concept to the German retirement benefit formula and taking empirically estimated relationships between annual income (as a proxy for ability), life expectancy and retirement age into account, we show that at the present discount rate of 3. 6 % per year there is redistribution from low to high earners, which, surprisingly, could be attenuated by raising the discount rate.
