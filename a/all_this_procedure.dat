Have they made out any clear state of the grand incumbrance of all, I mean {{the whole of the}} general and municipal establishments of all sorts, and compared it with the regular income by revenue? Every deficiency in these becomes a charge on the confiscated estate, before the creditor can plant his cabbages on an acre of Church property. There is no other prop than this confiscation to keep the whole state from tumbling to the ground. In this situation they have purposely covered all, that they ought industriously to have cleared, with a thick fog; and then, blindfold themselves, like bulls that shut their eyes when they push, they drive, by the point of the bayonets, their slaves, blindfolded indeed no worse than their lords, to take their fictions for currencies, and to swallow down paper pills by thirty-four millions sterling at a dose. Then they proudly lay in their claim to a future credit, on failure of all their past engagements, {{and at a time when}} (if in such a matter anything can be clear) it is clear that the surplus estates will never answer even the first of their mortgages,--I mean that of the four hundred millions (or sixteen millions sterling) of assignats. In <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure</b> I can discern neither the solid sense of plain dealing nor the subtle dexterity of ingenious fraud. The objections within the Assembly to pulling up the flood-gates for this inundation of fraud are unanswered; but they are thoroughly refuted by an hundred thousand financiers in the street.

They cannot raise supplies; but they can raise mobs. Let them rejoice in the applauses of the club at Dundee for their wisdom and patriotism in having thus applied the plunder of the citizens to the service of the state. I hear of no address upon this subject from the directors of the Bank of England,--though their approbation would be of a little more weight in the scale of credit than that of the club at Dundee. But to do justice to the club, I believe the gentlemen who compose it to be wiser than they appear,--that they will be less liberal of their money than of their addresses, and that they would not give a dog's ear of their most rumpled and ragged Scotch paper for twenty of your fairest assignats.|$|E

The tool is specially designed for analyzing metadynamics based simulations. The huge amount of diverse structures generated during such a simulation is partitioned into a set of microstates (i. e. structures with similar values of the collective variables). Their relative free energies are then computed by a weighted-histogram procedure and the most relevant free energy wells are identified by diagonalization of the rate matrix followed by a commitor analysis. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure</b> leads to a convenient representation of the metastable states and long-time kinetics of the system which can be compared with experimental data.

Travel Time estimated by SRSM model and MLR models are compared against with actual travel time is presented at Fig.  6. From this figure it can be observed that SRSM probability distribution is uni-modal (having one maximum at 625  sec), asymmetrical and similarly follows the actual travel time distribution. Whereas travel time distribution obtained by MLR models are bimodal frequency curves having two peaks, one maximum at 625  s and the other maximum at 925  s. Even travel time distribution estimated by MLR model by considering all the uncertainty parameters (Table  1) also follows bimodal frequency. From this it can be conclude that the MLR models are overestimating beyond the average actual travel time (783  s). It can also be concluded from the Fig.  5 that even if more uncertainty parameters are considered for modeling travel time MLR models are unable to follow the actual travel time distribution. Further, from travel time distribution it can be observed that travel time obtained by SRSM model is well distributed between travel time, 542  s to 2, 302  s. Whereas MLR models estimated travel time distribution varies between 493 to 1, 363  s. From this it can be concluded that MLR models are unable to map the worst case scenarios, this we can observe from tails of the probability distribution of travel time (Fig.  5).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a 3 D scene analysis system that automatically reconstructs the 3 D geometric model of real-world scenes from multiple range images acquired by a Laser Range Finder on board of a mobile robot. The reconstruction is achieved through an integrated and iterative procedure including range data acquisition, geometrical feature extraction, planning the next capture points, registration {{and integration of}} multiple views. Multiple range images from different viewpoints are acquired to resolve the ambiguities caused by occlusions and to construct a complete 3 D model. Occlusions are detected based on surface discontinuities. The 3 D scene modelling system combines different algorithms to overcome the specific problems raised by this type of images. Namely, a new hybrid algorithm for range image segmentation has been developed combining edge and region detection approaches to build a high-level description of a scene given a noisy range image. A strategy for automatically selecting the next sensing position and orientation based on the previously detected occlusions and using an objective function was developed. The system evaluates the set of capture points from which all the necessary data can be acquired aiming at minimising its number and therefore reducing the time needed for a complete scene reconstruction. Among these points it then selects the ones maximising the occluded areas to be resolved and optimising the acquisition conditions. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure</b> exclusively relies on acquired data. Another relevant issue {{of the work is}} the consistent registration/integration of range images acquired from different viewpoints. A hierarchical registration scheme working at the point level for higher accuracy is presented. The integration scheme combining the different views works, instead, at a feature representation level. The algorithms were fully tested in real world environments with different shape complexity and surface types namely planar and convex or concave curved surfaces. Direct applications of this technique include 3 D reconstruction and/or update of architectural or industrial plans into a CAD model, [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

If the information and communication technology (ICT) has to be successfully implemented and effectively transacted, then the teacher educators themselves should possess the knowledge of proper awareness towards teaching the subject of ICT in the teacher-training programme. In this regard NCERThas come out recently with a school curriculum framework where in it has been emphasized to integrated ICTin school education. It is not possible without the teacher being competed in techno-pedagogic dimensions of ICT. According to the regulations of University Grant Commission (UGC), the appointment of teachers and other staffs which was ordered on 28 th June, 2010 are mentioned in clause No. 4. 4. 7, as “Provided {{that at least one}} lecture should have specialization in information and communication technology and another is in special education”. The quality of teaching depends on the awareness of educational technology. The present study aims to investigate the SocioEconomic Status and Awareness of ICT among Teacher Trainees in Nagaland. The objectives of the study were to compare the mean scores of Awareness and SocioEconomic Status ICTamong Teacher Trainees of Nagaland when they are classified into gender, locality, type of management and Subject discipline. The sample of the study constitutes the selected Teacher Trainees of government and private colleges of Nagaland. A sample of 150 Teacher Trainees was selected using random sampling technique. The Awareness of ICT tool was developed by the investigator using the scientific procedure of tool construction. The tool consists of 65 objective type questions related to awareness of ICT. The respondent has to give the answer by marking either A, B, C, or D. The score varies in between 0 - 65 marks.

We examined the predictive value of Laser Doppler in {{occurrence of the}} syndrome. Material-method : For the time between 10. 01. 2005 and 20. 11. 2006 81 patients (ages 38 - 90 years) with end-stage renal disease undergoing a primary upper extremity AV access for hemodialysis were prospectively evaluated by Laser Doppler measurements. The mean value of the capillary blood flow of their ipsilateral hand first was obtained preoperatively and {{on the day of}} surgery, just after the operation, at 35 and 440 C. Two to three months after the A-V access (the vein has taken its final size) these patients undergo another clinical examination and a new measurement of the blood flow in the tissue in order to compare the new values with the past ones. For these patients that after <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure</b> we finally have the suspicion of the arterial steal syndrome we submit them to undergo a colour Doppler ultrasound in order to confirm the presence of the steal syndrome. Results : From the total of these 81 patients 20 were diabetics, 32 had symptomatic peripheral arterial disease and 4 of them suffered from Buerger disease. The AV accesses created included the following: autogenous brachial-cephalic (13 = 16 %), autogenous radial-cephalic (32 = 39, 5 %), prosthetic brachial-antecubital forearm loop (20 = 24, 7 %), and prosthetic brachial-axillary (16 = 19, 8 %). Thirteen(13) patients (16 %) developed a symptomatic steal syndrome. Two of them required surgical repair.
