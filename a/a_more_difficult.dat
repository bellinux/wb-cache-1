Contestants have their own money countdown, which starts at $1,000 and decreases by $50 per second. The other contestant from each team then faces <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> question, with an opening value of $2,500 and decreasing by $100 per second. The host usually reads the question to the contestants during this round. After this second question, the team that has more money wins and plays the bonus round for $10,000.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{surprised}} by {{the outcome of the}} Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third party candidate.|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E

5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb√ºttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and the answer is a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E
5|$|Although Muhammad had {{delivered}} Quranic verses commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity. In {{the month of}} Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and {{to prepare for a}} pilgrimage (umrah) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj. Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Hananu and Alawite revolts, the French {{authorities}} discovered pacifying northern Syria was <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> task than pacification of the Damascus region. Following the collapse of the Hananu Revolt, some political leaders in Aleppo continued to hope that the Turks would oust the French from northern Syria and unify Aleppo with its Anatolian hinterland, but the withdrawal of Turkish support for the rebels in Syria, following agreements with France, caused a deterioration in Syrian-Turkish ties and left the rebels and nationalists of northern Syria feeling betrayed. Disillusionment with Mustafa Kemal's policies regarding Syria made Turkey's remaining Syrian supporters realign their positions closer to Aleppo's Arab nationalists. In the few years after the revolt, Aleppo's elite largely embraced the concept of a united Syrian struggle for independence from French rule. This shift also began a process of strengthening ties with the leaders of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill had}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> {{time in the}} Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and {{industrialist}} Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} of Texas was changed {{as a result}} of some Spanish policies. As early as the 1690s, Spaniards brought European livestock, including cattle, horses, and mules, with them on their expeditions throughout the province. Some of the livestock strayed or stayed behind when the Spanish retreated from the territory in 1693, allowing the Indian tribes to begin loosely managing herds of the animals. These herds grazed heavily on the native grasses, allowing mesquite, which was native to the lower Texas coast, to spread inland. Although the introduced livestock were able to adapt to the changing conditions, the buffalo had <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> time grazing among the new vegetation, beginning the decline in their numbers. Spanish farmers also introduced tilling and irrigation to the land, further changing the landscape. Spanish architectural concepts were also adopted by those in Texas, including the addition of patios, tile floors and roofs, arched windows and doorways, carved wooden doors, and wrought iron grillwork.|$|E
