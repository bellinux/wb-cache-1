Artificial antibodies are largely diverse protein motifs that use the functional strategy of the <b>antibody</b> <b>molecule,</b> but aren’t limited by the loop and framework structural constraints of the natural antibody.

500|$|The {{antibody}} isotype of a B cell {{changes during}} cell development and activation. Immature B cells, which {{have never been}} exposed to an antigen, express only the IgM isotype in a cell surface bound form. The B lymphocyte, in this ready-to-respond form, {{is known as a}} [...] "naive B lymphocyte." [...] The naive B lymphocyte expresses both surface IgM and IgD. The co-expression of both of these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell ready to respond to antigen. B cell activation follows engagement of the cell-bound <b>antibody</b> <b>molecule</b> with an antigen, causing the cell to divide and differentiate into an antibody-producing cell called a plasma cell. In this activated form, the B cell starts to produce antibody in a secreted form rather than a membrane-bound form. Some daughter cells of the activated B cells undergo isotype switching, a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA, or IgG, that have defined roles in the immune system.|$|E
50|$|The IgG's Fc region also enables {{opsonization}} by a phagocyte, {{a process}} by which the Fc receptor on the phagocyte—such as neutrophils in blood and macrophages in tissues—binds the <b>antibody</b> <b>molecule's</b> FC stalk, and the phagocyte exhibits enhanced uptake of the antigen, attached to the <b>antibody</b> <b>molecule's</b> Fab region.|$|R

Antibody was usually attached haphazardly to the pili; however, in a few cases a regular periodicity could be observed. When few <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules</b> were attached, they could frequently be individually resolved and in certain antibody-pilus combinations large <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules,</b> tentatively identified as IgM, could be seen to predominate...|$|R
2500|$|Most large molecules, {{including}} {{virtually all}} proteins and many polysaccharides, {{can serve as}} antigens. The parts of an antigen that interact with an <b>antibody</b> <b>molecule</b> or a lymphocyte receptor, are called epitopes, or antigenic determinants. Most antigens contain a variety of epitopes and can stimulate the production of antibodies, specific T cell responses, or both. [...] A very small proportion (less than 0.01%) of the total lymphocytes are able to bind to a particular antigen, which suggests {{that only a few}} cells respond to each antigen.|$|E
2500|$|Like the T cell, B cells {{express a}} unique B cell {{receptor}} (BCR), in this case, a membrane-bound <b>antibody</b> <b>molecule.</b> All the BCR {{of any one}} clone of B cells recognizes and binds to only one particular antigen. A critical difference between B cells and T cells is how each cell [...] "sees" [...] an antigen. T cells recognize their cognate antigen in a processed form – as a peptide {{in the context of}} an MHC molecule, whereas B cells recognize antigens in their native form. Once a B cell encounters its cognate (or specific) antigen (and receives additional signals from a helper T cell (predominately Th2 type)), it further differentiates into an effector cell, known as a plasma cell.|$|E

50|$|This {{protocol}} {{is possible}} because an antibody {{consists of two}} parts, a variable region (which recognizes the antigen) and constant region (which makes up {{the structure of the}} <b>antibody</b> <b>molecule).</b> It is important to realize that this division is artificial and in reality the <b>antibody</b> <b>molecule</b> is four polypeptide chains: two heavy chains and two light chains. A researcher can generate several primary antibodies that recognize various antigens (have different variable regions), but all share the same constant region. All these antibodies may therefore be recognized by a single secondary antibody. This saves the cost of modifying the primary antibodies to directly carry a fluorophore.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of inkjet-printed biomolecules in porous nitrocellulose substrates {{often results in}} a non-homogeneous spot morphology {{commonly referred to as}} 'doughnut-shaped' spots. We have studied the influence of Pluronic F 127 (an amphiphilic surfactant) on the functionality of inkjet-printed primary <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules</b> and on the final assay result by performing a one-step antibody binding assay in the nitrocellulose substrate. The primary antibody was printed with and without Pluronic, followed by the addition of double-labelled amplicons as antigen molecules and a fluorophore-labelled streptavidin as detection conjugate. The {{distribution of}} the fluorescence intensity down into the nitrocellulose substrate was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy in 'Z' stacking mode. Each horizontal slice was further analysed by applying a concentric ring format and the fluorescence intensity in each slice was represented in a colour-coded way. The mean and total fluorescence intensity of the antibody binding assay (fluorescent streptavidin) showed a peak at 0. 2 % (w/v) Pluronic F 127. In addition, an improved spot morphology was observed also peaking at the same Pluronic concentration. Subsequently, we investigated the direct influence of Pluronic F 127 on the location of the primary <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules</b> by labelling these molecules with the fluorophore Alexa- 488. Our results show that upon increasing the concentration of Pluronic F 127 in the printing buffer, the spot diameter increased and the number of primary <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules</b> bound in the spot area gradually decreased. This was confirmed by analysing the distribution of fluorescently labelled primary <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules</b> down into the membrane layers. We conclude that a particular ratio between primary antibody and Pluronic F 127 molecules in combination with available substrate binding capacity results in an optimal orientation, that is Fab-UP, of the primary <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules.</b> Consequently, an increased number of antigen molecules (in our case the labelled amplicons) and of the fluorescent detection conjugate (streptavidin) will give an optimal signal. Moreover, distribution of the primary <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules</b> was more homogeneous at the optimal Pluronic F 127 concentration, contributing to the better spot morphology observed.

While conducting these experiments in Pressman’s lab, Nisonoff contributed to an important paper explaining an idea that eventually led to important conclusions about the structure of the <b>antibody</b> <b>molecule.</b> In this early paper he demonstrated that the <b>antibody</b> <b>molecule</b> has two combining sites with the same specificity for an antigenic determinant.

Our studies were based on the hypothesis that reaginic antibody activity is associated with a unique immunoglobulin isotype, which is now called IgE. As expected, identification of IgE facilitated the analysis of immunologic mechanisms of reaginic hypersensitivity.

40|$|The {{concept of}} idiotypy of {{antigen-binding}} receptors {{suggests that in}} addition to possessing a particular binding site for antigen, each receptor has a set of serologic determinants (idiotypes) which distinguish it from other receptors. The finding of idiotypy of <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules</b> (1) eventually led to a proposal for a network theory of the immune response (2). The network theory postulates that idiotypic determinants on antibodies are recognition sites for other, anti-idiotypic antibodies within an individual's own immunoglobulin repertoire.

Evidence for the occurrence of idiotypy (Id) 1 on immunoglobulin (<b>antibody)</b> <b>molecules</b> is by now abundant and considerable data has accumulated suggesting that the regulation of a given immune response involves the interaction of antigen-specific, Id-bearing <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules</b> and anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies.</b> In particular, it can be shown that: (a) xeno- and allogeneic anti-idiotypic antibodies can induce specific immune responses in the absence of "antigen " (3 - 5), and (b) that auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies (6) can be detected in vivo...|$|R

The later strains, although all were asymmetrically cross-reactive with earlier strains, tended to exhibit distant and variable cross-reactions with each other. The numbers and average affinities of <b>antibody</b> <b>molecules</b> capable of taking part in cross-reactions were calculated from equilibrium filtration experiments.
