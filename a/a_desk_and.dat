5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E

25|$|Wong {{entered through}} the front door, firing a number of bullets at people in his path. At 10:30a.m. Broome County Communications {{received}} several 911 calls, and the first police were dispatched to the scene. Two of the Civic Association's receptionists {{were among the first}} victims shot. While one of the receptionists was reported to have been shot through the head and killed, the second, shot in the stomach, feigned death and, when the gunman moved on, took cover under <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> called 911. The receptionist's call was taken by 911 staff at 10:38a.m. The wounded receptionist, 61-year-old Shirley DeLucia, remained on the line for 39 minutes, despite her gunshot wound, and relayed information until she was rescued. She later recounted that the gunman had opened fire without saying anything.|$|E

500|$|An inmate {{register}} {{reveals that}} there were 1,576 prisoners in total held at Alcatraz during its time as a Federal Penitentiary, although figures reported have varied and some have stated 1557. The prison cells, purposefully designed so that none adjoined an outside wall, typically measured [...] by [...] and [...] high. The cells were primitive with a bed, <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> a washbasin and toilet on the back wall and few furnishings except a blanket. An air vent, measuring [...] by , covered by a metal grill, lay {{at the back of}} the cells which led into the utility corridors. [...] Prisoners had no privacy in going to the toilet and the toilets would emit a strong stench because they were flushed with salt water. Hot water faucets were not installed until the early 1960s, shortly before closure.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Jason Woliner, who previously directed the Parks and Recreation episodes [...] "Beauty Pageant" [...] and [...] "Woman of the Year". The idea of Andy injuring himself in a motorcycle accident was conceived early in the filming of the second season by Chris Pratt. Pratt's stunt double, Joe Bucaro III, {{is considered one of}} the leading motorcycle stuntmen in the United States, and Pratt suggested that a stunt involving Andy crashing a motorcycle would be very funny. Bucaro filmed two takes of the crash in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", and the first take was used in the final episode. At the beginning of the episode, while roller-skating through the corridors of city hall, Andy unsuccessfully tries to jump over <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> falls violently to the ground. Unlike the motorcycle crash, Pratt performed that stunt himself, and had to film about six takes of it.|$|E
500|$|The three-story cellhouse {{included}} the main four {{blocks of the}} jail, A-block, B-block, C-block, and D-block, the warden's office, visitation room, the library, and the barber shop. [...] The prison cells typically measured [...] by [...] and [...] high. The cells were primitive and lacked privacy, with a bed, <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> a washbasin and toilet on the back wall, with few furnishings except a blanket. African-Americans were segregated from the rest in cell designation due to racial abuse being prevalent. D-Block housed the worst inmates and five cells {{at the end of}} it were designated as [...] "The Hole", where badly behaving prisoners would be sent for periods of punishment, often brutally so. The dining hall and kitchen lay off the main building in an extended part where both prisoners and staff would eat three meals a day together. The Alcatraz Hospital was above the dining hall.|$|E

500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself this is not my beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife".|$|E
500|$|The General Assembly building, {{housing the}} United Nations General Assembly, holds the General Assembly Hall {{which has a}} seating {{capacity}} of 1,800. At [...] long by [...] wide, {{it is the largest}} room in the complex. The Hall has two murals by the French artist Fernand Léger. At the front of the chamber, is the rostrum containing the green marble desk for the President of the General Assembly, Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services and matching lectern for speakers. Behind the rostrum is the UN emblem on a gold background. Flanking the rostrum is a paneled semi-circular wall that tapers as it nears the ceiling and surrounds the front portion of the chamber. In front of the paneled walls are seating areas for guests and within the wall are windows which allow translators to watch the proceedings as they work. The ceiling of the hall is [...] high and surmounted by a shallow dome ringed by recessed light fixtures. The entrance to the hall bears an inscription from the Gulistan by Iranian poet Saadi. The General Assembly Hall was last altered in 1980 when capacity was increased to accommodate the increased membership. Each of the 192 delegations has six seats in the hall with three at <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> three alternate seats behind them.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{positive to}} fair reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist for The Star-Ledger, said [...] "Boys' Club" [...] was funnier that previous episode and included scenes with good physical comedy involving Leslie, particularly when she spilled the beer bottles; he also praised Andy's [...] "naked crutch chase". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode {{gave a little}} more insight into Leslie's [...] "aspirations about {{wanting to be a}} woman who succeeds in government, which {{is a step in the}} right direction", but Fowler said her constant mistakes and wrong decisions bog down the story. Fowler said the best part of the episode was Andy's subplot, particularly the scene in which he hops down the street naked on his crutches. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- grade, and said the Amy Poehler character needs to be more fully formed in future episodes. Phipps said most of the show's laughs came from supporting characters Andy, Tom and Ron; he also particularly praised Ron's shutdown of Leslie's hearing and his monologues of the ideal government: [...] "One guy, who sits in a small room at <b>a</b> <b>desk.</b> <b>And</b> the only thing he’s allowed to decide is who to nuke." [...] Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly liked that the episode included a moral crisis of sorts for Leslie, who he described as [...] "a realized character instead of a caricature".|$|E

2500|$|Twenty {{five minutes}} {{brought us to}} the Bryson Tower, a white stucco palace with fretted {{lanterns}} in the forecourt and tall date palms. The entrance was in an L, up marble steps, through a Moorish archway, and over a lobby that was too big and a carpet that was too blue. Blue Ali Baba oil jars were dotted around, big enough to keep tigers in. There was <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> a night clerk {{with one of those}} moustaches that get stuck under your finger nail." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chapman and Cleese also {{specialised}} in sketches {{where two}} characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects, {{such as in}} the [...] "cheese shop", the [...] "dead parrot" [...] sketch and [...] "Argument Clinic", where Cleese plays a stone-faced bureaucrat employed to sit behind <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> engage people in pointless, trivial bickering. All of these roles were opposite Palin (who Cleese often claims is his favourite Python to work with)—the comic contrast between the towering Cleese's crazed aggression and the shorter Palin's shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series. Occasionally, the typical Cleese–Palin dynamic is reversed, as in [...] "Fish Licence", wherein Palin plays the bureaucrat with whom Cleese is trying to work.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after 8 P.M., {{residents}} in apartments above the Democratic Club heard several shots. [...] Eight hours later, a cab driver {{going to a}} nearby cafe noticed that the club door was open; he also heard water running inside. The police were called and they found the bodies of Charles Binaggio and Charles Gargotta inside the club. Binaggio was seated at <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> Gargotta was lying inside the front door. [...] Both men {{had been shot in}} the head four times with separate [...]32 caliber revolvers. [...] The police theorized that Gargotta had been trying to escape the club when he was shot in the back of the head. As for the running water heard by the cabbie, it came from a broken toilet and was unrelated to the hit.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} defeat of the Confederates in New Mexico, General and Mrs. Canby were reassigned back East where Canby spent more than a year in bureaucratic service in Pennsylvania, New York, and Washington, D.C. {{sometimes}} as an unofficial administrative assistant to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. It was not until 1864 that Canby was allowed out from behind <b>a</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> he and Mrs. Canby were sent to the Trans-Mississippi region, eventually finding a home in New Orleans where Louisa stayed while her husband supported the Union's impending defeat of Confederate forces, which happened to include the remnants of Sibley's brigade; although, by this time, Sibley himself had been court-martialed for dereliction of duty during the Battle of Bisland.

2500|$|The defendant, Charles P. Barrett, {{was one of}} a {{group of}} men in Spartanburg, South Carolina, alleged to have been {{involved}} in a conspiracy to defraud companies selling items by mail order. Barrett, apparently an attorney, arranged to have post offices established in rural areas with the name of each post office being the name of another defendant (e.g. Owens, McElrath, Wyatt). Companies sending mail to those individuals would thereby be led to think that the individuals were proprietors of the respective post offices. Barrett also created a letterhead on which to send orders for goods, in order to further induce the trust of the companies from which orders were placed, and his co-conspirators ordered goods including encyclopedias, a piano, an organ, <b>a</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> a safe, none of which were ever paid for. The fraud was far reaching, as the trial court reported that parties coming to testify that they had been defrauded: ...|$|E
2500|$|The band partly {{returned}} to the creative process used {{in the creation of}} The Warning in that some parts of songs were written and recorded in Goddard's bedroom, with Taylor also writing from his house and recording in the room he designated as a [...] "music room". These parts were then built upon in a studio where the band had more space, enabling them to [...] "expand on things". Goddard used Cubase to record at his house whilst Logic Pro was used in the studio as well as GarageBand to create parts of songs. Of the latter Taylor said, [...] "that's what I use for recording, and that's like half of the record is going through that program". In regards {{to the creation of the}} music, Taylor stated that everyone had involvement in aspects of all of the tracks. Taylor stated that the group felt as though they had exhausted their home studio sound and the possibilities of the instruments they could use at home. Despite this, Taylor explained that he and Joe have a similar work aesthetic and that ideas would [...] "come [...] any time of the day or night"; working on material at home would enable them to [...] "record at home whenever ideas come". However Taylor stated, [...] "even the studio we worked in, it's not like a professional studio that is like, top of the range. It's just a big basement with <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> various synthesisers and a drum kit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{shots of the}} library and a book called [...] "The Story of Us". Swift narrates the story while {{standing}} between two bookshelves, sitting on <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> lying across a table (and occasionally lying on top of [...] "The Story of Us") {{with a stack of}} books next to her, as we see scenes flashing back and forth between her and her ex-boyfriend, students in the library, some library staff, and her band playing the song. The scenes between her and her ex start with a private meeting between the two in the library, scenes where she is finding a place by herself without him in the library, to the awkward scene of finding him across the room from her. Swift hides behind a book she's holding when she notices her ex, then looks away pulling on her clothes and plays with her hair, in the attempt of not making him notice her. She doesn't notice that he noticed her too, later in the video, and was trying to avoid her too. They both eventually catch each other looking and they awkwardly try to give each other a silent and distant [...] "Hi" [...] as the video cuts to a scene where we see a girl who first pulls Swift's ex into a make out, then pulls away as the librarian passes by. When the librarian passes, Swift's ex pulls the girl back and kisses her again. This cheating caused the fall out between Swift and the guy. Swift eventually gives the first [...] "Hi" [...] which he returns and both get up to confront the other. The video ends with a break out of the other classmates and staff joining in, the classmates throwing away their papers and they and the staff begin dancing to the song while both Swift and her ex are face to face with each other in a very awkward moment, both trying to say how the other feels, but eventually they both shrug at each other and walk away. The last shot is of Swift closing the book of [...] "The Story of Us".|$|E
