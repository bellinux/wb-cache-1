5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left <b>armhole.</b> They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E
25|$|In the bespoke (custom-made) {{industry}} where each shirt {{is made from}} an individually drafted pattern, these sizing problems are avoided, though there are still different ways of making the shirt fit. While many choose to cut the sleeve long and have the cuff catch on the hand to regulate its length, some prefer the much harder option of using a high <b>armhole</b> and carefully tailored shape, so that the cuff can be loose and still sit in exactly the right place wherever the arm moves.|$|E
25|$|The Shoulders: the Neapolitan jacket has no {{shoulder}} padding. Neapolitan tailors {{removed the}} shoulder padding from their jackets {{in order to}} provide more freedom of movement. For this reason, the Neapolitan shoulder on informal jackets is sewn like a shirt sleeve (“spalla a camicia”) and it follows the natural curve of the human body rather than give it shape. This type of sleeve is cut about 10 cm larger than the <b>armhole,</b> and it can be finished with the “repecchia” – that visually interesting shirring the tailor creates with the extra fabric. This little flair, which supposedly allows for even more freedom of movement, is known as “manica a mappina”, and it gives the jacket a beautiful “rugged” appearance. For formal occasions, the Neapolitan shoulder features a “rollino” – a little roll of padding that raises the sleeve head to drape more cleanly.|$|E

50|$|Just before {{reaching}} the <b>armholes,</b> the knitter may add a few stitches for extra room under the arms. At the <b>armholes,</b> the knitting is divided into {{an equal number of}} stitches for the back and the front, and about five stitches from the front and five from the back are put onto a safety pin. The knitter then divides the front in two by putting four stitches from the middle on a safety pin to hold for the collar base. The back is worked straight up from the <b>armholes,</b> and the fronts are worked to the same height with some decreasing at the neck edge for shaping. The shoulders are knit together, and the remaining stitches (usually about one-third) at the neck back are held for the collar.|$|R
25|$|Christofle Charvet {{created the}} first shirtmaker store in Paris, for which the new term chemisier (shirtmaker) was coined. Previously, shirts were {{generally}} made by linen keepers with fabric provided by the customer, but in this store of a new kind, clients were measured, fabric selected and shirts made on site. The development of this specialty trade was favored by a change in men's fashion, with more importance given to the waistcoat and the shirt collar, which called for more propositions for the shirt front and a technical change. Previously, shirts were cut by linen keepers entirely of rectangles and squares. There were no shaping seams and no need for shirt patterns. The new interest for a closer fitting shirt led to curving the <b>armhole</b> and neckline or adding a shoulder yoke, by application to the shirt of tailoring techniques. The new kind of shirt was called chemise à pièce (yoked shirt). Alan Flusser credits Christofle Charvet with the original design of a collar that could be turned down or folded, much {{in the manner of}} contemporary collars, and the concept of the detachable collar.|$|E
500|$|Tailoring was {{softened}} in {{the early}} 20th century by Frederick Scholte when he developed the English drape for the Duke of Windsor. Scholte's [...] "dress soft" [...] style was developed into the [...] "London cut", the house style of Anderson & Sheppard, by Per Anderson, a protégé of Sholte. [...] The [...] "London cut" [...] is a high small <b>armhole</b> with a generous upper sleeve that permits the jacket to remain close to the neck while freeing the arm to move with comfort.|$|E
500|$|Underwire bras {{are built}} with a {{semi-circular}} [...] "underwire", [...] "bra wire", or [...] "wire" [...] {{embedded in the}} wire channel that circles the {{bottom and sides of}} each cup. One end, or head element, of the underwire is close to the front and center of the bra, and the other close to the <b>armhole.</b> The underwire can be made of metal or molded plastic; most are metallic. Plastic underwire has a very small share of the market because it does not provide the same support and rigidity offered by metal underwire. A metallic underwire is a thin strip of metal, usually with a nylon coating at both ends.|$|E
50|$|The MMus and undress DMus gowns {{are similar}} in shape to the masters' gown but with a flap collar {{covering}} the yoke and with inverted T-shaped <b>armholes</b> rather than straight horizontal cuts. Additionally there are panels of lace (known as gimp) near {{the foot of the}} gown and (on the DMus undress gown) on the sleeves. Instead of this panel, the MMus gown has a row of lace running from the <b>armholes</b> {{to the base of the}} sleeves.|$|R

50|$|The build of an A-shirt is simple: {{the neck}} and <b>armholes</b> are often {{reinforced}} for durability. One usually has large <b>armholes</b> and neck holes and a neckline that can reach down {{as far as the}} bottom of the chest. (Women's A-shirts have smaller holes, to conceal their breasts.) They are also sometimes made long to make tucking into a pair of jeans/shorts easier. In almost all cases, they are buttonless, collarless, and pocketless. An A-shirt worn as an undershirt is designed for a tight fit and is often made of ribbed cotton.|$|R

60|$|When he walks, he {{puts the}} thumb of each hand into the <b>armhole</b> of his waistcoat, and moves along stiffly, with a {{knock-kneed}} gait. His talk was chiefly of hotels, and such matters as a man, always travelling, without any purpose of observation for mental improvement, would be interested in. He spoke of {{his life as a}} hard one.|$|E
60|$|With a swift {{disclosing}} gesture he gave Ossipon {{a glimpse}} of an india-rubber tube, resembling a slender brown worm, issuing from the <b>armhole</b> of his waistcoat and plunging into the inner breast pocket of his jacket. His clothes, of a nondescript brown mixture, were threadbare and marked with stains, dusty in the folds, with ragged button-holes. “The detonator is partly mechanical, partly chemical,” he explained, with casual condescension.|$|E

60|$|The {{advantage}} of having {{plenty of time}} on one's hands is that one has leisure {{to attend to the}} affairs of all one's circle of friends; and Archie, assiduously as he watched over the destinies of the Sausage Chappie, did not neglect the romantic needs of his brother-in-law Bill. A few days later, Lucille, returning one morning to their mutual suite, found her husband seated in an upright chair at the table, an unusually stern expression on his amiable face. A large cigar was {{in the corner of his}} mouth. The fingers of one hand rested in the <b>armhole</b> of his waistcoat: with the other hand he tapped menacingly on the table.|$|E
6000|$|A slim, wiry {{youth in}} high-heeled boots {{came down to}} the water's edge. His face was boyish, but with a {{premature}} severity that hinted at a man's experience. His complexion was naturally dark; and the sun and wind of an outdoor life had burned it to a coffee brown. His hair was as black and straight as an Indian's; his face had not yet been upturned to the humiliation of a razor; his eyes were a cold and steady blue. He carried his left arm somewhat away from his body, for pearl-handled [...] .45s are frowned upon by town marshals, and are a little bulky when placed in the left <b>armhole</b> of one's vest. He looked beyond Captain Boone at the gulf with the impersonal and expressionless dignity of a Chinese emperor.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's M. de Mauves," [...] {{she said}} at once; with which she moved slowly forward. Longmore, {{wondering}} how she knew without seeing, had overtaken her by the time her husband came into view. A solitary walk in the forest was a pastime to which M. de Mauves was not addicted, but he seemed on this occasion to have resorted to it with some equanimity. He was smoking a fragrant cigar and had thrust his thumb into the <b>armhole</b> of his waistcoat with {{the air of a}} man thinking at his ease. He stopped short with surprise on seeing his wife and her companion, and his surprise had for Longmore even the pitch of impertinence. He glanced rapidly from one to the other, fixed the young man's own look sharply a single instant and then lifted his hat with formal politeness.|$|E
5000|$|A-shirt or vest or singlet (in British English) - {{essentially}} a sleeveless shirt with large <b>armholes</b> {{and a large}} neck hole, often worn by labourers or athletes for increased movability. Sometimes called a [...] "wife beater" [...] when worn without a covering layer.|$|R
50|$|Cesare Attolini is {{a luxury}} {{menswear}} brand founded in Naples the 1930s by Vincenzo Attolini. The brand is now run by his grandsons Giuseppe and Massimiliano Attolini.

60|$|Her father, {{his thumbs}} in the <b>armholes</b> of his {{waistcoat}} {{and his legs}} far apart, {{looked at her in}} blank and speechless amazement; her mother, with more consideration but equal lack of sympathy, patted her gently {{on the back of her}} hand.|$|R
60|$|Brooks nodded back, {{and resumed}} his conversation. Selina took the {{opportunity}} to mention casually to her neighbour, Mr. Huntingdon, that Mr. Brooks was a great friend of Lord Arranmore's, and Louise, on her side of the table, took care also to disseminate the same information. Everybody was properly impressed. Mr. Bullsom decided to give a dinner-party every month, and to double the greengrocer's tip, and by the time Selina's third stage whisper had reached her mother and the ladies finally departed, he {{was in a state of}} geniality bordering upon beatitude. There was a general move to his end of the table. Mr. Bullsom started the port, and his shirt-front grew wider and wider. He lit a cigar, and his thumb found its way to the <b>armhole</b> of his waistcoat. At that moment Mr. Bullsom would not have changed places with any man on earth.|$|E
