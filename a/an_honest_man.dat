5|$|In the Rhineland, Custine {{continued}} the revolution by proclamation, and levied heavy {{taxes on the}} nobility and clergy. During the winter a Prussian army forced him to evacuate Frankfurt, re-cross the Rhine and fall back upon Landau. This occurred during Charles François Dumouriez's treasonous collaboration with the Austrians. Summoned to Paris to account for himself, Custine was accused of treason, but was ably defended by Robespierre, the French revolutionary and lawyer, who declared Custine <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> who gave his country good service. With Robespierre's defense, he was cleared of all charges, and later given command of the Army of the North.|$|E
25|$|Repington (whom Wilson {{thought a}} “dirty brute” and “lying brute”) {{attacked}} the current standards of British staff officers in The Times on 27 September 1910, arguing that Wilson had educated staff officers to be “sucking Napoleons” and that Robertson was a “first rate man” who would sort it out. Wilson wrote to Lord Loch (27 September 1910) “we can comfort ourselves with the reflexion {{that to be}} abused by Repington is the highest praise <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> can get”.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, King Khalid {{was not an}} {{effective}} leader. Although {{he seemed to be}} reluctant to rule the country initially, he later warmed to the throne and displayed an apparent interest in improving the education, health-care and infrastructure of the country during his seven-year reign. King Khalid is also considered to have been a genial caretaker during his reign. However, King Khalid failed to monopolize the power during his reign, leading to the empowerment of the princes who had been in powerful posts in late King Faisal's reign. He had some personal characteristics that made him a respected king. Although he did not have an active interest in affairs of state and his health was not good, he was admired as <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> who managed to have good relations with the traditional establishment of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, he was granted support by other princes and powerful forces of the country.|$|E

25|$|Following World War I, circus films became popular. In 1924 He Who Gets Slapped was {{the first}} film {{released}} by MGM; in 1925 Sally of the Sawdust (remade 1930), Variety, and Vaudeville were produced, followed by The Devil's Circus in 1926 and The Circus starring Charlie Chaplin, Circus Rookies, 4 Devils; and Laugh Clown Laugh in 1928. German film Salto Mortale about trapeze artists was released in 1930 and remade in the United States and released as Trapeze starring Burt Lancaster in 1956; in 1932 Freaks was released; Charlie Chan at the Circus, Circus (USSR) and The Three Maxiums were released in 1936 and At the Circus starring the Marx Brothers and You Can't Cheat <b>an</b> <b>Honest</b> <b>Man</b> in 1939. Circus films continued to be popular during the Second World War; films from this era included The Great Profile starring John Barrymore (1940), the animated Disney film Dumbo (1941), Road Show (1941), The Wagons Roll at Night (1941) and Captive Wild Woman (1943).|$|E
25|$|Furious {{at their}} escape, Leontes now {{publicly}} accuses {{his wife of}} infidelity, and declares that the child she is bearing must be illegitimate. He throws her in prison, over the protests of his nobles, and sends two of his lords, Cleomenes and Dion, to the Oracle at Delphos for what he is sure will be confirmation of his suspicions. Meanwhile, the queen gives birth to a girl, and her loyal friend Paulina takes the baby to the king, {{in the hopes that}} the sight of the child will soften his heart. He grows angrier, however, and orders Paulina's husband, Lord Antigonus, to take the child and abandon it in a desolate place. Cleomenes and Dion return from Delphos with word from the Oracle and find Hermione publicly and humiliatingly put on trial before the king. She asserts her innocence, and asks for the word of the Oracle to be read before the court. The Oracle states categorically that Hermione and Polixenes are innocent, Camillo <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> <b>man,</b> and that Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found. Leontes shuns the news, refusing to believe it as the truth. As this news is revealed, word comes that Leontes' son, Mamillius, has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his mother. Hermione, meanwhile, falls in a swoon, and is carried away by Paulina, who subsequently reports the queen's death to her heartbroken and repentant husband. Leontes vows {{to spend the rest of}} his days atoning for the loss of his son, his abandoned daughter, and his queen.|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of James (2005), Varma planned to remake Siva. The second remake, also entitled Shiva, featured Mohit Ahlawat and Priyanka Kothari as the characters played by Nagarjuna and Amala in the original. Unlike Siva, the protagonist in the second remake is <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> who joins the Mumbai Police as a new recruit; the cycle-chain scene and Raghuvaran's character were omitted. Shiva received negative reviews; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com wrote that the film [...] "dare to ridiculously rest on the incapable shoulders of a non-acting cast", and nastiness was [...] "defined as a scowling ogre". Director Riingo Banerjee acknowledged Siva {{as a source of}} inspiration for his 2006 Bengali film Kranti.|$|E
500|$|Republican James Sullivan won the governor's seat from Strong in 1807, but his {{successor}} {{was unable to}} hold the seat in the 1809 election, which went to Federalist Christopher Gore. [...] Gerry stood for election again in 1810 against Gore, and won a narrow victory. [...] Republicans cast Gore as an ostentatious British-loving Tory who wanted to restore the monarchy (his parents had remained Loyal during the Revolution), and Gerry as a patriotic American, while Federalists described Gerry as a [...] "French partizan" [...] and Gore as <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> devoted to ridding the government of foreign influence. [...] A temporary lessening in {{the threat of war}} with Britain aided Gerry. [...] The two battled again in 1811, with Gerry once again victorious in a highly acrimonious campaign.|$|E
500|$|In 1760 Münchhausen {{retired to}} live as a Freiherr at his estates in Bodenwerder, where he {{remained}} {{until his death in}} 1797. It was there, especially at parties given for the area's aristocrats, that he developed a reputation as an imaginative after-dinner storyteller, creating witty and highly exaggerated accounts of his adventures in Russia. Over the ensuing thirty years, his storytelling abilities gained such renown that he frequently received visits from travelling nobles wanting to hear his tales. One guest described Münchhausen as telling his stories [...] "cavalierly, indeed with military emphasis, yet without any concession to the whimsicality of the man of the world; describing his adventures as one would incidents which were in the natural course of events". Rather than being considered a liar, Münchhausen was seen as <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> <b>man.</b> As another contemporary put it, Münchhausen's unbelievable narratives were designed not to deceive, but [...] "to ridicule the disposition for the marvellous which he observed in some of his acquaintances".|$|E

William Gibbs McAdoo, a former Democratic senator, stated [...] "You don't {{have to agree}} with every {{position}} taken to concede that he was an intellectual giant and one of the truly great men of our times". Ernest K. Lindley deemed Borah the [...] "most effectively liberal voice in the Republican Party". Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' paper, Der Angriff, asserted, [...] "American life loses a personality valued by friend or foe on account of his courage, honesty, and decent method of fighting."

Columnist Raymond Clapper mourned, [...] "there are no fighters on the progressive side —no men like T.R.... Borah was the last".|$|E
500|$|Beet (...) , a plant {{native to}} the Mediterranean Basin, was already grown in antiquity. Only the leaves were of culinary use, as the tapered, tough, whitish and bitter-tasting root was {{considered}} unfit for human consumption. It is likely that beet greens were used in variants of green borscht long before {{the invention of the}} beetroot-based red borscht. Beet varieties with round, red, sweet taproots, known as beetroots, were not reliably reported until the 12th century and did not spread to Eastern Europe before the 16th century. , a Polish Renaissance poet and moralist, included the earliest known Polish recipe for pickled beetroots in his 1568 book, Life of <b>an</b> <b>Honest</b> <b>Man.</b> It would later evolve into , or , a beet-and-horseradish relish popular in Polish and Jewish cuisines. [...] also recommended the [...] "very tasty brine" [...] left over from beetroot pickling, which was an early version of beet sour. The sour found some applications in Polish folk medicine as a cure for hangover and – mixed with honey – as a sore throat remedy.|$|E
500|$|In January 1864, Union {{soldiers}} forced Constable {{under threat}} of violence to make an oath of allegiance {{to the federal government}} in Mattoon, Illinois. [...] One source described the Union soldiers as a [...] "mob" [...] and stated that Constable [...] "shed tears." [...] Another source stated that the soldiers violently dragged Constable off his wagon and humiliated him by making him kneel on the ground and swear his allegiance, and that these actions caused an eruption of violence in Mattoon the following day. [...] After the Republican victories in the Illinois elections of 1864, the legislature cut Constable's judicial circuit from six to two counties in early 1865. [...] In the diaries of his nephew Edmund C. Hinde, Constable is described as <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> with good character, and his opponents are called [...] "cowards" [...] who did not understand the circumstances of the events. According to historian David Williamson, Hinde's argument supporting his uncle's ruling has legal merit. He said that Chief Justice Roger B. Taney made a similar argument in Ex parte Merryman.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Cromwell, Henry's Chief Minister, {{had long}} since had {{his eyes on the}} wealth of English monasteries; at the time they owned {{approximately}} a quarter of all the realm's landed wealth. Starting in 1534, Cromwell had each of the monasteries inspected, with the establishment's wealth and endowments recorded, along with frequent reports of impropriety, vice and excess. These reports were compiled into volumes known as the Valor Ecclesiasticus. Leicester abbey was inspected by Richard Layton, in 1535, who complimented Abbot Bourchier as <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> <b>man,</b> but who tried to bring charges of [...] "adultery and unnatural vice" [...] against the abbey's canons. Abbot Bourchier sought to gain Thomas Cromwell's favour to protect his canons and abbey; in 1536 sending him £100 and gifts of sheep and oxen. This was ultimately fruitless: Cromwell had convinced King Henry of the immoral behaviour within England's monasteries and thus between 1536 and 1541 they were all suppressed and dissolved: their land, property and wealth transferred to the king. The abbot's attempts at bribery could not save Leicester Abbey, and it was finally surrendered to the crown for dissolution in 1538.|$|E
500|$|During the {{presentation}} of evidence against her, Mary broke down and pointed accusingly at Walsingham saying, [...] "all {{of this is the}} work of Monsieur de Walsingham for my destruction", to which he replied, [...] "God is my witness that as a private person I have done nothing unworthy of <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> <b>man,</b> and as Secretary of State, nothing unbefitting my duty." [...] Mary was found guilty and the warrant for her execution was drafted, but Elizabeth hesitated to sign it, despite pressure from Walsingham. Walsingham wrote to Paulet urging him to find [...] "some way to shorten the life" [...] of Mary to relieve Elizabeth of the burden, to which Paulet replied indignantly, [...] "God forbid that I should make so foul a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot to my poor posterity, to shed blood without law or warrant." [...] Walsingham made arrangements for Mary's execution; Elizabeth signed the warrant on 1 February 1587 and entrusted it to William Davison, who had been appointed as junior Secretary of State in late September 1586. Davison passed the warrant to Cecil and a privy council convened by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge agreed to carry out the sentence as soon as was practical. Within a week, Mary was beheaded. On hearing of the execution, Elizabeth claimed not to have sanctioned the action and that she had not meant Davison to part with the warrant. Davison was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Walsingham's share of Elizabeth's displeasure was small because he was absent from court, at home ill, in the weeks just before and after the execution. Davison was eventually released in October 1588, on the orders of Cecil and Walsingham.|$|E
