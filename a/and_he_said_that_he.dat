Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn {{on her face and}} a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely {{that at least some of}} the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with both feet off the ground, snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.|$|E

Romney told the Associated Press that he did not recall pornography having come up for discussion while he had served on the board; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unaware of how much revenue the hotels may have generated from pornography.|$|E

500|$|Elgar was {{contemptuous of}} folk music {{and had little}} {{interest}} in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries [...] "museum pieces". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.|$|E

However, he quickly became {{aware of the importance of}} the public participation process itself, stating that it was [...] "one of the rare opportunities for the public to feel they were being heard and taken seriously."

500|$|Branco {{called the}} {{original}} rape storyline [...] "the gold standard of rape stories," [...] {{and stated that}} Carlivati had changed it into a soap opera cliché. Carlivati's addition to the characters' histories left him feeling betrayed, hurt, depressed, angry, insulted, and disgusted, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had wasted almost 20 years investing in and believing in the original rape storyline. At the [...] "re-rape" [...] storyline's conclusion, Branco stated that the payoff was worth the tense moments. [...] "However obscene or depraved the riskiest storyline in recent memory was," [...] he said, [...] "the fallout has been shockingly riveting—thanks {{to the fact that}} head writer Ron Carlivati is playing all the psychological beats of Todd's self-serving and criminal actions." [...] Branco also gave credit to St. John. [...] "Nominated for a 2009 Soap Opera Spirit Award as outstanding lead actor, St. John inarguably faced the most challenging assignment of any actor in 2008—in any genre," [...] said Branco.

For the most part, the team didn't want to redo any of the design {{elements}} from the first game, as they {{felt that there was}} no need to change anything that had already proved successful; instead, they opted to look for areas that could be improved and expanded upon them in a way that retained the base style of Knights of the Old Republic. Obsidian put much work into the game's graphics, including the appearances of non-player characters. Other technological improvements include the lighting and weather effects, in addition to increasing the level sizes. Knights of the Old Republic IIs lead artist was Aaron Meyers; he decided which people would join the art team after looking through [...] "tons of applications, resumes, and demo reels", <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was pleased with the amount of people who wanted to work for Obsidian.
