5|$|A {{version of}} this story {{circulating}} in 1836, recounted by Martineau, added that the slaves were emaciated, showed signs of being flayed with <b>a</b> <b>whip,</b> were bound in restrictive postures, and wore spiked iron collars which kept their heads in static positions.|$|E
5|$|Consciously or unconsciously, most theists see in {{gods and}} devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, <b>a</b> <b>whip</b> to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment.... The {{philosophy}} of Atheism expresses the expansion {{and growth of}} the human mind. The philosophy of theism, if we can call it a philosophy, is static and fixed.|$|E
5|$|Emma Goldman {{was born}} on June 27, 1869. Her father used {{violence}} to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him. He used <b>a</b> <b>whip</b> on Emma, the most rebellious of them. Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham to tone down his beatings. Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was at least partly a result of sexual frustration.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>whipped</b> cream charger (also called whippits, whippets (from {{the brand}} name Whip-It), nossies, nangs, or chargers) is a steel {{cylinder}} or cartridge filled with nitrous oxide (N2O) that is used as <b>a</b> <b>whipping</b> agent in <b>a</b> <b>whipped</b> cream dispenser. The narrow end of a charger has a foil covering which is broken to release the gas. This is usually done by a sharp pin inside the whipped cream dispenser. The nitrous oxide in chargers {{is also used to}} power model rocket engines.|$|R

5|$|Other {{suggestions}} {{for the cover}} included the group urinating against a Marshall Stack and an overweight nude woman with the Who's faces in place of her genitalia. An alternative cover featuring Moon dressed in black lingerie and a brown wig, holding <b>a</b> <b>whip,</b> was later used for the inside art for the 1995 and 2003 CD releases. Some of the photographs taken during these sessions were later used as part of Decca's United States promotion of the album.|$|E
5|$|The Macdonalds {{sought to}} {{maintain}} the park's natural beauty, planting 10,000shrubs in the first year, and thousands of trees during the 1930s. In the first few years, the park added a circle swing, <b>a</b> <b>Whip,</b> a miniature railroad, and in 1938, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company Rollo Coaster. World War II and the resulting rationing forced the park to close in 1943. Upon reopening in 1946, the park added the Caterpillar and a small showboat that sailed in Lake Bouquet.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} written and {{directed}} by Tan Tjoei Hock for Action Film, a subsidiary of producer The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film (JIF). Tan, who had made his directorial debut in 1940, based Srigala Item on the stories surrounding Johnston McCulley's fictional bandit Zorro; as with the American bandit, the Black Wolf used <b>a</b> <b>whip</b> and wore all black. The black-and-white film was shot by The Teng Chun's brother Teng Gan, with Hajopan Bajo Angin as artistic designer.|$|E

5|$|The {{script was}} written {{specifically}} for Hepburn, and was tailored to her personality. Filming began in September 1937 and wrapped in January 1938; {{it was over}} schedule and over budget. Production was frequently delayed due to uncontrollable laughing fits between Hepburn and Grant. Hepburn struggled with her comedic performance and was coached by her co-star, vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett. A tame leopard was used during the shooting; its trainer was off-screen with <b>a</b> <b>whip</b> for all its scenes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Final Fight, Poison and Roxy both utilized standing and acrobatic flip kicks {{to attack the}} player. As one of the fighters in Final Fight Revenge, her moveset was expanded heavily, and she was armed with <b>a</b> <b>whip.</b> The whip is used primarily in her Cat Claw and Thunder Whip attacks (which are comparable to Shoryuken/Shinryūken styled attacks, respectively), {{and can be used}} to steal a weapon from the opponent. Additionally, her handcuffs can be thrown as a horizontal projectile move to immobilize the opponent for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Susanna's (Priyanka Chopra) first husband—Edwin Rodriques (Neil Nitin Mukesh), an army major—is overbearing, jealous and possessive. Disabled, he cannot {{believe that}} a {{beautiful}} woman like Susanna would be faithful to him. Uncertain of his sexual potency, he takes out his anger on his wife. Although Susanna endures his mental cruelty, she cannot forgive Edwin for blinding her faithful, mute stableboy (Shashi Malviya) with <b>a</b> <b>whip.</b> Edwin is eliminated during a panther-hunting trip {{with the help of}} Susanna's faithful maid (Usha Uthup), butler (Harish Khanna) and the mute stableboy.|$|E

5|$|The camera tracks {{down to a}} lower {{floor on}} the building, where small kittens are thrown into a woodchipper-type machine to provide the filling for Bart Simpson plush dolls. The toys are then placed into a cart pulled by a sad panda which is driven by a man with <b>a</b> <b>whip.</b> A man {{shipping}} boxes with The Simpsons logo on the side uses the tongue from a severed dolphin head to fasten shut the packages. Another employee uses the horn of a sickly unicorn to smash {{the holes in the}} center of The Simpsons DVDs. The shot zooms out to reveal that sweatshop is contained within a grim version of the 20th Century Fox logo, surrounded by barbed wire, searchlights, and a watchtower.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of Apatosaurus {{are less}} elongated and more heavily constructed {{than those of}} Diplodocus, a diplodocid like Apatosaurus, and {{the bones of the}} leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that Apatosaurus was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The Apatosaurus skull, long thought to be similar to Camarasaurus, is much more similar to that of Diplodocus. Apatosaurus was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, Apatosaurus had air sacs that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as <b>a</b> <b>whip</b> to create loud noises.|$|E
5|$|Traditional series {{items such}} as Bombs used for {{demolition}} and the Bow and Arrow for ranged attacks are available as Link progresses through the game, along with new additions such as a mechanical Beetle that flies to areas beyond Link's reach {{for a variety of}} actions including activating switches; and <b>a</b> <b>whip</b> for grabbing otherwise-unreachable objects and levers. Link's shield takes damage when blocking attacks fail, and may eventually break. Items and equipment can also be optionally upgraded using materials gathered from defeated monsters and within each overworld environment, making them stronger and more durable. In addition to consuming resources, Link must also pay for the upgrade with Rupees, the game's currency which is scattered throughout the world.|$|E

5000|$|Signal whips (or signalwhips) are {{a type of}} single-tailed whip, {{originally}} designed to control dog teams. <b>A</b> signal <b>whip</b> usually measures between 3 and 4 feet in length. Signal whips and snake whips are similar. What distinguishes <b>a</b> signal <b>whip</b> from <b>a</b> snake <b>whip</b> {{is the absence of}} a [...] "fall". A fall is a piece of leather attached {{to the end of the}} body of the <b>whip.</b> In <b>a</b> snake <b>whip,</b> the [...] "cracker" [...] attaches to the fall. In <b>a</b> signal <b>whip,</b> the cracker attaches directly to the body of the whip.|$|R

5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used <b>a</b> <b>whip</b> to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E
5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about his sexual precocity. He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} sexual experience was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used <b>a</b> <b>whip</b> handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E
5|$|It was {{important}} {{to keep track of}} the amount of ice being loaded onto a ship for both commercial and safety reasons, so ice blocks were each weighed before they went onto a ship, and a total tally of the weight of the ice was recorded. Initially a crude method of loading involving ice tongs and <b>a</b> <b>whip</b> was used to lower the separated blocks of ice into the hold, but an improved method was developed by the 1870s involving a levered platform, superseded by a counterweighted platform device by 1890. Ships were loaded quickly to prevent the ice from melting and, in U.S. ports, an average cargo could be loaded in just two days. Freight charges were paid on the intake, or departure, weight of the cargo, and conditions were laid down on the handling of the ice along the route.|$|E

5|$|On December 27, 2016, Nova officially {{signed a}} three-year, $26 million {{contract}} with the Pirates. Nova won the National League's Pitcher of the Month Award for April 2017, after he led the league with an 0.75 WHIP, was second with 36 innings pitched and a 1.50 ERA, and threw two complete games (one shutout). After throwing six shutout innings against the Miami Marlins on June 11, Nova became the first Pirate to throw at least six innings in his first thirteen starts to begin a season since Eddie Solomon in 1981, who did it seventeen times. Nova's streak {{came to an end}} at fifteen starts, after pitching five innings of two run ball in a 6-2 win over the Rays in his sixteenth start of the year. By the All-Star break Nova was 9-6 with a 3.21 ERA in 120⅔ innings, with <b>a</b> <b>WHIP</b> of 1.09.|$|E
5|$|Shantae is a {{platform}} adventure game, in which players play as the eponymous Shantae, a half-genie who must travel across various areas {{in order to}} stop the evil lady pirate Risky Boots. Shantae's default attack involves using her hair like <b>a</b> <b>whip.</b> Shantae can also use gems obtained from defeated enemies to purchase items, such as life-restoring potions and damaging items with various uses, as well as learn upgraded combat moves. The game features five towns, with various areas filled with enemies and obstacles in between them. In order to progress through the game, Shantae must seek out various characters who will open up dungeons, with each dungeon containing a guardian genie that will teach Shantae a new dance. By using these dances, Shantae can transform herself into different animals, including a monkey that can climb on walls, an elephant that can smash objects such as boulders and tree stumps, a spider that can climb across webbing in the background, and a harpy that can fly in mid-air. Shantae must use these abilities to reach new areas or find hidden items.|$|E
5|$|The post of <b>a</b> <b>Whip</b> {{normally}} required {{silence in}} the chamber of the House of Commons, but in February 1976 Dormand {{was involved in a}} difficult situation which required him to give an explanation. The Conservative opposition had called a vote censuring the Secretary of State for Industry Eric Varley by reducing his salary to £1,000. Dormand was appointed as one of the tellers to count the vote, but both he and his Conservative opposite number miscounted and lost the true count. When Mellish announced the confusion to the Speaker, the Speaker agreed to hold another vote. Embarrassingly for Dormand, many Labour MPs had not stayed to hear the result and were no longer present, resulting in the Conservatives winning the vote by a majority of five. The Government decided that the result was not a true indication of the House's opinion and overturned the vote a few days later.|$|E
