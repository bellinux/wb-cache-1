5|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying is an American metalcore {{band from}} San Diego, California. Founded in 2000 by vocalist Tim Lambesis, the {{establishment}} of the band's first full lineup, which included drummer Jordan Mancino, occurred in 2001. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying has released six albums, one split album, and two compilation albums.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying started {{recording}} {{a new album}} titled An Ocean Between Us, which was released on August 21, 2007. Debuting at No.8 on the Billboard 200 and No.1 on the Top Rock chart, with first-week sales of 39,000 units, the album was the highest charting release for the band.|$|E

6000|$|... "Rely on it, proud man," [...] {{answered}} the youth, [...] "that I shall ask none; and although thou speakest <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> already at thy feet, trust me, that <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am determined never to ask thy mercy, so I am not fearful of needing it." ...|$|R

5|$|After {{leaving the}} band Society's Finest, {{in which he}} played guitar, vocalist Tim Lambesis formed <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying in 2000. Starting out as a duet with drummer Jordan Mancino, they first met as a band in February 2001. They both were in the {{hardcore}} punk band Point of Recognition. The band's name came from the novel {{of the same name}} by William Faulkner that was published in 1930; although the band's lyrics and music are not directly inspired by the novel.|$|E

The band played in Europe in the summer to perform with Metallica on the World Magnetic Tour along with Mastodon, while also playing headlining shows of their own and performing at major European festivals. For the final six dates of the tour, Unearth's Buz McGrath filled in for Mark Morton, as he left early to be with his wife and his first child.|$|E

During this period of time Lambesis was also working on music and found time to release the third full length from Austrian Death Machine called Triple Brutal.|$|E

60|$|I {{resisted}} a little, but I {{must confess}} I {{should not have}} resisted him much {{if he had not}} made those promises at all; so after a little struggle, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> still and let him come to bed. When he was there he took me in his arms, and so <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> all night with him, but he had no more to do with me, or offered anything to me, other than embracing me, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> say, in his arms, no, not the whole night, but rose up and dressed him in the morning, and left me as innocent for him <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was the day I was born.|$|R

5|$|Franco had six {{roles in}} 2012 {{none of which}} had much success except the crime-comedy film Spring Breakers, in which he played a gangster to highly {{positive}} reviews. The following year, Franco played the titular role in the fantasy film Oz the Great and Powerful, and the disaster film This Is the End saw him play a fictional version of himself. For the first one, he was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor - Fantasy. Also in 2013, he directed and starred in the drama <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying. He starred in the action thriller Good People (2014), an adaptation of Marcus Sakey's 2008 novel of the same name. In the 2014 controversial satirical comedy The Interview, he {{was seen as a}} journalist instructed to assassinate a North Korean leader. He had nine film releases in 2015, most of which failed financially except the animated film The Little Prince, a modest commercial success.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 2010, {{the actor}} {{acquired}} the rights to Stephen Elliott's The Adderall Diaries, with the intention to adapt, direct, and star in the film. It was announced in January 2011 that the actor has planned to not only star in, but direct himself in The Night Stalker, a film version of author Philip Carlo's book about the 1980s serial killer, Richard Ramirez. Co-screenwriter of the screenplay, Nicholas Constantine, was initially unconvinced that Franco would be right for the movie, until he learned of Franco's {{desire to be a}} director and later watched three of his short films, one of which featured a serial killer, ultimately confirming to the writer that the actor had a darker side. The actor also has plans to direct a film version of William Faulkner's <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying. Dec. 2010: 286–88 The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

The band played shows with labelmates As Cities Burn, mewithoutYou, and Underoath later that month. Touring continued through 2006 as the band shared a national tour with P.O.D. in spring and garnered a spot in the Sounds of the Underground Tour with <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying that summer. In June 2006, Beiser and Harbin stepped down and {{were replaced by}} bassist Dan Eaton and guitarist Jon Terry respectively. The two men had been longtime friends of the band.|$|E

The leopard, as it sprang, threw its full weight on my comrade, here. We had just risen to our feet; and the blow struck me, also, to the ground. I raised that cry <b>as</b> <b>I</b> fell. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> there, immovable. <b>I</b> felt the leopard's paw between my shoulders, and heard its angry growlings; and I held my breath, expecting every moment to feel its teeth in my neck.|$|R

25|$|E: <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors {{tell my parents}} {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
