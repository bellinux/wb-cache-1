40|$|Hydroxyapatite is a salt {{of calcium}} and {{phosphorus}} having the Ca/P ratio as 1. 6. Hydroxyapatite {{is one of}} the major mineral components of the bone due to which it shows excellent biocompatibility. Even though it is biocompatible, hydroxyapatite cannot be used directly in load bearing structures because of its poor mechanical properties. An alternative approach to utilize the biocompatibility of hydroxyapatite is by using it as a coating material. The biocompatibility of hydroxyapatite needs to be complemented by coating it on a substance having desirable mechanical properties. A suitable material for this purpose is medical grade stainless steel, which has been used to make prosthesis, bone fixation screws, guide wires etc. It has been shown that coating medical grade stainless steel (SS 316 L) implants with hydroxyapatite leads to better biocompatibility. For the coating process various techniques can be used. Electrophoretic deposition is a procedure of mild nature not involving extreme temperatures and has the advantage of producing a stoichiometric, uniform coating of the desired thickness. In this study a practical approach to coating was undertaken and a HA and composite HA-Chitosan coating obtained by varying the processing parameters was studied. A coating of HA and composite coating of stoichiometric hydroxyapatite and chitosan were produced on medical grade stainless steel (SS 316 L). Industrially pure chitosan was bought for the coating purposes and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were synthesized by a chemical reaction of calcium nitrate and ammonium phosphate. In the synthesis process of HA nanoparticles the pH was controlled by the addition of ammonium hydroxide. The coating was carried out stainless steel as the cathode and graphite rod as the counter electrode, the distance between electrodes being 2 cm at a current density of 0. 11 <b>Ampere</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> square. The SEM analysis showed that at a constant voltage the coating deposition increases with an increase in the coating time, whereas when the coating time is kept constant, the fineness of the coating increases with an increase in the voltage. From the XRD analysis it was confirmed that the phase purity of chitosan and HA is maintained even after the coating...|$|E

50|$|Permeability is the {{inductance}} {{per unit}} length. In SI units, permeability {{is measured in}} henries <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> (H·m−1 = J/(A2·m) = N A−2). The auxiliary magnetic field H has dimensions current per unit length and is measured in units of <b>amperes</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> (A m−1). The product µ H thus has dimensions inductance times current per unit area (H·A/m2). But inductance is magnetic flux per unit current, so the product has dimensions magnetic flux per unit area, that is, magnetic flux density. This is the magnetic field B, which is measured in webers (volt-seconds) per square-metre (V·s/m2), or teslas (T).|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two common}} {{processes}} for electrowinning the metal: the low current density process, and the Tainton high current density process. The former uses a 10% sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte, with current density of 270-325 <b>amperes</b> <b>per</b> square meter. The latter uses 22-28% sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte with a current density of about 1,000 <b>amperes</b> <b>per</b> square <b>metre.</b> The latter gives better purity and has higher production capacity per volume of electrolyte, {{but has the}} disadvantage of running hotter and being more corrosive to the vessel {{in which it is}} done.

50|$|In {{a vacuum}} and absent a {{magnetic}} field, the electrons would travel with a current density {{of tens of}} <b>amperes</b> <b>per</b> square <b>metre.</b> Because of the downward tilt of the Earth's magnetic field at high latitudes, the area of peak field strength is a U-shaped region to the equatorial side of the nuclear detonation. As shown in the diagram at the right, for nuclear detonations over the continental United States, this U-shaped region is south of the detonation point. Near the equator, where the Earth's magnetic field is more nearly horizontal, the E1 field strength is more nearly symmetrical around the burst location.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{precursor}} powders {{are packed}} into a silver tube which is extruded down in diameter. These are then repacked as multiple tubes {{in a silver}} tube and again extruded down in diameter, then drawn down further in size and rolled into a flat tape. The last step ensures grain alignment. The tapes are then reacted at high temperature to form dense, crystallographically aligned Bi-2223 multifilamentary conducting tape suitable for winding cables or coils for transformers, magnets, motors and generators. Typical tapes of 4 mm width and 0.2 mm thickness support a current at 77 K of 200 A, giving a critical current density (maximal <b>amperes</b> <b>per</b> square <b>metre</b> of cross-sectional area) in the Bi-2223 filaments of 5×105 A/cm2.
