40|$|Abstract. A tournament Tn is an {{orientation}} {{of a complete}} graph on n vertices. A king in a tournament is a vertex from which every other vertex is reachable by a path of length at most 2. <b>A</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence of kings in a tournament Tn is an ordered list of its vertices u 1,u 2, [...] .,un such that ui dominates ui+ 1 (ui → ui+ 1) and ui is a king in the subtournament induced by {uj: i ≤ j ≤ n} for each i = 1, 2, [...] .,n− 1. In particular, if Tn is transitive, searching for <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence of kings in Tn is equivalent to <b>sorting</b> <b>a</b> set of n numbers. In this paper, we try to find <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence of kings in a general tournament by asking the following type of binary question: “What is {{the orientation of the}} edge between two specified vertices u, v? ” The cost for finding <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence of kings is the minimum number of binary questions asked in order to guarantee the finding of <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence of kings. Using an adversary argument proposed in this paper, we show that the cost for finding <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence of kings in Tn is Θ(n 3 / 2) in the worst case, thus settling the order of magnitude of this question. We also showthat the cost for finding a king in Tn is Ω(n 4 / 3) and O(n 3 / 2) inthe worst case. Finally, we show a connection between <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> sequence of kings and a median order in a tournament...|$|R

40|$|What is <b>a</b> <b>sorting</b> {{function}}—not <b>a</b> <b>sorting</b> {{function for}} <b>a</b> given ordering relation, but <b>a</b> <b>sorting</b> function with nothing given? Formulating four basic properties of sorting algorithms as defining requirements, {{we arrive at}} intrinsic notions of sorting and stable sorting: A function is <b>a</b> <b>sorting</b> function if and only it is an intrinsically parametric permutation function. It is <b>a</b> stable <b>sorting</b> function {{if and only if}} it is an intrinsically stable permutation function. We show that ordering relations can be represented isomorphically as inequal-ity tests, comparators and stable sorting functions, each with their own intrinsic characterizations, which in turn provide a basis for run-time monitoring of their expected I/O behaviors. The isomorphisms are parametrically polymorphically de-finable, which shows that it is sufficient to provide any one of the representations since the others are derivable without compromising data abstraction. Finally we point out that stable sorting functions as default representations of ordering relations have the advantage of permitting linear-time sorting algorithms; inequality tests forfeit this possibility...|$|R
