The leaflets had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the Japanese decision-making process. As August 14 dawned, Suzuki, Kido, and the Emperor realized the day would end with either an acceptance of the American terms or a military coup.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to promoting growth of kelp forests, sea otters {{can also have}} <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> in rocky areas that tend {{to be dominated by}} mussel beds. They remove mussels from rocks, liberating space for competitive species and thereby increasing the diversity of species in the area.|$|E

5|$|The war had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on Australian {{society in}} other ways also. Indeed, for many Australians the nation's {{involvement}} {{is seen as a}} symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war. 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low {{with his}} {{daughter}}. The {{loss of his}} wife had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Moore won {{a six-month}} {{travelling}} scholarship which {{he spent in}} Northern Italy studying the great works of Michelangelo, Giotto di Bondone, Giovanni Pisano and several other Old Masters. During this period he also visited Paris, {{took advantage of the}} timed-sketching classes at the Académie Colarossi, and viewed, in the Trocadero, a plaster cast of a Toltec-Maya sculptural form, the Chac Mool, which he had previously seen in book illustrations. The reclining figure was to have <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.|$|E

5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on both on population and urbanisation, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford.|$|E
5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on {{the evolution}} of life on Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's {{experience}} in this war was encouraging in that it had won but also cautionary in that the enemy {{had one of the}} weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 miles from the nearest American harbor. That would have <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on Navy strategy and American foreign policy for next several decades.|$|E

50|$|From {{an early}} age, Réti was preoccupied by {{contemporary}} questions of artistic theory, which he {{also tried to}} explore as a professor. After 1920, particularly, he wrote more articles on these subjects.

5|$|The {{development}} of the TgPVR mouse has had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are susceptible to the virus. In 1999, the World Health Organization approved {{the use of the}} TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine against poliovirus type-3. In 2000, the mouse model was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.|$|E
5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on contemporary theology, particularly {{in the way people}} perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|After {{the birth}} of their daughter, Edith in 1896, Louema {{revealed}} that the father of both Edith and her older brother, Harvey (1893), was C. W. Post. Though Post offered him financial interest in La Vita Inn and his prospective famous breakfast drink, Postum, provided Beilhart he would stay and work at the Inn. Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of his house and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E

50|$|D'Ornano's {{book had}} <b>an</b> equally <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the {{historian}} circles in France. In 1950s Jean Savant, a renowned historian and writer, {{wrote a book}} about Walewska in which he attempted to recreate a scientific biography of Maria Walewska. Before publishing the book, he printed certain extracts from it in Elle, a popular woman's magazine, which resulted in a famous lawsuit from count d'Ornano and his descendants.|$|R

5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals {{in the thirteenth century}} generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E
5|$|Fighting soon erupted between {{elements}} of the Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Army. Although tentative negotiations resumed between the factions, matters took {{a turn for the}} worse when neutralist Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma was arrested during a right-wing coup attempt. U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger then notified the generals that the U.S. government would continue to support Souvanna. This turn of events had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on Laotian politics: First, it affirmed American support for Souvannah, only a few years after the U.S. had denounced him as a tool of the leftists; It also caused the neutralists to shift political allies from the left to the right; Finally, in May 1964, Souvannah announced the political union of the rightists and neutralists against the left.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} {{two and a half}} centuries, Io {{remained}} an unresolved, 5th-magnitude point of light in astronomers' telescopes. During the 17th century, Io and the other Galilean satellites served a variety of purposes, including early methods to determine longitude, validating Kepler's third law of planetary motion, and determining the time required for light to travel between Jupiter and Earth. Based on ephemerides produced by astronomer Giovanni Cassini and others, Pierre-Simon Laplace created a mathematical theory to explain the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede. This resonance was later found to have <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the geologies of the three moons.|$|E
