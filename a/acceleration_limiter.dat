40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{detailed}} {{model of a}} gas turbine for a {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plant. The prime mover is endowed with several controls: first of all, a speed control which can be either droop type or isochronous type according to the status of connection to the distribution grid. An <b>acceleration</b> <b>limiter</b> and an exhaust gases temperature limiter intervene to cut the fuel request, respectively, in case of an excessive rotor acceleration and of a too high temperature of the exhaust gases. A further control regulates inlet guide vanes (IGV) {{in order to keep the}} exhaust temperature almost constant. This is important in a cogeneration plant where the heat recovery from the exhaust gases is used to satisfy the demand of the thermal load. Some validation simulations on a model of cogeneration plant connected to a MV distribution grid are carried out and commente...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 19 th International Conference on Plasma-Surface Interactions in Controlled FusionInternational audienceThe {{transition}} between {{the core and}} scrape-off layer of a tokamak corresponds to a marked momentum shear layer, owing to sheath <b>acceleration</b> on <b>limiters</b> which drives near-sonic flows along the plasma magnetic field in the scrape-off layer, and a parallel shear flow instability can possibly be triggered. The possibility of this instability driven by the velocity gradient is investigated numerically, using a minimum model of particle and parallel momentum transport in {{the edge of a}} tokamak, in a computational domain modelling a limiter plasma with background turbulence modelled as an effective diffusion. It is found that unstable regions can exist in the vicinity of a limiter, in agreement with experimental findings, when momentum radial transport - and therefore coupling between SOL and core flows - is sufficiently weak. Instability is reinforced by core rotation, and is found to be maximum downstream of the limiter (with respect to the core plasma flow) ...|$|R
