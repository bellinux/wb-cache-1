As soon as the French prize crew was removed, Lieutenant Philip Fitz Gibbon, the remaining officer on Ceylon, rehoisted British colours and assumed control of the ship. This allowed Boadicea to sail past the recaptured frigate and engage the French ships directly, reaching Vénus at 16:40. Hamelin recognised that the battered state of his flagship meant {{that he would not}} be able to adequately defend against Rowley's attack and ordered Victor to take news of his defeat back to Port Napoleon. Readying his ship for a token action, Hamelin fired at Boadicea <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> up but was forced to surrender within ten minutes.|$|E

On April 28, 2010, they announced {{that they would be}} leaving long-time coaches Yuri Chesnichenko and Yaroslava Nechaeva to train with Igor Shpilband and Marina Zueva in Canton, Michigan. In September 2010, Bates suffered a complete laceration of his Achilles tendon after Samuelson hit him with her skate blade <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> down from a lift. They missed the entire 2010–11 season as a result. In June 2011, it was reported that they had ended their partnership. On June 28, 2011, Samuelson and Bates confirmed that they had split and said that they were both looking for new partners.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{all their}} coursework, their {{mathematics}} training had not prepared Kay (<b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> {{to be called}} early on at the Moore School) and Fran for their work calculating trajectories for firing tables: they were both unfamiliar with numerical integration methods used to compute the trajectories, and the textbook lent to them to study from (Numerical Mathematical Analysis, 1st Edition by James B. Scarborough, Oxford University Press, 1930) provided little enlightenment. The two newcomers ultimately learned how to perform the steps of their calculations, accurate to ten decimal places, through practice and the advisement of a well-liked supervisor, Lila Todd. A total of about 75 young female computers were employed at the Moore School in this period, many of them taking courses from Adele Goldstine, Mary Mauchly, and Mildred Kramer. Each gun required its own firing table, which had about 1,800 trajectories. Computing just one trajectory required approximately 30–40 hours of handwork with a calculator.|$|E
25|$|In early October 1806, Peterel {{was part}} of a convoy from Jamaica. Near North Edisto she {{encountered}} the French privateer Superbe, of 14 guns and 150 men. The privateer mistook Peterel for a guineaman and attempted to board. Peterel repulsed the attempt and then gave chase as Captain Dominique Houx (or Diron) of Superbe realized his mistake and made his escape. In the skirmish, Lieutenant Maitland of Peterel was killed, and four seamen were wounded. Peterel captured one of the French boarders who reported that a broadside from Peterel had killed some 30 to 40 men on Superbe <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> up to board.

25|$|Howes {{moved to}} the family's country house in Essendon, Hertfordshire for the {{duration}} of World War II. She was a show-business baby who lived a quiet, orderly childhood where she grew up with a nanny and was surrounded by a variety of pets and her parents' theatrical peers, including actor/writer Jack Hulbert and his wife, actress Cicely Courtneidge, who had an adjoining house. Her first taste of the stage was school productions, but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> from a theatrical family, it was inevitable that another family friend, an agent who was visiting the Howes family for dinner, became impressed with her and not long after suggested the young Sally Ann for a role in a movie. Two hundred young girls had already been screen tested without success, and the producers were desperate to find a talented little girl to play the lead, and they asked her father to please rush in some pictures on the recommendation of the agent. The movie, Thursday's Child, was written by playwright and screenwriter Rodney Ackland, also a close neighbour to the Howes family, and it would become Ackland's directorial debut. Thursday's Child (1943) launched her career. A second film, The Halfway House (1944), led to her being put under contract by Michael Balcon of Ealing Studios, and this was followed by many other film roles as a child actress, including Dead of Night (1945) with Sir Michael Redgrave, Pink String and Sealing Wax (1946), Nicholas Nickleby (1947), My Sister and I (1948) and Anna Karenina (1948), with Vivien Leigh.|$|E
500|$|The {{combined}} Franco-Spanish fleet put to sea on 19 October 1805, and by 21 October was {{in sight}} of the British ships. Nelson formed up his lines and the British began to converge on their distant opponents. Contrary to his original instructions, Nelson took {{the lead of the}} weather column in Victory. Concerned for the commander-in-chief's safety in such an exposed position, Henry Blackwood, a long-standing friend of Nelson and commander of the frigate [...] that day, suggested that Nelson come aboard his ship to better observe and direct the battle. Nelson refused, so Blackwood instead tried to convince him to let Harvey come past him in the Temeraire, and so lead the column into battle. Nelson agreed to this, and signalled for Harvey to come past him. As Temeraire drew up towards Victory, Nelson decided that if he was standing aside to let another ship lead his line, so too should Collingwood, commanding the lee column of ships. He signalled Collingwood, aboard his flagship , to let another ship come ahead of him, but Collingwood continued to surge ahead. Reconsidering his plan, Nelson is reported to have hailed the Temeraire, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> up alongside Victory, with the words [...] "I'll thank you, Captain Harvey, to keep in your proper station, which is astern of the Victory". Nelson's instruction was followed up by a formal signal and Harvey dropped back reluctantly, but otherwise kept within one ship's length of Victory as she sailed up to the Franco-Spanish line.|$|E

[...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie {{to get away with}} it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with you is the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow.
