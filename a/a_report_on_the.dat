5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} hull and a gunner and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. <b>A</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E

5|$|Brunner {{retired in}} 1869 at the {{relatively}} young age of 46. He remained {{employed by the}} Nelson Provincial Council as a consultant surveyor and was also head of the Nelson Survey Department. His administration skills were {{not up to the}} latter role and many of the surveys produced under his supervision were of poor quality. He also continued to seek private work and contributed to <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> suitability of the Buller region for settlement and this was published in early 1873. On his retirement in 1869 he had retained his offices of sheriff, returning officer and registration officer but was relieved of these in 1872 in cost-cutting measures by the Nelson Provincial Council. This did not meet with the approval of locals.|$|E
5|$|Cuthbert {{presided over}} the Council of Clovesho in 747 along with Æthelbald of Mercia.

It also mandated that each diocese hold a synod to proclaim the decisions of the council. Cuthbert sent his deacon Cynebert to Pope Gregory III after the council with <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> council and its resolutions. This action may have been taken in response to Boniface's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy. The actions of the council were also gathered into a collection at Cuthbert's command.|$|E
