5000|$|Willie B. once stated, [...] "A blues is <b>about</b> {{something}} <b>that's</b> real. It's <b>about</b> {{what a man}} feels {{when his}} wife leaves him, or <b>about</b> some disappointment <b>that</b> happens {{to him that he}} can't do anything <b>about.</b> <b>That's</b> why none of these young boys can really sing the blues. They don't know <b>about</b> the things <b>that</b> go into a blues".|$|R

5|$|A {{few minutes}} into the expansion, when the {{temperature}} was about a billion (one thousand million) kelvin and the density was <b>about</b> <b>that</b> of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked <b>about</b> <b>that</b> a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|He’s {{had a huge}} role in my career. There’s {{no doubt}} <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I value his opinion. But as a person, Salman has had the biggest impact on my life. I became friends with him when I was young. And his persona is very strong. If I were {{to look back and}} see his impact on my life, it’s been tremendous.|$|E

5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly <b>about</b> <b>that</b> song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, William Barber's {{successor}} {{as chief}} engraver, his son Charles E. Barber, slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins <b>about</b> <b>that</b> time {{suggest that he}} most likely did {{it as part of}} a plan to re-engrave all denominations. The most significant change made by Charles Barber was smoothing the back of the eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles, after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to be honest <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of course, naturally, I don’t {{expect you}} to tell me where it is," [...] said Mr. Chalk, [...] "but I thought it might be {{interesting}} to hear <b>about,</b> <b>that’s</b> all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's that?" [...] he said. [...] "I know a--pretty--woman when I see one, and all I can say is, I don't see {{the young}} man <b>about</b> <b>that's</b> fit for her; but perhaps--you--do, come, perhaps--you-do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{a man who}} was at Nice with us last year," [...] I stammered out, {{trying hard}} to look unconcerned. [...] "A fellow they talked <b>about,</b> <b>that's</b> all." [...] And I turned the subject.|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, Ivan Shishman {{was engaged}} in a war against the voivode of Wallachia, Dan I, between 1384 and 1386. There are few details <b>about</b> <b>that</b> war, only a brief note in the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle that Dan I died 23 September 1386 after being poisoned. The war {{was linked to the}} {{hostilities}} between Ivan Shishman and Ivan Sratsimir (Dan I's uncle), who had the support of the Wallachian rulers and was married to Anna of the House of Basarab.|$|E
5|$|King Thomas, {{raised as}} a member of the Bosnian Church, {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in c. 1445; Stephen Tomašević later stated that he had been baptized into the Roman Catholic Church as a child, and that he had been taught Latin letters. At <b>about</b> <b>that</b> time, likely in order to allow for a peaceful solution to his protracted war with the magnate Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, King Thomas requested from Pope Eugene IV an annulment of his union with Stephen's mother. Open warfare ended in 1446 with the marriage of Stephen's father to Kosača's daughter Catherine, by whom Stephen had a half-brother named Sigismund and a half-sister named Catherine.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 1939, Szilárd and Wigner {{drove in}} Wigner's car to Cutchogue on New York's Long Island, where Einstein was staying. When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not even think <b>about</b> <b>that).</b> Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner wrote it down, and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining what they were doing and why, giving it two weeks to respond if it had any objections.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{asking a}} good many questions, Jake," [...] Andrew went on: [...] "but I'm in the unfortunate {{position}} of having to look after matters I know nothing <b>about.</b> <b>That's</b> a rather remarkable qualification for a director." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Tom Werman and former If manager Lew Futterman. Nugent said about the album, [...] "If anyone {{wanted to know what}} rock 'n roll was all <b>about,</b> <b>that's</b> the only album they'd need".|$|R

5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically <b>about</b> <b>that</b> single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E
5|$|R.I.P. 35E {{and other}} citizens' groups {{continued}} to oppose a direct connection, {{arguing that it}} would be no different from a typical freeway, since drivers {{would be more likely to}} exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route390 (I-35E) to use Route382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at <b>about</b> <b>that</b> time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983.|$|E
5|$|The thing <b>about</b> <b>that</b> song, it's such {{a passionate}} song. I had {{to present it}} in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said one}} of the ladies, the Girton girl, when the squire had {{finished}} the prelate's narrative, [...] "I don't call that much of a story. What was Lady Birkenhead's confession <b>about?</b> <b>That's</b> what one really wants to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When my father, sir," [...] {{she said}} brightly, [...] "tells {{you about my}} being {{interested}} in other people, even though they know nothing about me--which, by the bye, I told you myself--you ought to know how <b>that</b> comes <b>about.</b> <b>That's</b> my father's doing." ...|$|R

5|$|There {{was much}} {{discussion}} {{about what the}} coin should be called—centum, decade, and dime being among the suggestions—before florin was eventually settled upon, {{not because of the}} old English coin of that name, but because the Netherlands had a florin, or gulden, of <b>about</b> <b>that</b> size and value.|$|E
5|$|There's {{something}} special <b>about</b> <b>that</b> first single, {{we were never}} quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
5|$|Amagis keel {{was laid}} down by Mitsubishi in Nagasaki, on 1 October 1942. She was {{launched}} on 15 October 1943 and completed on 10 August 1944. The ship was transferred {{among a number of}} ports on the Inland Sea until she arrived in Kure in February 1945 and was ordered to be camouflaged. Her intended air group, Air Group 601, was committed to the Battle of Iwo Jima <b>about</b> <b>that</b> same time. Amagi was briefly refitted from 10 to 24 February. On 19 March, the ship was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and lightly damaged by one bomb that struck the edge of the flight deck. On 13 April, the ship was permanently moored at an island in Kure harbor and extensively camouflaged.|$|E
