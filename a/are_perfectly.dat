5|$|Patrick Trench (Angus Deayton) – Patrick and {{his wife}} Pippa live next door to Victor, and often catches Victor engrossed in {{seemingly}} preposterous situations, all of which in context <b>are</b> <b>perfectly</b> innocuous. The couple's relationship with their neighbours begins badly after Victor mistakes Patrick and Pippa for distant relations when they arrive outside with three suitcasesnot realising that they are his next-door neighbours, having been on a lengthy holiday from the day Victor and Margaret moved in. Victor subsequently invites the bemused pair to stay; this and later incidents cause Patrick to suspect that Victor is quite insane, possibly bordering on malicious.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they <b>are</b> <b>perfectly</b> entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E

60|$|What is wrong, then? Whatever {{is unlike}} right; {{whatever}} is unlike goodness; whatever is unlike God; that is wrong. And why does God forbid {{us to do}} wrong? Simply because wrong is unlike himself. He <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> beautiful, perfectly blest and happy, because he <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> good; and he wishes to see all his creatures beautiful, blest, and happy: but they can only be so by being perfectly good; and they can only <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> good by being perfectly like God their Father; and they can only <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> like God the Father by being full of love, loving their neighbour as themselves.|$|R

5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as {{the form and}} behavior of the domestic cat is not radically {{different from those of}} wildcats and domestic cats <b>are</b> <b>perfectly</b> capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals <b>are</b> <b>perfectly</b> monogamous, {{meaning that}} they mate for life and take no other {{partners}} (even after the original mate’s death), as with wolves, Eurasian beavers, and otters. There are three types of polygamy: either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights (polygyny), multiple males that females mate with (polyandry), or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females (polygynandry). It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen, which, excluding leks, are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammals. Lek mating occurs in harems, wherein {{one or a few}} males protect their harem of females from other males who would otherwise mate with the females, as in elephant seals; or males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalizations, as in harbor seals.|$|E
5|$|Thrips setipennis is {{the sole}} {{pollinator}} of Wilkiea huegeliana, a small, unisexual annually flowering tree or shrub in the rainforests of eastern Australia. T. setipennis serves as an obligate pollinator for other Australian rainforest plant species, including Myrsine howittiana and M. variabilis. The genus Cycadothrips is a specialist pollinator of cycads, the flowers of which are adapted for pollination by small insects. Thrips are likewise the primary pollinators of heathers in the family Ericaceae, and {{play a significant role}} in the pollination of pointleaf manzanita. Electron microscopy has shown thrips carrying pollen grains adhering to their backs, and their fringed wings <b>are</b> <b>perfectly</b> capable of allowing them to fly from plant to plant.|$|E

After the consumer surplus is considered, it can be shown that the Marshallian deadweight loss is zero if demand <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> elastic or supply <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> inelastic. However, Hicks analyzed the situation through indifference curves and noted that when the Marshallian demand curve <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> inelastic, the policy or economic situation that caused a distortion in relative prices has a substitution effect, i.e. is a deadweight loss.|$|R
