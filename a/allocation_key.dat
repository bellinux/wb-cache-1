40|$|Norway {{has been}} {{characterized}} as a “hesitant reformer” regarding fisheries management. Instead of introducing a fully fledged ITQ-system after {{the crisis in the}} coastal fisheries in 1990, a new Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) system was introduced.

40|$|Calcium is an {{important}} second messenger in eukaryotic cells that regulates many different cellular processes. To elucidate calcium regulation in chloroplasts, we identified the targets of calcium-dependent phosphorylation within the stromal proteome. A 73 kDa protein was identified {{as one of the}} most dominant proteins undergoing phosphorylation in a calcium-dependent manner in the stromal extracts of both Arabidopsis and Pisum. It was identified as TKL (transketolase), an essential enzyme of both the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Calcium-dependent phosphorylation of both Arabidopsis isoforms (AtTKL 1 and AtTKL 2) could be confirmed in vitro using recombinant proteins. The phosphorylation is catalysed by a stroma-localized protein kinase, which cannot utilize GTP. Phosphorylation of AtTKL 1, the dominant isoform in most tissues, occurs at a serine residue that is conserved in TKLs of vascular plants. By contrast, an aspartate residue is present in this position in cyanobacteria, algae and mosses. Characterization of a phosphomimetic mutant (S 428 D) indicated that Ser 428 phosphorylation exerts significant effects on the enzyme’s substrate saturation kinetics at specific physiological pH values.

40|$|SUMMARY In this paper, {{we propose}} to adapt both the {{modulation}} scheme and the transmit {{power in the}} frequency domain using a heuristic evaluation of the bit error rate (BER) for each subcarrier. The proposed method consists in ordering in terms of fading impact, grouping {{a certain number of}} subcarriers and performing local power adaptation in each subcarrier group. The subcarrier grouping is performed in order to equalize the average channel condition of each subcarrier group. Grouping and local power adaptation allow us {{to take advantage of the}} channel variations and to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed power distribution scheme, while avoiding the performance degradation due to the suboptimum power adaptation as much as possible. Compared to the conventional power distribution methods, the proposed scheme does not require any iterative process and the power adaptation is directly performed using an analytical formula. Simulations show a gain in terms of BER performance compared to equal power distribution and existing algorithms for power distribution. In addition, due to the subcarrier group specificity, the trade-off between the computational complexity and the performance can be controlled by adjusting the size of the subcarrier groups. Simulation results show significant improvement of BER performance compared to equal power <b>allocation.</b> <b>key</b> words: OFDM, adaptive modulation, Lagrangian method, global BER optimizatio...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{elements}} of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the principle of ‘relative stability’. Relative stability means that yearly established Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for each fish stock are divided between the Member States of the European Union (EU) according to a fixed <b>allocation</b> <b>key.</b> One way to circumvent the relative stability is the (increasing) practice of swapping quota with other Member States. These swaps have a temporary character, but continuously repeated yearly swaps occur. In recent decades many Member States have shifted resource management responsibilities more towards the industry {{and the process of}} quota swapping is in several Member States managed by Producers Organisations (POs) rather than by government administrations. Networks of fishermen and POs try to establish solid relationships and try to put at the same time stability and flexibility into the system.

However, not all POs and fishermen tend to have (equal) access to the required information for quota swapping which raises questions on how transparent this process is.

A reduced-form, econometric model is derived and historical rural bank {{asset allocation}}s are predicted. Asset equations show consistency with the framework of equilibrium adjustments under uncertainty. Higher expected default rates on variable rate loans result in significant joint effects, which alter a bank's optimal <b>allocation.</b> <b>Key</b> words: agricultural banks, asset allocation, risk, variable-rate loans. Financial market volatility, deposit rate dereg-ulation, and resulting escalation of interest rate risk have necessitated changes in bank manage-ment practices during the 1980 s. Although a di-verse set of banking practices has been devised for reducing exposure to interest rate risk (Toevs and Haney; Kaufman; Sinkey), a primary strat-egy has been to shift interest rate risk to bor-rowers by using variable interest rate loans and other asset repricing arrangements (LaDue and Leatham). While variable-rate lending {{appeared to be a}} highly risk efficient means of managing interest rate uncertainty in the short term, the practice introduced a financial linkage between transfer of rate risk to the borrower and esca-lation of credit (default) risk. The present paper explores that linkage {{and the manner in which}} rural banks adjusted asset portfolios to control their risk exposure. An important implication of the analysis is that higher default rates on vari-able-rate loans have significant joint effects that alter a bank's optimal asset allocation. Increased interest rate risk and derivative credit risk theoretically imply shifts in the mean-vari-ance set of asset returns. Thus banks are ex-pected to make portfolio adjustments in re-sponse to the direct and indirect effects of rate uncertainty.

40|$|Numerous {{analyses}} {{have been}} performed to quantitatively link carbon stock change caused by land-use change (CSC-LUC) to consumption of agricultural products, but results differ significantly, even for studies focussing on the same region or product. This {{is due to the}} different focuses and interpretations of the links between direct drivers and underlying causes of CSC-LUC, which can be translated into differences in key functions, i. e. specific methods, algorithms and parameters embedded in the analysis. Using the example of Indonesian palm oil production (often associated with CSC-LUC), this paper carries out a meta-analysis of 12 existing studies, determines the different settings for the key functions embedded in consumption-based CSC-LUC studies and discussed their implications for policymaking. It identifies the underlying reasons of adopting different settings within the eight key functions and their advantages and trade-offs. Examples are the way of determining how deforestation is linked to oil palm, and the inclusion of non-agriculture and non-productive drivers in the accounting to weight their roles in CSC-LUC in comparison to palm oil consumption. Following that, the quantitative results from the selected studies were processed and harmonised in terms of unit, allocation mechanism, <b>allocation</b> <b>key</b> and amortisation period. This resulting in ranges of 0. 1 - 3. 8 and - 0. 1 - 15. 7 tCO 2 /t crude palm oil for historical and projection studies, respectively. It was observed that CSC-LUC allocated to palm oil is typically lower when propagating effects and non-agricultural or non-productive drivers were accounted for. Values also greatly differ when marginal and average allocation mechanisms were employed. Conclusively, individual analyses only answer part of the question about CSC-LUC drivers and have their own strengths and weaknesses. Since the context can be very different, using quantitative results from a single study for accounting purposes in policymaking is not recommended. Instead, insights from different studies should be combined, e. g. the relative role of logging and oil palm or the contribution to CSC-LUC in regional and global perspectives...|$|E

The introduction of ICPs in healthcare organizations should provide better healthcare to patients and reduce unnecessary variations in practice. While {{there is a huge}} literature on definition, design and managing of an ICP, criteria to select the health problems are lacking. Therefore we aimed to define those prioritization criteria useful to define ICPs in healthcare organizations in Europe. Methods A systematic review was performed in Pubmed, Scopus, CINHAL and Medline web search databases, using a Boolean search by the following mesh terms and free text word: clinical pathway, critical pathway, integrated care pathway, health priority, health problem, health issue and plan. The Delphi technique, as a structured process using a series of questionnaires to gather information, held until group consensus is reached, was applied to select and validate criteria useful for ICPs’ health problems selection. Results Because no articles, dealing with ICP prioritization criteria, were found, a second review was performed, focusing on priority setting of health interventions as a whole. 32 of the 327 articles resulting from the second review were included. Several criteria dealing with different dimensions (eg. feasibility, health distribution, health level, responsiveness, social and financial risk protection) were identified. Then, a Delphi panel, composed by European experts on ICPs implementation, was established. Preliminary results suggest that high priority should be assigned to health care problems characterized by a high need/demand volumes, wired evidences available, social and technological pressure, debate on literature. Conclusions Against the growing interest in ICPs implementation as suitable tools to minimize delays and resource utilization and to maximize quality of care, no universal criteria useful to prioritize and plan ICPs implementation in healthcare organizations are available. Our framework, composed by dimensions, criteria and weights, should assist healthcare organizations’ decision makers in planning activities and resource <b>allocation.</b> <b>Key</b> messages Selection of health problems to be faced through ICPs implementation should be guided by several validated and shared criteria in order to ensure a better answer to health problems. Priority setting in a comprehensive ICP selection has policy implications on resources allocation, strategic planning and overall governance and management, with undoubted effects on equality, too...|$|E
40|$|Our {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} there are large interstate differences {{in the delivery of}} essential nutrition interventions across India, and considerable variability in the estimated costs of delivering these interventions at scale. Additionally, <b>allocations</b> to <b>key</b> ministries, such as the MoHFW and the MoWCD, for nutrition, have been stagnant or have declined over the years. Furthermore, budget allocations for critical public health interventions such as toilets and piped water, are still quite low and will likely be inadequate to cover all families.

40|$|Abstract: In much of India, {{especially}} in the North, son preference is very strong. Newly available technologies now permit at least some families to express this son preference by sex-selective abortion. Son preference is also expressed by the neglect of daughters and the preferential <b>allocation</b> of <b>key</b> household resources to sons. This paper brierly describes the patriarchal context of rural North India which promotes son preference and daughter disfavor, and then presents information on prenatal sex-selection and postnatal sex-selection. The major ethical and public policy implications of both forms of sex-selection in India are reviewed in the conclus 4 on...|$|R
