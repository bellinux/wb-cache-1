40|$|While {{starting}} turbines {{from cold}} and non-cooled-down states rotors are heated quicker than cylinders due to significantly less weight and more intensive interaction with steam {{and the value}} of their differential expansion reaches up to the rated ones in the period of 4 - 5 hours. The investigations have revealed that while using a swirling steam <b>attemperator</b> it is possible to feed steam to turbine seals of the required temperature and at the required time during its variable operational conditions. This methodology makes it possible to save 400 t of specific fuel. In addition to this operational reliability of a power block is increased and a number and cost of repairs is decreased. </p...|$|E
40|$|Previous papers {{proposed}} a fuzzy applied observer(FAO) {{as a solution}} to the nonlinear estimation problem with unmeasurable input. This paper deals with a steam-temperature control(STC) of a once-through boiler using FAO. The STC consists of a final superheater(FSH), a spray <b>attemperator</b> at the FSH inlet, the FAO and two compensators. One object of compensation is delay in the dynamic behavior of steam temperature and the other is the effect of imbalance between disturbances in heat absorption and steam flow. The former is compensated for by state variable feedback and the latter is compensated for using fuzzy control to deviations in the temperature and the ratio of these two disturbances. Simulations are performed to confirm the control. The results show better control performance due to the suitable fuzzy applied observer compared to the uncompensated case...|$|E
25|$|The spacing between {{superheater}} panels has increased. All superheaters are now wide spaced {{to minimize}} fouling. This arrangement, {{in combination with}} sweetwater <b>attemperators,</b> ensures maximum protection against corrosion. With wide spacing plugging of the superheaters becomes less likely, the deposit cleaning is easier and the sootblowing steam consumption is lower. Increased number of superheaters facilitates the control of superheater outlet steam temperature especially during start ups.|$|R
50|$|The early 18th century saw the {{development}} of a popular new style of dark beer in London: Porter. Before 1700, London brewers sent out their beer very young and any aging was either performed by the publican or a dealer. Porter was the first beer to be aged at the brewery and despatched in a condition fit to be drunk immediately. It was the first beer that could be made on any large scale, and the London porter brewers, such as Whitbread, Truman, Parsons and Thrale, achieved great success financially.The large London porter breweries pioneered many technological advances, such as the construction of large storage vats, the use of the thermometer (about 1760), the hydrometer (1770), and <b>attemperators</b> (about 1780).|$|R
2500|$|The modern {{recovery}} boiler is {{of a single}} drum design, with vertical steam generating bank and wide spaced superheaters. This design was first proposed by Colin MacCallum in 1973 in a proposal by Götaverken (now Metso Power inc.) for a large {{recovery boiler}} having a capacity of 4,000,000lb of black liquor solids per day for a boiler in Skutskär, Sweden, but this design was rejected as being too advanced at that time by the prospective owner. [...] MacCallum presented the design at BLRBAC and in a paper [...] "The Radiant Recovery Boiler" [...] printed in Tappi magazine in December 1980. [...] The first boiler of this single-drum design was sold by Götaverken at Leaf River in Mississippi in 1984. [...] The construction of the vertical steam generating bank {{is similar to the}} vertical economizer. Vertical boiler bank is easy to keep clean. The spacing between superheater panels increased and leveled off at over 300 but under 400mm. Wide spacing in superheaters helps to minimize fouling. This arrangement, in combination with sweetwater <b>attemperators,</b> ensures maximum protection against corrosion. There have been numerous improvements in recovery boiler materials to limit corrosion.|$|R

The ignition furnace and sand-bath <b>attemperator</b> of the device form the double insurance to protect the heat in the process of the coal spontaneous combustion reaction, and could guarantee the coal spontaneous combustion reaction process to be simulated scientifically and veritably. With this device, the coal sample of the SHIGANG COAL MINE was experimented to simulate the spontaneous combustion reaction process, proving that the device is feasible. The device can be used in the relevant experiments of coal spontaneous combustion...|$|E
40|$|In an {{era where}} {{cogeneration}} is becoming increasingly attractive, the overall efficiency of the steam power cycle is of primary concern for sugar mills. For turbine alternator sets to operate at their highest efficiency, the inlet steam should be at maximum possible temperature across the load range. This paper begins by investigating the performance of superheaters in industrial watertube boilers for bagasse and coal firing. The relative contributions of the three primary modes of heat transfer in the superheater are then presented for each fuel {{across a range of}} boiler loads. It is shown that for an uncontrolled unscreened superheater, the steam temperature at the outlet varies with the boiler load and that the temperature achieved during coal firing is lower than for bagasse firing. It is beneficial to use a controlled superheater to provide steam at a constant temperature across a range of loads to maximise the power generated from turbine alternator sets. Different <b>attemperator</b> technologies are suggested to control the steam temperature, and two typical systems are described in detail: the mud drum type and the spray type with integral condenser. These two attemperators are compared in the areas of performance, cost and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of critical dynamic events causing thermochemical decomposition of the working fluid in organic Rankine cycle power systems. The case study is the plant of an oil and gas platform where one of the three gas turbines is combined with an organic Rankine cycle unit to increase the overall energy conversion efficiency. The dynamic model of the plant is coupled with a one-dimensional model of the once-through boiler fed by the exhaust thermal power of the gas turbine. The heat exchanger model uses a distributed cross-flow physical topology and local correlations for single- and two-phase heat transfer coefficients. The results indicate that severe load changes (0. 4 – 1. 0 MW s− 1) can lead to exceedance of the temperature limit of fluid decomposition for a period of 10 min. Ramp rates lower than 0. 3 MW s− 1 are acceptable considering the stability of the electric grid and fluid decomposition. It is demonstrated that the use of a spray <b>attemperator</b> can mitigate the problems of local overheating of the organic compound. As a practical consequence, this paper provides guidelines for safe and reliable operation of organic Rankine cycle power modules on offshore installations...|$|E
50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type <b>attemperators.</b> The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the dynamic modeling of 210 MW Industrial Coal Fired Boiler {{which is used}} commonly in thermal power plants. The goal of developing the first principle model is to capture the key dynamical properties of the boiler over a wide operating range. The model describes the complicated dynamics of the various components of Industrial coal fired boiler such as furnace, boiler drum, primary superheater <b>attemperator</b> and secondary superheater. The model is developed based on the physical principles, and {{is characterized by a}} few physical parameters. The parameters are determined from the construction data, and a few of them from the field test data. A strong effort has been made {{to strike a balance between}} fidelity and simplicity. From the modeling point of view, the boiler is divided into five subsystems and for each subsystem, the first principle models are developed using the mass and energy balance equations. The subsystem models are then integrated to obtain the integrated boiler model. Simulation studies are carried out based on the nominal values of the system variables and the parameters collected from a power plant. The integrated boiler model obtained is tested for its dynamic and steady state characteristics and the results of which are described. The model is validated against the unique plant data and the results are presented. The model describes the behaviour of the system over a wide operating range. A good agreement is found between the simulation and actual parameters of the boiler...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{development}} and implementation of a neural network model predictive controller to be used for controlling the integrated recycle heat exchanger (Intrex) in a 300 MW circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler. Discussion of the development of the controller will include data collection and preprocessing, controller design and controller tuning. The controller will be programmed directly into the plant distributed control system (DCS) and does not require the continuous use of any third party software. The intrexes serve as the loop seal in the CFB as well as intermediate and finishing superheaters. Heat is transferred to the steam in the intrex superheaters from the circulating ash which can vary in consistency, quantity and quality. Fuel composition can have a large impact on the ash quality and in turn, on intrex performance. Variations in MW load and airflow settings will also impact intrex performance due to their impact on the quantity of ash circulating in the CFB. Insufficient intrex heat transfer will result in low main steam temperature while excessive heat transfer will result in high superheat <b>attemperator</b> sprays and/or loss of unit efficiency. This controller will automatically adjust to optimize intrex ash flow to compensate for changes in the other ash properties by controlling intrex air flows. The controller will allow the operator to enter a target intrex steam temperature increase which will cause all of the intrex air flows to adjust simultaneously to achieve the target temperature. The result will be stable main steam temperature and in turn stable and reliable operation of the CFB...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} a {{comprehensive}} {{model of a}} fossil fueled power plant (FFPP) is developed in order to evaluate {{the performance of a}} newly designed turbine follower controller. Considering the drawbacks of previous works, an overall model is developed to minimize the error between each subsystem model output and the experimental data obtained at the actual power plant. The developed model is organized in two main subsystems namely; Boiler and Turbine. Considering each FFPP subsystem characteristics, different modeling approaches are developed. For economizer, evaporator, superheater and reheater, first order models are determined based on principles of mass and energy conservation. Simulations verify the accuracy of the developed models. Due to the nonlinear characteristics of <b>attemperator,</b> a new model, based on a genetic-fuzzy systems utilizing Pittsburgh approach is developed showing a promising performance vis-à-vis those derived with other methods like ANFIS. The optimization constraints are handled utilizing penalty functions. The effect of increasing the number of rules and membership functions on the performance of the proposed model is also studied and evaluated. The turbine model is developed based on the equation of adiabatic expansion. Parameters of all evaluated models are tuned by means of evolutionary algorithms. Based on the developed model a fuzzy PI controller is developed. It is then successfully implemented in the turbine follower control strategy of the plant. In this control strategy instead of keeping control parameters constant, they are adjusted on-line with regard to the error and the error rate. It is shown that the response of the system improves significantly. It is also shown that fuel consumption decreases considerably.

40|$|Superheater is for {{generating}} superheated steam from the saturated steam from the evaporator outlet. In {{the case of}} pulverized coal fired boiler, a relatively small amount of ash causes problems with ash fouling on the heating surfaces, including the superheaters. In the convection pass of the boiler, the flue gas temperature is lower and ash deposits can be loose or sintered. Ash fouling not only reduces heat transfer from the flue gas to the steam, but also {{is the cause of}} a higher pressure drop on the flue gas flow path. In the case the pressure drop is greater than the power consumed by the fan increases. If the superheater surfaces are covered with ash than the steam temperature at the outlet of the superheater stages falls, and the flow rates of the water injected into <b>attemperator</b> should be reduced. There is also an increase in flue gas temperature after the different stages of the superheater. Consequently, this leads to a reduction in boiler efficiency. The paper presents the results of computational fluid dynamics simulations of the first stage superheater of both the boiler OP- 210 M using the commercial software. The temperature distributions of the steam and flue gas along the way they flow together with temperature of the tube walls and temperature of the ash deposits will be determined. The calculated steam temperature is compared with measurement results. Knowledge of these temperatures is of great practical importance because it allows to choose the grade of steel for a given superheater stage. Using the developed model of the superheater to determine its degree of ash fouling in the on-line mode one can control the activation frequency of steam sootblowers...|$|E
