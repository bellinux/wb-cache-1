5|$|As the Griffin family {{attend the}} county fair, Stewie announces {{that he has}} bred a winning {{pedigree}} pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to Brian that he got the pig from a parallel universe, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog {{in the same time}} and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed (despite the existence of the Sistine Chapel in that universe), leading an impressed Brian to <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the Griffin family. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no idea how to return home.|$|E

500|$|In 1940, Congress {{enacted the}} Smith Act, making {{it illegal to}} {{advocate}} [...] "the propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force and violence". The statute provided law enforcement a tool to combat Communist leaders. After Eugene Dennis was convicted in the Foley Square trial for attempting to organize a Communist Party, he petitioned for certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted. In Dennis v. United States (1951), the Court upheld the law, 6–2. Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson relied on Holmes' [...] "{{clear and present danger}}" [...] test as adapted by Learned Hand: [...] "In each case [...] must <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> gravity of the 'evil', discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as necessary to avoid the danger."

500|$|In 1946, {{three years}} after Hall's death, Troubridge wanted to include The Well in a Collected Memorial Edition of Hall's works. Peter Davies of the Windmill Press wrote to the Home Office's legal adviser to <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> post-war Labour {{administration}} would allow the book to be republished. Unknown to Troubridge, he added a postscript saying [...] "I am not really anxious to do The Well of Loneliness and am rather relieved than otherwise by any lack of enthusiasm I may encounter in official circles." [...] Home Secretary James Chuter Ede told Troubridge that any publisher reprinting the book would risk prosecution. In 1949 Falcon Press brought out an edition with no legal challenge. The Well has been in print continuously ever since and has been translated into at least 14 languages. In the 1960s it was still selling 100,000 copies {{a year in the}} United States alone. Looking back on the controversy in 1972, Flanner remarked on how unlikely it seemed that a [...] "rather innocent" [...] book like The Well could have created such a scandal.

500|$|In {{the case}} of United States v. Dennis in 1950, Hand made a ruling that {{appeared}} to contradict his Masses decision. By then, a series of precedents had intervened, often based on Oliver Wendell Holmes's [...] "clear and present danger" [...] test, leaving him less room for maneuver. Hand felt he had [...] "no choice" [...] but to agree that threats against the government {{by a group of}} Communists were illegal under the repressive Smith Act of 1940. In order to do so, he interpreted the [...] "clear and present danger" [...] in a new way. [...] "In each case," [...] he wrote, [...] " [...] must <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> gravity of the 'evil', discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger." [...] This formula allowed more scope for curbing free speech in cases where, as the government believed with Communism, the danger was grave, whether it was immediate or not. Critics and disappointed liberals accused Hand of placing his concern for judicial restraint ahead of freedom of speech. Hand confided to a friend that, if it had been up to him, he would [...] "never have prosecuted those birds".|$|E

Ho Chi Minh ACC responded that Flight 370 {{was not supposed to}} enter Cambodian airspace and that they had already contacted Phnom Penh ACC (which controls Cambodian airspace), which had no contact with Flight 370. Kuala Lumpur ACC contacted Malaysia Airlines' operations centre at 02:34, inquiring about the communication status with Flight 370, and were informed that Flight 370 was in a normal condition based on a signal download and that it was located at [...] Later, another Malaysia Airlines aircraft (Flight 386 bound for Shanghai) attempted, at the request of Ho Chi Minh ACC, to contact Flight 370 on the Lumpur Radar frequency—the frequency on which Flight 370 last made contact with Malaysian air traffic control—and on emergency frequencies. The attempt was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|In May 1950, {{one month}} before the appeals court heard oral {{arguments}} in the CPUSA case, the Supreme Court ruled on free speech issues in American Communications Association v. Douds. In that case the Court considered the {{clear and present danger}} test, but rejected it as too mechanical and instead introduced a balancing test. Killian, p 1101. [...] American Communications Association v. Douds 339 U.S. 382 (1950). The federal appeals court heard oral arguments in the CPUSA case on June21–23, 1950. Two days later, on June25, South Korea was invaded by forces from communist North Korea, marking the start of the Korean War; during the two months that the appeals court judges were forging their opinions, the Korean War dominated the headlines. On August1, 1950, the appeals court unanimously upheld the convictions in an opinion written by Judge Learned Hand. Judge Hand considered the clear and present danger test, but his opinion adopted a balancing approach similar to that suggested in American Communications Association v. Douds. Sabin, p 79.

The American Communist Party, of which the defendants are the controlling spirits, is a highly articulated, well contrived, far spread organization, numbering thousands of adherents, rigidly and ruthlessly disciplined, many of whom are infused with a passionate Utopian faith that is to redeem mankind.... The violent capture of all existing governments is one article of the creed of that faith , which abjures the possibility of success by lawful means." ...|$|E

2500|$|For example, {{suppose a}} victim clicks a {{malicious}} phishing link beginning with Facebook.

2500|$|In Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem (2004), the Supreme Court {{drew up a}} {{definition}} of freedom of religion under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, mindful of the overlap with section 2(a). [...] The majority found freedom of religion encompasses a right to religious practices if the individual has a sincere belief that the practice is connected to religion. [...] It would not matter whether the practice was needed according to religious authority. [...] If courts can believe an individual {{is telling the truth}} in saying a practice is connected to religion, the courts then <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> infringement of freedom of religion is severe enough to trigger section 2. [...] The Court also said religious beliefs are vacillating, so courts trying to determine an individual belief should be mindful that beliefs may change. [...] Following this test in Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys (2006), the Court found freedom of religion should protect a non-violent Sikh student's right to wear a kirpan (dagger) in school.|$|E
2500|$|ANC {{rules and}} Mbeki's {{commitment}} {{to the idea of}} party discipline mean that he may not publicly criticise the current government policy that HIV causes AIDS and that antiretrovirals should be provided. Some critics of Mbeki continued to assert that notwithstanding he continued to influence AIDS policy through his personal views behind the scenes, a charge which his office regularly denies. However, in a 2007 published biography [...] "Thabo Mbeki: The Dream Deferred", author Mark Gevisser describes how the president, knowing that he was writing the biography, contacted him earlier in 2007. This was to <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> author had seen a 100-page paper secretly authored by Mr. Mbeki and distributed anonymously among the ANC leadership six years ago.
