5|$|Most {{bands of}} the NWOBHM {{had the same}} look as their fans and {{produced}} rock shows without special visual effects. A notable exception was Iron Maiden, which created the grisly character Eddie the Head as a stage prop to enrich their performances very early in their career. Other exceptions were Demon, Cloven Hoof and Samson, which used various props, costumes and tricks in their shows, while Pagan <b>Altar</b> <b>and</b> Venom became well known for their elaborate scenography inspired by shock rock and Satanism.|$|E

5|$|Structure 86 is to {{the west}} of Structure 32, at {{the western edge of the}} West Group. The first phase of {{construction}} dates to the Early Classic, between 150 and 300 AD, when it took the form of a sunken patio, with stairways descending in the middle of its perimeter walls. At the centre of the patio were placed a clay <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> a stone, around which and across the rest of the patio were deposited an enormous number of offerings consisting of ceramic vessels, mostly from the Solano tradition.|$|E
5|$|The bronze lectern {{was given}} to the College in 1654. The black and white marble paving dates from 1677–78. Except for the pews on the west, dating from 1884, the panelling, stalls and screens are all 17th-century, as are the <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> carved communion rails. Behind the altar is Bernard van Orley's The Carrying of the Cross — a companion-piece to this {{painting}} is in the National Gallery of Scotland. The organ case dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.|$|E
5|$|The choir {{is where}} the priest and/or a choral group sings the psalms.

5|$|The {{church was}} {{assigned}} as a historic monument by decree of 10 September 1913, {{only to have}} its stained glass smashed during a Zeppelin bombardment on 15 January 1915, falling through the roof. General de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on 6 April 1921 at the cathedral. The building experienced extensive damage during World War II, and was partially rebuilt, {{although much of the}} old <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> furnishings were not replaced.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry to}} the vestry {{is located at the}} end of the right side aisle next to the choir; {{at the end of the}} left side aisle is the Chapel for Mercy of God. The {{tabernacle}} is situated on the chapel's altar. The church's main altar is faced with a dark green marble, and houses relics of Saints Andrew, Zenon of Verona, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cosmas, Damian and Anastasia, as well as the Virgin Mary's scarf and a donation from the Diocese of Verona. The ambo—a projection coming out from the soleas—is on the right side of the <b>altar,</b> <b>and</b> is faced with the same marble. Behind the altar, on the wall of the apse, there is a nine-metre high stone crucifix with a three-metre high figure of Christ. Plaster figures depicting the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist by architect Svyatoslav Sakhlebin are located on the left and the right sides (respectively) of the corbels. On the opposite side of the <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> above the cathedral's vestibule is the organ loft, which had originally room for 50choristers; a large part of it is now occupied by the organ.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church has nineteen stained glass windows, three behind the <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> eight along {{each side of the}} church building. The windows behind the altar focus on St. Joseph and depict, from right to left, the sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt; the daily lives of the Holy Family; and the death of Joseph. Four of the sixteen windows {{on the sides of the}} church (those closest to the <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> those closest to the doors) depict lilies. The remaining twelve windows each depict a single saint, including Ignatius of Loyola, Stanislaus Kostka, and Saint Cecilia. Further ornamentation of the walls includes carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross as well as twelve triforiums holding paintings illustrating the Lord's Prayer, the Bread of Life Discourse, and praise to Christ and Mary. On top of the altar, at the eastern end of the church, is a tabernacle. The altar, imported from Germany in 1880, is decorated with statues of Abraham, Peter, Paul, and Melchizedek.|$|E
