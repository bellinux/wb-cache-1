40|$|From the Introduction]. This {{analysis}} highlights potential {{challenges to}} rotation among successive Trio Presidencies {{by the new}} European Council President {{in the provision of}} leadership that accommodates divergent interests in a Union of 27 + members. The relationship between the Trio Presidency and the proposed European Council President is one that must be defined carefully in practice. This is necessary to ensure that the balance of power does not tip to advantage the latter personality {{at the expense of the}} former. Another feature of an increasingly complex institutional system that raises questions in terms of leadership capacity is the position defined in the Lisbon Treaty as the High Representative for Security Policy and Defense. Given all the responsibilities the person in this post inherits, it is necessary to ask if leadership on behalf of the Union is realistically possible to achieve. A corollary observation is that omni directional (tous <b>azimuts)</b> bilateral arrangements, often referenced in the literature as 'multiple bilateralism,' occur with greater frequency in a larger Union. This analysis draws the implications of these experiences for leadership in Europe’s transnational polity...|$|R
40|$|Este trabajo explora la utilidad del mapeo de lineamientos sobre mapas de relieve sombreado producidos con {{software}} para análisis de imágenes satelitales a partir de modelos de elevación digital (DEM) de 3 segundos de resolución espacial. La zona de estudio se ubica entre 39 °S y 39 ° 30 'S y entre 71 °W y 71 ° 30 'W y se utilizaron tres mapas de relieve sombreado con luz incidente a 45 º de la horizontal y <b>azimuts</b> de 120 º, 240 ° y 360 °. Tres operadores mapearon lineamientos de manera independiente en las diferentes imágenes con el resultado de nueve mapas independientes. Sólo los lineamientos mapeados en {{al menos}} 2 mapas de relieve sombreado por al menos dos operadores o por los tres operadores en al menos una de las imágenes fue considerado un lineamiento reproducible, de esta manera se obtuvieron 23 lineamientos. Las tendencias obtenidas son 55 °, 106 °, 140 °, y 153 °. Estos lineamientos fueron contrastados con lineamientos mapeados en una imagen GeoCoverT (Mosaico Ortorrectificado Comprimido de imágenes Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper), en la hoja geológica 1 : 200. 000 (SEGEMAR) y en mapas topográficos 1 : 50. 000 (IGM). Algunos lineamientos claramente identificables a partir del DEM no se distinguieron en los mapas geológicos o topográficos ni en la imagen Landsat. Los autores consideran que existen ciertas ventajas del uso de modelos de elevación digital para el mapeo de lineamientos regionales: 1) Los usuarios pueden controlar el ángulo de incidencia de la luz y su azimut; 2) La escala de trabajo puede ser cambiada todas las veces que sea necesario; 3) A diferencia de las fotografías aéreas, los datos satelitales no tiene ningún tipo de deformación y no muestra influencia de rasgos antropogénicos o interferencia de la vegetación en la interpretación. Otra importante ventaja del DEM SRTM 3 V 2 y la imagen GeoCoverT usada en este caso es que se trata de datos de acceso gratuito y que cubren casi la totalidad de la Tierra. La correlación entre lineamientos obtenidos con la técnica presentada y geología, fallas y fracturas sugiere que los DEM pueden ser un componente importante en el mapeo geológico. Sin embargo, los lineamientos regionales obtenidos deben ser contrastados con la información estructural obtenida en el campo. This paper explores {{the usefulness of}} mapping lineaments with shaded relief maps produced by satellite image analysis software from Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of three seconds spatial resolution. The area of study is located between 39 ºS and 39 º 30 ´S and between 71 ºW and 71 º 30 'W and three shaded relief maps were use with incident light at 45 º from the horizontal and azimuths of 120 º, 240 º and 360 º. Three operators mapped lineaments separately in the different images obtaining a result of nine independent maps. Reproducible lineaments were considered only those mapped {{in at least two}} shaded relief maps by at least two operators or by three operators in at least one image, in the end 23 lineaments were obtained. The tendencies observed were 55 º, 106 º, 140 º and 153 º. These lineaments were compared with lineaments mapped in a GeoCoverTM Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Imagery ortorrectified compressed mosaic, in the geologic map 1 : 200. 000 (SEGEMAR) and in topographic maps 1 : 50. 000 (IGM). Some lineaments that were clearly identified with the DEM were not observed in the geological and topographic maps or in the Landsat imagery. The authors consider there are certain advantages in applying digital elevation models in the mapping of regional lineaments: 1) the users can control the incident angle and its azimuth; 2) The working scale can be change as needed; 3) in contrast to aerial photography, the satellite data have no deformation and it doesn't show any kind influences with anthropologic features or interference in the interpretation due to vegetation. Another advantage of the DEM (SRTM 3 V 2) and the GeoCoverT image used in this procedure is that the data is for free access and almost cover all the Earth. The correlation between the presented technique and geology, faults and fractures suggest that DEM can be a very important component in the geological mapping. The obtained lineaments must be checked with the structural information obtained in the field to be validated...|$|R
