This model depicts a complicated boundary structure of target samples distribution in a high-dimensional space. In this case, each kind of target constructs its own compact coverage area.

Before use in rice breeding, the eating and cooking properties of Australian wild rice must first be understood as these are key factors in determining rice quality and consumer <b>acceptance.</b> <b>Samples</b> of Australian wild rice (taxa B) were collected and evaluated together with a commercial Canadian wild rice (Zizania aquatic L.), Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare, and selected commercial rices including long grain, medium grain, basmati, red basmati, and red rice. Cooking profiles were established, physical traits were measured and conventional descriptive analysis techniques were used to compare the sensory properties of the unpolished rices. Twenty six descriptors, together with definitions, were developed with a panel of twelve experienced assessors including aroma, flavour, texture and aftertaste attributes. Results reveal that the Australian wild rice had a mild aroma and flavour similar to that of red rice and red basmati but without the lingering aftertaste. In terms of texture, the wild rice was firmer, and somewhat crunchy and chewy rather than soft and fluffy despite requiring a longer cooking time. The sensory, physical and cooking profiles indicate that Australian wild rice has a high potential for commercialization in itself and provides a suitable genetic source for breeding programs, particularly in the coloured rice market...|$|R

In 2004 the Smith inquiry made the following statement:"There is much concern and debate about the positioning of Statistics and Data Handling within the current mathematics GCSE, where it occupies some 25 per cent of the timetable allocation. On the one hand, there is widespread agreement that the Key Stage 4 curriculum is over-crowded and that the introduction of Statistics and Data Handling may {{have been at the}} expense of time needed for practising and acquiring fluency in core mathematical manipulations. Many in higher education mathematics and engineering departments take this view. On the other hand, there is overwhelming recognition, shared by the Inquiry, of the vital importance of Statistics and Data Handling skills both for a number of other academic disciplines and in the workplace. The Inquiry recommends that there be a radical re-look at this issue and that much of the teaching and learning of Statistics and Data Handling would be better removed from the mathematics timetable and integrated with the teaching and learning of other disciplines (e.g. biology or geography). The time restored to the mathematics timetable should be used for acquiring greater mastery of core mathematical concepts and operations." ...|$|E
