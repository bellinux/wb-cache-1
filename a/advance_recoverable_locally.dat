40|$|Three {{science and}} {{engineering}} problems of recent interests -index coding, <b>locally</b> <b>recoverable</b> distributed storage, and guessing games on graphs- are discussed and the connection between their optimal solutions is elucidated. By generalizing recent results by Shanmugam and Dimakis and by Mazumdar on the complementarity between the optimal broadcast rate of an index coding problem on a directed graph and the normalized rate of a <b>locally</b> <b>recoverable</b> distributed storage problem on the same graph, it is shown that the capacity region and the optimal rate region of these two problems are complementary. The main ingredients in establishing this result are the notion of confusion graph introduced by Alon et al. (2008), the vertex transitivity of a confusion graph, the characterization of the index coding capacity region via the fractional chromatic number of confusion graphs, and the characterization of the optimal rate region of the <b>locally</b> <b>recoverable</b> distributed storage via the independence number of confusion graphs. As {{the third and final}} facet of the complementarity, guessing games on graphs by Riis are discussed as special cases of the <b>locally</b> <b>recoverable</b> distributed storage problem, and it is shown that the winning probability of the optimal strategy for a guessing game and the ratio between the winning probabilities of the optimal strategy and a random guess can be characterized, respectively, by the capacity region for index coding and the optimal rate region for distributed storage.

40|$|Abstract—Source coding is {{concerned}} with optimally com-pressing data, {{so that it can}} be reconstructed up to a specified distortion from its compressed representation. Usually, in fixed-length compression, a sequence of n symbols (from some alpha-bet) is encoded to a sequence of k symbols (bits). The decoder produces an estimate of the original sequence of n symbols from the encoded bits. The rate-distortion function characterizes the optimal possible rate of compression allowing a given distortion in reconstruction as n grows. This function depends on the source probability distribution. In a <b>locally</b> <b>recoverable</b> decoding, to reconstruct a single symbol, only a few compressed bits are accessed. In this paper we find the limits of local recovery for rates near the rate-distortion function. For a wide set of source distributions, we show that, it is possible to compress within of the rate-distortion function such the local recoverability grows as Ω(log (1)); that is, in order to recover one source symbol, at least Ω(log (1 bits of the compressed symbols are queried.

Like classical MDS codes, optimal locally repairable codes carry some very nice combinatorial structures. Since introduction of the Singleton-type bound for locally repairable codes, people have put tremendous effort on constructions of optimal locally repairable codes.

We refer to such actions as deconstruction operations and protocols implementing them as state deconstruction protocols. State deconstruction generalizes Landauer erasure of a single-party quantum state as well the erasure of correlations of a two-party quantum state. We find that the deconstruction cost of a tripartite quantum state on systems $ABE$ is equal to its conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI) $I(A;B|E) $, thus giving the CQMI an operational interpretation in terms of a state deconstruction protocol. We also define a related task called conditional erasure, in which the goal is to apply noise to systems $AE$ in order to decouple system $A$ from systems $BE$, while causing negligible disturbance to the marginal state of systems $BE$. We find that the optimal rate of noise for conditional erasure is also equal to the CQMI $I(A;B|E) $. State deconstruction and conditional erasure lead to operational interpretations of the quantum discord and squashed entanglement, which are quantum correlation measures based on the CQMI. We find that the quantum discord is equal to the cost of simulating einselection, the process by which a quantum system interacts with an environment, resulting in selective loss of information in the system. The squashed entanglement is equal to half the minimum rate of noise needed for deconstruction/conditional erasure if Alice has available the best possible system $E$ to help in the deconstruction/conditional erasure task.
