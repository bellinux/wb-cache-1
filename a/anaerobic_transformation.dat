40|$|The anoxic and <b>anaerobic</b> sulfur <b>transformation</b> {{pathways}} in a laboratory-scale sewer receiving nitrate were investigated. Four reactors {{in series}} {{were employed to}} imitate a rising main sewer. The nitrate-dosing strategy was effective in controlling sulfide, as confirmed by the long-term sulfide measurements. Anoxic sulfide oxidation occurred in two sequential steps, namely the oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur (S(0)) and the oxidation of S(0) to sulfate (SO(4) (2 -)). The second oxidation step, which primarily occurred when {{the first step was}} completed, had a rate that is approximately 15 % of the first step. When nitrate was depleted, sulfate and elemental sulfur were reduced simultaneously to sulfide. Sulfate reduction had a substantially higher rate (5 times) than S(0) reduction. The relatively slower S(0) oxidation and reduction rates implied that S(0) was an important intermediate during anoxic and <b>anaerobic</b> sulfur <b>transformation.</b> Electron microscopic studies indicated the presence of elemental sulfur, which was at a significant level of 9. 9 and 16. 7 mg-S/g-biomass in nitrate-free and nitrate-exposed sewer biofilms, respectively. A conceptual sulfur transformation model was established to characterize predominant sulfur transformations in rising main sewers receiving nitrate dosage. The findings are pertinent for optimizing nitrate dosing to control sulfide in rising main sewers...|$|R

However, using fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) probing to analyse microbial populations, {{we have shown}} evidence opposing this widespread belief. We describe the phosphorus (P) removing performance and microbial population analyses of sludges obtained in a laboratory scale EBPR reactor. Two sludges with extremely high P removing capabilities were examined, the P content of these sludges was 8. 6 percent (P sludge) and 12. 3 percent (S sludge) of the MLSS. Identification of bacteria using FISH probing indicated both sludges were dominated by microbes from the beta proteobacteria and high mol percent G+C Gram positive bacteria. Acinetobacter could make up only a small proportion of the cells in these sludges. Sludge with extremely poor P removal (P content of 1. 5 percent, referred to as T sludge) was then generated by reducing the P in the influent. Bacteria resembling the G-bacteria became abundant in this sludge and these were identified using FISH probing. The <b>anaerobic</b> <b>transformations</b> of the T and P sludges correlated well with that of the non-EBPR and EBPR biological models respectively, indicating that bacteria in the T sludge have the potential to inhibit P removal in EBPR systems...|$|R

A Dehalococcoides spp. -containing, sediment-enrichment dechlorinated PCE rapidly to ethene (ETH) but slowly and incompletely dechlorinated TeCA. Moreover, when present in mixture with PCE, TeCA disrupted the ability of Dehalococcoides to dechlorinate vinyl chloride.

Here, we report on aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> microbial nitrogen <b>transformation</b> processes that co-occur within millimetre-sized cyanobacterial aggregates (Nodularia spumigena) collected in aerated surface waters in the Baltic Sea. Microelectrode profiles showed steep oxygen gradients inside the aggregates {{and the potential for}} nitrous oxide production in the aggregates' anoxic centres. N- 15 -isotope labelling experiments and nutrient analyses revealed that N- 2 fixation, ammonification, nitrification, nitrate reduction to ammonium, denitrification and possibly anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) can co-occur within these consortia. Thus, N. spumigena aggregates are potential sites of nitrogen gain, recycling and loss. Rates of nitrate reduction to ammonium and N- 2 were limited by low internal nitrification rates and low concentrations of nitrate in the ambient water. Presumably, patterns of N-transformation processes similar to those observed in this study arise also in other phytoplankton colonies, marine snow and fecal pellets. Anoxic microniches, as a pre-condition for <b>anaerobic</b> nitrogen <b>transformations,</b> may occur within large aggregates (>= 1 mm) even when suspended in fully oxygenated waters, whereas anoxia in small aggregates (= 0. 1 mm) may only arise in lowoxygenated waters (1. 5 mu M), O- 2 -depleted water layers, for example, in the chemocline of the Baltic Sea or the oceanic mesopelagic zone, aggregates may promote N-recycling and -loss processes...|$|R

Here we used a multidisciplinary strategy (site geochemistry, laboratory biodegradation assays, and field extraction of molecular biomarkers) to deduce an ongoing linkage between aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation and nitrogen cycling in a contaminated subsurface site. Three site wells were monitored over a 10 -month period, which revealed fluctuating concentrations of nitrate, ammonia, sulfate, sulfide, methane, and other constituents.

The accumulated evidence points at a major role of electron shuttles in the redox conversion of several distinct contaminants, both by chemical and biological mechanisms. Many microorganisms are capable of reducing redox mediators linked to the anaerobic oxidation of organic and inorganic substrates. Electron shuttles can also be chemically reduced by electron donors commonly found in anaerobic environments (e. g. sulfide and ferrous iron). Reduced electron shuttles can transfer electrons to several distinct electron-withdrawing compounds, such as azo dyes, polyhalogenated compounds, nitroaromatics and oxidized metalloids, among others. Moreover, reduced molecules with redox properties can support the microbial reduction of electron acceptors, such as nitrate, arsenate and perchlorate.

40|$|Propionate, {{a carbon}} {{substrate}} abundant in many prefermenters, {{has been shown}} in several previous studies to be a more favorable substrate than acetate for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). The anaerobic metabolism of propionate by polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) is studied in this paper. A metabolic model is proposed to characterize the <b>anaerobic</b> biochemical <b>transformations</b> of propionate uptake by PAOs. The model is demonstrated to predict very well the experimental data from a PAO culture enriched in a laboratory-scale reactor with propionate as the sole carbon source. Quantitative fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis shows that Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis, the only identified PAO to date, constitute 63 % of the bacterial population in this culture. Unlike the anaerobic metabolism of acetate by PAOs, which induces mainly poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) production, the major fractions of poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA) produced with propionate as the carbon source are poly-beta-hydroxyvalerate (PHV) and poly-beta-hydroxy- 2 -methylvalerate (PH 2 MV). PHA formation correlates very well with a selective (or nonrandom) condensation of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA molecules. The maximum specific propionate uptake rate by PAOs found in this study is 0. 18 C-mol/C-mol-biomass h, which is very similar to the maximum specific acetate uptake rate reported in literature. The energy required for transporting 1 carbon-mole of propionate across the PAO cell membrane is also determined to be similar to the transportation of 1 carbon-mole of acetate. Furthermore, the experimental results suggest that PAOs possess a similar preference toward acetate and propionate uptake on a carbon-mole basis. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

Studies with [14 C]CT suggested that a portion of the transformed CT reacted with biomass to form unidentified soluble and insoluble products. Intermediate production of a trichloromethyl radical can explain observed product distribution without significant CO 2 formation. Evidence suggests that respiratory c-type cytochromes are responsible for the dehalogenation ability of S. putrefaciens 200.

In one of these locations, in the Ebro River sediment, HCB dechlorination could be linked to Dehalococcoides species growth and activity by 16 S rRNA-based molecular methods. Furthermore, HCB dechlorination activity in this sediment was found over the full range of ambient temperatures that this sediment can be exposed to during different seasons throughout the year. The sediment contained several reductive dehalogenase (rdh) genes, and analysis of their transcription revealed the dominance of cbrA, previously shown to encode a trichlorobenzene reductive dehalogenase. This study investigated the role of Dehalococcoides spp. in HCB dechlorination in river sediments and evaluated if the current knowledge of rdh genes could be used to assess HCB bioremediation potentia...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies on}} the {{microbial}} metabolism of nitroaromatic compounds have used pure cultures of aerobic microorganisms. In many cases, attempts to degrade nitroaromatics under aerobic conditions by pure cultures result in no mineralization and only superficial modifications of the structure. However, mixed culture systems properly operated result in the transformation of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) {{and in some cases}} mineralization of TNT occurs. In this paper, the mixed culture system is described with emphasis on intermediates and the characteristics of the aerobic microbial process including the necessity for a co-substrate. The possibility of removing TNT under aerobic/anoxic conditions is described in detail. Another option for the biodegradation of TNT and nitroaromatics is under anaerobic, sulfate reducing conditions. In this instance, the nitroaromatic compounds undergo a series of reductions with the formation of amino compounds. TNT under sulfate reducing conditions is reduced to triaminotoluene presumably by the enzyme nitrite reductase, which is commonly found in many Desulfovibrio spp. The removal of nitro groups from TNT is achieved by a series of reductive reactions with the formation of ammonia and toluene by Desulfovibrio sp. (B strain). These metabolic processes could be applied to other nitroaromatic compounds like nitrobenzene, nitrobenzoic acids, nitrophenols, and aniline. The data supporting the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> of TNT under different growth condition are reviewed in this report...|$|E
40|$|Almost 40 % of {{the total}} waste {{produced}} in developing countries is made of biodegradable waste. Typically the waste including the biodegradable portion is transported to the so-called landfills without any segregation process, treatment and utilization in advance. Although mitigation practices such as source reduction, reuse and recycle are essential and required to be practiced in any integrated waste management plan, {{one of the best}} approaches to reduce the volume of the waste goes to the landfills is biological transformation. Biological transformation of waste occurs in two major categories; aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. <b>Anaerobic</b> <b>transformation</b> of biodegradable waste produces methane gas (CH 4) which is the valuable source of energy. At first the gas has some impurities such as CO 2 and other trace materials which are required to be removed from the main stream before utilization. In addition to methane, the byproduct of the anaerobic process is slurry that can be used as soil amendment agent. It contains several vital elements such as nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (N, P and K) for crops. The quality of slurry is required to be assessed since it affects the soil conditions and plants growth. In this study the importance of biological transformation in waste management systems has been discussed. Different methods and significant factors in methane production via anaerobic digestion have bee...|$|E
40|$|Aerobic {{enrichment}} cultures from contaminated groundwaters dechlorinated trichloroethylene (TCE) (14. 6 mg/liter; 111 mumol/liter) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) (16. 2 mg/liter; 98 mumol/liter) reductively within 4 {{days after}} the transition from aerobic to <b>anaerobic</b> conditions. The <b>transformation</b> products were equimolar amounts of cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene and traces of 1, 1 -dichloroethylene. No other chlorinated product and no methane were detected. The change was accompanied by the release of sulfide, which caused {{a decrease in the}} redox potential from 0 to - 150 mV. In sterile control experiments, sulfide led to the abiotic formation of traces of 1, 1 -dichloroethylene without cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene production. The reductive dechlorination of PCE via TCE depended on these specific transition conditions after consumption of the electron acceptor oxygen or nitrate. Repeated feeding of TCE or PCE to cultures after the change to anaerobic conditions yielded no further dechlorination. Only aerobic subcultures with an air/liquid ratio of 1 : 4 maintained dechlorination activities; anaerobic subcultures showed no transformation. Bacteria from noncontaminated sites showed no reduction under the same conditions...|$|R
40|$|In eubacteria, the tRNA transglycosylase (Tgt) in {{specific}} tRNAs exchanges a guanine in the anticodon for 7 -aminomethyl- 7 -deazaguanine, which is finally converted to queuosine. The tgt gene of Escherichia coli has been mapped at 9 min on the genome, and mutant pairs containing an intact or mutated tgt allele were obtained after transduction of the tgt locus by P 1 bacteriophages into a genetically defined E. coli strain (S. Noguchi, Y. Nishimura, Y. Hirota, and S. Nishimura, J. Biol. Chem. 257 : 6544 - 6550, 1982). These tgt mutants grew anerobically with fumarate as an electron acceptor, while nitrate or trimethylamine N-oxide {{could not be}} reduced. Furthermore, molybdate reductase activity was almost lacking and the characteristic absorption maxima, corresponding to cytochrome a 1 and the cytochrome d complex, were not detectable in low-temperature reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectra in anaerobically grown cells. Transduction of the mutated tgt locus into another E. coli recipient resulted in tgt mutants without <b>anaerobic</b> defects. <b>Transformation</b> of the original tgt mutants with an fnr gene-containing plasmid reversed the anaerobic defects. Clearly, the original tgt mutants harbor a second mutation, affecting the anaerobic regulator protein Fnr. The results suggest that fnr is involved in anaerobic control of components of the cytochrome d complex and of the redox system that transfers electrons to molybdate. F' plasmids containing a fused lacI-lacZ gene with the nonsense codon UAG at different positions in the lacI part were transferred to E. coli strains with a mutated or nonmutated tgt locus but intact in fnr. A twofold increase {{in the frequency of}} incorrect readthrough of the UAG codon, dependent on the codon context, was observed in the tgt mutant and is suggested to be caused by a tRNA(Tyr) with G in place of queuosine...|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{combination}} of fundamental and applied research efforts to assess and develop advanced remediation technologies for the remediation of TNT and RDX contaminated materials. Three noteworthy advancements are included in this presentation. ^ The first ever demonstration of reductive transformation of 1, 3, 5 -hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitrotriazine (RDX) in a simulated groundwater aquifer is shown. Remediation of groundwater contaminated with high explosives is still limited to traditional pump and treat technologies using activated carbon for physical removal of contaminants. Pump and treat technology is insufficient to meet the long-term remediation goals set by the federal government. This study also correlates changes in contaminant profile with resulting toxicity and screening level bioassays and shows that RDX metabolites exert lower toxicity in HepG 2 cell viability assays and in Vibrio fisheri using commercial bacterial bioluminescence assays. ^ Second, a treatability assessment of slurry phase 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) concentrations exceeding 8000 ppm examined the feasibility of biological remediation. Most previous efforts demonstrating <b>anaerobic</b> reductive <b>transformation</b> of TNT in slurry systems attained successful remediation only at contaminant concentrations less than 100 ppm. Further, the effort resulted in significant closure to the 14 C-TNT mass balance using innovative radiotracer procedures. ^ Finally, the development of needed parameters and an application protocol for noninvasive remediation of TNT in soil is presented. The topical application of lime to explosives-contaminated soil may provide an effective and economical method to manage lands containing dispersed explosives and energetic contaminants. The long-term development of a low impact technology using remote capability for 2, 4, 6 -trinitotoluene remediation in soil corresponds directly to source control needs inherent in sustainable army training range needs for the foreseeable future. ...|$|R
