5|$|The Prosaurolophus-Saurolophus clade {{has been}} a {{problematic}} grouping when trying to place among hadrosaurines. Many skull features are similar to Edmontosaurus, while other <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Gryposaurus, so the group has been classified as close to both. However, the clade might be closer to Edmontosaurus, as the features are more numerous uniting them.|$|E

For active flight, the white-bellied sea eagle alternates strong deep wing-beats with short periods of gliding.|$|E

The ballet was revived again in 1924 with scenery and costumes by Alexandre Benois.

5|$|In Inner Mongolia, {{official}} language policy divides the Mongolian language into three dialects: Southern Mongolian, Oirat, and Barghu-Buryat. Southern Mongolian {{is said to}} consist of Chakhar, Ordos, Baarin, Khorchin, Kharchin, and Alasha. The authorities have synthesized a literary standard for Mongolian in whose grammar {{is said to be}} based on Southern Mongolian and whose pronunciation is based on the Chakhar dialect as spoken in the Plain Blue Banner. Dialectologically, however, western Southern Mongolian dialects <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Khalkha than they are to eastern Southern Mongolian dialects: for example, Chakhar is closer to Khalkha than to Khorchin.|$|E
5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, The New Testament in the Original Greek (1881), and it was the basis for their text. All critical editions of the New Testament published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus was the basis for the translation.|$|E
5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because areas that <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the equator {{have a greater}} amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

5|$|The four {{terrestrial}} or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, {{few or no}} moons, and no ring systems. They {{are composed}} largely of refractory minerals, such as the silicates, which form their crusts and mantles, and metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet {{should not be confused}} with inferior planet, which designates those planets that <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).|$|E
5|$|Transcription in archaea {{more closely}} resembles {{eukaryotic}} than bacterial transcription, with the archaeal RNA polymerase being {{very close to}} its equivalent in eukaryotes; while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and eukaryal equivalents. Although archaea only have one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in transcription seems {{to be close to}} that of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, with similar protein assemblies (the general transcription factors) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter. However, other archaeal transcription factors <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 28 February, a curfew was imposed in 27 towns and cities {{of the state in}} an attempt to curb the violence. Over the next two days, Bharuch, Rajkot and later Surat were hit. Approximately 151 towns and 993 villages in 16 of the state's 25 districts were {{affected}} by the post-Godhra violence, which was particularly severe in six districts. The violence raged heavily between 28 February and 3 March 2002, slowed briefly, then restarted on 15 March and continued until mid-June. Northern and central Gujarat and the north-eastern tribal beltwhich <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Godhra Citywere the worst affected while Saurashtra and Kutch remained relatively peaceful. 1,000 army troops were flown in by {{the evening of}} 1 March to restore order. Intelligence officials alleged that the state government deliberately delayed the deployment. On 3 May, former Punjab police chief Kanwar Pal Singh Gill was appointed as security adviser to Modi. The Gujarat government transferred several senior police officers, who had taken steps to contain and investigate violent attacks, to administrative positions.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the early}} results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the {{discovery}} of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60, and 100μm, and came from within an angular radius of 10arcseconds (10″) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80astronomical units (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension {{on the order of}} a millimeter, as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting–Robertson drag. The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the star.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{invariably}} salty and, {{although its}} degree of saltiness (salinity) can vary, about 90% {{of the water}} in the ocean has 34– (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%. To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the South <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> 35‰. The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%. Other solutes include metal ions such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (SO₄), carbonate (CO₃), and bromides. In the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it is much too saline; similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated. For scientific and technical purposes, a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used.|$|E
5|$|This spotted cat {{most closely}} resembles the leopard physically, {{although}} it is usually larger and of sturdier build and its behavioral and habitat characteristics <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> those of the tiger. While dense rainforest is its preferred habitat, the jaguar will range {{across a variety of}} forested and open terrains. Its preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions, but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts. The jaguar is notable, along with the tiger, as a feline that enjoys swimming. The jaguar is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush predator {{at the top of the}} food chain (an apex predator). It is a keystone species, playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating the populations of the animals it hunts. The jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite, even relative to the other big cats. This allows it to pierce the shells of armored reptiles and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of prey between the ears to deliver a fatal bite to the brain.|$|E
