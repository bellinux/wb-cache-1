50|$|On 30 November, JAXA {{announced}} that control and communication with Hayabusa had been restored, but a problem remained with the craft's reaction control system, perhaps involving a frozen pipe. Mission control was working {{to resolve the}} problem before the craft's upcoming launch window for return to Earth. On December 6, Hayabusa was 550 km from Itokawa. JAXA {{held a press conference}} about the situation so far. On 27 November, the probe experienced a power outage when trying <b>altitude</b> <b>correction,</b> probably due to a fuel leakage. On 2 December, an <b>altitude</b> <b>correction</b> was attempted, but the thruster did not generate enough force. On 3 December, the probe's Z-axis was found to be 20 to 30 degrees from the Sun direction and increasing. On 4 December, as an emergency measure, xenon propellant from the ion engines was blown to correct the spin, and it was confirmed successful. Altitude control was commanded using the xenon gas. On 5 December, altitude was corrected enough to regain communication through the medium gain antenna. Telemetry was obtained and analyzed. As the result of telemetry analysis, it was found that there was a strong possibility that the sampler projectile had not penetrated when it landed on 25 November. Due to the power outage, the telemetry log data was faulty. On 8 December, a sudden altitude change was observed, and communication with Hayabusa was lost. It was thought likely that the turbulence was caused by evaporation of 8 or 10cc of leaked fuel. This forced a wait of a month or two for Hayabusa to stabilize by conversion of precession to pure rotation, after which the rotation axis needed to be directed toward the Sun and Earth within a specific angular range. The probability of achieving this was estimated at 60% by December 2006, 70% by spring 2007.|$|E

40|$|Overestimation of {{the height}} of radar {{precipitation}} echoes increases with horizontal distance from the WSR- 57 radar {{as a result of}} the combined effect of earth curvature, atmospheric refraction, and beam width.

For echoes 550, 000 ft, the average echo altitude increase is less than 1, 000 ft for distances up to 100 :mi; It. was also found that echo frequencies increase proportionally with the area of each additional IO-mi annulus.

Considering the influence of altitude and air humidity, correction factor for gas injection rate is calculated. The value of gas injection for <b>altitude</b> <b>correction</b> factor generally increases {{with the increase in}} altitude, especially when conducting air drilling in high altitude areas of western China the correction factor of Qinghai oilfield can be calculated as high as 1. 5.

Consideration of wind loads is very important in the structural design especially in the design of high rise structures. This, among accurate prediction of other loads affecting a structure, ensures safe and economic design of structures. Kenyan structural engineers depend on basic wind speeds which were determined over 30 years ago. It is important to periodically review the wind speeds. This is because the wind speeds experienced could change due to changes in land use like deforestation to give way for infrastructure among other causes.
