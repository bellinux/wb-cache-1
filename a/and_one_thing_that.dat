2500|$|Huckabee took stances {{opposed to}} the nature of the {{incumbent}} president, Barack Obama. In comments made March 1, 2011, on The Steve Malzberg Show, Huckabee said of Obama, [...] "I would love to know more. What I know is troubling enough. <b>And</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, is very different than the average American." [...] (This is a reference to the Mau Mau Uprising against the colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1952; Obama himself has never lived in Kenya.) ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had gone}} flying along a winding path between {{the borders of}} the kitchen garden, and in the {{increasing}} twilight he was as hard to follow as a flying hare. But at length the path after many twists betrayed its purpose and led abruptly up two or three steps to the door of a tiny but very clean cottage. There was nothing about the outside to distinguish it from other cottages, except indeed its ominous cleanliness <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> was out of all the custom and tradition of all cottages under the sun. In the middle of the little garden among the stocks and marigolds there surged up in shapeless stone a South Sea Island idol. There was something gross and even evil in that eyeless and alien god among the most innocent of the English flowers.|$|E
60|$|So {{there came}} to Denton and Elizabeth a long {{succession}} of laborious days, that hardened their hands, wove strange threads of some new and sterner substance {{into the soft}} prettiness of their lives, and drew grave lines and shadows on their faces. The bright, convenient ways of the former life had receded to an inaccessible distance; slowly they learnt {{the lesson of the}} underworld--sombre and laborious, vast and pregnant. There were many little things happened: things that would be tedious and miserable to tell, things that were bitter and grievous to bear--indignities, tyrannies, such as must ever season the bread of the poor in cities; <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> was not little, but seemed like the utter blackening of life to them, which was that the child they had given life to sickened and died. But that story, that ancient, perpetually recurring story, has been told so often, has been told so beautifully, that {{there is no need to}} tell it over again here. There was the same sharp fear, the same long anxiety, the deferred inevitable blow, and the black silence. It has always been the same; it will always be the same. It is one of the things that must be.|$|E

60|$|Hilary {{looked at}} that round, not too cleanly hand. He could see her {{watching}} him between her fingers. It was uncanny, almost horrible, like {{the sight of a}} cat watching a bird; and he stood appalled at the terrible reality of his position, at the sight of his own future with this girl, with her traditions, customs, life, the thousand <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he did not know about her, {{that he would have to}} live with if he once took her. A minute passed, which seemed eternity, for into it was condensed every force of her long pursuit, her instinctive clutching at something that she felt to be security, her reaching upwards, her twining round him.|$|R
60|$|The next <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> happened--I can't {{tell which}} day it was--was Mrs. Deerhurst's coming, professing to be dreadfully shocked and {{overcome}} by my father's death, {{to take away}} Emily. She must be so much in our way. I, who saw her first, answered only by begging to keep her--our great comfort <b>and</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> cheered <b>and</b> upheld my brother.|$|R
6000|$|Not {{long after}} we had dined, the food-bringing was over. The gifts (carefully noted and tallied as they came in) were now {{announced}} by a humorous orator, who convulsed the audience, introducing singing notes, now on {{the name of the}} article, now on the number; six thousand odd heads of taro, three hundred and nineteen cooked pigs; <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> particularly caught me (by good luck), a single turtle [...] "for the king"--le tasi mo le tupu. Then came one of the strangest sights I have yet witnessed. The two most important persons there (bar Mataafa) were Popo and his son. They rose, holding their long shod rods of talking men, passed forth from the house, broke into a strange dance, the father capering with outstretched arms and rod, the son crouching and gambolling beside him in a manner indescribable, and presently began to extend the circle of this dance among the acres of cooked food. Whatever they leaped over, whatever they called for, became theirs. To see mediæval Dante thus demean himself struck a kind of a chill of incongruity into our Philistine souls; but even in a great part of the Samoan concourse, these antique and (I understand) quite local manners awoke laughter. One of my biscuit tins and a live calf were among the spoils he claimed, but the large majority of the cooked food (having once proved his dignity) he re-presented to the king.|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose you}} are anxious, if these letters which are piling up and piling up should ever reach you, or even start to do so, to know {{something}} about the Altrurian cities, and what they are like. Well, in the first place, you must cast all images of American cities out of your mind, or any European cities, except, perhaps, the prettiest and stateliest parts of Paris, where there is a regular sky-line, and the public buildings and monuments are approached through shaded avenues. There are no private houses here, in our sense--that is, houses which people have built with their own money on their own land, and made as ugly outside and as molestive to their neighbors and the passers-by as they chose. As the buildings belong to the whole people, the first requirement is that they shall be beautiful inside and out. There are a few grand edifices looking like Greek temples, which are used for the government offices, and these are, of course, the most dignified, but the dwellings are quite as attractive and comfortable. They are built round courts, with gardens and flowers in the courts, and wide grassy spaces round them. They are rather tall, but never so tall as our great hotels or apartment-houses, and the floors are brought to one level by elevators, which are used only in the capitals; and, generally speaking, I should say the villages were pleasanter than the cities. In fact, the village is the Altrurian ideal, and there is an effort everywhere {{to reduce the size of}} the towns and increase the number of the villages. The outlying farms have been gathered into these, and now there is not one of those lonely places in the country, like those where our farmers toil alone outdoors and their wives alone indoors, and both go mad so often in the solitude. The villages are almost in sight of each other, and the people go to their fields in company, while the women carry on their house-keeping co-operatively, with a large kitchen which they use in common; they have their meals apart or together, as they like. If any one is sick or disabled the neighbors come in and help do her work, as they used with us in the early times, and as they still do in country places. Village life here is preferred, just as country life is in England, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> will amuse you, with your American ideas, and your pride in the overgrowth of our cities: the Altrurian papers solemnly announce from time to time that the population of such or such a capital has been reduced so many hundreds or thousands since the last census. That means that the villages in the neighborhood have been increased in number and population.|$|E
50|$|Jumulleok {{is short}} steak marinated with sesame oil, salt and pepper. It is almost similar to unmarinated gogigui <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> distinguishes it from other kinds is its steak-like juicy texture. Spicy pork daeji bulgogi {{is also a}} popular gogigui dish. It is {{different}} from beef bulgogi in that the marinade is not soy sauce-based, but instead, is marinated in sauces based on gochujang and/or gochu garu (Korean chili powder).|$|E
50|$|Gravicalymene is a genus of trilobites {{from the}} order Phacopida, {{suborder}} Calymenia. Gravicalymene {{has been a}} 'hot button' trilobite lately. The species that are currently in this genus have been in Calymene <b>and</b> Sthenocalymene. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> seems {{to be consistent with}} the genus Gravicalymene is that they sometimes occur in Dolomitic limestone and that many occur in the Silurian age.|$|R
5000|$|Moolala is a {{personal}} finance training company founded in 2009 by business journalist Bruce Sellery.

60|$|But his {{troubles}} were not over yet; for, {{just as he}} came out from under all the ruin, the island began to sink down into the water, carrying everything along with it--that is, everything but him <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> else. <b>That</b> <b>one</b> other <b>thing</b> was an empty boat, and King Selim climbed into it, and nothing else saved him from drowning.

50|$|Long time ago, {{this area}} is a wide forested place. There is a little stream located in the area. People of the place call it Putol na sapa, for a simple reason {{that they did not}} know where it starts and where it ends. <b>And</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> puzzles their mind is that there are many fish in it. During sunny days, the stream gets dry, and the fish and plants in it lost. But during rainy days, the fish and plants start to dwell in the stream. Time passed by, the name of the place was changed. From Putol na sapa, it's now called POCTOL.|$|E

60|$|Miserable {{as he was}} on the steamer, a new misery {{came upon}} him. What when the steamer reached Tahiti? He would have to go ashore. He would have to order his trade-goods, to find a passage on a {{schooner}} to the Marquesas, to do a thousand <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were awful to contemplate. Whenever he steeled himself deliberately to think, he could see the desperate peril in which he stood. In all truth, he was in the Valley of the Shadow, and his danger lay in that he was not afraid. If he were only afraid, he would make toward life. Being unafraid, he was drifting deeper into the shadow. He found no delight in the old familiar things of life. The Mariposa was now in the northeast trades, and this wine of wind, surging against him, irritated him. He had his chair moved to escape the embrace of this lusty comrade of old days and nights.|$|R

5000|$|Obviousness: The term is {{so obvious}} that it goes without saying. Furthermore, there must be <b>one</b> <b>and</b> only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> would be implied by the parties.
