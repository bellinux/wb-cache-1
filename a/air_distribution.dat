25|$|Air {{quality and}} air flow— An {{innovative}} underfloor <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> system allows fresh air {{to move into}} the building while pushing stale air to the ceiling. This air is then collected in air ducts and circulated outside, providing healthy and comfortable air for occupants.|$|E
25|$|Much of the building's {{architecture}} is transparent {{and serves as}} a teaching tool. As an example, the exposed ductwork and <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> systems allows students to construct a better understanding of issues of indoor air quality. Seniors examine the building's airflow with the lead custodian Ron during their investigations related to environmental health.|$|E
25|$|Development resumed, {{to improve}} {{emissions}} durability and ready the engine for more stringent 1975 standards. The fuel injection was redesigned for better <b>air</b> <b>distribution.</b> High-energy electronic ignition and mandatory catalytic converter were added; also a Pulse Air system, functionally {{the same as}} an air pump but without the pump's six-horsepower loss. A larger catalytic converter further guarded against power loss. More advanced ignition timing, and the lead-free fuel required with the converter, prevented exhaust-valve failure.|$|E
40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>distributions</b> in {{commercial}} airliner cabins are crucial {{for creating a}} thermally comfortable and healthy cabin environment. This paper reviewed the methods used in predicting, designing, and analyzing <b>air</b> <b>distributions</b> in the cabins. Two popular methods are experimental measurements and numerical simulations. The experimental measurements have usually been seen as more reliable although they are more expensive and time consuming. Most of the numerical simulations use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) that can provide effectively detailed information. Numerous applications using the two methods {{can be found in}} the literature for studying <b>air</b> <b>distributions</b> in aircraft cabin, including investigations on more reliable and accurate models. Our review shows that studies using both experimental measurements and computer simulations are becoming popular. Our review also found that it is necessary to use a full-scale test rig to obtain reliable and high quality experimental data, and that the hybrid CFD models are rather promising for simulating <b>air</b> <b>distributions</b> in airliner cabins...|$|R

25|$|To {{maintain}} the differential air pressure, spectators usually entered {{and left the}} seating and concourse areas through revolving doors, since the use of regular doors without an airlock would have caused significant loss of air pressure. The double-walled construction allowed warmed air to circulate beneath {{the top of the}} dome, melting accumulated snow. A sophisticated environmental control center in {{the lower part of the}} stadium was manned to monitor weather and make adjustments in <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> to {{maintain the}} roof.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooling system}} was based around a high-efficiency {{air-cooled}} condensing chiller. Each office was provided {{with its own}} thermal controls, from the mechanicals of the compartmentalized four-pipe and two-pipe fan-coil underfloor <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> system, allowing ventilated air to be warmer and cleaner, to the operable windows and shades, so that occupants could work at their own comfort levels. Occupancy sensors shut off ventilation when no one is present. If these measures worked as planned, the total cooling load capacity would be only 29 watts per square metre (2.6 per square foot), and the building would see a 45% improvement over American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) energy-use standards.|$|E

30|$|The {{velocity}} contours {{indicate that}} the <b>air</b> velocity <b>distributions</b> at most measuring locations do not follow the typical “velocity profile” observed within a duct, where the maximum velocity occurs at the centerline of the duct and the minimum occurs near the wall. A certain <b>air</b> velocity <b>distribution</b> pattern is correlated well with {{the location of the}} measuring station, mainly because of the merging and splitting of the airflow upstream and downstream.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify {{characteristics}} <b>air</b> temperature <b>distribution</b> on platforms, and also to analyze influence of existence of trains on platforms of railway station on <b>air</b> temperature <b>distribution.</b> In this paper, we measured the thermal environment on platforms in station 'A' that is one of the largest railway stations in Japan. Existence of trains had an effect on air temperature rise of Shinkansen platform. <b>Air</b> temperature <b>distributions</b> on platform of the old railroad platform and the Shinkansen platform were different, but air temperature of Southernmost point of each platform rose every 20 〜 30 minutes, 3 〜 5 minutes after the blow of strong wind. Therefore, we proposed a method of time correction by the moving observation of air temperature and we got two patterns of <b>air</b> temperature <b>distribution</b> on platforms for every hour. It was clarified that when about 3 m/s wind blew along the orbit on platforms in the open type platforms, the high-temperature area spread about 60 m, and central point of each platform was cooled down...|$|R
2500|$|The Hoverbarge {{technology}} is somewhat different from high-speed hovercraft, which {{has traditionally been}} constructed using aircraft technology. The initial concept of the air cushion barge {{has always been to}} provide a low-tech amphibious solution for accessing construction sites using typical equipment found in this area, such as diesel engines, ventilating fans, winches and marine equipment. The load to move a 200ton payload ACV barge at [...] would only be 5tons. The skirt and <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> design on high-speed craft again is more complex, as they have to cope with the air cushion being washed out by a wave and wave impact. The slow speed and large mono chamber of the hover barge actually helps reduce the effect of wave action, giving a very smooth ride.|$|E

40|$|Indoor {{air flow}} {{is a term}} {{referring}} to the thermal and fluid flow in enclosed environments. It {{is closely related to}} the human and the stable operation of a data center. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has {{played an important role in}} designing and evaluating various indoor <b>air</b> <b>distributions.</b> To determine which viscous model works best for indoor environment, six commonly used viscous models are evaluated. They are laminar model, standard k- 2 ̆ 6 epsiv; model, renormalization group (RNG) k- 2 ̆ 6 epsiv; model, realizable k- 2 ̆ 6 epsiv; model, standard k-ω model and shear-stress transport (SST) k-ω model. Simulation results are compared with experimental data for three typical indoor air flow patterns: natural convection in a tall cavity, forced convection in a model room with partitions and mixed convection in a square cavity. None of the viscous models have the optimized performance for all types of flow. The overall performance of the RNG k- 2 ̆ 6 epsiv; model is better than others and is therefore recommended for simulations of indoor air flow. The RNG k- 2 ̆ 6 epsiv; model is then used to simulate the <b>air</b> <b>distributions</b> for the data center at Purdue University Calumet. Based on the analysis of the thermal and fluid flow field, the optimal configuration for the data center is proposed. ...|$|R
