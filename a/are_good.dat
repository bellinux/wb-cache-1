5|$|Cognitive externalism is a {{very broad}} {{collection}} of views that suggests {{the role of the}} environment, of tools, of development, and of the body in fleshing out cognition. Embodied cognition, the extended mind, and enactivism <b>are</b> <b>good</b> examples.|$|E

5|$|An ant's head {{contains}} many sensory organs. Like most insects, ants have compound eyes made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ant eyes <b>are</b> <b>good</b> for acute movement detection, {{but do not}} offer a high resolution image. They also have three small ocelli (simple eyes) {{on the top of}} the head that detect light levels and polarization. Compared to vertebrates, most ants have poor-to-mediocre eyesight and a few subterranean species are completely blind. However, some ants, such as Australia's bulldog ant, have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away.|$|E

5|$|Humpback whales {{have been}} sighted {{in the lower}} region of Glacier Bay; also in Sitakaday Narrows, Whidbey Passage and the waters around South Marble Island. For kayakers, Hugh Miller Inlet and the Beardslee Islands <b>are</b> <b>good</b> {{locations}} to see humpback whales {{from a safe distance}} of about a quarter mile. Other marine whales sighted are grey, minke, fin, and killer whales (orcas).|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), have low elasticity, and <b>are</b> <b>good</b> insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, {{they tend to have}} high ionization energy and electronegativity values, and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E
5|$|Many {{environmental}} {{scientists believe}} amphibians, including frogs, <b>are</b> <b>good</b> biological indicators of broader ecosystem health {{because of their}} intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults). It appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline, while those with direct development are the most resistant.|$|E

5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult {{to grow in the}} wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They <b>are</b> <b>good</b> bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Potassium ions are {{necessary}} for the function of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables <b>are</b> <b>good</b> dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells {{and an increase in}} potassium excretion by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Some {{ytterbium}} halides {{are used}} as reagents in organic synthesis. For example, ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) is a Lewis acid {{and can be used}} as a catalyst in the Aldol and Diels–Alder reactions. Ytterbium(II) iodide (YbI2) may be used, like samarium(II) iodide, as a reducing agent for coupling reactions. Ytterbium(III) fluoride (YbF3) is used as an inert and non-toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions, which <b>are</b> <b>good</b> for dental health, and is also a good X-ray contrast agent.|$|E

5|$|The Eighteenth Dynasty tombs {{within the}} valley vary {{quite a bit}} in decoration, style, and location. It seems that at first there was no fixed plan. The tomb of Hatshepsut has a unique shape, {{twisting}} and turning down over 200metres from the entrance, so that the burial chamber is 97metres below the surface. The tombs gradually became more regular and formalised, and those of Thutmose III and Thutmose IV, KV34 and KV43, <b>are</b> <b>good</b> examples of Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, both with their bent axis, and simple decoration.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} {{good family}} dog while it has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they <b>are</b> <b>good</b> with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} also {{the centre of the}} {{explosives}} industry between the 17th and early 20th century, before a decline following an accident in 1916 which killed over 100 workers. This coincided with a revival of the shipping industry in the town. Faversham has a number of landmarks, with several historic churches including St Mary of Charity, Faversham Parish Church, the Maison Dieu and Faversham Recreation Ground. Faversham Market has been established for over 900 years and is still based in the town centre. There <b>are</b> <b>good</b> road and rail links, including a Southeastern service to the High Speed 1 line at Ebbsfleet International and London.|$|E

5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>good</b> {{examples}} of horizontal water mills, {{also known as}} Norse or Clack Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill-stone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone, and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below. Some were still in use on Papa Stour {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of Clumlie, at Troswick in the south Mainland of Shetland.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other large tombs from the 18th {{century in the}} churchyard—some of which <b>are</b> <b>good</b> {{examples}} {{of the use of}} artificial Coade stone, popular at the time—and several brass and stone memorial tablets inside the church from the 16th century onwards. George Hutchinson has a prominent wall memorial in the chancel in addition to his tomb outside; local sculptor Richard Joanes designed it, and there are Coade stone embellishments. Other carved tablets, such as those to Reverend Lewin and Nicholas Spencer, are by obscure London-based mid-19th-century sculptor T. Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers bloom {{from early}} May to late September {{but most are}} gone by late August.
