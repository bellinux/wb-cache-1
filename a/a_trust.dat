5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create <b>a</b> <b>trust.</b> There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> to be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E
5|$|Trust {{funds are}} {{earmarked}} for specific programs and purposes {{in accordance with}} a statute that designates the fund as <b>a</b> <b>trust.</b> Its statutory designation distinguishes the fund as <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> rather than a special fund. The Highway Trust Fund {{is an example of}} trust funds.|$|E
5|$|If the {{community}} wishing to incorporate is located within <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> area under the Island Trust Act, it must incorporate as an island municipality. A single island municipality designation has been granted to Bowen Island.|$|E

25|$|Trusts go by many {{different}} names, {{depending on the}} characteristics or {{the purpose of the}} trust. Because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes, <b>a</b> single <b>trust</b> might accurately be described in several ways. For example, <b>a</b> living <b>trust</b> is often <b>an</b> express <b>trust,</b> which is also <b>a</b> revocable <b>trust,</b> and might include <b>an</b> incentive <b>trust,</b> and so forth.|$|R

5|$|The tribe then {{appealed the}} case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court found that various federal laws {{required}} the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary damages. The court then looked to the 1960 act and determined that this act did create <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages. This was based on common law, with the court referencing the Restatement (Second) of Trusts to outline that <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> body (the land and buildings). The court noted that both parties agreed that there was <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> but not that damages were authorized. The court held that where the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a fiduciary duty was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary damages. The court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
5|$|As Secretary of Administration and Finance, Baker was a main {{architect}} of the Big Dig financing plan. In 1997 {{the federal government was}} planning to cut funding for the Big Dig by $300 million per year. The state set up <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> and sold Grant Anticipation Notes (GANs) to investors. The notes were secured by promising future federal highway funds. As federal highway dollars are awarded to Massachusetts, the money is used to pay off the GANs.|$|E
30|$|When {{a client}} {{application}} creates a session with <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> application, it connects to an “Instance” of that <b>trusted</b> application. <b>A</b> <b>trusted</b> application instance has a physical memory space which {{is separated from}} the physical memory space {{of all the other}} <b>trusted</b> application instances. <b>A</b> session is used to logically connect multiple commands invoked in <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> application. Each session has its own state, which typically contains the session context and the context of the task executing the session.|$|R
30|$|TCCP [63] enables {{providers}} to offer closed box execution environments, and {{allows users to}} determine if the environment is secure before launching their VMs. The TCCP adds two fundamental elements: <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> virtual machine monitor (TVMM) and <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> coordinator (TC). The TC manages <b>a</b> set of <b>trusted</b> nodes that run TVMMs, and it is maintained but <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> third party. The TC participates in the process of launching or migrating a VM, which verifies that a VM is running in <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> platform. The authors in [78] claimed that TCCP has a significant downside {{due to the fact that}} all the transactions have to verify with the TC which creates an overload. They proposed to use Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) and Privacy CA scheme to tackle this issue.|$|R
30|$|To avoid VM {{misappropriation}} by a malicious CSP, {{the simplest}} way is not to use VM to implement location verifier. Rather, location verifier should be hosted on a private machine owned by the user or on <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> third party. However, if for any good reasons regarding user’s preferences or requirements, location verifier is hosted by the CSP, the user must deploy on the CSP <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> hardware, such as <b>a</b> <b>Trusted</b> Platform Module, to prevent CSP to manipulate the hosted VMs [29].|$|R
5|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{there is no}} {{requirement}} for particular formalities in trust instruments, they can be oral or written. The only requirement is that they show an intention to create <b>a</b> <b>trust.</b> The exceptions are where it is a transfer of land, the transfer of existing equitable interests, or where the trust is made in a will.|$|E
5|$|Fiduciary {{funds are}} used to account for assets held in trust by the {{government}} for the benefit of individuals or other entities. The employee pension fund, created by the State of Maryland to provide retirement benefits for its employees, {{is an example of a}} fiduciary fund. Financial statements may further distinguish fiduciary funds as either trust or agency funds; <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> fund generally exists for a longer period of time than an agency fund.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in July 2000, the Avalanche, Nuggets and Pepsi Center {{were finally}} bought by real estate {{entrepreneur}} Stan Kroenke in a $450million deal. Kroenke is the brother-in-law of the Lauries; his wife Ann is Nancy Laurie's sister. Liberty retained only a 6.5% stake {{of the sports}} franchises. As part of the deal, Kroenke placed the teams into <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> that would ensure the teams will stay in Denver until at least 2025. After the deal, Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises.|$|E
40|$|To create <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> {{environment}} for program execution and data storage, the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) {{has introduced a}} set of technologies to create <b>a</b> <b>Trusted</b> Platform, based on <b>a</b> hardware <b>trust</b> anchor capable of protecting sensitive information and identifying the components running in a computer system. <b>A</b> <b>Trusted</b> Platform is built around a cost-effective and tamper-resistant hardware component called Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Although TPM is widely available, building <b>a</b> <b>Trusted</b> Platforms and Applications {{is not an easy}} task. This work wants to encourage the usage of Trusted Computing in commodity systems and propose the adoption of the Trusted Computing Technology in different applications which require the guarantee that information is handled correctly. The broad diffusion of Trusted Computing and Trusted Platforms in real life scenarios will allow mitigating software attacks and will allow users to increase confidence on their platform...|$|R
50|$|The {{notion of}} <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> {{environment}} is somewhat fluid. The departure of <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> staff member {{with access to}} sensitive information can become a data breach if the staff member retains access to the data subsequent to termination of the trust relationship. In distributed systems, this can also occur with a breakdown in <b>a</b> web of <b>trust.</b>|$|R
30|$|If {{there is}} not <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> service node i that has interacted with the {{feedback}} node j directly, it needs a recommendation node k to recommend <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> node j for service node i. Thus, the process of indirect interaction is summarized in Algorithm 2.|$|R
5|$|In {{his later}} life, Richard Gibbs {{recognised}} that the diverse {{interests of the}} large family, {{and the need to}} invest heavily in even basic refurbishment of the house to make it weather-secured and habitable, would require the family to sell Tyntesfield. Recognising also that substantial death duties would become payable on his death, Richard drew up a will based around <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> that would allow his fortune to pass to the surviving children of his brother and half sister, a total of 19 beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|Joint a Tribal Council, of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton, 528 F.2d 370 (1st Cir. 1975), was a {{landmark}} decision regarding aboriginal {{title in the}} United States. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the Nonintercourse Act applied to the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot, non-federally-recognized Indian tribes, and established <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> relationship between those tribes {{and the federal government}} that the state of Maine could not terminate.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{just below}} Northwich, the Anderton Boat Lift {{is now the}} normal route for leisure boats to reach the river. Following its closure in 1983, <b>a</b> <b>Trust</b> was created to {{campaign}} for its restoration. The lift became a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1994, and work eventually started on its refurbishment in 1999. It reopened in 2002, and is once more hydraulically powered. The use of modern hydraulic fluids is expected to prevent the problem of corrosion suffered when it was originally built.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{importance}} of Relationship Marketing has been recognised, there has been considerable discussion in the Marketing literature on Trust generally. However, the creation of <b>a</b> <b>trusting</b> brand identity through advertising has received little attention. This paper is our first step towards examining this relationship. Focus group research was undertaken to identify the characteristics of print advertisements perceived as portraying <b>a</b> <b>trusting</b> image. Reasons for <b>trusting</b> <b>a</b> brand were also explored. The results show that advertisements that are simple, straightforward and clear are perceived as being more trusting. Consumers are also quite critical of current advertising efforts in building <b>a</b> <b>trusting</b> brand image...|$|R

5|$|Where {{payments}} {{have been}} made by mistake claimants {{may or may not be}} able to recoup their losses. The leading case is Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC, where Lord Browne-Wilkinson declared that a constructive trust would be created when the recipient of the funds became aware of the mistaken transfer. As such, ignorance of the mistake would not create a fiduciary relationship, therefore not <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> and the property would be untraceable.|$|E
5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. In {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, and returned to the creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E

40|$|In the (t, n) {{threshold}} signature schemes {{with the}} assistance of <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> party, the trusted party easily becomes the targets of attack. And an authority which can be trusted by all players doesn't exist. So the schemes without <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> party were proposed to solve those security problems. But all of the conventional schemes without <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> party cannot withstand conspiracy attacks. A novel (t, n) threshold signature scheme with <b>a</b> weakened <b>trusted</b> party is proposed, in which the group secret key is composed of two parts. Any t or more group players cannot cooperate to reveal the group secret key and the weakened trusted party only knows a part of player’s secret key. So the new scheme can effectively withstand conspiracy attacks and as the power of the trusted party is limited, it meets the purpose of designing a threshold signature scheme without <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> party...|$|R

Although he provided his family with financial support, he spent much of his time abroad and on 17 June 1929 bigamously married Nobubai Visvonata Catcar, causing Sorabji and his mother a substantial loss of fortune. He died in Bad Nauheim, Germany, on 8 July 1932. In the same year, Sorabji travelled to India to settle matters related to his father's estate, but obtained nothing but money from <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> fund that his father had established in 1914. Nevertheless, it saved him from having to earn a living, although his lifestyle was ascetic.|$|E

5|$|Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in {{the case}} favoring the law firm's position. The case dealt {{with the concept of}} an advance payment retainer, a fee given to an {{attorney}} for later services to a client. An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney's assets {{as soon as it was}} paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer) and the security retainer. A classic retainer was described by the court as one used in an attorney-client relationship for a set length of time or a particular purpose. A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois.|$|E
