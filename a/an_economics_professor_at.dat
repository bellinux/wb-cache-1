25|$|The {{club was}} not keen on repeating the {{disaster}} of 1991–92, {{and in the}} next season Bayern spent the equivalent of €12 million on the new players—Thomas Helmer (€4M), Brazil's captain Jorginho (€2.8M) and Lothar Matthäus (€2M) topped the bill of a list that also included Mehmet Scholl. Calming the nerves of the thrifty President Dr. Fritz Scherer, <b>an</b> <b>economics</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of Munich, was the sale of Stefan Effenberg and Brian Laudrup for €8.5 million to Fiorentina. The rebuilt side came close to winning the title, but just missed out. Ribbeck's tactics, which were felt to be overly negative, were blamed for this, and when the following season looked to be going no differently, Beckenbauer dismissed Ribbeck and took control of the team himself. An immediate upturn in form saw Bayern take that year's title.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Barro, <b>an</b> <b>economics</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Harvard University (author of the 1974 Ricardian {{equivalence}} hypothesis postulating {{that government}} stimuli are inefficient {{in a perfect}} market), argued that US stimulus spending might be unwise because {{of one of the}} factors the US stimulus package depended on for its effectiveness, the [...] "multiplier effect". The fiscal multiplier, required to be over the value of one for the effect to take place, was in practice close to zero – not 1.5 as he said the Obama team were assuming – which means the extra employment generated by the stimulus would be cancelled out by less output and investment in the private sector.|$|E

2500|$|According to Thomas DeGregori, <b>an</b> <b>economics</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of Houston, in {{an article}} {{published}} by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank operating in Washington D.C., [...] "it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools. Then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer, healthier lives. However, in poor countries like Bangladesh, working children are essential for survival in many families, as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century. So, while the struggle to end child labour is necessary, getting there often requires taking different routes—and, sadly, there are many political obstacles.|$|E

2500|$|Still {{other critics}} saw {{reflected}} in the government's response its attitude to the so-called [...] "Irish Question".

[...] In 1848, Denis Shine Lawlor suggested that Russell was a student of the Elizabethan poet Edmund Spenser, who had calculated [...] "how far English colonisation and English policy might be most effectively carried out by Irish starvation." [...] Charles Trevelyan, the civil servant with most direct responsibility for the government's handling of the famine, described it in 1848 as [...] "a direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful Providence", which laid bare [...] "the deep and inveterate root of social evil"; he affirmed that the Famine was [...] "the sharp but effectual remedy by which the cure is likely to be effected.

2500|$|Burton G. Malkiel, <b>an</b> <b>economics</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Princeton University {{and writer}} of A Random Walk Down Wall Street, {{performed}} a test where his {{students were given}} a hypothetical stock that was initially worth fifty dollars. [...] The closing stock price for each day was determined by a coin flip. [...] If the result was heads, the price would close a half point higher, but if the result was tails, it would close a half point lower. [...] Thus, each time, the price had a fifty-fifty chance of closing higher or lower than the previous day. [...] Cycles or trends were determined from the tests. [...] Malkiel then took the results in a chart and graph form to a chartist, a person who “seeks to predict future movements by seeking to interpret past patterns {{on the assumption that}} ‘history tends to repeat itself’”. [...] The chartist told Malkiel that they needed to immediately buy the stock. Since the coin flips were random, the fictitious stock had no overall trend. Malkiel argued that this indicates that the market and stocks could be just as random as flipping a coin.|$|E

5000|$|None of the Ford {{supporters}} from Texas were {{delegates to}} the national convention in Kansas City. Angelo recalls Tower as having [...] "begged" [...] him to allocate a delegate slot for the senator. Angelo said that Tower could be a delegate if he were committed to supporting Reagan, an impossible condition for Tower because of his longstanding commitment to President Ford.
