5|$|Technique-wise, Sjumandjaja {{used the}} camera to emphasise the narrative. Bajangan, his first work, used long shots to show the main character's lonesomeness. He would often use several shots to show the {{psychological}} issues faced by his characters, focusing on both the characters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> around them. He also used references to well-known cultural works; a scene in Kartini was framed so to reflect Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{was first}} {{played at the}} Origins II {{convention}} in 1976, where {{it was used to}} introduce Dungeons & Dragons players to the science fiction game Metamorphosis Alpha. In 1980, TSR published the adventure, updated for first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. The adventure was not updated for later rules systems, but a Wizards.com article did provide a conversion to Future Tech. It included a separate booklet of illustrations, in both color and black and white. The adventure is an old-time favorite of many Dungeons & Dragons fans, including Stephen Colbert. It was ranked the fifth-best Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, and received positive reviews from White Dwarf <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Space</b> Gamer magazines. The other adventures in the S series include S1 Tomb of Horrors, S2 White Plume Mountain, and S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.|$|E
5|$|Frahm {{anti-roll}} {{tanks were}} fitted during construction, but these {{proved to be}} ineffective; the tanks only reduced rolling by 33%.

The ship was able to carry an additional 180 t(200 short tons) of coal in the anti-roll tanks. Von der Tanns hull consisted of 15 watertight compartments, and a double bottom extended for 75% of the ship's length. The ship was known to have good maneuvering characteristics, with a speed loss of 60% and a heel of 8degrees at full rudder.|$|E

5|$|Lakes may form in basins {{where there}} is {{sufficient}} precipitation or meltwater from glaciers above. They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low-lying areas. When the lakes dry up, they leave a crust or hardpan behind. This area of deposited clay, silt or sand {{is known as a}} playa. The deserts of North America have more than one hundred playas, many of them relics of Lake Bonneville which covered parts of Utah, Nevada and Idaho during the last ice age when the climate was colder and wetter. These include the Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake and many dry lake beds. The smooth flat surfaces of playas have been used for attempted vehicle speed records at Black Rock Desert and Bonneville Speedway and the United States Air Force uses Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert as runways for aircraft <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Mir {{featured}} a shower, the Bania, located in Kvant-2. It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations, but proved {{difficult to use}} due to {{the time required to}} set up, use, and stow. The shower, which {{featured a}} plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.|$|E

5|$|Radio {{communications}} provided telemetry {{and scientific}} data links between Mir and the RKA Mission Control Centre (TsUP). Radio links {{were also used}} during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, Mir was equipped with several communication systems used for different purposes. The station communicated directly with the ground via the Lira antenna mounted to the core module. The Lira antenna also had the capability to use the Luch data relay satellite system (which fell into disrepair in the 1990s) and the network of Soviet tracking ships deployed in various locations around the world (which also became unavailable in the 1990s). UHF radio was used by cosmonauts conducting EVAs. UHF was also employed by other spacecraft that docked to or undocked from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle, {{in order to receive}} commands from the TsUP and Mir crew members via the TORU system.|$|E
5|$|The Trylon {{closed for}} three months in summer 2017 as Kryshka {{supervised}} a major renovation and expansion of the theater, at a projected cost of $175,000. MSR Design of Minneapolis worked pro bono to create updated architectural plans. As part of the renovation, the entrance was moved from Minnehaha Ave to 33rd Street. An outdoor courtyard was created outside the entrance, a new lobby and concession stand were built, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> was updated to be more accessible to wheelchair users. The auditorium was expanded from 50 to 92 seats, and a new screen and sound system were added. Relinquishing the Microcinema moniker, the movie house reopened as the Trylon Cinema over the weekend of September 22–24, 2017, with screenings of Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator.|$|E

Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E

5|$|Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, {{finally coming}} to his senses, thanks the young hero for {{stopping}} him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon {{thought of as}} a fad. Wanting nothing more than to create heroes, Blue was sucked into one of his own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost touch with reality and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete. He snaps his fingers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> station's onboard computer warns {{of a large number of}} UFOs heading towards Earth. Blue tells Joe that a hero will be needed twice more to save the world. Joe attempts to leave but not before Silvia requests a V-Watch from her father and to accompany her boyfriend.

5|$|The {{hexagonal}} structure {{has a point}} group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E
