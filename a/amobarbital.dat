25|$|Drug users tend {{to prefer}} short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates. The most {{commonly}} used are <b>amobarbital</b> (Amytal), pentobarbital (Nembutal), and secobarbital (Seconal). A combination of <b>amobarbital</b> and secobarbital (called Tuinal) is also highly used. Short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates are usually prescribed as sedatives and sleeping pills. These pills begin acting fifteen to forty minutes after they are swallowed, and their effects last from five to six hours.|$|E

25|$|Zonisamide {{and other}} {{carbonic}} anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide {{have been known}} to interfere with <b>amobarbital,</b> which has led to inadequate anesthetization during the Wada test. Zonisamide may also interact with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to increase the potential for metabolic acidosis.|$|E
25|$|Coma can be cyclic, {{with the}} {{individual}} alternating from a comatose state to a hyper-alert state of consciousness, which occurred in a 4-year-old boy who suffered an overdose of clonazepam. The combination of clonazepam and certain barbiturates, e.g. <b>amobarbital,</b> at prescribed doses {{has resulted in a}} synergistic potentiation of the effects of each drug, leading to serious respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{small group}} of List II drugs for which doctors have to write the {{prescriptions}} according to the same, tougher guidelines as those for List I drugs (writing the prescription in full in letters, listing the patients name, and have to contain the name and initials, address, city and telephone number of the licensed prescriber issuing the prescriptions, as well as the name and initials, address and city of the person the prescription is issued to). Among that group of drugs are the barbiturates <b>amobarbital,</b> butalbital, cyclobarbital, and pentobarbital.|$|E

2500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of December 14, 1963, Washington's seventh husband, {{football}} great Dick [...] "Night Train" [...] Lane, went to sleep with Washington and awoke later to find her slumped over and not responsive. Doctor B. C. Ross came to the scene to pronounce her dead. An autopsy later showed a lethal combination of secobarbital and <b>amobarbital,</b> which contributed to her death at the age of 39. She is buried in the Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances {{was signed}} in Vienna. Designed to {{regulate}} amphetamines, barbiturates, and other synthetics, the 34th version of the treaty, , regulates secobarbital as schedule II, <b>amobarbital,</b> butalbital, cyclobarbital, and pentobarbital as schedule III, and allobarbital, barbital, butobarbital, mephobarbital, phenobarbital, butabarbital, and vinylbital as schedule IV on its [...] "Green List". The combination medication Fioricet, consisting of butalbital, caffeine, and paracetamol (acetaminophen), however, is specifically exempted from controlled substance status, while its sibling Fiorinal, which contains aspirin instead of paracetamol and may contain codeine phosphate, remains a schedule III drug.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, [...] the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 {{classified}} most barbiturates as controlled substances—and {{they remain}} so [...] Barbital, methylphenobarbital (also known as mephobarbital), and phenobarbital are designated schedule IV drugs, and [...] "Any substance which contains any quantity of a derivative of barbituric acid, or any salt of a derivative of barbituric acid" [...] (all other barbiturates) were designated as schedule III. Under the original CSA, no barbiturates {{were placed in}} schedule I, II, or V, however <b>amobarbital,</b> pentobarbital, and secobarbital are schedule II controlled substances unless {{they are in a}} suppository dosage form.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amobarbital</b> (formerly {{known as}} amylobarbitone or sodium amytal) {{is a drug}} that is a {{barbiturate}} derivative. It has sedative-hypnotic properties. It is a white crystalline powder with no odor and a slightly bitter taste. It was first synthesized in Germany in 1923. If <b>amobarbital</b> is taken for extended periods of time, physical and psychological dependence can develop. <b>Amobarbital</b> withdrawal mimics delirium tremens and may be life-threatening.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amobarbital</b> (5-ethyl-5-isoamylbarbituric acid), {{like all}} barbiturates, is {{synthesized}} by reacting malonic acid derivatives with urea derivatives. In particular, {{in order to}} make <b>amobarbital,</b> α-ethyl-α-isoamylmalonic ester is reacted with urea (in the presence of sodium ethoxide).|$|E
5000|$|A 1988 {{study found}} that <b>amobarbital</b> {{increases}} benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo with less potency than secobarbital and pentobarbital (in descending order), but greater than phenobarbital and barbital (in descending order).

50|$|On {{the night}} of August 28, 1951, Robert Walker's {{housekeeper}} found the actor in an emotional state.

5000|$|When given slowly by an {{intravenous}} route, sodium <b>amobarbital</b> has {{a reputation}} for acting as a so-called truth serum.
