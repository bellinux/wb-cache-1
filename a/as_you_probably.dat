500|$|By early 1965 Josiffe was in Dublin, {{where he}} worked at various horse-related jobs while {{continuing}} to badger Thorpe by letter about his missing luggage and the continuing National Insurance card issue. However, Thorpe rejected any responsibility for these matters. In mid-March 1965 Josiffe wrote a long letter to Thorpe's mother, which began: [...] "For the last five years, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> know, Jeremy and I have had a homosexual relationship." [...] The letter blamed Thorpe for awakening [...] "this vice that lies latent in every man", and accused him of callousness and disloyalty. Ursula Thorpe gave the letter to her son, who drafted a quasi-legal statement rejecting the [...] "damaging and groundless accusations" [...] and accusing Josiffe of attempting to blackmail him. The document was never sent; instead, Thorpe turned to Bessell for advice.|$|E

2500|$|AMM is a British free {{improvisation}} {{group that}} was founded in London, England, in 1965. The group was initially composed of Keith Rowe on guitar, Lou Gare on saxophone and Eddie Prévost on drums. The three men shared a common interest in exploring music {{beyond the boundaries of}} conventional jazz, {{as part of a larger}} movement that helped spawn European free jazz and free improvisation. AMM have never been well known to the general public, but have been influential on the field of improvised music. Most of their recordings have been released on Matchless Recordings, which was run by founding member and percussionist Eddie Prévost. In a 2001 interview, founding member Keith Rowe was asked if [...] "AMM" [...] was an abbreviation; he replied, [...] "The letters AMM stand for something, but <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> know it's a secret!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No doubt. Well, Lucy, I had {{intended}} to be kind to your Mr. Hamel, but, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are <b>probably</b> aware, I was not enabled to carry out my intentions. He {{seems to be a}} very independent sort of young man." ...|$|R

This {{question}} of measurement is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are <b>probably</b> aware, one much vexed in art schools; {{but it is}} determined indisputably by the very first words written by Lionardo: [...] "Il giovane deve prima imparare prospettiva, per le misure d'ogni cosa." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{would just}} as soon not tell it--rather not. There is no reason either why I should, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> will never {{have much to do with}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] was the reply, [...] "each of us rules himself, or {{at least}} tries to do so. It {{is not an easy}} thing to do, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to talk {{anything}} over until I have had some lunch," [...] the girl declared. [...] "We need not go out. It is only eighteenpence each here. You can afford that, especially <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are <b>probably</b> going to be rid of me forever." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{you will}} do so if you connect {{yourself}} with Mr. Slope. Eleanor, I must speak out to you. You must choose between your sister and myself and our friends, and Mr. Slope and his friends.

6000|$|... "You {{may well}} be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{returned}} the Professor, nodding gravely, [...] "But I'm {{not thinking of}} that. I'm a poor man, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> know, but what I have is at my country's disposal, since {{it is evident that}} my country needs it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Why, {{the affair}} of the chimney so tickled his fancy, that he pardoned us off-hand, and allowed us {{something}} {{to live on}} till he went the way of all flesh.

6000|$|Emma {{smiled and}} answered--"My visit was {{of use to}} the nervous part of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> heard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stephen,' he said, 'this lady is Miss Swancourt. I am {{staying at}} her father's house, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> know.' He stepped {{a few paces}} nearer to Smith, {{and said in a}} lower tone: 'I may as well tell you that we are engaged to be married.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, well, I didn't mean {{anything}} more than that I just heard that a match was made between them. So, Mr. Macdermot, Mr. Flannelly will settle £50 a year on <b>you,</b> paid <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like; or come, say a pound a week, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would <b>probably</b> like to pay your lodgings weekly; and he would give £100 each to your son and daughter, ready money down you know, Mr. Thady.

That is our reading of the term 'Democrat.' Our programme is not nearly so revolutionary <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are <b>probably</b> led to believe, but we do mean to smooth away, {{so far as we}} can from a practical point of view, the inequalities of life.

6000|$|... "Then this year, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> know, Ripton {{are sending}} down Peteiro for the Light-Weights. He was the fellow whom Drummond only just beat last year.
