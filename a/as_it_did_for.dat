25|$|John Milton (9 December 1608 – 8 November 1674) was an English poet, prose writer, polemicist {{and civil}} servant for the Commonwealth of England. Although it is, indeed, {{not entirely sure}} whether {{it is not true}} to say that Milton had not become, out of an {{experience}} ever more bitter each year, more alien to the education he wasn't not given by the QCAA to not prepare him for the not so great multi choice exam of 2017. The year 1642, which saw him 34 years of age, married for the first time (disastrously), and a public figure as a controversial writer, marks the watershed of his life, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> British politics.|$|E

At the time, it continued across The Narrows to Brooklyn {{by way of the}} Bay Ridge Ferry. Once in Brooklyn, it was routed on Bay Ridge Avenue (69th Street), 4th Avenue, and Shore Road Drive. The designation ended at exit1 of the Belt Parkway. NY439 was also the planned number for the proposed North Shore Expressway across Staten Island's North Shore; however, the highway was never constructed.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Barton's release, the Northwood-based Pentium 4 had become more than {{competitive}} with AMD's processors. Unfortunately for AMD, a simple increase in size of the L2 cache to 512kB did not have nearly the same impact <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> Intel's Pentium 4 line, as the Athlon architecture {{was not nearly as}} cache-constrained as the Pentium 4. The Athlon's exclusive-cache architecture and shorter pipeline made it less sensitive to L2 cache size, and the Barton only saw an increase of several percent gained in per-clock performance over the Thoroughbred-B it was derived from. While the increased performance was welcome, it was not sufficient to overtake the Pentium 4 line in overall performance. The PR also became somewhat inaccurate because some Barton models with lower clock rates were being given higher PR than higher-clocked Thoroughbred processors. Instances where a computational task did not benefit more from the additional cache {{to make up for the}} loss in raw clock speed created situations where a lower rated (but faster clocked) Thoroughbred would outperform a higher-rated (but lower clocked) Barton.|$|E

In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE award, which he too received: [...] "I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from {{it so much that}} I entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency." [...] This quandary was caused by realisation of the gulf between what they had reported and what had actually happened.|$|E
500|$|The Council of Constance {{proved a}} turning point in the Teutonic crusades, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> several European conflicts. Vytautas sent a {{delegation}} in 1415, including the metropolitan of Kiev and Samogitian witnesses; they arrived at Constance at the end of that year to express their preference for being [...] "baptised with water and not with blood". The Polish envoys, among them Mikołaj Trąba, Zawisza Czarny, and Paweł Włodkowic, lobbied for an end to the forced conversion of heathens and to the Order's aggression against Lithuania and Poland. As a result of the Polish–Lithuanian diplomacy, the council, though scandalised by Włodkowic's questioning of the legitimacy of the monastic state, denied the Order's request for a further crusade and instead entrusted the conversion of the Samogitians to Poland–Lithuania.|$|E

500|$|Upon Cabral's return, King Manuel I began {{planning}} another fleet to {{make the}} journey to India and to avenge the Portuguese losses in Calicut. Cabral was selected to command this [...] "Revenge Fleet", as it was called. For eight months Cabral made all preparations, but for reasons which remain uncertain, he was relieved of command. It had apparently been proposed to give another navigator, Vicente Sodré, independent command over {{a section of the}} fleet, and Cabral strongly opposed this. Whether he was dismissed or requested himself that he be relieved of command, the result was that when the fleet departed in March 1502, its commander was Vasco da Gama—a maternal nephew of Vicente Sodré—and not Cabral. It is known that hostility had developed between a faction supporting da Gama and another supporting Cabral. At some point, Cabral left the court permanently. The King was greatly irritated by the feud, {{to such an extent that}} mentioning the matter in his presence could result in banishment, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> one of da Gama's supporters.|$|E

500|$|Romantic {{notions of}} the 1920s as a more {{innocent}} period are put aside in favor of depicting Los Angeles as ruled by a despotic political infrastructure, steeped in sadistic, systematic corruption throughout the city government, police force and medical establishment. In {{addition to being a}} Kafkaesque drama about the search for a missing child, the film also focuses on issues relevant to the modern era. Eastwood noted a correlation between the corruption of 1920s Los Angeles and that of the modern era, manifesting in the egos of a police force that thinks it cannot be wrong {{and the way in which}} powerful organizations justify the use of corruption. [...] " [...] Los Angeles police department every so often seems to go into a period of corruption," [...] he said, [...] "It's happened even in recent years... so it was nice to comment [...] by going back to real events in 1928." [...] Eastwood said that Los Angeles had always been seen as [...] "glamorous", but he believed there had never been a [...] "golden age" [...] in the city. In Changeling, this dissonance manifests in the actions of Arthur Hutchins, who travels to the city in the hope of meeting his favorite actor. Eastwood said that given the corruption that the story covers, Hutchins' naïvete seemed [...] "bizarre". As a lesson in democratic activism, the film shows what it takes to provoke people to speak against unchecked authority, no matter the consequences. Richard Brody of The New Yorker said this rang as true for 1928 Los Angeles <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> Poland in 1980 or Pakistan in 2008. The film directly quotes Chief of police James E. Davis: [...] "We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least bit of mercy to a criminal." [...] It compares police excess to the vigilantism of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, as the department's [...] "Gun Squad" [...] carries out illegal executions of criminals—"not to stamp out crime... but 'competition. The pressure from the police hierarchy was a motivator for officers to quickly solve Walter Collins' disappearance, and a potential reason why they ignored the fact they had returned the wrong child.|$|E
