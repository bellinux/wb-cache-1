25|$|In {{very severe}} myelosuppression, which occurs in some regimens, {{almost all the}} bone marrow stem cells (cells that produce white and red blood cells) are destroyed, meaning <b>allogenic</b> or {{autologous}} bone marrow cell transplants are necessary. (In autologous BMTs, cells are removed from the patient before the treatment, multiplied and then re-injected afterward; in <b>allogenic</b> BMTs, the source is a donor.) However, some patients still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, The Perth Group {{questioned}} {{the existence of}} HIV, and speculated that the production of antibodies recognizing HIV proteins {{can be caused by}} <b>allogenic</b> stimuli and autoimmune disorders. They continued to repeat this speculation through at least 2006.|$|E
25|$|Jehovah's Witnesses reject transfusions {{of whole}} <b>allogenic</b> blood and its primary {{components}} (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma), and transfusions of stored autologous blood or its primary components. As a doctrine, Jehovah's Witnesses do not reject transfusion of whole autologous blood {{so long as}} it is not stored prior to surgery (e.g. peri-operative extraction and transfusion of autologous blood). This religious position is due to their belief that blood is sacred and represents life in God's eyes. Jehovah's Witnesses understand scriptures such as Leviticus 17:10-14 (which speaks of not eating blood) and Acts 15:29 ("abstain from blood") to include taking blood into the body via a transfusion. Controversy has stemmed, however, from what critics state are inconsistencies in Witness policies on blood, claims that Witness patients are coerced into refusing blood and that Watch Tower literature distorts facts about transfusions and fails to provide information that would allow Witnesses to make an informed decision on the issue.|$|E
500|$|Wookey Hole {{is on the}} {{southern}} escarpment of the Mendip Hills, and is the resurgence which drains {{the southern}} flanks of North Hill and Pen Hill. [...] It is the second largest resurgence on Mendip, with an estimated catchment area of , and an average discharge of [...] per second. Some of the water is <b>allogenic</b> in origin i.e. drained off non-limestone rocks, collecting as streams on the surface before sinking {{at or near the}} Lower Limestone Shale— Black Rock Limestone boundary, often through swallets such as Plantation Swallet near St Cuthbert's lead works between the Hunter's Lodge Inn and Priddy Pools. It then passes through major cave systems such as Swildon's Hole, Eastwater Cavern and St Cuthbert's Swallet, around Priddy, but 95% is water that has percolated directly into the limestone.|$|E

5000|$|In {{allogeneic}} cell therapy the donor {{is a different}} person to {{the recipient of the}} cells. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, the <b>allogenic</b> methodology is promising because unmatched <b>allogenic</b> therapies can form the basis of [...] "off the shelf" [...] products. There is research interest in attempting to develop such products to treat conditions including Crohn's disease and a variety of vascular conditions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Allogenic</b> {{bone marrow}} {{transplantation}} has been investigated {{in the treatment of}} HTLV-1 disease with varied results. One case report describes an HTLV-1 infected woman who developed chronic refractory eczema, corneal injury and adult T cell leukemia. She was subsequently treated with <b>allogenic</b> stem cell transplantation and had complete resolution of symptoms. One year post-transplant, she has had no recurrence of any symptoms, and furthermore has had a decrease in her proviral load.|$|E

5000|$|Ways {{to avoid}} the adverse events {{associated}} with <b>allogenic</b> transfusion are often grouped under the umbrella phrase bloodless surgery. There are several so-called bloodless options. These include: ...|$|E
50|$|Climatic {{factors may}} be very important, but on a much longer {{time-scale}} than any other. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns will promote changes in communities. As the climate warmed {{at the end of}} each ice age, great successional changes took place. The tundra vegetation and bare glacial till deposits underwent succession to mixed deciduous forest. The greenhouse effect resulting in increase in temperature is likely to bring profound <b>Allogenic</b> changes in the next century. Geological and climatic catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, avalanches, meteors, floods, fires, and high wind also bring <b>allogenic</b> changes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allogenic</b> {{succession}} {{is caused}} by external environmental influences and not by the vegetation. For example, soil changes due to erosion, leaching or the deposition of silt and clays can alter the nutrient content and water relationships in the ecosystems. Animals also {{play an important role}} in <b>allogenic</b> changes as they are pollinators, seed dispersers and herbivores. They can also increase nutrient content of the soil in certain areas, or shift soil about (as termites, ants, and moles do) creating patches in the habitat. This may create regeneration sites that favor certain species.|$|E
50|$|The {{only known}} cure for CAEBV is <b>allogenic</b> haematopoietic stem cell {{transplant}} (HSCT), {{with all other}} treatment options (rituximab, cytotoxic chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy) being nothing more than stopgaps.|$|E

50|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} are {{currently}} under clinical trials as a possible treatment for graft v. host disease and graft rejection after experiments on various animals showing that <b>allogenic</b> stem cell treatments were not rejected and showed no difference in healing capabilities compared with autologous stem cells. This is being further researched for creating off-the-shelf <b>allogenic</b> stem cell treatments for various aspects in regenerative veterinary medicine. Clinical trials are underway to explore the low immunogenic properties of stem cells and their possible use for treatment of problems with an overactive immune system seen with allergies and autoimmune disorders.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{documented}} use of [...] "self-donated" [...] {{blood was}} in 1818, {{and interest in}} the practice continued until the Second World War, at which point blood supply became less of an issue due to the increased number of blood donors. Later, interest in the procedure returned with concerns about <b>allogenic</b> (separate-donor) transfusions. Autotransfusion is used {{in a number of}} orthopedic, trauma, and cardiac cases, amongst others. Where appropriate, it carries certain advantages -including the reduction of infection risk, and the provision of more functional cells not subjected to the significant storage durations common among banked <b>allogenic</b> (separate-donor) blood products.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, doctor George Mikhail {{performed}} Detroit's first Mohs Micrographic Surgery, {{a procedure}} to remove skin cancers. In 1968, the first <b>allogenic</b> kidney transplant in Detroit {{was done by}} doctors D. Emerick Szilagyi, Joseph P. Elliott and Roger F. Smith.|$|E

50|$|It is an <b>allogenic</b> stem therapy {{based on}} mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) {{derived from the}} bone marrow of adult donors. MSCs are {{purified}} from the marrow, cultured and packaged, with up to 10,000 doses derived from a single donor. The doses are stored frozen until needed.|$|E
50|$|An animal's {{exposure}} to the antigens of a different member of the same or similar species is allostimulation, and the tissue is <b>allogenic.</b> Transplanted organs are often acquired from a cadaver (usually a host who had succumbed to trauma), whose tissues had already sustained ischemia or inflammation.|$|E
50|$|Solar neon is neon {{that has}} been made in the Sun and {{transmitted}} to Earth as ions in the solar wind. It is distinguished from <b>allogenic</b> neon (that is, neon created in other ways) by its isotopic abundance, since solar neon is created directly via nuclear fusion, instead of via planetary nuclear fission.|$|E
5000|$|United Therapeutics is also {{developing}} a unique type of biologic medicinal product {{known as a}} manufactured organ.  This type of biologic would be transplanted into the patient {{as a substitute for}} a failing organ.  The company has regenerative medicine products such as these being developed via xenotransplantation, <b>allogenic</b> recellularization and autologous bioprinting technologies.|$|E
5000|$|One {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} the anterior chamber is dampened immune response to <b>allogenic</b> grafts. This is called anterior chamber associated immune deviation (ACAID), a term introduced in 1981 by Streilein et al. This phenomenon is relevant {{to the fact that}} the eye is considered an [...] "immune privileged site", like the brain and the testis.|$|E
50|$|Authigenesis is {{the process}} whereby a mineral or {{sedimentary}} rock deposit is generated where it is found or observed. Such deposits are described as authigenic. Authigenic sedimentary minerals form during sedimentation by precipitation or recrystallization instead of being transported from elsewhere (<b>allogenic)</b> by water or wind. Authigenic sediments are the main constituents of deep sea sedimentation. Authigenic clays tend to reduce the porosity of sediments, thus reducing permeability.|$|E
50|$|As of November 2013, {{researchers}} at the Seoul National University Hospital will be looking to recruit participants into a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of <b>allogenic</b> adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ALLO-ASC) {{for the treatment of}} a lateral epicondylitis tendon injury where the duration of the symptoms is over six months. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells will be administrated to the patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) by an ultrasonographic-guided injection.|$|E
50|$|The lack of durable {{heart valve}} {{prostheses}} for young patients has driven forward research in tissue engineering approaches for valve replacement. Current tissue-engineering concepts {{are based on}} either artificial polymeric or biological scaffolds, derived from donated human tissue (<b>allogenic)</b> or animals (xenogenic). While more readily available, {{there have been reports}} of dramatic failure in the use of xenogeneic matrices in paediatric patients, leading to scepticism regarding their application.|$|E
