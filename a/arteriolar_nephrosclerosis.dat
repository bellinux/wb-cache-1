40|$|Malignant {{hypertension}} {{is closely}} associated with impairment of multiple organs, and renal dysfunction remains an important cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in patients with malignant hypertension. The renal histopathological changes usually indicate malignant <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> (MANS) that is characterised by fibrinoid necrosis in small arteries. However, renal biopsies were not taken routinely in previous reports. We report an educational case of malignant hypertension caused by MANS leading to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) ...|$|E
40|$|Increased plasma {{fibrinogen}} levels and hemostatic abnormalities suggestive of a prothrombotic state {{are present in}} patients with endstage renal failure and could contribute to increased cardiovascular morbidity in these patients. We investigated the relationship between abnormalities of the hemostatic system {{and the degree of}} renal failure and whether these abnormalities are associated with increased prevalence of cardiovascular events in patients with <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis.</b> in 425 patients recruited at a hypertension clinic we assessed the renal function by creatinine clearance, urinary protein excretion, and microalbuminuria, the prevalence of atherosclerotic disease. and measured prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2), D-dimer, and antithrombin. Early impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance, 30 to 89 ml/min per 1. 73 m(2) of body surface area) caused by <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> was found in 172 patients. Patients with early renal failure were significanly older and had significantly greater values of blood pressure, plasma fibrinogen, F 1 + 2, and D-dimer than patients with normal renal function. Elevated D-dimer and {{fibrinogen levels}} were independently associated with the presence of decreased creatinine clearance. Log fibrinogen, log F 1 + 2, and log D-dimer were inversely correlated with creatinine clearance. The prevalence of coronary artery, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease was significantly greater in patients with mild renal failure than in those with normal renal function. Elevated levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer were associated with the presence of atherosclerotic disease independent of renal function and other risk factors. In conclusion, changes in hemostatic parameters occur early in the course of renal failure in patients with <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis,</b> suggesting a prothrombotic state that may contribute to the risk for atherosclerotic disease at all levels of renal function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} the association between pathological types of kidney and clinical manifestations in patients with hypertensive nephropathy. The blood pressure, fundus, urinalysis test results and renal func-tion changes were analysed in patients who were treated for hypertensive nephropathy. Downward kidney puncture biopsy was performed using a 16 G ejection needle with the aid of B ultrasound in 47 cases. The specimens were observed using light microscopy and immunofluorescence. The pathological changes observed in the patients exhibiting symptoms of hypertensive nephropathy varied. The majority of clinical manifestations were benign <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis,</b> hyaline degeneration of the renal artery and the appearance of a thickened wall of a thickened renal artery wall. Severe cases showed malignant <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> characterised by fibrinoid necrosis of renal arterioles and intimal hyperplasia. In addition, in the severe cases, fibrinoid necrosis of the afferent arteriole and arcuate artery wall was observed, with severe interlobular artery and arcuate artery myointimal thickening. Renal biopsy in patients with hypertensive nephropathy is safe and feasible. The prognosis and treatment of pathological and clinical disease related to renal pathology is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous cardiac and renal lesions in AP A hamsters were {{examined}} histopathologically. Myocardial degeneration, valvular thickening, coronary arterial degeneration and increase in heart weight were common in old hamsters. These changes, which suggest cardiac failure, {{seem to be}} related to cardiac thrombosis which predominantly affected the left atrium and was found in over 40 % of each sex over 16 months of age. Neither glomerular amyloidosis nor <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> was detected. In gen-eral the histopathology of renal lesions in AP A hamsters resembled that of the condition known as glomerulonephrosis in rats. Renal lesions occurred more frequently and more severely and developed more rapidly in females than in males. There was no apparent correlation between cardiac thrombosis and renal disease...|$|E
40|$|SALT {{restriction}} in {{the treatment}} of hypertension was first advocated more than a half-century ago. 1 The subsequent history of this therapeutic measure has been reviewed, 2 ' 3 and it has also been reported that hyperten-sive patients with secondary renal damage or with primary renal disease may be benefited. 4 The present study was undertaken to study further the effects of sodium chloride restriction in patients with primary hypertension who had ad-vanced <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis.</b> CASE MATERIAL AND METHODS Four men and two women with documented primary hypertension, clinically in the accelerated ("malignant") phase, were studied on the wards of the Presbyterian Hospital. All were known to have developed their proteinuria subsequent to the discovery of an elevated blood pressure. At the time of admission they had the following common features: marked nonlabile hypertension, proteinuria with a few red cells in the urinar...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{investigations}} reported in this thesis was {{to test the hypothesis}} of Doctor Séan Moore, that platelet emboli arising from complicated les ions of the aorta, above the renal orifices, were responsible for the renal <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> commonly seen in human essential hypertension. A technique was devised whereby a catheter bearing exposed magnesium-aluminum wire was placed in the thoracic aortas of rabbits, dogs, rats and monkeys. This embolic source resulted in scattered areas of renal cortical atrophy which were subtended by arterioles showing extensive intimal hyperplasia. The medial cells of these arterioles, especially in the rabbit, were transformed to granule-containing cells with supposed secretory function. Animals with this lesion became hypertensive. A correlative study of renal renin, plasma renin, renal arteriolar granularity and hypertension revealed that in the acute phase of micro-embolic hypertension there is evidence for the participation of renin-angiotensin system; however, in the chronic phase there is none...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{contraceptive}} {{therapy was}} responsible for two episodes of severe hypertension in a young woman. On the second occasion she developed malignant <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> that progressed to end-stage renal failure before the contraceptive therapy was stopped. She is now well, requiring no antihypertensive medications, after maintenance hemodialysis, bilateral nephrectomy, and kidney transplantation. The implications of this rare but not unexpected complication from the casual use of hormonal contraceptives are discussed. ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES increase the blood pressure of some women (1 - 5). In at least two cases their use {{has been associated with}} the development of malig-nant hypertension that remitted after the drug was withdrawn (6, 7). We present the case of a woman who had two episodes of severe hypertension while taking oral contraceptives. The relationship between the contraceptives and her hypertension was not realized. During the second episode the drug was not withdrawn until after she had developed irre-versible end-stage renal failure from malignant arteri-olar nephrosclerosis. Case Report A 29 -year-old negro woman was admitted to our hemodialysis unit in January 1971. Her clinical cours...|$|E
40|$|Orleans, La. 70112). Quantitative {{measures}} {{of the severity of}} hypertensive neph-rosclerosis. Amer. J. Epid., 1970, 97 : 2 5 - 3 1. — A method is described whereby hiitologic sections of renal tissue obtained at autopsy can be used to measure separately the amounts of arterial and of <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis</b> in a way which is more nearly objective than previous methods, and which yields values on a continuous rather than a step scale of severity. The amount of error caused by variations in the observer {{from time to time and}} by irregularity of distribution of the disease among different samples of the renal substance is estimated. The method appears to be ready for general use in the epidemiologic study of neph-rosderosb. arteries; autopsy; blood pressure; hospital records; kidney; nephrosclerosis In the kidneys of hypertensive human subjects examined at autopsy, the patholo-gist usually expects to find in histologic sections a certain set of morphologic alter-ations in the arterioles and small arteries (1 - 3). Those various changes, taken to-gether, are sometimes viewed as repre-senting manifestations of a single disease process. Although both arteries and arteri-oles are involved, this disease is usually called "arteriolar nephrosclerosis", since small arteries are often not distinguished from arterioles. The present report deals with a method which was designed to esti-mate the severity of these vascular changes present in the renal mass of autopsied hu-man subjects. The method consists of preparing six periodic-acid Schiff-stained histologic sec-tions from representative parts of bot...|$|E
40|$|AIM: This paper reviews {{progression}} in renal diseases. METHODS: An English language {{literature search}} using Medline (1980 January- 2001 July) {{was done to}} assess research and review articles on progression in renal diseases. RESULTS: Factors that {{increase the risk of}} progression in renal diseases are hypertension, dyslipidaemia, underlying nephropathy, high dietary protein intake and proteinuria. Others are smoking, hyperglycemia, low birth weight, obesity, metabolic syndrome X, genetic factors such as angiotensin converting enzyme 'DD' genotype and chromosome 1 q 21, and exposure to lead. Hypertension induces <b>arteriolar</b> <b>nephrosclerosis.</b> The mechanisms whereby lipids contribute to vascular and renal injury are incompletely understood. Glomerular hyperperfusion and increased proteinuria may explain the adverse effects of increased protein intake on renal disease progression. Proteinuria contains numerous toxic/inflammatory systems that promote progression. Cigarette smoking has vasoconstrictive, thrombotic and direct toxic effects on the vascular epithelium. Hyperglycemia is strongly implicated in the progression of complications in diabetics. Oligonephropathy in low birth weight has been suggested to increase the risk for systemic and glomerular hypertension in adult life. In obesity, the combination of hyperfiltration, glomerular hypertrophy and glomerular hypertension is a primary initiating event for glomerular injury manifesting as glomerulomegally and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria. Angiotensin I, with enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism, especially the "DD" genotype, predisposes to a rapid decline in renal function. Finally, long-term exposure to low levels of environmental lead affects renal function. CONCLUSION: The control of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, proteinuria, obesity, avoidance of low birth weight, smoking and heavy metals such as lead are intervention strategies for preventing progression of renal diseases...|$|E
