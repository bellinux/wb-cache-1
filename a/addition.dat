5|$|A {{far-reaching}} {{generalization of}} <b>addition</b> of natural numbers is the <b>addition</b> of ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers in set theory. These give two different generalizations of <b>addition</b> of natural numbers to the transfinite. Unlike most <b>addition</b> operations, <b>addition</b> of ordinal numbers is not commutative. <b>Addition</b> of cardinal numbers, however, is a commutative operation {{closely related to}} the disjoint union operation.|$|E

5|$|A one-story kitchen <b>addition,</b> {{built in}} 1961–1962 and {{measuring}} about , {{extends from the}} northwest side of the original 1855 house. The <b>addition</b> has a gabled standing seam metal roof, and its exterior is covered in white-painted board-and-batten siding. It has a vinyl bay window on the southwest side, a one-over-one double-hung vinyl window on the northeast side and a door (adjoining {{the wall of the}} 1855 house) on the southeast side. An enclosed board-and-batten porch, measuring about , and a shed roof extend from the front (southwest) of the kitchen <b>addition.</b> The original basement under the 1855 house is accessible through this porch extension. A ghost building outline on the northwest side of the 1855 house indicates an earlier structure where the present kitchen <b>addition</b> stands.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} transit room {{conversion}} to office space {{the building has}} seen other major work in the past. The southwest {{corner of the building}} was built in 1956, of cream colored brick, to house additional classrooms and office space. The <b>addition</b> of 1956 took special care to replicate nearly every aspect of the original building except for color. Another major <b>addition</b> occurred in 1966 with the construction of the large east wing. Of the same cream colored brick as the 1956 <b>addition,</b> it also tried to mimic the building's finer details. The 1966 east wing <b>addition</b> provided for, again, more office space, but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a radio telescope laboratory. The observatory basement and the dome housing the refractor are still in use by the astronomy department at U of I and the University of Illinois Astronomical Society, a student organization on campus.|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} {{transient}} plastic phase process, the SiC silicon carbide kiln furniture materials were produced through adding Si powder to SiC materials. At {{the condition of}} the same <b>additions</b> of SiO 2 powder, the effect of the Si powder <b>additions</b> on properties of silicon carbide materials after sintered at 1450 °C for 3 h in air atmosphere was studied by means of SEM and other analysis methods.

When the Si powder <b>additions</b> is lower than 3. 5 %, the density and strength of samples increase and porosity decrease with increasing Si powder <b>additions.</b> However when the Si powder <b>additions</b> is higher than 3. 5 %, the density and strength of samples decrease and porosity increase with increasing Si powder <b>additions.</b> With increasing of Si <b>additions,</b> the residual strength of sample after thermal shocked increased and linear change rate decreased, and get to boundary value when Si <b>additions</b> is 4. 5 %.
