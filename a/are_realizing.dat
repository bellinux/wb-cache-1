25|$|There {{are many}} {{workplace}} policies that can alleviate {{the burden of}} work–family balance for many middle-class families. Some options in family-friendly workplaces include providing paid leave or options for reduced hours. Workplaces <b>are</b> <b>realizing</b> that employees with well balanced family and work lives are actually valuable to firms: workplace childcare assistance can increase productivity and morale among employees, as well as lessen turnover, accidents, and absenteeism. Childcare options for working parents can be key in workplace satisfaction. Workplace supports such as personal time off, paid leave, on-site or nearby childcare, financial assistance for childcare, and other family-friendly policies are Western European workplace norms that could solve the work–family balance problem in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Parenting {{is a large}} task within itself, {{and when}} a parent has a career as well, it can cause a double burden, or work–family conflict. Strain begins to develop when women and men find that the demands of their family are {{conflicting}} with the demands from their job. When one is faced with a double burden like this, it affects how decisions are made within a career and in a family; this burden could potentially effect when a couple decides to have children. 75% of all women who have jobs are in their childbearing prime. When the conflict between one's family and work presents itself, the unpaid work that is being done in the home may be cut down, because of the certain health effects, or {{as a solution to}} deal with the greater demands from the workplace. Social outings and visits, and family dinners are two of the first things that get cut back on due to the work/family conflict. In a study by Ari Väänänen, May V. Kevin, et al. found that if a man put a higher importance on their family, were more likely to stay home from work {{in order to deal with}} extreme family demands. Ways that the double burden can be lessened for is with hired help in the house, day-care facilities, and longer maternity leaves for women. For instance, in Norway women are allowed the options of 10months of maternity leave, where they will get 100% of their pay, or 12months leave, where they will only paid 80% of their earnings. Some companies <b>are</b> <b>realizing</b> the effect the double burden of work and a family is having on their employees and are offering flexible work schedules in order to help their employees cope. Not only do these flexible hours help the employee deal with their stress, but it also benefits the company because workers are happier, less likely to be absent, more productive, and the turnover rate is lower for the company. As Sophia Mwangi says, [...] "Parenthood is a joy. Let us never be burdened by it but let's celebrate the joy that it brings. Celebrate those first steps or words, the first school play, their graduation day, passing those exams, landing their first job, getting married, making you grandparents. Whatever it is, let's celebrate our children. It's not easy, but the art of juggling can always be mastered!" ...|$|E

A new study on fatherhood (2010) shows that more men are looking for alternatives to their 40-hour workweek in order {{to spend more time}} with their family. [...] Though working less means a smaller paycheck and higher stress levels, men are looking for flexibility just as much as women. [...] However, with an ever-changing [...] society, flexibility is becoming much more apparent. [...] "It seems that some traditional stereotypes are starting to lessen just a bit in terms of who’s responsible for care of the children" [...] says human resource specialist Steve Moore.

2500|$|At {{the state}} level, California {{was the first}} state to offer paid family leave {{benefits}} for its workers. While the benefits only last for 6 weeks [...] this is the first major step for maternity leave in the United States. New Jersey lawmakers are pushing legislation that would make their state the second state to add this worker benefit. Under one New Jersey proposal, workers who take leave would be paid through the state’s temporary disability insurance fund, [...] "augmented by a 0.1 percent charge on workers’ weekly wages." [...] Traditionally, many conservatives have opposed paid family leave, but there is a sign that this mindset is beginning to change. Reverend Paul Schenck, a prominent member of the National Pro-Life Action Center recently stated that he would support paid maternity leave on the assumption that it might encourage women to follow through with their pregnancies instead of having abortions.
