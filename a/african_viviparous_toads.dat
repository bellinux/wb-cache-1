It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and {{includes}} significant portions of Mont Nimba, a geographically unique area with more than 200 endemic species and a rich fauna and flora including duikers, big cats (lion and leopard), civets, and two species of <b>viviparous</b> <b>toad.</b>|$|R
50|$|The western Nimba toad or Mt. Nimba <b>viviparous</b> <b>toad</b> (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis) is {{a species}} of toad from {{highlands}} in the Mount Nimba region of Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea. This Critically endangered species is threatened by habitat loss, and mining of iron ore and bauxite. This and the equally threatened N. liberiensis are the only frogs/toads that are viviparous; it is possible liberiensis should be included as a subspecies of N. occidentalis.|$|R
50|$|Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve is a {{protected}} area and UNESCO World Heritage Site located in both Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire, extending over {{a total of}} area of 17,540 hectares, with 12,540 hectares in Guinea, and 5,000 hectares in Côte d'Ivoire. The reserve covers significant portions of the Nimba Range, a geographically unique area with unusually rich flora and fauna, including exceptional numbers of single-site endemic species, such as <b>viviparous</b> <b>toads,</b> and horseshoe bats. Its highest peak is Mount Richard-Molard at 1,752 m (5,750 ft), which is the highest peak of both countries.|$|R
50|$|The Nimba Range {{harbours}} {{an especially}} rich flora and fauna, {{and it is}} the home of more than 2000 vascular plant species, 317 vertebrate species, 107 of which are mammals, and to more than 2,500 invertebrate species. Notably endemic vertebrates are Nimba <b>viviparous</b> <b>toad</b> (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis), Lamotte's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros lamottei), and Nimba otter shrew (Micropotamogale lamottei).

40|$|A {{putative}} {{driver of}} global amphibian decline is the panzootic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). While Bd {{has been documented}} across continental Africa, its distribution in West Africa remains ambiguous. We tested 793 West African amphibians (one caecilian and 61 anuran species) {{for the presence of}} Bd. The samples originated from seven West African countries - Be´nin, Burkina Faso, Coˆ te d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone - and were collected from a variety of habitats, ranging from lowland rainforests to montane forests, montane grasslands to humid and dry lowland savannahs. The species investigated comprised various life-history strategies, but we focused particularly on aquatic and riparian species. We used diagnostic PCR to screen 656 specimen swabs and histology to analyse 137 specimen toe tips. All samples tested negative for Bd, including a widespread habitat generalist Hoplobatrachus occipitalis which is intensively traded on the West African food market and thus could be a potential dispersal agent for Bd. Continental fine-grained (30 arc seconds) environmental niche models suggest that Bd should have a broad distribution across West Africa that includes most of the regions and habitats that we surveyed. The surprising apparent absence of Bd in West Africa indicates that the Dahomey Gap may have acted as a natural barrier. Herein we highlight the importance of this Bd-free region of the African continent - especially for the long-term conservation of several threatened species depending on fast flowing forest streams (Conraua alleni (‘‘Vulnerable’’) and Petropedetes natator (‘‘Near Threatened’’)) as well as the ‘‘Critically Endangered’’ <b>viviparous</b> <b>toad</b> endemic to the montane grasslands of Mount Nimba (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis) German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) through the BIOTA-West project (01 LC 0617 J).

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the distribution of}} the <b>viviparous</b> Nimba <b>toad</b> Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis throughout its potential range, the montane grasslands of the Monts Nimba massif, West Africa. Although predominantly part of a World Heritage Site, the Monts Nimba also comprise a mining enclave in the northwestern part of the mountain massif. The present study revealed that the Nimba toad seems to have its most viable populations within the mining enclave (Mont Sempéré) or directly adjacent to it (Grands Rochers). These 2 populations and a third, presumably isolated one (Mont Richard Molard), may be source populations, whereas other smaller populations are likely to be sinks. We generally recorded lower toad densities than in earlier studies and failed to confirm the toads’ presence in parts of their former known range. Some of these changes might be due to an increased frequency of fires in recent years, resulting in the loss of a thick layer of grass roots on the rocky underground. However, the most imminent threat to the toads’ survival at present is the proposed mining project in the core area of their range. It is thus imperative that the Critically Endangered status of the Nimba toad be retained for the present. However, a broader and more in-depth study of the population sizes, population genetics and the microhabitat needs is urgently needed...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{morphological}} {{and physiological}} changes involved in pregnancy in live-bearing reptiles are well studied, the genetic mechanisms that underlie {{these changes are}} not known. We used the <b>viviparous</b> <b>African</b> Ocellated Skink, Chalcides ocellatus, as a model to identify a near complete gene expression profile associated with pregnancy using RNA-Seq analyses of uterine transcriptomes. Pregnancy in C. ocellatus is associated with upregulation of uterine genes involved with metabolism, cell proliferation and death, and cellular transport. Moreover, there are clear parallels between the genetic processes associated with pregnancy in mammals and Chalcides in expression of genes related to tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, immune system regulation, and nutrient provisioning to the embryo. In particular, the pregnant uterine transcriptome is dominated by expression of proteolytic enzymes that we speculate are involved both with remodeling the chorioallantoic placenta and histotrophy in the omphaloplacenta. Elements of the maternal innate immune system are downregulated in the pregnant uterus, indicating a potential mechanism to avoid rejection of the embryo. We found a downregulation of major histocompatability complex loci and estrogen and progesterone receptors in the pregnant uterus. This pattern is similar to mammals but cannot {{be explained by the}} mammalian model. The latter finding provides evidence that pregnancy is controlled by different endocrinological mechanisms in mammals and reptiles. Finally, 88 % of the identified genes are expressed in both the pregnant and the nonpregnant uterus, and thus, morphological and physiologica...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tsetse flies, vectors of <b>African</b> trypanosomes, undergo <b>viviparous</b> {{reproduction}} (the {{deposition of}} live offspring). This reproductive strategy {{results in a}} large maternal investment and the deposition of {{a small number of}} progeny during a female's lifespan. The reproductive biology of tsetse has been studied on a physiological level; however the molecular analysis of tsetse reproduction requires deeper investigation. To build a foundation from which to base molecular studies of tsetse reproduction, a cDNA library was generated from female tsetse (Glossina morsitans morsitans) reproductive tissues and the intrauterine developmental stages. 3438 expressed sequence tags were sequenced and analyzed. Results Analysis of a nonredundant catalogue of 1391 contigs resulted in 520 predicted proteins. 475 of these proteins were full length. We predict that 412 of these represent cytoplasmic proteins while 57 are secreted. Comparison of these proteins with other tissue specific tsetse cDNA libraries (salivary gland, fat body/milk gland, and midgut) identified 51 that are unique to the reproductive/immature cDNA library. 11 unique proteins were homologus to uncharacterized putative proteins within the NR database suggesting the identification of novel genes associated with reproductive functions in other insects (hypothetical conserved). The analysis also yielded seven putative proteins without significant homology to sequences present in the public database (unknown genes). These proteins may represent unique functions associated with tsetse's viviparous reproductive cycle. RT-PCR analysis of hypothetical conserved and unknown contigs was performed to determine basic tissue and stage specificity of the expression of these genes. Conclusion This paper identifies 51 putative proteins specific to a tsetse reproductive/immature EST library. 11 of these proteins correspond to hypothetical conserved genes and 7 proteins are tsetse specific. </p...|$|R
