40|$|Electronic funds {{transfer}} (EFT) {{consists of a}} group of technologies that allow financial transactions to be carried out electronically. Messages sent by several forms of telecommunication cause funds to be transferred from one financial account to another. The messages substitute for an exchange of currency or for a signed check that would bring about the same transfer. The term EFT has also come to include transfer of information critical to such transactions without an immediate transfer of funds; for example, <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> or validation of checks by telecommunication. Although most EFT technologies are at most 15 years old, they are already having a significant impact on payment systems and on banks and other financial institutions. It is possible that within the next two decades EFT will transform the way Americans carry out their day-to-day commercial activities and personal monetary transactions...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper presents a framework and solution {{for improving the}} efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>authorization</b> processing <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> card transactions using multi-threading and shared-memory pool techniques. Through the use of both techniques, a prototype of a real-time multi-threaded authorization system has been developed with Java platforms to overcome the slow sequential <b>authorization</b> processing <b>of</b> a single threaded model <b>of</b> current <b>credit</b> card <b>authorization</b> systems. Via multi-threading technique, it allows parallel execution of the validation functional units involved during the <b>authorization</b> process <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> card transaction through multiple threads. It also enables a separate thread to be executed {{in the background of}} the process to perform data synchronization maintained in the shared-memory pool with the main system database. Shared-memory pool has been used to provide a global point of access to the card information kept in the random access memory. During the authorization process, the respective worker thread performs a binary search to obtain the authentication data from the shared memory instead of the system database to hasten the <b>authorization</b> process <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> card transactions. Performancetesting has been carried out to measure the efficiency of a fixed number <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> card <b>authorization</b> processes running between the single-threaded and the multi-threaded authorization systems in a workstation using similar hardware capabilities. Specially-embedded tools are incorporated in the payment gateway applications to obtain the length of end-to-end execution...|$|R

50|$|In some cases, ease {{of access}} is {{balanced}} against the strictness of access checks. For example, {{the credit card}} network {{does not require a}} personal identification number for authentication of the claimed identity, and a small transaction usually does not require a signature of the authenticated person for proof <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> the transaction. The security of the system is maintained by limiting distribution <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> card numbers, and by the threat of punishment for fraud.|$|R
