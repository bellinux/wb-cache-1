5000|$|On June 29, 2008, a {{court in}} Paris, France, awarded damages of 40 million euros (US $63 million) to luxury goods group LVMH over eBay <b>auctions</b> <b>of</b> {{counterfeit}} bags, perfumes and other items. The plaintiffs further alleged that <b>auctions</b> <b>of</b> legitimate perfumes were also illegal, because, they claim, only authorized resellers {{are permitted to}} sell them, and authorized resellers {{are not permitted to}} sell on eBay. The court agreed, entering a permanent injunction against eBay <b>auctions</b> <b>of</b> LVMH perfumes, whether counterfeit or not. eBay announced that French users would be barred from buying or selling LVMH perfumes and cosmetics on any of eBay's sites.|$|R
5|$|The {{book was}} {{originally}} produced {{in a limited}} edition of only seven copies, each handwritten and illustrated by J. K. Rowling.

5|$|After these changes, the {{legislature}} {{of the new}} state began to organize counties. Three 320-acre sites in Kiowa, Caddo and Comanche counties were selected for county seats, with Lawton designated as the Comanche County seat. The town was named for Major General Henry W. Lawton, a quartermaster at Fort Sill, who had taken part in the pursuit and capture of Geronimo. The city was opened to settlement through an <b>auction</b> <b>of</b> town lots beginning on August 6, 1901, which was completed 60 days later. By September 25, 1901, the Rock Island Railroad expanded to Lawton and was soon joined by the Frisco Line. The first city elections were held October 24, 1901.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} price {{paths in}} sequential ascending <b>auctions</b> <b>of</b> identical rare books in Australia. Economic theory is inconclusive but suggests prices in sequential <b>auctions</b> <b>of</b> identical objects should follow flat or rising paths. The empirical literature is {{in several ways}} unsatisfactory, but points most commonly to falling price paths. Data from rare book auctions promise to overcome {{some of the problems}} in the empirical literature. A preliminary examination <b>of</b> rare book <b>auction</b> data from Australia indicates prices tended to be equal in sequential <b>auctions</b> <b>of</b> identical b o o b in the 1980 s and 1990 s, and unequal in the 1970 s. These results are consistent with the conjecture that more mature auction markets feature flatter price paths in sequential <b>auctions</b> <b>of</b> identical assets. Rare book auctions are a context in which jkrther progress on sequential auctions is likely. * The author is grateful to Professor John Creedy, and to Mrs Jill Burdon for her advice about interpreting the book auction records. 1...|$|R
5|$|In 1874, in a {{district}} court case, Deady {{ruled in favor of}} Marcus Neff in a lawsuit against Sylvester Pennoyer concerning unpaid legal fees to John H. Mitchell and a sheriff's <b>auction</b> <b>of</b> Neff's land to Pennoyer. The case would become the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision of Pennoyer v. Neff that helped define the law of personal jurisdiction. In 1885, Deady admitted Mary Leonard to the federal bar, the first woman admitted to practice in Oregon, though the Oregon Supreme Court at first denied her admittance to the state bar on technical grounds. Later that year the Oregon legislature resolved the technical issue in the statute and the state high court admitted Leonard into the state bar.|$|E

Galea believes the remaining cartridges can be sold by the city of Alamogordo through the Museum of Space History. She hopes that the sale of these games can help fund recognition of the burial site as a tourist attraction in the future. The City of Alamogordo approved the <b>auction</b> <b>of</b> the games in September 2014, to be sold through eBay and the Alamogordo Council website. As of September 2015, over $107,000 has been raised through the sales of about 880 unearthed cartridges, with one E.T. copy selling for more than $1,500. About 300 cartridges remain to be sold at a later date given the historical value of the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|On Malta, the French had rapidly {{dismantled}} {{the institutions}} of the Knights of St. John, including the Roman Catholic Church. Church property was looted and seized to pay for the expedition to Egypt, an act that generated considerable anger among the deeply religious Maltese population. On 2 September, this anger erupted in a popular uprising during an <b>auction</b> <b>of</b> church property, and within days thousands of Maltese irregulars had driven the French garrison into Valletta. Valletta was surrounded by approximately 10,000 irregular Maltese soldiers led by Emmanuele Vitale and Canon Francesco Saverio Caruana. The Maltese were armed with 23 cannon and a small squadron of coastal gunboats. Although there was intermittent skirmishing between the garrison and the Maltese, the fortress was too strong for the irregulars to assault.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Romney Depot to Depot Valley brought {{residential}} development on the hilltops {{to the west and}} east of Valley. On September27, 1911, George Edward Harmison (1863–1916) conducted a public <b>auction</b> <b>of</b> Valley View farm's fields atop Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River. The land was located atop the hill to the west of Valley. Harmison subdivided the fields into lots, and the planned development was known as the Valley View Addition to Romney. Harmison sold 21 of the land lots at the auction, and several lots were sold privately. A free lot was given to J.H. Newhouse, and Harmison set aside two lots on a bluff for the site of a future hospital, which he planned to deed to any entity willing to build one.|$|E
5|$|All of BA's Concorde fleet {{have been}} grounded, drained of {{hydraulic}} fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn.

On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an <b>auction</b> <b>of</b> British Airways Concorde artefacts, including a nose cone, at Kensington Olympia in London. Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum, in Surrey, England.|$|E
5|$|During the Internet bubble {{that led}} up to 2000, heavy {{investments}} in undersea fibre-optic cables linked Asia {{with the rest of the}} world. The fall that followed the economic boom resulted in the <b>auction</b> <b>of</b> cheap fiber optic cables at one-tenth of their original price. This development resulted in widely available low-cost communications infrastructure. All of these investments and events, not to mention a swell of available talent, resulted in India becoming almost overnight the centre for outsourcing of Business process. Within this sector and events, the ITES-BPO sector has become a big employment generator especially amongst young college graduates. The number of professionals employed by IT and ITES sectors is estimated at around 1.3million as of March 2006. Also, Indian IT-ITES is estimated to have helped create an additional 3 million job opportunities through indirect, induced and in helpful manner have created employment.|$|E

5|$|On Malta, the {{dissolution}} of the Roman Catholic Church under French rule had been extremely unpopular among the native Maltese population. During an <b>auction</b> <b>of</b> church property on 2 September 1798, an armed uprising had begun that had forced the French garrison, commanded by General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois, to retreat into the capital Valletta {{by the end of the}} month. The garrison, which numbered approximately 3,000 men, had limited food stocks, and efforts to bring supplies in by sea were restricted by a squadron of British and Portuguese ships stationed off the harbour. The blockade was under the command of Nelson, now Lord Nelson, based in Palermo on Sicily, and directly managed by Captain Alexander Ball on the ship of the line HMS Alexander. During 1799 a number of factors, including inadequate food production on Malta, lack of resources and troops caused by commitments elsewhere in the Mediterranean and the appearance of a French fleet under Admiral Etienne Eustache Bruix in the Western Mediterranean all contributed to lapses in the blockade. However, despite the trickle of supplies that reached the garrison, Vaubois' troops were beginning to suffer the effects of starvation and disease. Late in the year Ball went ashore assist the Maltese troops conducting the siege and was replaced in command of Alexander by his first lieutenant, William Harrington.|$|E
