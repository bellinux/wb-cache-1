5000|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the shorter trains may have created an even rougher experience than was typical for <b>a</b> <b>Traver</b> Cyclone. It {{was described as a}} [...] "rib tickler" [...] where the side-to-side motion of the cars (particularly on the coaster's rapidly undulating [...] "Jazz Track") would slam riders' ribs to either sides of the cars. This led to problems of low ridership (and particularly repeat ridership) that plagued the other Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters. The smaller-than-usual trains, which like the other Cyclones could only run one-at-a-time, also contributed to this problem.|$|R

50|$|This {{section was}} named after the oldest {{operating}} coaster in the park, Comet, and lies along Spring Creek. This {{is one of the}} oldest areas part of Hersheypark; many rides have come and gone in this area. The park's first water ride, the Mill Chute installed in 1929, was alongside the creek where Great Bear runs today. The original location for the bumper cars, then called the Auto Skooters, is now the SooperDooperLooper Sandwich Stop. There were giant slides on the hill where the Hersheypark Amphitheater is located. A Streco turnpike ride was located underneath the high bridge that crossed Spring Creek to Minetown. In 1932 the Park installed <b>a</b> <b>Traver</b> Tumble Bug ride next to the Mill Chute. It was removed in 1981 to make room for the Wave Swinger. The park's carousel, before being moved to Carousel Circle in 1972, was located along the creek adjacent to the station of Comet. Before SooperDooperLooper came to Comet Hollow in 1977, a Himalaya ride was in that location, and before that, twin Eli Bridge Ferris wheels. A whip, and a station for the Electric Railroad were also located in Comet Hollow at one time.|$|R

40|$|Dutch {{argument}} extraction is {{analyzed in}} {{the version of}} Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar which is sketched in [Pollard&Sag(1994) ], chapter 9. In this version of HPSG the existence of traces is denied and instead extraction information is introduced by lexical rules operating on the features of lexical heads. We present such lexical rules to account for Dutch verb second and the highly idiosyncratic properties of Dutch preposition stranding, thus illustrating the descriptive power of such lexical rules. We also generalize the analysis {{to account for the}} behaviour of Dutch P 0 w. r. t. neuter pronouns and define P 0 in the hierarchical lexicon so that P 0 is disallowed to locally govern any pronoun which denotes a neuter referent. 1 Dutch Verb Second and Preposition Stranding Dutch displays an intriguing idiosyncracy with respect to preposition stranding, as can be read from the contrast between (1 b) and (1 c); (1) a.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of decorating trees. We examine the special case where multiple traversals over a tree are needed for full decoration. We compare three functional approaches that do not recompute any values in successive traversals: a circular program to short-circuit multiple passes, a program with bindings from one traversal to the next to explicitly pass values and finally a monadic program that records a suitable state. Given our criteria, avoiding lazy evaluation {{and the ability to}} memoize the traversals, bindings seem to have the most advantages. 1 Introduction This paper discusses a special form of tree decorations that requires multiple traversals over a tree. Multiple traversals are needed if "global" information must first be gathered before it can be used: information flows from one traversal to the next. Tree decoration in imperative programming is straightforward: attributes are stored in the tree. Therefore, no complications arise when <b>a</b> later <b>trave</b> [...] ...|$|R

Nearctic species recently classified there belong either to Anafroptilum Kluge, 2011 or to Neo-cloeon Traver, 1932, reinstated genus.

40|$|In CDMA mobile networks, callers {{that are}} {{transmitting}} through a power station may cause interference at other power stations. When many users are already con-nected in the network, a new call may cause {{the signal to}} noise ratio to drop below a tolerance threshold. This phenomenon is called “outage ” and it provides an important measure of performance, useful in the design and control of the system. Evaluating this probability analytically has proven unsuccessful and only approximations exist to-day. Direct simulation of such networks is at present very slow because outage occurs infrequently – it may take hours to simulate directly a realistic model if a reasonable precision is desired. Thus this approach is not useful for design problems where one wishes to evaluate and compare performance of many different network models. In this work we implement a change of measure to estimate the outage probability using Importance Sampling. We present a functional estimator and a stochastic approxima-tion method that are capable of learning the best parameters for the change of measure.
