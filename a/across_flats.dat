5000|$|Many {{applications}} use {{air driven}} or {{electric impact wrench}} or impact driver to deliver the amount of shock and torque required to tighten or loosen the different bolts or nuts in use. Inside an impact wrench there is a rotating hammer, usually driven by electricity or air pressure, {{that is used to}} incrementally rotate the output shaft. The impact wrench is designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft via a hammering action. While typical impact wrenches deliver between 500 and 1500 ft-lbs of torque, some larger impact wrenches such as the Ingersoll Rand 599A1 can deliver near 80,000 ft-lb (10850 Nm) of torque which is enough to tighten hex nuts 7" [...] <b>across</b> <b>flats.</b> Even if the socket attached to the impact wrench does not turn, it is still subjected to successive shock blows by the impact wrench's internal hammer(s). These successive blows are often enough to loosen or tighten a tight or corroded nut or bolt or in some cases break or strip the fastener. Impact wrenches are hard on the sockets since the sockets in use also get hammered. Regular chrome plated [...] "hand sockets" [...] like those commonly included with hand ratchet wrench tool sets are not suitable for this kind of high load impact application. Hand sockets, when used with an impact wrench, can break or shatter explosively if they are used with an impact wrench. Impact sockets are specifically designed and manufactured for impact gun use, and are nearly always made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel that is then heat treated for extra durability. Most impact sockets made for [...] "standard" [...] hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design. For more flexibility many impact sockets are made with swivel type socket—socket wrench attachment geometry. These impact sockets are rarely, if ever, chrome-plated, as chrome will chip off under impact use, and the process of chrome plating hardened steel causes some hydrogen embrittlement which can cause parts to crack. Instead, impact sockets are most commonly finished with a black oxide surface or other conversion treatment to provide some corrosion and rust protection and improved appearance even after hard impact wrench use. Although ordinary hand sockets should never be used with impact wrenches, impact sockets can be used with hand socket wrenches and other hand drivers.|$|E

Gamble; and Strength of slabs subjected to multiaxial bending and compression, by W. L. Gamble, H. Flug [and] M. A. Sozen. Summary of Flexural Strength Of Reinforced Concrete Slabs With Externally Applied In-Plane Forces by Girolaml, A. G. : Reinforced concrete slabs, bounded by elements which can develop horizontal reactions, have flexural capacities considerably {{in excess of}} the load calculated by an orthodox application of the yield-line analysis. The additional capacity results primarily from changes in geometry of the slab which generates in-plane forces reacting against the bounding element. Calculation of the effect of the in-plane forces on slab flexural strength is essential for a realistic evaluation of the slab capacity because the increase in load caused by the in-plane forces is not negligible, especially for short-time loading. The investigation described in this report was concerned with the development of a simple method of calculation for the flexural {{strength of}} reinforced concrete slabs with in-plane forces and to check the applicability of the method by experiments. Six reinforced concrete slabs with spandrel beams were built, instrumented, and tested. The test slabs, which were six-ft square and 1. 75 in. deep, were reinforced with intermediate grade steel (yield stress was approximately 48, 000 psl) and the concrete strength was approximately 4500 :psl [...] The slab and the spandrel beams had both negative and positive moment reinforcement to stimulate an interior panel in a two-way slab designed to carry 150 psf. Three of the test slabs were supported only at the corners while three were supported at several points along the spandrel beams to investigate the effects of nonyielding beams [...] . Summary of Strength Of Slabs Subjected To Multiaxial Bending And Compression by Gamble, W. L. : Reinforced concrete slab panels which are supported so that horizontal displacement of the edges of the panels are prevented are often capable of supporting considerably more load than would be indicated by simple yield-line analysis methods because of in-plane compression forces developed during deflection. The purpose of the series of tests and analysis described in this report was to demonstrate that the basic principles used in predicting the strength of reinforced concrete elements subjected to bending moments and thrusts in one direction, {{as in the case of}} columns, can also be used satisfactorily to predict the strength and behavior of slabs subjected to bending and in-plane forces acting in several directions at once. The importance of the in-plane forces can perhaps be best illustrated by reference to a set of tests conducted by Ockleston on a large reinforced concrete building. A single interior beam-supported panel carried a uniformly distributed load of 753 psf. While the computed capacity, using the yield-line analysis technique, was 295 psf. The very high load capacity is attributable to the presence of –in-plane compression forces generated when the surrounding panels restrained the lateral movements of the edges of the load panel. Six hexagonal reinforced concrete slabs were constructed and tested in order to investigate the effects of the reinforcement ratio and magnitude of in-plane forces on the strength and behavior of slabs. The slabs were reinforced with steel having a yield stress of about 50 kips/in. ² and the average concrete strength was about 6, 300 1 b/in. ² The slabs were four in. thick, and the basic hexagon measure about 6 ft 2 in. <b>across</b> <b>flats.</b> The edges of the hexagon were slotted to form loading wings, and the load was applied so as to produce constant bending moments in all directions within a three ft diam.
