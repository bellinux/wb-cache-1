50|$|A {{crevasse}} splay is a sedimentary {{fluvial deposit}} which forms when a stream breaks its natural or artificial levees and deposits sediment on a floodplain. A breach that forms a crevasse splay deposits sediments in similar pattern to an <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> <b>deposit.</b> Once the levee has been breached the {{water flows out}} of its channel. As the water spreads onto the flood plain sediments will start {{to fall out of}} suspension as the water loses energy. The resulting deposition can create graded deposits similar to those found in Bouma sequences. In some cases crevasse splays can cause a river to abandon its old river channel, a process known as avulsion. Breaches that form a crevasse splay deposits occur most commonly on the outside banks of meanders where the water has the highest energy. Crevasse splay deposits can range in size. Larger deposits can be 6 m thick at the levee and spread 2 km wide, while smaller deposits may only be 1 cm thick.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{the complex}} {{subsurface}} is becoming increasingly important: for hydrocarbon exploration, possible storage of CO 2, {{and the production of}} water for geothermal heating and energy production purposes. An example of a complex reservoir is a reservoir formed by <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> sediments. Although research into <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> <b>deposits</b> has been conducted, the geometry and sedimentary environment of <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> <b>deposits</b> is still not completely understood at this time. 3 D modelling of these sediments will contribute to the knowledge of <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> reservoirs and give predictions of inter-well connectivity, hence improving production. To gain a better understanding in the reservoir architecture of <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> <b>deposits,</b> an outcrop study in the Sis-palaeovalley, in the Tremp-Graus Basin in the Southern Pyrenees was conducted. An outcrop wall with a studied height of approximately 220 meters, in an area with a length of 1200 m and a width of 950 m, is investigated and mapped by using lithostratigraphic logs, photo panels and correlation observations. By analysing the gained data, a 3 D reservoir architecture computer model is built giving a representation of an <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> reservoir. Four lithofacies are encountered in the field: the conglomerate-, sandstone-, siltstone-, and limestone lithofacies. In {{the lower part of the}} outcrop the stacking of the sediment layers is farther apart compared to the upper part of the outcrop.

40|$|DOI: 10. 17014 /ijog. 2. 3. 125 - 137 This paper {{focuses on}} the Quaternary Baturetno Formation. An earlier {{research}} concluded that the black clay of the Baturetno Formation formed as a ‘palaeolake’ deposit. The ‘palaeolake’ was interpreted to form due to the shifting course of the Bengawan Solo Purba River in relation to Pliocene tectonic tilting in the southern Java. The stratigraphy of the Baturetno Formation was observed {{in the western part}} of the Baturetno Basin, and based on marker beds, the Baturetno Formation was classified into three units: (1) Gravel unit (GR) in the upper part, (2) clay unit (CU) in the middle part, and (3) sand-gravel unit (SG) in the lower part. There are floating gravel fragments of andesite, claystone, coral, and limestone with diameters of up to 10 cm in the clay unit. The particle size of sediment reflects the environment, but the lake deposition occurs under very quiet conditions. The occurrence of these fragments within the clay cannot be explained if the clay was deposited within a lake environment. The occurrence of floating fragments in the black clay of Baturetno Formation can best be explained through mudflow process. The cohesive strength of the mudflow is responsible for the ability of large fragments to float within the mud matrix. In general, the Baturetno Formation is inferred to be an <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> <b>deposit.</b> The presence of sand, gravel, and mud are characteristics of alluvial fan deposits. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Miocene distal {{alluvial}} fan and palustrine deposits of the Madrid Basin (Paracuellos de Jarama area) were examined {{to establish the}} sequence of its pedogenic–diagenetic processes and the main factors controlling them. In this area the diagenetic processes operated not only on carbonates, as commonly studied, but also in high magnesium clays and opaline cherts. This paper provides a dynamic model for saline–alkaline lake margins that complements the existing freshwater palustrine model. Three sections (BER, PEL and UPC) containing limestones, sepiolite, dolostones and opaline cherts were examined; these represent the entire transition from <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> <b>deposit</b> to lake environment. The {{alluvial fan}} deposits (PEL section) show the most complex sequence of processes. After a weak edaphic imprint, the primary mudstone and siltstones are affected by silicification (opaline levels formed mainly by selective replacement of sepiolites) and later dolomitization. Several types of dolomite are present, rounded crystals, spherules and globular bodies being the most characteristic. In the ponds situated {{at the foot of}} the alluvial fans or in interfan areas, sepiolite precipitated within free water bodies (BER section) and an intense pedogenesis led to the formation of palustrine sepiolite deposits. Later, the intense silicification of the sepiolite produced lenticular opaline levels that were locally transformed to quartz by aging. In the shallow lakes (UPC section), palustrine limestones and sepiolite were deposited. The carbonates are partially affected by silicification, the sepiolite becoming completely silicified. The opaline levels clearly preserve the structure of the limestones and sepiolite host rocks. All the opaline levels show local aging processes. The silicification processes were different in the three settings due to the interplay of groundwater with sedimentary environments and facies. In the distal alluvial fan sediments of the PEL section, the initial host rock affected by silicification is not preserved due to the later dolomitization that erased both it and its textures. The silicification environment was therefore not easy to determine. In the BER and UPC section, the main silicification took place in groundwater-influenced environments but evidence was seen of cements and silicifications in vadose environments. In all study settings, the overlapping of pedogenic, vadose and groundwater processes was controlled by changes in the position of the water table. Four stages were concluded to explain the transformation from the primary deposits to the later dolomitization process and the formation of vadose cements. The majority of the silicifications seen occurred as responses to changes in the water table position linked to the aggradation of this closed basin. In all the studied environments, the sepiolite deposits were preferentially silicified; their fibrous structure and high absorption capacity helping to retain interstitial fluids. Moreover sepiolite and opal are stable under relatively similar geochemical conditions in arid environments. The dissolution of the sepiolite caused an increase in silica in the interstitial fluids, favouring silicification and ruling out the need of a biogenic source. The replacement of limestones by silica is usually driven by variations in pH and salinity, which are very common in surface environments such as shallow lakes and soils...|$|E

40|$|Between 80 and 90 {{percent of}} the {{potential}} iron ore reserves in the Griqualand West basin in the Northern Cape province of South Africa is situated in the Asbesheuwels Iron-formation immediately below an unconformity that separates it from the Gamagara Formation of the Olifantshoek Supergroup. This extensive regional unconformity marks a lengthy period of non-deposition and erosion which preceded the deposition of the Gamagara Formation. Due {{to the nature of}} the intimate relationship between the shales and iron ore body, specifically on the Maremane dome, new insights into the Gamagara Formation were required. The thesis provides a renewed stratigraphic, petrographic and geochemical study on the Gamagara Formation and relates it to previous studies done on the lateral correlative Mapedi Formation, some 70 km north of the Maremane dome. The use of 10 newly available drill-cores selected from across the Maremane Dome allows for regional correlations to be made in a study which employs petrographic/mineralogical investigations using transmitted/reflected light microscopy, XRD and EPMA, complimented by traditional whole-rock geochemical analysis of majors, traces, rare earth elements and Nd isotopes. At the base of the Gamagara lie conglomerates representing an <b>alluvial</b> <b>fan</b> <b>deposit,</b> overlying this, shale and quartzite successions represent progradational delta lobes. The deltas are interpreted to be tide- dominated as indicated by a combination of features including: microbial mat growth, intertidal deposition in the delta top, sand bars and flaser laminations in the upward coarsening quartzite units of the delta front. Transgression is indicated by periodic transgressive lag deposits. A variety of sedimentary structures and textural features are described that can be interpreted as the results of microbial mat colonization on the sediment surface. Although in none of the described features can it irrefutably be proven that they are microbial mat deposits, the observed features are consistent with such an interpretation and should be considered indicators of possible microbial mat presence in the Gamagara Formation. Hydrothermal modifications are identified in various units of the Gamagara Formation and seem to occur as separate events. Basal white shales show mobility of Al and slight HFSE enrichments, while overlying red shales record HFSE, K and Fe enrichments. K-metasomatism has been known to occur in the underlying paleoweathering profile of the Transvaal Supergroup (Ongeluk lavas) a unit which is interpreted as the most likely provenance for the mid-to-upper shale lithofacies of the Gamagara Formation. Highly alkaline F-bearing brines had the ability to mobilize titania and fluorapatite, reset Nd isotope systematics and ultimately enriched HFSE concentrations in the red shales of the Gamagara Formation. As the same enrichment is evident in the Mapedi Formation, the event possibly represents unconformity related fluid flow on a regional scale (~ 140 km). Nd-isotopes record an isotopic disturbance concurrent with the HFSE enrichment and Tdm model ages suggest disruption (and enrichment) occurred between 1. 73 and 1. 86 Ga. Following this, Fe-addition occurred by epigenetic mechanisms similar to those of MVT-type deposits. Although gaps in the current understanding of the modifications of the Gamagara Formation exist, such events may have far reaching implications for the underlying iron ore bodies and the possibility arises that the genesis and/or epigenetic modification of the ore bodies of the Transvaal Supergroup may be casually linked to the same fluid-migration event/s...|$|E
