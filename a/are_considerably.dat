5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread {{out around the}} base of the plant for varying distances, close to the surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in {{stabilizing}} the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these come into contact with a rooting medium.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} {{refers to the}} {{construction}} of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electric power. These installations can utilize the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects. However, the construction and the maintenance costs <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> higher.|$|E
5|$|Seven of {{the nine}} {{surviving}} stones are under 90 centimetres (3 feet) tall, {{but two of the}} north-west stones <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> larger. Located opposite the circle's two shortest stones, one is thin and pointed, reaching 2.1 metres (7 feet) high, while the other is broader, measuring 1.8 metres square (6 feet by 6 feet). The largest of the stones weighs approximately 7.3 tonnes (8 tons) and would have required the efforts of many people to move and erect it.|$|E

5|$|The use of pure oxygen for {{accelerated}} decompression {{is limited}} by oxygen toxicity. In open circuit scuba the upper limit for oxygen partial pressure is generally accepted as 1.6 bar, equivalent {{to a depth of}} 6msw (metres of sea water), but in-water and surface decompression at higher partial pressures is routinely used in surface supplied diving operation, both by the military and civilian contractors, as the consequences of CNS oxygen toxicity <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> reduced when the diver has a secure breathing gas supply.|$|E
5|$|Urban life is {{concentrated}} in the capital, whose population is mostly engaged in commerce. The other major towns are Sarh, Moundou, Abéché and Doba, which <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> smaller but growing rapidly in population and economic activity. Since 2003, 230,000 Sudanese refugees have fled to eastern Chad from war-ridden Darfur. With the 172,600 Chadians displaced by {{the civil war in}} the east, this has generated increased tensions among the region's communities.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{administration}} {{in the second and}} third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> different from fetal warfarin syndrome. The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders, including spasticity and seizures, and eye defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.|$|E

5|$|Wind farms {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Khmers have a poor {{perception}} of the Vietnamese community, due to persistent feelings of communal animosity from the past history of Vietnamese rule over Cambodia. In 1958, a survey conducted by Donald Willmott upon {{high school students in}} Phnom Penh showed that relations with Chinese were generally rated as friendly, whereas Khmer students viewed their Vietnamese classmates with suspicion. Relations between the Vietnamese and Chinese <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take Vietnamese wives, particularly in Phnom Penh and eastern parts of the country where there are large Chinese and Vietnamese communities. In recent years, field research carried out by Ehrentraut in 2013 suggested that ethnic relations between Vietnamese have deteriorated not only with the ethnic Khmer, but also with the Cham and Chinese Cambodians.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 Halton had {{the largest}} {{proportion}} of the population in Cheshire in the age groups under 5, 5 to 15 and 16 to pension age and, at 16.1% the lowest proportion of people at pension age or older. At 1.2% the proportion of non-white ethnic groups in 2001 equalled the lowest in all local authorities in Cheshire. At 11.5 per 1,000 population, the live birth rate in Halton and Warrington, is the highest in the county. At 121 the standardised mortality ratio and at 21.5% the percentage of persons with limiting long-term illness <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> the highest in Cheshire.|$|E

5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the north-western side of the monument <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate choice of the circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop a loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E
5|$|The Raptors {{have enjoyed}} a {{consistent}} fanbase throughout their history. The Toronto Raptors set NBA attendance records in their 2000, 2001, 2002 seasons {{when they made}} the playoffs. Attendance dipped slightly between 2003 and 2006. This improved during the 2006–07 regular season {{to an average of}} 18,258 fans (13th in the league), 92.2% of capacity at the ACC. Following the success of the 2006–07 season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales for the 2007–08 season. Their television ratings, however, <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> lower than other more established Toronto sports teams and most other sporting events shown on Canadian television.|$|E

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{are those that}} are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits. Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%. Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if used strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%. With typical use first-year failure rates <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> high, at 9%, due to incorrect usage. Other methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young people.|$|E
5|$|The two {{defensive}} towers appearing {{along the}} near shoreline of the islet are still present, their structures remain intact although their exteriors <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> altered. The leftmost is Birger Jarls torn {{located in the}} north-western corner of the islet and erroneously named after Birger Jarl, by tradition attributed to be the founder of Stockholm. The other is the so-called Vasatornet ("Tower of Vasa"), today forming the southern tower of the Wrangel Palace. For {{the construction of the}} towers and other defensive structures, the king used bricks from the monastery Klara kloster located just north of the city but absent in the painting. Since the monastery is known to have been demolished immediately following the introduction of Protestantism in 1527, the painting is, again, a credible source rendering the city as it appeared in 1535.|$|E
5|$|Tiger {{shark teeth}} are unique with very sharp, {{pronounced}} serrations and an unmistakable sideways pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the sharks life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark teeth <b>are</b> <b>considerably</b> shorter {{than those of}} a great white shark, however they are nearly as broad as the root as the great whites teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.|$|E
