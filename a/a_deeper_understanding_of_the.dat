5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E

25|$|Objective {{collapse}} theories, {{which involve}} a dynamic (and non-deterministic) {{collapse of the}} wave function (e.g. Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory, Penrose interpretation, or causal fermion systems) avoid these absurdities. The theory of causal fermion systems for example, is able to unify quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory, via a more fundamental theory which is non-linear, but {{gives rise to the}} linear behaviour of the wave function and also gives rise to the non-linear, non-deterministic, wave-function collapse. These theories suggest that <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory underlying quantum mechanics shows the universe is indeed non-deterministic at a fundamental level.|$|E
25|$|Sin is not {{viewed by}} the Orthodox as a stain on the soul {{that needs to be}} wiped out, or a legal {{transgression}} that must be set right by a punitive sentence, but rather as a mistake made by the individual with the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of Penance (epitemia), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but rather is directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, {{it is not unusual for}} even small children to confess; though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for spiritual growth remains the same.|$|E
25|$|Background texts: The {{following}} {{bibliography of}} source papers includes {{a number of}} texts {{to be used as}} background. The mathematics that led to the flurry of papers about abstract machines in the 1950s and 1960s can be found in van Heijenoort (1967)—an assemblage of original papers spanning the 50 years from Frege (1879) to Gödel (1931). Davis (ed.) The Undecidable (1965) carries the torch onward beginning with Gödel (1931) through Gödel's (1964) postscriptum (p.71); the original papers of Alan Turing (1936-7) and Emil Post (1936) are included in The Undecidable. The mathematics of Church, Rosser and Kleene that appear as reprints of original papers in The Undecidable is carried further in Kleene (1952), a mandatory text for anyone pursuing <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mathematics behind the machines. Both Kleene (1952) and Davis (1958) are referenced by a number of the papers.|$|E

500|$|Although Alonso Álvarez de Pineda claimed Texas for Spain in 1519, {{the area}} was largely ignored by Spain until the late seventeenth century. In 1685, the Spanish learned that France had {{established}} a colony in the area between New Spain and Florida. Believing the French colony {{was a threat to}} Spanish mines and shipping routes, Spanish King Carlos II's Council of War recommended that [...] "Spain needed swift action 'to remove this thorn which has been thrust into the heart of America. The greater the delay the greater the difficulty of attainment.'" [...] Having no idea where to find the French colony, the Spanish launched tenexpeditionsboth land and seaover the next threeyears. While unable to fulfill their original goal of locating the French settlement, the expeditions did provide Spain <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geography of the Gulf Coast region. The last expedition, in 1689, discovered a French deserter living in southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. In April 1689, the Frenchman helped guide the Spanish, under Alonso de León, to Fort Saint Louis, which had been destroyed by Karankawa Indians. De León's expedition also met representatives of the Caddo people, who lived between the Trinity and the Red Rivers. The Caddo expressed interest in learning about Christianity.|$|E
