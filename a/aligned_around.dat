40|$|Pairwise string {{alignment}} (PSA) is {{an important}} general technique for obtaining a measure of similarity between two strings, used e. g., in dialectology, historical linguistics, transliteration, and in evaluating name distinctiveness. The current study focuses on evaluating different PSA methods at the alignment level instead of via the distances it induces. About 3. 5 million pairwise alignments of Bulgarian phonetic dialect data are used to compare four algorithms with a manually corrected gold standard. The algorithms evaluated include three variants of the Levenshtein algorithm {{as well as the}} Pair Hidden Markov Model. Our results show that while all algorithms perform very well and <b>align</b> <b>around</b> 95 % of all alignments correctly, there are specific qualitative differences in the (mis) alignments of the different algorithms. ...|$|R

However, the Jawa Oromo inhabiting Damot preferred to be ruled by Waragna's son Fasil; when Grazmach Eshte arrived in Damot, he was assassinated and Fasil proclaimed governor in his place; according to Bruce, Iyoas' uncles Birale and Lubo convinced him to confirm Fasil in that position.|$|E
50|$|In 1611, Marie de' Medici, {{the widow}} of Henry IV and the regent for the King Louis XIII decided to build a palace in {{imitation}} of the Pitti Palace in her native Florence. She purchased the hotel du Luxembourg (today the Petit-Luxembourg palace) and began construction of the new palace. She commissioned Salomon de Brosse to build the palace and a fountain, which still exists. In 1612 she planted 2,000 elm trees, and directed a series of gardeners, most notably Tommaso Francini, to build a park in the style she had known {{as a child in}} Florence. Francini planned two terraces with balustrades and parterres laid out along the axis of the chateau, <b>aligned</b> <b>around</b> a circular basin.

40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steels specimens were deformed by tension in {{temperatures in the}} range of - 50 °C to 20 °C and 0. 03 to 0. 12 true strain, in order to obtain different volumetric fractions of ε (hexagonal close packed) and α′ (body centered cubic) strain induced martensites. The morphology, distribution and volumetric fractions of the martensites were characterized by metallography and dilatometry analysis and quantified by ferrite detector measurements. The damping behavior of specimens with different volumetric fractions of martensites was studied in an inverted torsion pendulum in the 40 °C to 400 °C range. The ε- and α′-martensites reversion was observed in the temperature range of 50 °C 200 °C and 500 °C 800 °C, respectively, by dilatometry. Internal friction curves in function of temperature of the deformed samples presented internal friction peaks. The first internal friction peak is related to sum of the amount of ε- and α′-martensites. For low deformations it <b>aligns</b> <b>around</b> 130 °C and it is related only to the ε → γ reverse transformation. The peak situated around 350 °C increases with the specimen degree of deformation and is, probably, related to the presence of α′/γ interfaces, and deformed austenite. Copyright © 2010 T. F. A.

40|$|ABSTRACT Obscurin (� 800 kDa) in {{striated}} muscle closely surrounds sarcomeres {{at the level}} of the M-band and Z-disk where, we hypothesize, it participates in the assembly of the contractile apparatus and membrane systems required for Ca 2 � homeostasis. In this study, we used small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) technology to reduce the levels of obscurin in primary cultures of skeletal myotubes to study its role in myofibrillogenesis and the organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). siRNA-treated myotubes showed a specific and dramatic reduction in the � 800 kDa form of obscurin by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. M-bands and A-bands, but not Z-disks or I-bands, were disrupted when the synthesis of obscurin was inhibited. Small ankyrin 1, an integral protein of the network SR that binds to obscurin, also failed to <b>align</b> <b>around</b> developing sarcomeres in treated myotubes. Myosin and myomesin levels were significantly reduced in treated myotubes but �-actinin was not, suggesting that downregulation of obscurin destabilizes proteins of the M-band and A-band but not of the Z-disk. Our findings suggest that obscurin is required for the assembly of the M-band and A-band and for the regular alignment of the network SR around the contractile apparatus. ...|$|R
40|$|Borehole failure {{observed}} on image and dipmeter logs from 55 petroleum wells across the NW Borneo collisional margin {{were used to}} determine maximum horizontal stress (σH) orientations; combined with seismic and outcrop data, they define seven tectonic provinces. The Baram Delta–Deepwater Fold-Thrust Belt exhibits three tectonic provinces: its inner shelf inverted province (σH is NW-SE, margin-normal), its outer shelf extension province (σH is NE-SW, margin-parallel), and its slope to basin floor compression province (σH is NW-SE, margin-normal). In the inverted province, σH reflects inversion of deltaic normal faults. The σH orientations in the extension and compression provinces reflect deltaic gravitational tectonics. The shale and minibasin provinces have been recognized in offshore Sabah. In the shale province, σH is N 010 °E, which <b>aligns</b> <b>around</b> the boundary of a massif of mobile shale. Currently, no data are available to determine σH in the minibasin province. In the Balingian province, σH is ESE-WNW, reflecting ESE absolute Sunda plate motions due to the absence of a thick detachment seen elsewhere in NW Borneo. The Central Luconia province demonstrates poorly constrained and variable σH orientations. These seven provinces result from the heterogeneous structural and stratigraphic development of the NW Borneo margin and formed due to complex collisional tectonics and the varied distribution and thicknesses of stratigraphic packages...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} traces the {{development}} of contractile cells in the nonmuscular segments of rat lung microvessels in hyperoxic pulmonary hypertension. New intimal cells first develop into a well-defined layer beneath the endothelium and internal to an elastic lamina. Ultrastructurally, these cells {{are found to be}} 1) fibroblasts recruited to the vessel wall from the interstitium and 2) intermediate cells, a population of preexisting vascular cells (structurally between a smooth muscle cell and a pericyte). Early in hyperoxia (days 3 through 7), interstitial fibroblasts migrate and <b>align</b> <b>around</b> the smallest vessels in which an elastic lamina is either absent or fragmentary. These cells then are incorporated into the vessel wall by tropoelastin secretion and the formation of an elastic lamina along their abluminal margin. After day 7, the new mural fibroblasts acquire the features of contractile cells, namely a basal lamina, extensive microfilaments, and dense bodies. In other vessels, as early as day 3 of hyperoxia, intermediate cells within the vessel intima begin to acquire the additional filaments and dense bodies of contractile cells. As hyperoxia continues, each cell pathway gives rise to vessels with distinct intimal or medial layers of contractile cells. In this way, thick-walled 'newly muscularized' vessel segments form adjacent to the capillary bed...|$|R

To reveal the relation between the molecular alignment and the structural minimum in the high-order harmonic spectrum, we perform an analysis based on the two-center interference model. Our analysis shows that the structural minimum position depends linearly on the inverse of the alignment parameter $ $. This linear relation indicates the possibility of probing the rotational wave-packet dynamics by measuring the spectral minima...|$|R
