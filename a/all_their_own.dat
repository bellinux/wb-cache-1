5|$|Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project, and {{was largely}} unguided. It was tasked with {{research and development}} of almost any piece of equipment that might help with the mission outlined in its charter. As a result, few of the programs came to fruition and fewer still left a definitive mark on the conflict. The developments under Shed Light were quickly eclipsed by new aircraft produced under Project Gunship (notably under Gunship II and Gunship III). They were fitted with many of the sensors developed under Shed Light, but took on a life <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> Shed Light’s most visible programs, Black Spot and Tropic Moon, have largely fallen into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the sinking, Royal Oaks survivors were billeted in the towns and villages of Orkney. A funeral parade for the dead took place at Lyness on Hoy on 16 October; many of the surviving crew, having lost <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> clothing on the ship, attended in borrowed boiler suits and gym shoes. They were generally granted a few days survivors' leave by the navy, and then assigned to ships and roles elsewhere. Kenneth Toop, who survived the sinking while serving as a Boy, First Class on Royal Oak, served as the Royal Oak Association's Honorary Secretary. An annual ceremony of remembrance is held by the survivors and descendants of the crew at the Naval War Memorial, Southsea, on the anniversary of the sinking. The last remaining survivor of Royal Oak, Arthur Smith, who had been a 17-year old Boy, First Class when the ship was struck, died on 11 December 2016. He had been on watch at the bridge and had jumped from the sinking ship, swimming in the wrong direction until he was picked up by a boat and transferred to the Daisy 2.|$|E

25|$|The Future Sound of London (often {{abbreviated}} to FSOL) is a British electronic music group composed of Garry Cobain (sometimes stylised as Gaz Cobain) and Brian Dougans. The duo are often credited with pushing {{the boundaries of}} electronic music experimentation and of pioneering {{a new era of}} dance music. Although often associated with ambient music, Cobain and Dougans usually resist being typecast into any one particular genre. Their work covers many areas of electronic music, such as ambient techno, house music, trip hop, ambient dub, acid techno. In addition to music composition, their interests have covered a number of areas including film and video, 2D and 3D computer graphics, animation in making almost <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> videos for their singles, radio broadcasting and creating their own electronic devices for sound making.|$|E

25|$|Petrarch is a {{key figure}} in the {{imitation}} of Horace in accentual meters. His verse letters in Latin were modelled on the Epistles and he wrote a letter to Horace {{in the form of an}} ode. However he also borrowed from Horace when composing his Italian sonnets. One modern scholar has speculated that authors who imitated Horace in accentual rhythms (including stressed Latin and vernacular languages) may have considered their work a natural sequel to Horace's metrical variety. In France, Horace and Pindar were the poetic models for a group of vernacular authors called the Pléiade, including for example Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. Montaigne made constant and inventive use of Horatian quotes. The vernacular languages were dominant in Spain and Portugal in the sixteenth century, where Horace's influence is notable in the works of such authors as Garcilaso de la Vega, Juan Boscán Sá de Miranda, Antonio Ferreira and Fray Luis de León, the latter for example writing odes on the Horatian theme beatus ille (happy the man). The sixteenth century in western Europe was also an age of translations (except in Germany, where Horace wasn't translated until well into the seventeenth century). The first English translator was Thomas Drant, who placed translations of Jeremiah and Horace side by side in Medicinable Morall, 1566. That was also the year that the Scot George Buchanan paraphrased the Psalms in a Horatian setting. Ben Jonson put Horace on the stage in 1601 in Poetaster, along with other classical Latin authors, giving them <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> verses to speak in translation. Horace's part evinces the independent spirit, moral earnestness and critical insight that many readers look for in his poems.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} Dark Blues made a spurt, Cambridge pulled away and were three lengths ahead by Chiswick Steps. [...] According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater, [...] "from here {{they had it}} <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> way to the finish". [...] Cambridge passed the {{finishing}} post {{four and a half}} lengths ahead, in a time of 18 minutes 41 seconds, the fastest winning time since the 1911 race and the second fastest {{time in the history of}} the event.

500|$|... "E. Weston & Son" [...] {{became a}} diverse {{operation}} {{which included a}} large ropewalk on Weston's property on Powder Point. The 1,000 foot long structure produced cordage for Weston vessels and became a lucrative component of the enterprise as the Westons supplied rigging to all of Duxbury's major shipbuilders as well as shipyards in Boston. In 1812, the Westons built a sailcloth mill in the Millbrook section of Duxbury. They owned a blacksmith shop and tar kiln and employed a large workforce of carpenters, laborers, stevedores and mariners. Thus the Westons were able to supply virtually <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> raw material needed to build sailing vessels. The Westons built numerous smaller vessels, including [...] schooners for fishing and coastal trade. However, Weston's best known vessels were large brigs and ships which traded primarily in the northern Atlantic and Mediterranean.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1966, Pink Floyd {{had gained}} a {{reliable}} management team in Andrew King and Peter Jenner. Towards the end of October 1966, Pink Floyd, with King and Jenner, set up Blackhill Enterprises, to manage the group's finances. Blackhill was staffed by lodgers Jenner found in his Edbrooke Road house, and among others, Barrett's flatmate, Peter Wynne Wilson (who became road manager, however, since he had more experience in lighting, he was also lighting assistant). King and Jenner wanted to prepare some demo recordings for a possible record deal, {{so at the end}} of October, they booked a session at Thompson Private Recording Studio, in Hemel Hempstead. King said of the demos: [...] "That was the first time I realised they were going to write <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> material, Syd just turned into a songwriter, it seemed like overnight." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Fazekas {{stated that}} it was [...] "fabulous from a writing perspective" [...] to have an eight episode order, as [...] "you can plan it and know where you're heading... They're <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> stories {{and they all have}} their own drive, but it's sort of {{building}} toward a big thing {{at the end of the}} eight episodes." [...] Elaborating on this, Atwell said, [...] "it's incredibly tight, the script, which is great. It's fast moving and fast paced but luckily because it's not stretched out of 22 episodes, nothing is diluted. Every line is vital to not only moving the story and the action [...] but also developing the characters." [...] The season's overarching storyline revolves around the chemical weapon Midnight Oil, which is based on the Madbomb of the Captain America comics. The Madbomb was originally considered for use in , before negotiations with actors to adapt the [...] "Civil War" [...] storyline were completed. Also in July, it was revealed that Carter's husband would be explored in the series. However, he was ultimately not explored much in the first season, with McFeely saying, [...] "This was the season where she says goodbye to Steve ... In a second season, she could be freer to have those conversations about a life after him." ...|$|E
500|$|Considered {{rare for}} Disney animals, Pascal and Maximus do not speak. The idea to make Pascal and Maximus mute was {{inspired}} by the performances of actors Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton in Silent films. Identifying themselves as [...] "huge fans" [...] of Chaplin, Greno and Howard suggested {{that it would be a}} good idea to have a character like the actor featured in the film. Additionally, the directors explained in an interview with Orange that Pascal and Maximus' silence was also inspired by the roles of Princess Aurora's animal friends in Disney's Sleeping Beauty (1959), following the film's rules and guidelines that even though they do not talk, they remain [...] "very expressive" [...] nonetheless and [...] "act and understand without words." [...] Maximus particularly [...] "belongs to the grand tradition of Disney creatures that are full of personality even though they don't talk." [...] One film critic observed that Pascal and Maximus [...] "have personalities <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> making use of techniques harkening back to the silent era". Howard explained that [...] "Pantomime acting is a great challenge for our animators" [...] because, according to animator Jin Kim, Pascal and Maximus both [...] "had to be funny without speech", forcing the animators to exaggerate their emotions and facial expressions. The Chicago Sun-Times observed that [...] "Pascal ... doesn't speak, but manages to convey himself with eye rolls and changes of color." [...] Both animals' sound effects are provided by American actor Frank Welker.|$|E

M.I.A.'s fashion and style landed her on Vogue's 10 Best Dressed of 2008. She turned down her inclusion on People magazine's {{list of the}} [...] "50 Most Beautiful People in the World" [...] the same year. M.I.A.'s status as a style icon, trendsetter and trailblazer is globally affirmed, with her distinct identity, style, and music illuminating social issues of gender, the third world, and popular music. Critics point out that such facets of her public persona underline the importance of authenticity, challenging the globalised popular music market, and demonstrating music's strive to be political. Her albums have been met with acclaim, often heralded as [...] "eclectic" [...] for possessing a genre <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> [...] "packaging inherent politics {{in the form of}} pleasurable dance music." [...] M.I.A.'s artistic efforts to connect this [...] "extreme eclecticism" [...] with issues of exile, war, violence and terrorism are both commended and criticised. Commentators laud M.I.A.'s use and subversion of her refugee and migrant experiences, through the weaving of musical creativity, artwork and fashion with her personal life as having dispelled stereotypical notions of the immigrant experience. This gives her a unique place in popular music, while demanding new responses within popular music, media and fashion culture. M.I.A. has been the muse of designers Donatella Versace and Bartley and photographers Rankin and David Bailey, whose spread documents the British musicians who defined the sound and style of rock 'n' roll. On 1 July 2012 Maya attended the Atelier Versace Show in Paris, wearing clothing inspired from the designer's 1992 collection. In 2013 she released her own Versace Collection.|$|E
