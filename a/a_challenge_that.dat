5|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} {{arrive at the}} cabin for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) proves to be an {{excellent}} hunter and bags the first quail. Growing increasingly agitated, Ron agrees to <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>that</b> Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. After {{a few hours of}} hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has been shot in the head. Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back to the cabin, where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the game's fictional locations, the team tried to represent iconic {{features of the}} American frontier; New Austin features small towns and outposts, Nuevo Paraíso includes rebel outposts and Mexican army forts, and West Elizabeth represents the civilized areas of the world. These three locations represent a developing nation, a province {{on the brink of}} war, and an advanced nation, respectively. The American frontier was extensively researched for the game. The team organized field trips to Washington, visited the Library of Congress, captured a multitude of photographs, and analyzed various classic Western films. <b>A</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>that</b> the team faced {{as a direct result of}} the world's size was to include enough content to interest players. Using this challenge as a strength and a major part of the design process, the team tried to make the countryside wild, with a variety of potential events to occur. They initially believed that it was possible to use the formula of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008)—a large variety of mission styles with different activities and objectives—in Red Dead Redemption; as development continued, they realized that the emptiness of the world resulted in the inability to use this formula.|$|E

25|$|India {{has made}} {{progress}} {{in terms of}} increasing the primary education attendance rate and expanding literacy to approximately three-quarters {{of the population in}} the 7–10 age group, by 2011. India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development. Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrollment Ratio of 24% in 2013, there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrollment levels of developed nations, <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>that</b> will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.|$|E

25|$|Finland's export-dependent economy {{continuously}} {{adapted to}} the world market; in doing so, it changed Finnish society as well. The prolonged worldwide boom, {{beginning in the late}} 1940s and lasting until the first oil crisis in 1973, was <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>that</b> Finland met and from which it emerged with a highly sophisticated and diversified economy, including a new occupational structure. Some sectors kept a fairly constant share of the work force. Transportation and construction, for example, each accounted for between 7 and 8 percent in both 1950 and 1985, and manufacturing's share rose only from 22 to 24 percent. However, both the commercial and the service sectors more than doubled their share of the work force, accounting, respectively, for 21 and 28 percent in 1985. The greatest change was the decline of the economically active population employed in agriculture and forestry, from approximately 50 percent in 1950 to 10 percent in 1985. The exodus from farms and forests provided the labour power needed for the growth of other sectors.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match of}} the night, the third to feature CMLL and Invasores on {{opposite}} sides, was {{centered around the}} personal issues between CMLL representative La Sombra and Invasor Olímpico, focusing {{on the fact that}} La Sombra had won Olímpico's match at the previous month's CMLL 77th Anniversary Show and Olímpico was eager to gain his revenge. La Sombra teamed up with Máscara Dorada and La Máscara to take on Olímpico, Alebrije and Psicosis. The first fall ended after just over six minutes of wrestling as Psicosis pinned La Máscara and Alebrije pinned Máscara Dorada. In the second fall Máscara Dorada pinned Olímpico, followed by La Sombra pinning El Alebrije to even the match between the two teams. In the closing moments of the match Olímpico tried to kick La Sombra in the groin, but Sombra caught the foot to prevent it. Instead Olímpico pulled off La Sombra's mask {{in full view of the}} referee to draw the disqualification, then he kicked La Sombra in the groin. Los Invasores ignored the referee and proceeded to beat up La Máscara and Máscara Dorada as well, stealing the masks of all three tecnicos and then challenging the team to a future Luchas de Apuestas match, <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>that</b> was ignored as the three tecnicos tried to cover up as best they could.|$|E
25|$|On December 9, Arsenal {{bounced back}} with a 4–1 away win against Galatasaray in {{the final game of}} the group stage of the Champions League and during the match, Aaron Ramsey scored a double, {{including}} a tremendous 35-yard left-footed volley in the 29th minute, while Lukas Podolski scored what proved to be his two last goals for the club against the club he'd sign for the following summer. Mathieu Debuchy also returned to the starting line-up after three months out with his injury. Arsenal progressed to the next round of the Champions league as the runners-up of their group, being drawn against Monaco (having faced the French side in the Emirates Cup). On 13 December, Santi Cazorla scored a brace on his 30th birthday as Arsenal recorded a second successive 4-1 win, against Newcastle at Emirates Stadium. Olivier Giroud also scored a brace, showing his full fitness and his form. On 21 December, Arsenal took on Premier League strugglers Liverpool at Anfield. In the match, Philippe Coutinho gave Liverpool the lead but Debuchy's first goal for Arsenal levelled the scoring. In the second half, Giroud gave Arsenal the lead. Fabio Borini was sent off for a high kick on Santi Cazorla (<b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>that</b> tore the Spaniard's shirt), but in the 97th minute of the match, Martin Škrtel gave Liverpool an equaliser, the match ending 2–2.|$|E

25|$|Arsenal's {{second game}} in the Emirates Cup was against Ligue 1 runners up Monaco. Wenger fielded a 4–3–3 formation, which saw the {{introduction}} of first team names Wojciech Szczęsny, Laurent Koscielny, Jack Wilshere, Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud into the side. Summer signings Sánchez and Chambers started the match, which also served as the debut for £12million signing Mathieu Debuchy. Arsenal had needed only a draw to claim the Emirates Cup and entered the game looking for that draw. However, Monaco were gifted the only goal of the match in the 37th minute when Radamel Falcao was given {{the freedom of the}} Arsenal penalty area to head home João Moutinho’s free-kick, awarded for Wilshere's clumsy lunge on Nabil Dirar, <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>that</b> booked the English midfielder. Having won 5–1 against Benfica 24 hours earlier, Arsenal struggled against the French side and created {{little in the way of}} clear-cut chances. Sánchez played on both flanks and then through the middle in the second period before being withdrawn in the 74th minute. Following the introduction of Chuba Akpom into the side, Arsenal showed direct running and looked for an equaliser. Akpom, who replaced Sánchez, was brought down by Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subašić as Akpom burst into the box, only for referee Martin Atkinson to award a free-kick rather than a penalty— despite replays showing the foul was clearly inside the area. The game finished 1–0 to Monaco, and with Valencia winning 3–1 against Benfica earlier that day, the Spanish side won the trophy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} game of a West Coast series, the Patriots again practiced at San José State University in {{preparation}} for their game against the Raiders. On the Raiders' first drive, a 43-yard three-and-out punt was returned 14 yards by Faulk to the Raiders' 40-yard line. The Patriots then moved into the Raiders' red zone with two third-down conversions, both Welker receptions, but the ensuing second down, the Patriots were docked a timeout after losing <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>that</b> the Raiders had too many players on the field. On the next play, Faulk caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to give the Patriots a 7–0 lead. Starting from within their 20-yard line {{for the second straight}} possession, the Raiders faced another three-and-out after a third down Vrabel strip-sack of quarterback JaMarcus Russell that was recovered by Raiders tight end Zach Miller. Punter Shane Lechler's next punt traveled 18 yards, giving the Patriots the ball at the Raiders' 35-yard line. Three plays later, Cassel connected with Moss on a 20-yard touchdown pass to extend the Patriots' lead to 14–0. After yet another Raiders three-and-out, Lechler punted 62 yards to the Patriots' 5-yard line, marking {{the first time in the}} game the Patriots would run a play from scrimmage in their own territory. This play would be a 14-yard Cassel run; a third-down Faulk catch then extended the drive, and the Patriots moved into Raiders territory on another Cassel scramble coupled with a Raiders holding penalty. Four plays later, a 29-yard Morris touchdown run gave the Patriots a 21–0 lead. However, one play after converting their initial first down of the game, the Raiders cut the Patriots' lead to 21–7 on a 56-yard touchdown catch by Johnnie Lee Higgins from Russell.|$|E
