The rich marine life is due to the intense food supply of microscopic animals and plants, including phytoplankton and zooplankton.|$|E

The system was over somewhat cooler water at first with sea surface temperatures around 79°F (26°C); however, the low shear environment allowed the depression to continue to organize. Late that evening, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Danielle.|$|E
