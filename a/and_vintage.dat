5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, but {{fell off the}} next week. It {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Although some were ambivalent towards its loose blaxploitation concept and Saadiq's songwriting, critics praised the album's production quality <b>and</b> <b>vintage</b> musical approach. It is currently out of print.|$|E

5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Carol would be filmed in Cincinnati, Ohio, and production offices would open in early January 2014, with filming expected from mid-March through May. In February 2014, the Greater Cincinnati & Northern Kentucky Film Commission released the solicitation from producers for extras <b>and</b> <b>vintage</b> vehicles. Principal photography began on March 12, 2014, at Eden Park in Cincinnati. Various locations around Cincinnati, Ohio were used during production, including Downtown Cincinnati, Hyde Park, Over-the-Rhine, Wyoming, Cheviot, and Hamilton, as well as Alexandria, Kentucky. Except for the Waterloo, Iowa, motel room, which was a set built for privacy during filming of the love scene, actual locations were used for interior and exterior settings. The second floor of a now-defunct department store served as the location for the toy department of the fictional Frankenberg's. Filming was completed on May 2, 2014. The film was shot in 34 days. Edward Lachman shot Carol on Super 16 mm film using 35 mm format lenses.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, a {{large part}} of Cabernet Sauvignon's {{reputation}} was built on its ability to age and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age new flavors and aromas can emerge and add to the wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux with some premium examples in favorable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of the wines tend to soften after ten years and can typically last for at least another decade-sometimes longer depending on the producer <b>and</b> <b>vintage.</b> Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May 2017, {{the album}} was reissued for the album's 50th anniversary in four {{different}} formats: a single CD, a double CD set, a double vinyl set and a six-disc super deluxe edition. The first CD contains a new stereo remix of the album produced by Giles Martin. Created using modern <b>and</b> <b>vintage</b> technology, the 2017 mix retains more of the idiosyncrasies that were unique to the original mono version of Sgt. Pepper's. Unlike the original album, first-generation tapes were used rather than their subsequent mixdowns, resulting in a clearer and more spacious sound. The other discs contain alternative mixes and previously unreleased session tapes. The six-disc box set includes four CDs {{as well as a}} documentary and 5.1 surround sound mixes of the album in both DVD and Blu-ray form.|$|E
5|$|On Late Registration, West drew {{inspiration}} from English trip hop band Portishead and collaborated with film score composer Jon Brion. The album's music blends West's primary soulful hip hop production with Brion's elaborate chamber pop orchestration, and experimentally delves into {{a wide array of}} different genres, including jazz, blues, rock, R, spoken word, funk, turntablism, western classical, and psychedelic soul. With the presence of Brion, who conducts a twenty-piece orchestra and plays instruments individually selected by West, the album is largely orchestral in nature, brandishing a euphony of string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs among other symphonic instrumentation. They also incorporated a myriad of foreign <b>and</b> <b>vintage</b> instruments not typical in popular music, let alone hip hop, such as a celesta, harpsichord, Chamberlin, CS-80 analog synthesizer, Chinese bells and berimbau, vibraphones, and marimba.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cooper {{stayed with the}} Countess Dorothy di Frasso at the Villa Madama in Rome, where she taught him about good food <b>and</b> <b>vintage</b> wines, how to read Italian and French menus, and how to socialize among Europe's nobility and upper classes. After guiding him through the great art museums and {{galleries}} of Italy, she accompanied him on a ten-week big-game hunting safari {{on the slopes of}} Mount Kenya in East Africa, where he was credited with over sixty kills, including two lions, a rhinoceros, and various antelopes. His safari experience in Africa had a profound influence on Cooper and intensified his love of the wilderness. After returning to Europe, he and the countess set off on a Mediterranean cruise of the Italian and French Rivieras. Rested and rejuvenated by his year-long exile, a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932 and negotiated a new contract with Paramount for two films per year, a salary of $4,000 a week, and director and script approval.|$|E
