5|$|After {{teaching}} at the University of Washington from 1910 to 1912, Morgan completed <b>a</b> <b>Ph.D.</b> in chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1914. Stieglitz supervised her dissertation. She {{may have been the}} only married woman to have received <b>a</b> <b>Ph.D.</b> in chemistry in {{the first few years of}} the 20th century. Despite the fact that married women were not generally welcome on university faculties (female professors were usually expected to resign when they married), Stieglitz agreed to write a recommendation letter for Morgan for a position at the University of Illinois. Stieglitz noted in his letter that the university should overlook Morgan's marital status because her husband was ill at the time.|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} acidophilic microorganisms, A. caldus thrives best in an {{environment}} with <b>a</b> low, acidic <b>pH</b> with <b>a</b> preferred <b>pH</b> range of 2.0-2.5.

40|$|Understanding {{variability}} in the chlorophyll-specific absorption of marine phytoplankton, <b>a</b> <b>ph</b> * Chl (λ), is essential for primary production modelling, calculation of underwater light field characteristics, and development of algorithms for remote sensing of chlorophyll concentrations.

However, {{the potential impact of}} measurement uncertainties on derived values of <b>a</b> <b>ph</b> * Chl (λ) has received insufficient study. This study presents an analysis of measurement uncertainties for a data set collected in the Ligurian Sea in Spring and assesses the impact on estimates of <b>a</b> <b>ph</b> * Chl (λ). It is found that a large proportion of apparent variability in this set of <b>a</b> <b>ph</b> * Chl (λ) can be attributed to measurement errors.
