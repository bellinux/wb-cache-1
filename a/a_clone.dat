5|$|In {{the process}} of {{destroying}} NESTS, he becomes allied with Maxima, a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death. While Maxima sees K' as a friend and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, who it is revealed is <b>a</b> <b>clone</b> of his sister, Seirah. Even though Whip reveals her identity to K', he ignores this, saying he will do what he pleases. Although he hates The King of Fighters tournaments, he commonly enters them, being asked by someone, or to find NESTS. The participants often criticize him for being antisocial. After destroying NESTS, K' starts recovering his memories, but he suspects he could forget all the people he has met. He also becomes determined to prove he is better than Kyo, instead of being only <b>a</b> <b>clone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kraken was <b>a</b> <b>clone</b> {{who shared}} Dredd's DNA. He {{had been created}} by rogue judge Morton Judd as part of <b>a</b> <b>clone</b> army to {{overthrow}} the judges and conquer Mega-City One (though not to restore democracy). Of the survivors, Kraken alone was spared and was rehabilitated at the Academy of Law, {{with a view to}} having him one day replace Dredd when Dredd finally retired or died.

5|$|The studio {{initially}} {{imagined that}} the film would center around <b>a</b> <b>clone</b> of the character Newt from Aliens, as the Ellen Ripley character had died {{at the end of}} Alien 3. Whedon composed a thirty-page treatment surrounding this idea before being informed that the studio, though impressed with his script, now intended to base the story on <b>a</b> <b>clone</b> of Ripley, whom they saw as the anchor of the series. Whedon had to rewrite the script {{in a way that would}} bring back the Ripley character, a task he found difficult. The idea of cloning was suggested by producers David Giler and Walter Hill, who opposed the production of Alien Resurrection, as they thought it would ruin the franchise.|$|E
5|$|All known {{cnidaria}} can reproduce asexually {{by various}} means, {{in addition to}} regenerating after being fragmented. Hydrozoan polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. Scyphozoan polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian <b>a</b> <b>clone</b> of the adult.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAvailability of <b>a</b> <b>cloned</b> genome {{from which}} {{infectious}} RNA can be transcribed {{is essential for}} investigating RNA virus molecular mechanisms. To date, no such clones have been reported for the Dicistroviridae, an emerging family of invertebrate viruses. Previously we demonstrated baculovirus-driven expression of <b>a</b> <b>cloned</b> Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV; Dicistroviridae) genome that was infectious to aphids, and we identified a cell line (GWSS-Z 10) from the glassy-winged sharpshooter, that supports RhPV replication. Here we report that RNA transcribed from <b>a</b> full-length cDNA <b>clone</b> is infectious. Transfection of GWSS-Z 10 cells with the RhPV transcript resulted in cytopathic effects, ultrastructural changes, and accumulation of progeny virions, consistent with virus infection. Virions from transcript-infected cells were infectious in aphids. This infectious transcript of <b>a</b> <b>cloned</b> RhPV genome provides a valuable tool, and a more tractable system without interference from baculovirus infection, for investigating replication and pathogenesis of dicistroviruses...|$|R

5|$|Gaunt was a late {{entry to}} the {{controversial}} storyline, created mainly as a plot device to return Harry to life; the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter into thinking he was <b>a</b> <b>clone,</b> and assuming his father's Green Goblin identity. However, this narrative was rejected by newly-promoted editor in chief Bob Harras, and eventually Norman was chosen to be the mastermind. Following the Clone Saga, Green Goblin re-established himself as a supervillain and Spider-Man's nemesis, serving as the main antagonist of several arcs thereafter.|$|E

5|$|After Boisselier {{announced}} that {{no evidence of}} the cloning would be provided, journalists became very skeptical of her story. While discussing Boisselier's management of Clonaid, Palmer notes {{that it is impossible}} to know why she stated that <b>a</b> <b>clone</b> was produced but then refused to provide evidence. She argues that her refusal to provide evidence may have been because she organized a hoax, did not wish to publicize the birth of an unhealthy child, or was taken advantage of by a scientist she had hired. American science journalist Steven S. Hall criticized the media for their coverage of Clonaid, believe that they were inarticulately represented as a credible group. He speculates that the coverage of Boisselier and other cloning adherents galvanized sentiment against cloning, leading to its banning in the U.S.|$|E
