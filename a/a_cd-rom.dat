5|$|Though the Sega CD {{offers a}} faster processor, its main {{purpose is to}} expand {{the size of the}} games. Whereas ROM {{cartridges}} of the day typically contained 8 to 16 megabits of data, <b>a</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> disc can hold more than 640 megabytes of data, more than 320 times the storage of a Genesis cartridge. This allows the Sega CD to run games containing full motion video.|$|E

5|$|The Sega CD, {{released}} as the Mega-CD in most regions outside North America, is <b>a</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> accessory for the Sega Genesis video game console designed and produced by Sega {{as part of}} the fourth generation of video game consoles.

5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained that Lincoln was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not run on a Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} <b>a</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> drive, but Lincoln made it sound as if the game was unworthy of Nintendo's moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance themselves from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Square {{showed an}} {{interactive}} SGI technical demonstration of Final Fantasy VI for the then {{next generation of}} consoles. The demonstration used Silicon Graphics's prototype Nintendo 64 workstations to create 3D graphics. Fans believed the demo was of a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 console; however, 1997 saw the release of Final FantasyVII for the Sony PlayStation. The switch was due to a dispute with Nintendo over its use of faster but more expensive cartridges, {{as opposed to the}} slower and cheaper, but much higher capacity Compact Discs used on rival systems. Final FantasyVII introduced 3D graphics with fully pre-rendered backgrounds. It was because of this switch to 3D that <b>a</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> format was chosen over a cartridge format. The switch also led to increased production costs and a greater subdivision of the creative staff for Final FantasyVII and subsequent 3D titles in the series.|$|E

5|$|Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have {{frequently}} been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both {{set in the}} Sprawl trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and New Rose Hotel (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former {{was the first time}} in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and <b>a</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> interactive video game. , Vincenzo Natali still hoped to bring Neuromancer to the screen, after some years in development hell. Count Zero was at one point being developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive, has also been optioned and bought. An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in 2006, and Pattern Recognition was in the process of development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project. Announced at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story Dogfight by BAFTA award-winning writer and director Simon Pummell. Written by Gibson and Michael Swanwick and first published in Omni in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer Janine Marmot at Hot Property Films.|$|E
5|$|Secret of Mana was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} a launch title for the SNES-CD add-on. After the contract between Nintendo and Sony to produce the add-on failed, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the competing PlayStation console, Square adapted the game for the SNES cartridge format. The game had to be altered to fit the storage space of a SNES game cartridge, which is much smaller than that of <b>a</b> <b>CD-ROM.</b> The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, believing that {{too much of the}} game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone. One of the most significant changes was the removal of the option to take multiple routes through the game that led to several possible endings, in contrast to the linear journey in the final product. The plot that remained was different than the original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone. Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations, and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game. In 2006, Level magazine claimed that Secret of Manas rocky development was Square's main inspiration to move their games, such as the Final Fantasy series, from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the Genesis, Sega's Consumer Products Research and Development Labs led by manager Tomio Takami were tasked with {{creating}} <b>a</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> add-on for the system, which became the Sega CD. The Sega CD was originally intended to equal the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-CD, but with twice as much random-access memory (RAM), and sell for about JP¥20,000 (or US$150). In addition to relatively short loading times, Takami's team planned for the device to feature hardware scaling and rotation similar to that found in Sega's arcade games, which required the use of a dedicated digital signal processor (DSP). However, two changes made later in development contributed to the final unit's higher than expected price. Because the Genesis' Motorola 68000 CPU was too slow to handle the Sega CD's new graphical capabilities, an additional 68000 CPU was incorporated into the add-on. In addition, upon hearing rumors that NEC planned a memory upgrade to the TurboGrafx-CD, which would bring its available RAM from 0.5 Mbit to between 2 and 4 Mbit, Sega decided to increase the Sega CD's available RAM from 1 Mbit to 6 Mbit. This proved {{to be one of the}} greatest technical challenges during development since the Genesis' access speed was initially too slow to run programs effectively. The cost of the device was now estimated at $370, but market research convinced Sega executives that consumers would be willing to pay more for a state-of-the-art machine. Sega partnered with JVC, which had been working with Warner New Media to develop a CD player under the CD+G standard, to develop the Sega CD.|$|E
