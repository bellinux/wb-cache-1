5|$|The first {{regulating}} Act for the National Archives of Malta was Act IV, {{passed in}} 1990. Catalogues were published on CD-ROM, an annual lecture was established and an exhibition centre was opened. In 2005, Act V came into force, creating {{the post of}} National Archivist (currently Charles J. Farrugia) and created the National Archives as <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> under the Government of Malta's umbrella. Since its opening, the National Archives have opened up three new facilities.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E
25|$|There are {{differences}} between Islamic and Western legal systems. For example, sharia classically recognizes only natural persons, and never developed {{the concept of}} <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>person,</b> or corporation, i.e., a legal entity that limits the liabilities of its managers, shareholders, and employees; exists beyond the lifetimes of its founders; and that can own assets, sign contracts, and appear in court through representatives. Interest prohibitions imposed secondary costs by discouraging record keeping and delaying the introduction of modern accounting. Such factors, according to Timur Kuran, have {{played a significant role}} in retarding economic development in the Middle East.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is mainly based on geographical division. Every member belongs to the parish of their domicile, with parish boundaries following municipal boundaries. Large cities, on the other hand, are usually divided into several parishes, with the geographical location of the members' homes determining parish membership. The membership of a parish varies from a few hundred in small municipalities to around 60,000 members in the parish of Malmi, Helsinki. According to the Church Act, the parish is responsible for all the practical work performed by the church. The parish is headed by the vicar and the parish council. Both are elected by the members, using equal, closed voting. The term of the parish council is four years while the vicar is elected for life or until he reaches sixty-eight years of age. A parish is <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> of public nature, capable of taxing its members. The amount of tax collected is decided by the parish council and falls between 1 and 2.25 percent of personal income. In practice, the tax is collected by the state, for a fee.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1800s, the US {{government}} could take away a firm's license if it acted irresponsibly. Corporations {{were viewed as}} [...] "creatures of the state" [...] under the law. In 1819, the United States Supreme Court in Dartmouth College vs. Woodward established a corporation as <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> in specific contexts. This ruling allowed corporations to be protected under the Constitution and prevented states from regulating firms. Recently countries included CSR policies in government agendas.|$|E
2500|$|Under pure [...] "chattel slavery" [...] - {{the slave}} {{ceases to be}} [...] <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> and so has no rights as a person. Historically such slaves tended to be {{involved}} in large scale industrial or agricultural work. They cannot legally marry and may be sold away from their home and relatives. This is the kind of slavery that existed under Roman law and in the antebellum Southern United States. [...] The Christian church very early treated slaves as persons, and they were allowed to be baptised, marry, and also be ordained. [...] This tended to be reflected in slavery laws of Catholic countries, so that French slaves, for example, were allowed to marry slaves or free people, though neither baptism nor marrying a free person emancipated them - an issue in the leading French legal case of Jean Boucaux (1737).|$|E

2500|$|While {{a limited}} company is {{deemed to be}} <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> {{separate}} from its shareholders and employees, {{as a matter of}} fact a company can only act through its employees, from the board of directors down. So there must be rules to attribute rights and duties to a company from its actors. This usually matters because an aggrieved third party will want to sue whoever has money to pay for breach of an obligation, and companies rather than their employees often have more money. Up until reforms in 2006 this area used to be complicated significantly by the requirement on companies to specify an objects clause for their business, for instance [...] "to make and sell, or lend on hire, railway-carriages". If companies acted outside their objects, for instance by giving a loan to build railways in Belgium, any such contracts were said to be ultra vires and consequently void. This is what happened in the early case of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co Ltd v Riche. The policy was thought to protect shareholders and creditors, whose investments or credit would not be used for an unanticipated purpose. However, it soon became clear that the ultra vires rule restricted the flexibility of businesses to expand to meet market opportunities. Void contracts might unexpectedly and arbitrarily hinder business. So companies began to draft ever longer objects clauses, often adding an extra provision stating all objects must be construed as fully separate, or the company's objects include anything directors feel is reasonably incidental to the business. Now the 2006 Act states that companies are deemed to have unlimited objects, unless they opt for restrictions. The 2006 reforms have also clarified the legal position that if a company does have limited objects, an ultra vires act will cause the directors to have breached a duty to follow the constitution under section 171. So a shareholder who disagreed with an action outside the company's objects must sue directors for any loss. Contracts remain valid and third parties will be unaffected by this alone.|$|E

6000|$|And {{this brings}} me to the last point upon which I wish to touch. The answer to all {{inquiries}} as to what has become of the enormous [275] personal and real estate which has been given over to Mr. Booth is that it is held [...] "in trust." [...] The supporters of Mr. Booth may feel justified in taking that statement [...] "on trust." [...] I do not. Anyhow, the more completely satisfactory this [...] "trust" [...] is, the less can any man who asks the public to put blind faith in his integrity and his wisdom object to acquaint them exactly with its provisions. Is the trust drawn up in favour of the Salvation Army? But what is the legal status of the Salvation Army? Have the soldiers any claim? Certainly not. Have the officers any legal interest in the [...] "trust"? Surely not. The [...] "General" [...] has taken good care to insist on their renouncing all claims as a condition of their appointment. Thus, to all appearance, the army, as <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>person,</b> is identical with Mr. Booth. And, in that case, any [...] "trust" [...] ostensibly {{for the benefit of the}} army is--what shall we say that is at once accurate and polite? ...|$|E
