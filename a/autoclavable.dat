40|$|ABSTRACT: Medical thoracoscopy is a {{valuable}} tool in the investigation and management of pleural disease. It has considerable advantages over conventional blind pleural biopsy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Despite this, the practice of this technique in the UK is limited. Most operators use the rigid thoracoscope, which may be an unfamiliar instrument to respiratory physicians. A semirigid thoracoscope is available but its use has not been possible in the UK as it requires sterilisation with ethylene oxide, which is not approved in this country. The present authors describe herein their experience with the first ever <b>autoclavable</b> semirigid thoracoscope. Medical thoracoscopy using the new instrument was performed in 56 patients between June 2004 and May 2006. All patients had been referred with a unilateral pleural effusion of unknown aetiology, where blind pleural aspiration had failed to yield an answer. Diagnostic samples were taken and talc poudrage performed where appropriate. The instrument was easy to handle and excellent views were obtained. Histologically adequate biopsy samples were obtained in 54 patients. The combination of clinical features, computed tomography findings and thoracoscopic biopsy enabled a definite diagnosis in 49 (90. 7 %) of these patients. There were no complications. The <b>autoclavable</b> semirigid thoracoscope has immense potential in the diagnosis and management of pleural disease. Its diagnostic yield in pleural disease {{is comparable to the}} conventional rigid thoracoscope. It is similar in design to the fibreoptic bronchoscope and respiratory physicians should be able to adapt to its use easily. It is also compatible with existing video processors and light sources available in most endoscopy suites. The fact that this instrument is <b>autoclavable</b> should open the field for its use in the UK as well as in other countries...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{introduced}} plastic swivel connectors (both <b>autoclavable</b> and disposable) {{were examined}} under laboratory conditions for gas leakage. The leak from the <b>autoclavable</b> connectors before autoclaving nearly always exceeded 5 %. Although this leak was diminished after autoclaving, the swivelling property was greatly decreased. The position of maximal leakage {{was found to}} vary with {{the position of the}} connector on the tracheal or tracheostomy tube adaptor. The magnitude of the leaks obtained varied, only the disposable connectors complying with our own criteria. Comparison of the plastic connectors was made with one type of metal swivel connector which was also found to be acceptable for clinical use. Lightweight plastic connectors capable of rotating through 360 ° are available for connecting tracheal or tracheostomy tube adaptors to a catheter mount. Their swivelling property allows repositioning of ventilator tubing without disconnecting the patient and reduces torsion forces and drag on the tracheal or tracheostomy tube. This could diminish the occurrence of uneven pressure areas, ulceration of surrounding tissues and possible displacement of the tube. Because such connectors are so mobile there is a danger of gas leakage. The present study was de-signed to investigate this possibility. Two types of plastic swivel connectors were tested; one was suit-able for sterilization in an autoclave and the other was disposable. The results were compared with those from a metal connector possessing similar properties. DESIGN OF CONNECTORS <b>Autoclavable</b> plastic connector. The construction of this swivel connector (Portex Ltd, Hythe, Kent) is shown in figure 1. It is a right-angled tube made from acetyl copolymer; one limb connects to a catheter mount, the other houses an inner female 15 mm internal diameter connection which can be push fitted on to a male 15 mm tracheal tube adaptor.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} tasks for the surgeon during the removal of low-grade gliomas is to identify as precisely as possible the borders between functional and non-functional brain tissue with the aim of obtaining the maximal possible resection which allows to the patient the longer survival. For this purpose, systems for acute extracellular recordings of single neuron and multi-unit activity are considered promising. Here we describe a system to be used with 16 microelectrodes arrays that consists of an <b>autoclavable</b> headstage, a built-in inserter for precise electrode positioning and a system that measures and controls the pressure exerted by the headstage on the brain with a twofold purpose: to increase recording stability and to avoid disturbance of local perfusion which would cause a degradation {{of the quality of the}} recording and, eventually, local ischemia. With respect to devices where only electrodes are <b>autoclavable,</b> our design permits the reduction of noise arising from long cable connections preserving at the same time the flexibility and avoiding long-lasting gas sterilization procedures. Finally, size is much smaller and set up time much shorter compared to commercial systems currently in use in surgery rooms, making it easy to consider our system very useful for intra-operatory mapping operations. © 2007 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} profile of infectious laboratory waste being autoclaved was examined {{relative to the}} type of containers used in the process. A standardized waste load (1, 750 +/- 4 g) placed in the container was evaluated by using a direct readout thermocouple. The sensor of the thermocouple was placed within an unused and outdated agar plate, centrally located about 5 cm {{from the bottom of the}} container. The gravity displacement autoclave tested reached 121 degrees C within 3 min. Waste within a steel container (plus 1 liter of water) reached 108, 120, and 122 degrees C at 12, 30, and 50 min, respectively. Without the addition of water, the corresponding temperatures were 60, 110, and 120 degrees C, respectively. With a steel container, "autoclavable" plastic bags, and no additional water, the temperatures were 36, 71, and 105 degrees C, respectively. When 1 liter of water was placed in the <b>autoclavable</b> bag, the temperatures were 98, 115, and 121 degrees C, respectively.

40|$|The heat {{resistance}} and ultrastructural features of spore suspensions prepared from Clostridium thermocellum LQRI, Clostridium thermosulfurogenes 4 B, and Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum 39 E were compared {{as a function}} of decimal reduction time. The decimal reduction times at 121 degrees C for strains LQRI, 4 B, and 39 E were 0. 5, 2. 5, and 11 min. The higher degree of spore {{heat resistance}} was associated with a spore architecture displaying a thicker cortex layer. Heat resistance of these spores was proportional to the ratio of spore cortex volume to cytoplasmic volume. These ratios for spores of strains LQRI, 4 B, and 39 E were 1. 4, 1. 6, and 6. 6, respectively.

40|$|Recombinant glycoproteins such as {{monoclonal}} antibodies have a {{major impact}} on modern healthcare systems, e. g., as the active pharmaceutical ingredients in anticancer drugs. A specific glycan profile is often necessary to achieve certain desirable activities, such as the effector functions of an antibody, receptor binding or a sufficient serum half-life. However, many expression systems produce glycan profiles that differ substantially from the preferred form (usually the form found in humans) or produce a diverse array of glycans with a range of in vivo activities, thus necessitating laborious and costly separation and purification processes. In contrast, protein glycosylation in plant cells is much more homogeneous than other systems, with only one or two dominant forms. Additionally, these glycan profiles tend to remain stable when the process and cultivation conditions are changed, making plant cells an ideal expression system to produce recombinant glycoproteins with uniform glycan profiles in a consistent manner.
