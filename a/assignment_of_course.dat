40|$|The {{combinatorial}} assignment {{problem has}} three principal features: (i) agents require bundles of indivisible objects; (ii) monetary transfers are prohibited; and (iii) the market administrator cares about both e ¢ ciency and fairness. An {{example of this}} problem is the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> schedules to students. Impossibility theorems have established that the only e ¢ cient and strategyproof mechanisms in this environment are dictatorships. Any non-dictatorship solution will involve compromise of e ¢ ciency or strategyproofness. This paper proposes {{a solution to the}} combinatorial assignment problem. Since we lack attainable criteria of fairness for this environment, I begin by formalizing two such criteria. The maximin share guarantee, based on the idea of divide-and-choose, generalizes and weakens fair share. Envy bounded by a single good weakens envy freeness. Both criteria recognize that indivisibilities complicate fair division, but exploit the fact that bundles of indivisible objects are somewhat divisible. Dictatorships fail both criteria. Second, I propose a speci…c mechanism, the Approximate Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes Mechanism, which satis…es the fairness criteria while maintaining attractive compromises of e ¢ ciency and strategyproofness.

40|$|Timetable {{problem is}} a {{well-known}} multidimensional, constraint assignment problem that focuses in the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>courses</b> to faculty members in classrooms within limited time slots. Hence, it is a challenging time-consuming problem facing universities and {{it belongs to the}} NP-hard class of problems. In particular, universities regularly need an optimal solution for the course timetable problem. However, a manual solution to this problem by considering all constraints usually requires a long time and hard work to offer proper, optimized solution. Specifically, timetabling problem scan be modeled as Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), which are combinatorial in nature. Particularly, a variety of approaches are used to investigate CSPs, such as constraint logic programming (CLP) that combines the declaratively of logic programming with the efficiency of methods from operations research and artificial intelligence. This paper introduces a model that applies CLP to the timetabling as a CSP on the use of an Optimization Programming Language (OPL). The proposed model is tested against real data obtained from the Community College (CC), at University of Sharjah (UoS) that has a so sophisticated timetable with much interlaced, limited resources and limited time slots...|$|R

The deliberate combination of human and biophysical environments, systems, scales and geographies results in a milieu that is both easy and mind-bendingly complex.

40|$|To {{what extent}} is {{uncertainty}} concerning process status a cause of waste in construction workflows? Work studies and action research are expensive methods for investigation of such questions concerning construction workflow control policies and their results have limited applicability. Agent-based simulation (ABS) is particularly suitable for modelling peoples’ behavior and interaction in complex settings, like in construction, and therefore represents an alternative. We present a parametric ABS system (EPIC 2. 0) developed using a relational data model for modelling construction workflow; the model enables users to specify the construction subjects (subcontractor trade crews), their work methods, the amount of work, the workspaces (locations), dependencies between the works, etc. The simulation encapsulates both variability and uncertainty in the construction workflow. Variability arising from design changes, quality checks and working conditions may lead to random change in workload and performance. Uncertainty arises {{from the fact that}} agents do not have full or perfect information. The major advantages of this ABS system are its ability to run differently configured virtual projects in terms of work crews, locations and production system control policies and to test the relative impacts of various approaches to communication of process status information.

Consequently, curriculum design for first year students requires {{an awareness of the}} need to provide commencing students with a framework for meeting the requirements of the academic environment. This paper illustrates how the successful practice of teaching first year students addresses the learning issues and needs of first year university students through the use of scaffolding and developmental assessment.

The core element of this tool is a set of translation levels, which helps designers with the translation of meaningful associations into design features.

Students who use a higher level of the tool are receiving a higher grade, because they are able to integrate meaning and forms in a more abstract way.
