5|$|A {{more mundane}} {{example is the}} {{presence}} of astrological symbols found on some shoes <b>and</b> <b>sandals</b> from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes <b>and</b> <b>sandals</b> is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.|$|E
5|$|Freimann and Bein (50 Jaffa Road) was {{the first}} luxury shoe store in Israel. Founded by German-Jewish immigrants, it {{imported}} quality leather shoes from Europe and attracted a clientele of British officers and Arab sheikhs. The store originally opened in the Generali Building further east on Jaffa Road in 1935 and moved to 50 Jaffa Road in 1947. It closed in 2014. Khalifa Shoes (44 Jaffa Road), founded in 1954, is a Jewish family-owned business specializing in Israeli-made shoes <b>and</b> <b>sandals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Known to Māori as tī kōuka, {{the tree}} {{was used as a}} source of food, {{particularly}} in the South Island, where it was cultivated in areas where other crops would not grow. It provided durable fibre for textiles, anchor ropes, fishing lines, baskets, waterproof rain capes and cloaks, <b>and</b> <b>sandals.</b> Hardy and fast growing, C.australis is widely planted in New Zealand gardens, parks and streets, and numerous cultivars are available. The tree can also be found in large numbers in island restoration projects such as Tiritiri Matangi Island, where it was among the first seedling trees to be planted.|$|E

25|$|In the 12th century, the abbots of Fulda claimed {{precedence}} of {{the archbishop}} of Cologne. Abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state, and {{in defiance of the}} prohibition of early councils and the protests of St Bernard and others, adopted the episcopal insignia of mitre, ring, gloves <b>and</b> <b>sandals.</b>|$|E
25|$|Zisapel {{is known}} {{throughout}} Israel’s business community for {{his penchant for}} wearing jeans <b>and</b> <b>sandals</b> while at work and his preference for flying economy class while traveling abroad.

50|$|Colossus and the Headhunters, {{also known}} in its {{original}} Italian title as Maciste contro i cacciatori di teste ("Maciste against the head-hunters"), is a sword <b>and</b> <b>sandal</b> film created in Italy and released in 1963. It is notable for having no monsters, which was {{a hallmark of the}} sword <b>and</b> <b>sandal</b> genre, instead featuring the titular Headhunter tribe as antagonists. Another alternate title was Fury of the Headhunters.|$|R
50|$|The 1982 film {{adaptation}} of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian, for example, {{is a personal}} (non-epic) story concerning the hero's quest for revenge and his efforts to thwart a single megalomaniac—while saving a beautiful princess in the process. Some critics refer to such films by the term Sword <b>and</b> <b>Sandal</b> rather than Sword and Sorcery, although others would maintain that the Sword <b>and</b> <b>Sandal</b> label should be reserved only for the subset of fantasy films set in ancient times on the planet Earth, and still others would broaden the term to encompass films that have no fantastic elements whatsoever. To some, the term Sword <b>and</b> <b>Sandal</b> has pejorative connotations, designating a film with a low-quality script, bad acting, and poor production values.|$|R

25|$|Another bronze piece, dated c. 750 BC and {{presently}} in the Heraklion Museum, shows two helmeted {{but otherwise}} nude youths, one {{older than the}} other. They both display erections and stand beside each other holding hands. Yet another bronze cutout dated to the 7th century BC shows a lad, nude except for a long, decorative cape <b>and</b> <b>sandals,</b> holding a bow and quiver. These pieces document that this Cretan initiatory tradition continued over many centuries and that later offerings left by pairs of lovers at this shrine became more elaborate and erotically explicit.|$|E
25|$|Costume {{is another}} {{strength}} of the collection. In addition to the 'oldest dress' there is a unique beadnet dress of a dancer from the Pyramid Age (about 2400 BC), two long sleeved robes of the same date, a suit of armour from the palace of Memphis, as well as socks <b>and</b> <b>sandals</b> from the Roman period. The collection contains works of art from Akhenaten’s city at Amarna: colourful tiles, carvings and frescoes, from many other important Egyptian and Nubian settlements and burial sites. The museum houses the world’s largest collection of Roman period mummy portraits (first to second centuries AD).|$|E
25|$|During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far {{northern}} India, {{in what is}} now southern Afghanistan {{and northern}} Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because Gandharan Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays Greek and Persian artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes <b>and</b> <b>sandals,</b> acanthus leaf decorations, etc.|$|E

25|$|A major {{contribution}} to the recent growth in the overall Bahamian economy is Kerzner International's Atlantis Resort and Casino, which took over the former Paradise Island Resort and has provided a much needed boost to the economy. In addition, the opening of Breezes Super Club <b>and</b> <b>Sandals</b> Resort also aided this turnaround. The Bahamian Government also has adopted a proactive approach to courting foreign investors and has conducted major investment missions to the Far East, Europe, Latin America, and Canada. The {{primary purpose of the}} trips was to restore the reputation of The Bahamas in these markets.|$|E
25|$|About 20 matrilineal clans were {{recognized}} by the Acoma. Traditional child rearing involved very little discipline. Couples were generally monogamous and divorce was rare. Funerary rites involved ceremony and quick burial after death, followed by four days and nights of vigil. Women would wear cotton dresses <b>and</b> <b>sandals</b> or high moccasin boots. Traditional clothing for men involved cotton kilts and leather sandals. Rabbit and deer skin was used for clothing and robes, as well. In the seventeenth century horses {{were introduced to the}} Pueblo by the Spanish. Education was overseen by kiva headmen who taught about human behavior, spirit and body, astrology, ethics, child psychology, oratory, history, dance, and music.|$|E
25|$|Jewelery (such as brooches), weapons (including swords with {{decorative}} hilts) {{and clothing}} (such as capes <b>and</b> <b>sandals)</b> {{have been found}} in a number of grave sites. The grave of Queen Aregund, discovered in 1959, and the Treasure of Gourdon, which was deposited soon after 524, are notable examples. The few Merovingian illuminated manuscripts that have survived, such as the Gelasian Sacramentary, contain a great deal of zoomorphic representations. Such Frankish objects show a greater use of the style and motifs of Late Antiquity and a lesser degree of skill and sophistication in design and manufacture than comparable works from the British Isles. So little has survived, however, that the best quality of work from this period may not be represented.|$|E

25|$|The Games of 1870 {{took place}} like the {{training}} in the Panathenaic stadium, which was excavated, restored and provided with wooden benches {{in order to accommodate}} 30,000 people, a huge number for the time. In general the contest was much better organized and athletes were uniformly dressed, with sport costumes <b>and</b> <b>sandals</b> in skin color. On November 1, the Games were officially opened, but athletic events were postponed to November 15 due to bad weather, which also forced the cancellation of all nautical events, horse races and shooting events. Athletes included Greek nationals, as well as ethnic Greeks from the Ottoman Empire and Crete (then a semi-independent state under Ottoman suzerainty). Some 20,000 to 25,000 spectators watched the 31 athletes who had previously qualified compete in a variety of events. Before the competition started, the athletes were asked to take an oath that they would compete in a fair manner. At the same time, the Games included a competition in the arts.|$|E
25|$|Episode five: Bianca and Andy - Bianca {{was very}} much {{looking forward to the}} time when her husband Andy {{returned}} from an eighteen-year stint serving with the RAF. The thirty-four-year-old couple were reunited to help bring up their growing family. But events did not run as expected. With three boys under ten, and a fourth child on the way, Bianca feels over-worked and unappreciated by her partner. Meanwhile, Andy does not adjust easily to spending so much time at home and now feels there is no communication in the partnership. Andy makes an effort to dress up for college, but at home Bianca only sees him in old jeans with socks <b>and</b> <b>sandals.</b> Woodall and Constantine question whether a new wardrobe can help the couple's marriage. Woodall helps Bianca to embrace her growing pregnancy bump with carefully fitted dresses and tops. With the help of hairdresser Richard Ward the couple are transformed and given a fresh look and made to feel happier and more comfortable together in their relationship.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks <b>and</b> <b>sandals.</b> Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E

[...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift <b>and</b> <b>sandals.</b> I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd never seen anything like it. Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E
