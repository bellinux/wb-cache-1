Unlike Austen, Brontë makes a woman the center of interest. Reticent Mrs. Graham with her views on alcohol consumption and girls’ education, controversial for the 19th century, soon becomes an outcast.|$|E
25|$|After the disappointing {{performance}} of Millionaires the band chose to start anew {{in their approach}} to their next album, working with Eno once again. They spent most of 2000 recording the album; writing the songs, then performing them live before actually recording them.

The album's artwork featured a composite image of the faces of all the band members to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>person.</b> The album reached only number 11, the lowest position for a James studio album since their signing to Fontana.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, rats did not {{directly}} start {{the spread of the}} bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>person,</b> and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.|$|E
25|$|The veneration of nats also shares similar {{practices}} with Buddhism. In Buddhism, offerings are extremely common and expected. Shrines and temples, {{in which these}} offerings are to be made, are seen in both Burmese folk religion and Buddhism. In both the faiths, many different statues of various deities {{can also be seen}} around the house. Burmese folk religion differs dramatically in the concept of a soul. Buddhism does not believe in a soul that leaves after one dies, but rather a consciousness that is transferred to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>person</b> (consciousness is reborn in another). In contrast, Burmese folk religion holds that the soul can leave the body it inhabits. This soul is often depicted {{in the form of a}} butterfly called a leppya. The act of the soul leaving the host often happens in dreams, or when someone is sick or dying. If one is awoken in the middle of their dream, it is said that their soul might not be back to them yet. If a host tries to live without its soul it will die. When someone is dying, butterfly hunts are often held to try to recapture the soul that has wondered off.|$|E

Fisher's {{connection}} with the Washington Post arose because of his close friendship with the Post's then-owner Phillip Graham since his early days in Washington, D.C. [...] Both Fisher and Graham had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter and had shared a rented house (belonging to future Secretary of State Dean Acheson), together with [...] Donald Hiss (brother of Alger Hiss). From 1969 to 1975, Fisher served as Dean of Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.

She said on the photograph, [...] "Having an Iconic Moment in the studio with Toby-Mozilla and S1. My throat hurts from singing, laughing and crying." [...] Gad worked with Madonna on fourteen songs, twelve appeared on the album's multiple track lists, with one being [...] "Iconic". According to Gad, [...] "The first week she was quite intimidating. It was like a test phase. You have to criticize, but you can't really offend. But she also likes honest, harsh critics to say things as they are. It worked out really well and she got sweeter and sweeter." [...] For the track, she initially asked American rapper Jay Z to be featured on with verses about icons, however he called American rapper Chance the Rapper and said {{that it would be better}} if somebody that was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>person</b> and that he thought that could be a new icon got on the record. Chance and Madonna had met before through American recording artist Frank Ocean in a concert and became friends, prompting the singer to accept Jay Z's suggestion.|$|E

For this reason, Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of Humanae vitae, that the transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator.

[...] (17) Others, such as Denise Chavez (Face of an Angel,1994) support Olmos' position. In an interview with Margot Kelly, Chavez concludes, [...] "Anaya maintains that the kind of protagonist who will be able to become free is a person of synthesis, a person who is able to draw [...] [...] [...]on our Spanish roots and our native indigenous roots and become <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>person,</b> become that Mestizo with a unique perspective." [...] In general, Amy Barrias' analyses of representative coming-of-age Chicano and American Indian texts, including Bless Me, Ultima allows her to conclude that because American Indian and Chicano(a) writers find very little in dominant culture on which to build an identity, they have turned inward to create their own texts of rediscovery.

In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show on the windowsill in their mother's bedroom. “It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I’m a spin-off of my sister’s show, as she likes to point out.” In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Édith Piaf. [...] "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone." [...] She would also perform alone for herself after everyone had gone to bed. [...] "I'd stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself until I fell asleep. I'd interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them." [...] Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. [...] "We weren't the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!" [...] The marriage brought an end to the children's late night antics. [...] "There was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>person</b> in her bed now and I couldn't do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." [...] Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household. The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didn't take to her upper crust accent. [...] "I had to talk like them to avoid being beaten up." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first was}} an almost {{complete}} disruption of relations with his parents. [...] The proximate cause was his friendship and later love {{for one of his}} private piano pupils, Eugénie-Félicité-Caroline Saillot (1824–1918), whose parents were members of the Comédie-Française company under the stage name of Desmousseaux. [...] He had known her from his years at the Conservatoire, and for young Franck Félicité Desmousseaux's family home had become something of a refuge from his overbearing father. [...] When in 1846 Nicolas-Joseph found a composition dedicated to [...] "Mlle. F. Desmousseaux, in pleasant memories" [...] among César-Auguste's papers, he tore it up in the latter's presence. [...] César-Auguste went directly to the Desmousseauxs', wrote out the piece from memory, and presented it to Félicité with a dedicatory line. [...] Relations with his father worsened, who forbade any thought of betrothal and marriage (which French law permitted of a father for a son younger than 25), accusing him of distressing his mother and shouting at him about a then notorious husband-wife poisoning case as the most likely outcome of any match by his son. His mother's role in the dispute is unclear: she was either mildly supportive of her son or stayed completely out of the conflict. [...] On a Sunday in July, César-Auguste walked out of his parents' house for the last time with nothing but what he could carry, and moved to the Desmousseauxs', where he was welcomed. [...] From that time on, young Franck termed himself and signed his papers and works as César Franck or plain C. Franck. [...] "It was his intention to make a clean break with his father and to let it be known he had done so [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] He was determined to become <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>person,</b> as different as possible from the other." ...|$|E
