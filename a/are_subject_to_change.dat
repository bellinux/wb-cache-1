5|$|The FA Cup is English football's {{primary cup}} competition. It was first held in 1871–72 with only 15 teams entering; {{the growth of}} the sport and changes to the competition's {{structure}} meant that by 2000, more than 600 teams took part. Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup in the third round and are drawn randomly out of a hat with the remaining clubs.

25|$|More than 60 years later, Bateman’s Principle has {{received}} considerable attention. Sutherland argued that males' higher variance in reproductive success {{may result from}} random mating and coincidence. Hubbell and Johnson suggested that variance in reproductive success can be greatly influenced by the time and allocations of mating. In 2005, Gowaty and Hubbell suggested that mating tendencies <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> depending on certain strategies. They argued that there are cases in which males can be more selective than females, whereas Bateman suggested that his paradigm would be “almost universal” among sexually reproducing species. Critics proposed that females might be more subject to sexual selection than males, but not in all circumstances. An example of a species that flouts Bateman's principle is the pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides. Female pseudoscorpions that mated {{with more than one}} male had higher reproductive success.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this discrepancy. First, some news sources include only pledged delegates in their total count, while others include superdelegates. Second, {{estimates}} of superdelegate votes are unreliable and <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Third, pledged delegates in many states are selected at county or state conventions late in the process; thus, the initial primary and caucus results provide only a projection of pledged delegates, highlighted by the discrepancies with the Iowa county convention results. Fourth, {{in the days after}} an election, results in individual precincts may be delayed, and news organizations may project the winners of those precincts based on statistical analysis or may wait for confirmed results. The Democratic nominating process is a complex system that has evolved over time, and in close races, it can be difficult under the current system to know who is leading in the delegate count.|$|E
25|$|Distribution of {{voltage-gated}} sodium channels {{along the}} dendritic membrane plays {{a crucial role}} in a dendrites ability to propagate a signal. High dendritic membrane thresholds often make it harder for initiation of dendritic spikes. However, increased density of voltage-gated sodium channels may reduce the amplitude of a signal needed to initiate a spike. Clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels have been observed at the synapses of the globus pallidus neuron. It has also been demonstrated through dendritic computational models that the threshold amplitude of a synaptic conductance needed to generate a dendritic spike is significantly less if the voltage-gated sodium channels are clustered at the synapse. The same type of voltage-gated channels may differ in distribution between the soma and dendrite within the same neuron. There seems to be no general pattern of distribution for voltage-gated channels within dendrites. Different neuronal dendrites exhibit different density patterns which <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> during development and can be modulated by neurotransmitters.|$|E

500|$|The Football League Cup is a cup {{competition}} open to {{clubs in}} the Premier League and Football League. Like the FA Cup it is played on a knockout basis, {{with the exception of}} the semi-finals, which are contested over a two-legged tie. Wenger's tenure at Arsenal has seen him use the competition to field younger and lesser known players, something he and Ferguson were initially criticised for in 1997. While Ferguson felt it was an unwanted distraction at the time, Wenger said: [...] "If the competition wants to survive it must offer the incentive of a European place."
