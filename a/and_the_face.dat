5|$|Previous {{security}} {{features in the}} Ship Series were carried over to the Portrait Series, and new ones incorporated into the banknote. The two most prominent {{security features}} are the engraved portrait of Yusof bin Ishak (which contains fine lines that are difficult for counterfeiters to mimic) and the Kinegram (a printed security hologram); MAS states that banknotes with missing or mutilated portrait or/and Kinegram command no value. Paper versions issued by BCCS features its logo <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> value, while those issued by the MAS features its logo with the Merlion (a mythical creature and national symbol) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> value. Polymer versions of the banknote have the Kinegram replaced by {{an image of the}} Singapore lion symbol with the face value, showing the coat of arms of Singapore when tilted at varying degrees.|$|E

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps) {{is a small}} American sparrow. This {{passerine}} {{is primarily}} found across the Southwestern United States {{and much of the}} interior of Mexico, south to the transverse mountain range, and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the transverse range. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. Twelve subspecies are generally recognized, though up to eighteen have been suggested. This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. The crown is rufous, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and supercilium are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a thick black malar streak.|$|E

5|$|The tear streaks are a {{means of}} visual communication. The tear streaks {{combined}} with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> are obscure from a distance, {{and so are the}} expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.|$|E
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} (Sitta carolinensis) {{is a small}} songbird of the nuthatch family which breeds in old-growth woodland {{across much}} of temperate North America. It is a stocky bird, with a large head, short tail, powerful bill, and strong feet. The upperparts are pale blue-gray, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and underparts are white. It has a black cap and a chestnut lower belly. The nine subspecies differ mainly in {{the color of the}} body plumage.|$|E
5|$|R.S. Yeoman's 2014 {{edition of}} A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the Lafayette dollar at $650 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) ranging upwards to $19,000 in near-pristine MS-66. One in MS-67 condition, tied with {{multiple}} others {{for the best}} condition known, sold in 2004 for $66,700. Most Lafayette dollars display contact marks from other coins as the pieces were mechanically ejected from the press into a hopper and no {{attempt was made to}} preserve their appearance for collectors. Although whether the specimen is well-struck or not rarely affects value, clearly struck specimens will show the engraving line separating Lafayette's boot from the rest of his uniform, and details of the lower part of his clothing will also be distinct. The highest points on the coin, at which wear should be most apparent, are Washington's cheekbone on the obverse <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of Lafayette on the reverse.|$|E

Keibler got upset victories over Kim, Stratus, and Holly. She earned a Women's Championship title match on October 11, 2004, but she was defeated by Stratus, who retained the title.

She was eliminated second to last after jumping over the top rope to avoid hitting the turnbuckle, followed by Holly knocking her off the apron to eliminate her.|$|E
5|$|The Turtle was {{the first}} {{submersible}} vessel used for combat {{and led to the}} development of what we know today as the modern submarine, forever changing underwater warfare <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of naval warfare. As such, the Turtle has been replicated many times to show new audience the roots of submarine technology, how much it has changed, and the influence it has had on modern submarines. By the 1950s, historian of technology Brooke Hindle credited the Turtle as “the greatest of the wartime inventions.” The Turtle remains a source of national as well as regional pride, which led to the construction of several replicas, a number of which exist in Bushnell’s home state of Connecticut. As Benjamin Gale noted in 1775, the vessel was “constructed with great simplicity,” and it has thus inspired at least four replicas. Many of these followed the designs set down by Bushnell, with “precise and comprehensive descriptions of his submarine,” which aided the replication process.|$|E
5|$|The {{characteristic}} {{bright orange}} bill plates and other facial characteristics {{develop in the}} spring. At {{the close of the}} breeding season, these special coatings and appendages are shed in a partial moult. This makes the beak appear less broad, the tip less bright and the base darker grey. The eye ornaments are shed and the eyes appear round. At the same time, the feathers {{of the head and neck}} are replaced <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> becomes darker. This winter plumage is seldom seen by humans because when they have left their chicks, the birds head out to sea and do not return to land until the next breeding season. The juvenile bird is similar to the adult in plumage but altogether duller with a much darker grey face and yellowish-brown beak tip and legs. After fledging, it will make its way to the water and will head out to sea and not return to land for several years. In the interim, each year it will have a broader bill, paler face patches and brighter legs and beak.|$|E

5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E
