5|$|By the 1970s, the Auxois {{had almost}} become extinct, and the French {{government}} began pushing the breeding of all native draft horses for meat production, {{as opposed to}} agricultural usage. However, the meat of the Auxois was not considered high quality, and this, combined with a lower-than-expected market for meat, led to a continued decline in French draft horse populations. In the 1990s, the French government reversed its position on breeding for meat, and began promoting draft breeds for leisure pursuits. The Auxois continues to be rare, having the eighth-smallest population numbers of the nine native French draft breeds. An annual breed show is held in Semur-en-Auxois, and the Auxois is frequently seen at the Paris International <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Show.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each year, the Trait du Nord is {{honored at}} an <b>agricultural</b> <b>show</b> and horse show in Paris. In 1995, the breed won the International Workhorse Trophy at the Paris show and in 2010, a Trait du Nord {{took the first}} place prize for weight pulling at the show. Trait du Nord teams {{participate}} in the Route du Poisson, a relay race commemorating the route that teams took to bring fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris until the 19th century. The race takes place {{every two or three}} years and is the biggest equine relay race in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Lurgan Park, a {{few hundred}} yards from the main street, is the largest urban park in Northern Ireland and the second-largest in Ireland after Phoenix Park, Dublin. It used {{to be part of the}} estate of Brownlow House, a 19th-century Elizabethan-style manor house. In 1893, the land was {{purchased}} by Lurgan Borough Council and opened as a public park in 1909 by Earl Aberdeen, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It includes a sizeable artificial lake and an original Coalbrookdale fountain. Today the park is home to annual summer events such as the Lurgan <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Show,</b> and the Lurgan Park Rally, noted as the largest annual motor sport event in Northern Ireland and a stage in the Circuit of Ireland rally.|$|E
50|$|Prize-winners at <b>agricultural</b> <b>shows</b> are {{generally}} awarded inscribed medals, cups, rosettes or ribbons. The National Museum of Australia has a rare collection of medals documenting {{the history of}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>shows</b> and rural industries across Australia. The 111 medals range in date from the mid-19th to the early 20th century and many are associated with significant individuals and organizations.|$|R
40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>shows</b> are {{significant}} events for rural communities. Using {{the case study}} of the Royal Welsh Show, the largest event {{of its kind in}} Europe, this paper argues that <b>agricultural</b> <b>shows</b> can be seen as temporary knowledge clusters. By bringing together key rural actors, <b>agricultural</b> <b>shows</b> create temporary spaces for presentation and interaction between suppliers, producers and consumers, leading to distinct vertical and horizontal forms of knowledge exchange. Discussions take place between farmers, government and suppliers, creating trust and allowing for knowledge exchange to take place. At the same time, farmers can view and compare their stock and farming practices with that of other farmers, sharing best practice and allowing for new ideas to emerge and gain prominence in the agricultural industry. This interaction between different groups at <b>agricultural</b> <b>shows</b> creates a rural buzz, helping to maintain rural relations year round, eventually forming a community of practice...|$|R

5|$|The breed is {{accessible}} {{to the public at}} l'Asinerie nationale de la Tillauderie, an experimental farm in Dampierre-sur-Boutonne in Charente-Maritime, and at the Saintes National Stud. Members of the breed are exhibited at the annual Paris International <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Show.</b> Approximately a dozen horses are exported each year, mainly to Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. A few breeding stallions have been exported to the United States. Breeders in the US have become interested in the conservation of the breed as a draft animal, as opposed to many Europeans, who are looking for a leisure animal. A stud farm also exists in Sweden, and one in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Today, Mérens {{closest to}} the {{original}} type and lifestyle {{are found in the}} valleys of the high mountains of the Pyrenees, near Andorra. The majority of Mérens breeding still takes place in Ariege, the traditional homeland of the breed. However, they can also be found in almost all regions of France, including the Alps, the Cévennes, the Centre, the Massif Central and the Île-de-France. Besides the annual breed show in Bouan, Mérens are also commonly seen at the Paris International <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Show</b> and other major horse shows.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the breed}} are shown {{annually}} at the Paris International <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Show.</b> There are fairs {{held for the}} breed at Lessay and Gavray, in Manche. The National Stud at Saint-Lo remains involved in the maintenance {{and development of the}} breed, and organizes the annual national competition for the breed. The stud also organizes events at which to present the breed to the public, including the Normandy Horse Show. The Norman Cob is beginning to be exported to other countries, especially Belgium. In that country, some are bred pure, while others are crossed on the Ardennes to improve the latter's gaits. Approximately 15 horses are exported annually, traveling to Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy for leisure, logging and agricultural uses.|$|E
25|$|The Agricultural Societies Council banned horses from <b>agricultural</b> <b>shows</b> at Grenfell, Narromine, Barmedman, Lake Cargelligo, Finley, Manildra, Minto and Woodstock.|$|R
40|$|Metropolitan <b>agricultural</b> <b>shows</b> {{offer an}} {{appealing}} starting point {{to explore the}} shared and distinctive histories of urban and rural Australia. This paper analyses how {{and to what extent}} the Brisbane Exhibition affected its host city and how and to what extent a changing urban context affected the Exhibition, providing the foundation for developing a richer and more nuanced understanding of the history of metropolitan <b>agricultural</b> <b>shows</b> and the complex relationships between urban and rural Australians...|$|R

5|$|On 31 August 1937, three Hawker Demon {{aircraft}} of No.1 Squadron were on {{a training}} flight, during which they landed at an air base in Hamilton, Victoria. The exercise coincided with the local <b>agricultural</b> <b>show,</b> and the planes briefly provided a stationary display for the public. Recommencing their journey, the first aircraft had already taken off when the second was seen to have difficulties. The pilot, Pilot Officer Kenneth McKenzie, had attempted a climbing turn when the aircraft's engine stalled, sending the machine into a dive. McAloney—who was a passenger in the third aircraft—witnessed the incident and signalled for his pilot to stop. On doing this, McAloney immediately leapt out of his plane and ran across the airfield. Out of control, the second aircraft struck the ground and rapidly became engulfed in flames. The first on scene, McAloney dashed into the wreckage {{in an effort to}} extradite the two crew members, and was able to grab hold of McKenzie who was sprawled over the flaming main fuel tank. McAloney pulled McKenzie free of the cockpit and down on to the aircraft's wing, though McKenzie's leg became trapped in the wreckage. Despite this, McAloney continued his efforts to free McKenzie, burning his hands on the pilot's smouldering clothes. At this point, one of the wing tanks burst, rendering McAloney unconscious. He was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns, and spent the next four weeks in hospital undergoing treatment. Both McKenzie and his observer-gunner, Sergeant Norman Torrens-Witherow, perished and it was later ascertained that, owing to the injuries sustained on impact, they would not have survived even if the rescue attempt had been successful.|$|E

25|$|Despite growing {{dissatisfaction with}} the privately owned dairy enterprises, the early {{factories}} of the dairy industry encouraged a proactive approach from farmers to improve the yield {{and quality of the}} region's milk products. The agricultural and dairy success of the area was directly linked to the community's ability to lobby for land to be set aside for the Boonah Showgrounds in order to hold an <b>Agricultural</b> <b>show</b> to showcase the district's produce and reinforce community spirit. The designer and manager of the creamery, Samuel Dover, was the first secretary of the newly formed Fassifern and Dugandan Pastoral and <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Show</b> Society. The first Boonah Show was held in 1898.|$|E
