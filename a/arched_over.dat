5|$|In 2001, President Lukashenko {{issued a}} decree {{granting}} a flag to the Armed Forces of Belarus. The flag, {{which has a}} ratio of 1:1.7, has the national ornamental pattern {{along the length of}} the hoist side of the flag. On the front of the flag is the Belarusian coat of arms, with the wording УЗБРОЕНЫЯ СІЛЫ ("Armed Forces") <b>arched</b> <b>over</b> it, and РЭСПУБЛІКІ БЕЛАРУСЬ ("of Republic of Belarus") written below; the text of both is in gold. On the reverse of the flag, the center contains the symbol of the armed forces, which is a red star surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel. Above the symbol is the phrase ЗА НАШУ РАДЗІМУ ("For our Motherland"), while below is the full name of the military unit.|$|E

The Tour streamlet joins the Carmel nearby and before the confluence can be found an old well, <b>arched</b> <b>over,</b> known as the Lady's well, with never-failing, excellent and refreshingly cool water. A small wooden bridge used to run across to it from the church glebe side.|$|E
25|$|In 1664, Jan van Bonnel built a {{saw mill}} on East 74th Street and the East River, where a 13,710-meter long stream {{that began in}} the north of today's Central Park, which became known as the Saw Kill or Saw Kill Creek, emptied into the river. Later owners of the {{property}} George Elphinstone and Abraham Shotwell replaced the saw mill with a leather mill in 1677. The Saw Kill was later redirected into a culvert, <b>arched</b> <b>over,</b> and its trickling little stream was called Arch Brook.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} years, the Fort was {{accessed}} through boats only but a bridge linking the Red Fort with Salimgarh Fort {{was said to}} have been built by Jahangir, father of Shahajahan;a conflicting information also attributes its construction by Farid Khan who held the fort in Jagir. This bridge was later replaced by a railway bridge at the same location. At present, an <b>arched</b> <b>over</b> bridge connects it from the Red Fort end. From this location, the fort provides a commanding view of the Red Fort, the river and the surroundings. But it is a noisy area with continuous flow of heavy traffic from the several artery roads that surround it and also from the traffic flow from the trans–Yamuna over the existing steel bridge on the main river close by.|$|E
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is a {{moderately}} large fish, growing {{to a maximum}} recorded length of 80cm and a weight of 4 kg, however is more common between 30 and 40cm length. It is rare at lengths greater than 80cm. The species is often considered to have a rather unusual body form, having features superficially similar to tunas, mackerels and other carangids. The body is elongate and subcylindrical, becoming highly compressed toward the tail and caudal fin, with a marked median keel on the caudal peduncle. The dorsal and ventral profiles of the fish are nearly evenly , with the two profiles intersecting at the pointed snout. There are two separate dorsal fins; the first consisting of 8 moderately high spines and the second of a single spine followed by 18 to 20 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two anteriorally detached spines followed by a single spine attached to 16 or 17 soft rays. In both the dorsal and anal fins, the posterior 7-10 rays are detached and form a series of diagnostic finlets. The pectoral fin is strongly falcate (scythe shaped), and extends beyond {{the origin of the}} second dorsal fin. The lateral line is strongly <b>arched</b> <b>over</b> a short length anteriorly, with the intersection of the curved and straight sections vertically below the fourth or fifth spine of the first dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line has 21 to 29 scales, while the straight section has 51 to 59 very large scutes. The breast is devoid of scales in a triangular patch to about one-third the distance to the pectoral fin base. The eye has a well-developed adipose eyelid which nearly completely covers the eye. The upper jaw contains small villiform teeth, with some outer teeth moderately enlarged, while the lower jaw has a single row of small teeth. There are 26 to 32 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae.|$|E

Tall, round-arched windows punctuated its length and illuminated its interior, while evening skating {{was made possible by}} 500gas-jet lighting fixtures set in coloured glass globes. At a later date, the lighting was converted to electric, making {{the building}} the first in Canada to be electrified.|$|E

500|$|Thelema draws its {{principal}} gods and goddesses from Ancient Egyptian religion. The highest deity in the cosmology of Thelema is the goddess Nuit. She {{is the night}} sky <b>arched</b> <b>over</b> the Earth symbolized {{in the form of}} a naked woman. She is conceived as the Great Mother, the ultimate source of all things. [...] The second principal deity of Thelema is the god Hadit, conceived as the infinitely small point, complement and consort of Nuit. [...] Hadit symbolizes manifestation, motion, and time. He is also described in Liber AL vel Legis as [...] "the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star". [...] The third deity in the cosmology of Thelema is Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a manifestation of Horus. He is symbolized as a throned man with the head of a hawk who carries a wand. He is associated with the Sun and the active energies of Thelemic magick. [...] Other deities within the cosmology of Thelema are Hoor-paar-kraat (or Harpocrates), god of silence and inner strength, the brother of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Babalon, the goddess of all pleasure, known as the Virgin Whore, and Therion, the beast that Babalon rides, who represents the wild animal within man, a force of nature.|$|E

2500|$|Lautner first defined an {{architectural}} {{solution to the}} scale, function, and public space of car-oriented suburban architecture in his remodel of Henry's in Glendale in 1947. Googie's Coffee Shop, designed in 1949, stood {{at the corner of}} Sunset Strip and Crescent Heights, next to the famous Schwab's Pharmacy; regrettably it was demolished in 1989. It was distinctive for its expansive glass walls, arresting angular form, prominent roofline, and exuberant signage oriented to car traffic: an advertisement for itself. Another key Lautner work in the Googie genre was Henry's Restaurant (1957) in Pomona; its vaulted roof, resembling an inverted boat hull, <b>arched</b> <b>over</b> the interior booths and the large exposed beams (made from glue-laminated timber) carried through to the exterior, where they supported a slatted awning that shaded the drive-in area. Other architects spread the Modern aesthetic of the coffee shop/drive-in in such as Tiny Naylor's (Lautner employer Douglas Honnold), Ship's (Martin Stern, Jr.), and Norm's and Clock's (Armet and Davis.) ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{quote from}} the NMC, {{describes}} the ideal mouse body type, for showing: [...] "The mouse must be long on body with long clean head, not too fine or pointed at the nose, the eyes should be large, bold and prominent. The ears large and tulip shaped, free from creases, carried erect with plenty of width between them. The body should be long and slim, a trifle <b>arched</b> <b>over</b> the loin and racy in appearance; the tail, which must be free from kinks should come well {{out of the back}} and be thick at the root or set-on, gradually tapering like a whip lash to a fine end, the length being about equal to that of the mouse's body. Unless the variety standard states otherwise, the coat should be short perfectly smooth, glossy and sleek to the hand. The mouse should be perfectly tractable and free from any vice and not subject to fits or other similar ailments. A mouse with absence of whiskers, blind in one or both eyes, carrying external parasites, having a tumor, sore or legs with fur missing, suffering from any obvious disease or deformity or kinked tail shall be disqualified." ...|$|E
