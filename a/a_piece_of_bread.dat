Yet her soul could not find the peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery’s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E

Lorenzo had been a civilian forced worker in Auschwitz, who for six months had given part of his ration and <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> to Levi without asking for anything in return. The gesture constant actions saved Levi's life. In his memoir, Levi contrasted Lorenzo with {{everyone else in the}} camp, prisoners and guards alike, as someone who managed to preserve his humanity. After the war, Lorenzo could not cope with the memories of what he had seen, and descended into alcoholism. Levi made several trips to rescue his old friend from the streets, but in 1952 Lorenzo died.|$|E
25|$|The College was {{in great}} {{disrepair}} when Jan Standonck took over—some {{of the walls}} were falling down. It had {{become known as the}} Collège de Montaigu, after the Archbishop's brother, and Jan was to make it famous. He imposed a very severe regime on the students. They could leave only with his permission and had to return before nightfall—he took the key from the porter every night. They wore only a single cloth gown and were given only <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> each day to eat. They {{had to go to the}} door of a nearby monastery at eleven o'clock each morning to receive a hand-out of food. They were punished for the slightest fault, and were encouraged—out of pure charity—to inform of any misdemeanours, and to criticise each other's conduct. Erasmus, one of the students, later said he did not think anyone could forget—or even survive unscathed—their time at the College.|$|E
25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} a simple dish, but comes in many varieties {{due to its}} versatility. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. Pasta is also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand or food processor and served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, color and texture. When choosing which type of pasta and sauce to serve together, {{there is a general}} rule regarding compatibility. Simple sauces like pesto are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. The extra sauce left on the plate after all of the pasta is eaten is often mopped up with <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread.</b> Pasta is largely carbohydrates (mainly as starch), with moderate amounts of protein and manganese.|$|E

500|$|The film stars Kitty Horn as the maid, but {{the other}} actors in the film are unknown. Both the {{scenario}} writer {{and the director of}} the film are unknown. Produced and released in time for Washington's Birthday, the crossing of the Delaware River was inspired by Emmanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware. Though official materials openly postulated as to how Washington received word of the British being weak, Washington's plan was never sporadic and a landing of all the men was not done at the behest of a single maid. American accounts have long held the notion that the Hessian forces would be drunk and sluggish. According to Patriot John Greenwood, who fought in the battle and supervised Hessians afterward, who wrote, [...] "I am certain not a drop of liquor was drunk during the whole night, nor, as I could see, even <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> eaten.

2500|$|An eruv tavshilin (Hebrew: עירוב תבשילין [...] "mixed cooked food items") {{is made in}} {{the home}} {{on the eve of a}} holiday with a work proscription that {{directly}} precedes the Sabbath.

[...] It is common to use a piece of cooked egg, fish, or meat as the cooked item and <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> or matzah as the baked item. [...] It is needed because while it is allowed to cook and transfer fire on holidays (unlike the Sabbath and Yom Kippur, when these activities are forbidden), these activities are allowed to be done for use on only the holiday, and not for the next day. [...] The eruv tavshilin makes it possible to begin preparing for the Sabbath before the holiday, and continue doing so. [...] The foods of the eruv tavshilin are traditionally eaten on the Sabbath day following the holiday.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{protective}} charms, wearing clothing inside out, church bells, St. John's wort, and four-leaf clovers {{are regarded as}} effective. In Newfoundland folklore, the most popular type of fairy protection is bread, varying from stale bread to hard tack or a slice of fresh home-made bread. Bread {{is associated with the}} home and the hearth, as well as with industry and the taming of nature, and as such, seems to be disliked by some types of fairies. On the other hand, in much of the Celtic folklore, baked goods are a traditional offering to the folk, as are cream and butter. “The prototype of food, and therefore a symbol of life, bread was one of the commonest protections against fairies. Before going out into a fairy-haunted place, it was customary to put a piece of dry bread in one’s pocket.” In County Wexford, Ireland, in 1882, it was reported that “if an infant is carried out after dark <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> is wrapped in its bib or dress, and this protects it from any witchcraft or evil.” ...|$|E
