Trials evaluated sprayer settings, combinations of nozzle types, airflow rates, and air direction in both adult and young poplar plantations. Overall, spray drift amounts registered downwind of poplar plantations were less than those obtained to derive reference drift curves during the EU Plant Protection Product registration process that used late-growth-stage fruit crops.

40|$|Two {{air flow}} rate (4. 7 m 3 /s and 7. 1 m 3 /s) and two forward speed {{treatments}} (6 km/h and 9 km/h approx.) were compared {{at the beginning of}} flowering and the berry touch stages in a Casarsa-trained vineyard by using a randomised-blocks design with four replicates. The sprayer was an Ecologic 2000 T 800 model fitted with an axial-flow fan and six Albuz ATR nozzles on each side, placed at the lateral outlets of a fishtail <b>air</b> <b>conveyor.</b> Analysis of variance of the mean foliar deposits showed no significant effects owing to either the {{air flow rate}} and the travel speed or their interaction at both growth stages. However, at beginning of flowering, the lower air flow rate significantly increased mean deposition in the inside of the canopy. At full foliage (berry touch) stage, the higher travel speed slightly increased deposits on the canopy side nearest the sprayer, while decreased them on the opposite side. Further research is being planned in order to optimise the air flow rate and the travel speed in vineyards with narrower row distances...|$|E
40|$|Maximum {{retention}} of spray and run-off volumes on citrus leaves were studied {{in a laboratory}} experiment and then compared with a field trial. In the field trial an air-assisted sprayer fitted with a tower <b>air</b> <b>conveyor</b> was used to apply between 1000 and 8000 l ha- 1, atomised as a uniform spray spectrum, at different forward speeds. The volume of spray retained by leaves increased with increasing application volumes but the percent retention decreased above an application volume of 2000 l ha- 1. The proportion of spray lost as canopy run-off also increased above 2000 l ha- 1. Spray deposition was highest on leaves in the bottom tree zone, decreased in the top tree zone and was lowest in the middle tree zone. This deposition pattern is probably caused by the airflow pattern generated by the sprayer and indicates that uneven distribution of airflow to the tree is related to uneven leaf coverage throughout the canopy. A tractor speed of 3. 6 km h- 1 did not reduce leaf {{retention of}} spray volume compared with the slower speed (1. 7 km h- 1) but reduced canopy run-off at the 4000 l ha- 1 application volume. Canopy spray run-off was highest along the tree axis parallel to sprayer travel and lowest along the tree axis perpendicular to sprayer travel. The application of pesticides to citrus at volumes that do not exceed 2000 l ha- 1 reduces the loss of pesticide as canopy spray run-off and maximises pesticide spray recovery on the citrus leaf canopy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} of {{pomegranate}} arils pneumatic separation, the aerodynamic characteristics of pomegranate aril, rind and locular septa are essential. The main {{aim of this study}} was to measure and compare the aerodynamic characteristics of these materials to provide the data and to facilitate the design and adjustment of machines that perform separation of pomegranate arils from rind and locular septa based on aerodynamic characteristics (terminal velocity, drag coefficient and Reynolds number). To achieve this objective, Ashraf variety pomegranate fruit during its maturity stages was studied. The obtained results showed that the variation in maturity stage significantly influenced the terminal velocity, drag coefficient and Reynolds number (P< 0. 05). During the fruit maturity, the terminal velocity of locular septa, rind and pomegranate aril increased from 1. 05 to 1. 16, 3. 16 to 3. 73 and 5. 89 to 6. 70 ms− 1, respectively. The corresponding value of drag coefficient of the three studied materials decreased from 0. 92 to 0. 79, 0. 75 to 0. 59 and 0. 53 to 0. 36, respectively with advancing fruit maturity. Also these ranges for Reynolds number were 403. 24 – 617. 75, 1213. 44 – 1986. 37 and 2261. 76 – 3568. 02, respectively. Consequently, aerodynamic separation of pomegranate aril from locular septa and rind is theoretically possible if the air velocity value is adjusted according to the terminal velocity of pomegranate aril. Also the obtained equations can be used for calculating the parameters of pomegranate aril movement in pneumatic tunnels or in the design and development of <b>air</b> <b>conveyor</b> and pneumatic separator of pomegranate aril...|$|E

The de-rating effects of overvoltage and three phase imbalance on AC motors are well known. Excessive overvoltage results in saturation of the iron core, wasting energy through eddy currents and increased hysteresis losses. Drawing excessive current results in excess heat output due to copper losses. The additional stress of overvoltage on motors will decrease motor lifetime.|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{pesticide}} spraying in citrus crops with low-profile sprayers {{results in}} pest management problems {{because of the}} poor distribution of pesticide throughout the tree. Pesticide losses, particularly drift, are a concern {{with this type of}} sprayer especially in orchards situated in or near urban areas. The spray deposit on citrus leaves and fruit and off-target losses (canopy run-off and drift) were determined for air-assisted low-profile sprayers and air-assisted sprayers fitted with tower <b>air</b> <b>conveyors</b> (air-towers). The air-tower sprayers produced even distribution of leaf spray deposits through the full height of the tree canopy while the low-profile sprayers produced decreasing leaf spray deposits with increasing height in the trees. The Metters tower sprayer and Cropliner low-profile sprayer resulted in increasing deposits from the 0 degrees axis through to the 90 degrees axis to sprayer travel while the Barlow tower sprayer and the Hardi low-profile sprayer produced a more even distribution of deposits through the axes to sprayer travel. Fruit deposits were not significantly different between sprayers. The Barlow tower sprayer produced significantly less canopy spray run-off compared with the low-profile sprayers. The Barlow tower sprayer resulted in a significant reduction in spray drift in the above tree zone compared with the Hardi low-profile sprayer. Better distribution of pesticides in citrus tree canopies will improve pest control especially in the top sections of the tree as this is where the greatest increase in pesticide deposit is achieved with air-tower sprayers. Both ground and air contamination from pesticides can also be reduced by using sprayers fitted with air-tower conveyors designed to produce even airflows for the full height of the citrus trees being sprayed...|$|R

The desired oscillating movement is accomplished by electromagnetic exciting forces. The exciting force of this dynamic system actuates between the carrying element and the inertial mass.

40|$|Atmospheric {{monitoring}} systems (AMS) are required when using <b>air</b> from <b>conveyor</b> belt entries to ventilate working sections in U. S. underground coal mines. AMS technology {{has the potential}} to increase fire safety mine-wide, but {{research is needed to determine}} the detection and response times for fires of a variety of combustible materials. To evaluate the potential of an AMS for fire detection in other areas of a coal mine, a series of full-scale fire experiments were conducted to determine detection and response times from fires of different combustible materials that are found in U. S. underground coal mines, including high- and low-volatility coals, conveyor belts, brattice materials, different types of wood, diesel fuel, and a foam sealant. These experiments were conducted in the Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM) of the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) located in Pittsburgh, PA, using a commercially available AMS that is typical of current technology. The results showed that through proper selection of sensors and their locations, a mine-wide AMS can provide sufficient early fire warning times and improve the health and safety of miners.

40|$|Conventional {{high volume}} {{pesticide}} spraying in citrus crops with oscillating boom sprayers results in {{low levels of}} pesticide retention on trees {{and high levels of}} off- target losses. This study was conducted to establish whether lower volume pesticide spraying with an air-assisted low-profile sprayer and air-assisted sprayers fitted with tower <b>air</b> <b>conveyors</b> (air-towers) could replace conventional high volume pesticide spraying. The spraying efficacy of an oscillating boom sprayer applying 10 000 l ha (- 1) was compared with three different air-assisted sprayers applying volumes of between 500 and 6000 l ha (- 1). Spray efficacy was determined by measuring spray deposits on citrus leaves and fruit and off-target losses (canopy run-off) by using a fluorescent dye tracer technique. Biological efficacy was determined by assessing the control of two insect pests of citrus being California red scale (Aonidiella aurantii Maskell) and Citrus mealybug (Planococcus citri Risso) using Supracide 400 (methidathion). The Barlow tower sprayer operating at 6000 l ha (- 1) produced equal spray deposits on leaves and higher spray deposits on fruit compared to the oscillating boom operating at 10 000 l ha (- 1). The Hardi low-profile air-blast sprayer produced significantly lower spray deposits on both leaves and fruit as the height zone increased in the trees. The Silvan air-shear tower sprayer produced better distribution of spray than the low-profile air-blast sprayer through the height zones in the tree on both leaves and fruit. The percentage of leaf retention of spray volume increased with decreasing application volume from 14 % for the oscillating boom at 10 000 1 ha (- 1) to 59 % for the Silvan tower at 500 l ha (- 1). Canopy spray run-off increased with increasing volume from 2 % for the Silvan tower at 500 and 1000 l ha (- 1) and the Barlow tower at 1500 1 ha (- 1) to 28 % for the oscillating boom at 10 000 1 ha (- 1). The biological efficacy of the oscillating boom sprayer on red scale was matched by the Barlow tower at 6000 l ha (- 1) and the Silvan tower at 500 l ha (- 1). The Barlow tower at 6000 l ha (- 1) produced a greater reduction in fruit infected with mealybug in the calyx than the oscillating boom sprayer at 10000 l ha (- 1) and all other sprayer treatments. The reduction in dose rate of insecticide produced by using lower spray volumes with registered rates based on volume of spray volume resulted in pests not being controlled in some of the lower volume treatments. This clearly illustrates that changes to certain pesticide registrations will be necessary in the adoption of lower spray volumes in crops such as citrus. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} jointly by ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Environment), Bologna and Florence Universities {{and the firm}} FINI COMPRESSORI. A comparison is carried out between the environmental damages of two models (MK 10 and MK 94) of air axial compressors manufactured by FINI COMPRESSORI, with a volume of intaken air of 226 l/min, a power of 1. 8 kW and a maximum pressure of 10 bar. The comparison is obtained by using LCA calculated by SimaPro 3. 1 code and two methods: Eco-indicator 95 and a new method obtained by adding to the Eco-indicator 95 method other damage categories such as some raw material depletion, solid and energy. The system boundaries include raw material extraction {{and the end of}} life of the components and some special tools for manufacturing such as dies, moulds and shells. All metallic materials have the recycling as waste scenario. For LCA study we have considered the three components crankshaft, crankcase and valve plate for both the models, the <b>air</b> cooling <b>conveyor</b> for the MK 94 and the surplus of consumed energy for the MK 10. The conveyor decreases the temperature of air and therefore increases the compressor efficiency and reduces the electrical energy consumption during the use. From the LCA results, we can conclude that the introduction of the conveyor reduces the damage of MK 10 model of 114. 07 mPt and that the other modifications of the design increase the damage of MK 10 model of 11 mPt. The damage of air compressor can be diminished by reusing crankshaft and crankcase. A design modification of the blades of the ventilator is proposed to avoid the conveyor.

What DEMASA expects by developing this project is to improve the production process of the lines that complement TOSTY Brand, especially potato chips such as: “PAPITOSTY” and “PAPIOLAS. ” This because currently there are not controls over the variables that influence products fabrication regarding the potato hopper, quantity of raw material in the process, water, <b>air,</b> fryer temperature, <b>conveyor</b> belt speed, and engine control. If these variables are not rightly manipulated, there can appear several problems which can be: stop on the production waste of air and water, turn engines on unnecessarily, inappropriate fry temperature, or something even more serious such as the drop down of the products final quality or problems with product’s quantity which may produces economical loss to the company. By analyzing the situation, it can be concluded that those problems can be avoided and they are a consequence of the lack of control variables during the process. The solution to the problems is to perform a centralized system where people can have control and monitor the production process variables. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica.
