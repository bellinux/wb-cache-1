5|$|In late 1996, {{after more}} than five years of {{addiction}} to heroin, Frusciante quit it cold turkey. However, months later he was still unable to break addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol. In January 1998, urged by longtime friend Bob Forrest, Frusciante checked into Las Encinas, a drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, to begin a full recovery. Upon arrival, he was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing all of his rotten teeth and replacing them with dental implants. He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged <b>arms.</b> <b>About</b> a month later, Frusciante checked out of Las Encinas and re-entered society.|$|E
5|$|Sinosauropteryx was anatomically {{similar to}} Compsognathus, differing from its European {{relatives}} in its proportions. The skull of Sinosauropteryx was 15% longer than its thigh bones, unlike in Compsognathus, where {{the skull and}} thigh bones are approximately equivalent in length. The arms of Sinosauropteryx (humerus and radius) were only 30% the length of its legs (thigh bone and shin), compared to 40% in Compsognathus. Additionally, Sinosauropteryx had several features unique among all other theropods. It had 64 vertebrae in its tail. This high number made its tail the longest relative to body length of any theropod. Its hands were long compared to its <b>arms,</b> <b>about</b> 84% to 91% {{of the length of}} the rest of the arm (humerus and radius), and half the length of the foot. The first and second digits were about the same length, with a large claw on the first digit. The first fingers were large, being both longer and thicker than either of the bones of the forearm. The teeth differed slightly (they were heterodont) based on position: those near the tips of the upper jaws (on the premaxillae) were slender and lacked serrations, while those behind them (on the maxillae) were serrated and laterally compressed. The teeth of the lower jaws were similarly differentiated.|$|E
25|$|What {{began as}} a local quarrel grew in stages to finally occupy the {{attention}} of both the Texas and federal governments. Newspaper editors throughout the nation covered the story, often in frenzied tone and with lurid detail. At the conflict's height, as many as 650 men bore <b>arms.</b> <b>About</b> 20 to 30 men {{were killed in the}} 12-year fight for salt, and perhaps double that number were wounded. The war's damage also included an estimated $31,050 in property damage. Crop losses were sustained because local farmers did not till or harvest their fields for several months, but the wheat loss was estimated at $48,000. To these immediate financial losses (worth about $1.5 million in 2007) can be added the further political and economic marginalization of the Mexican-American community of El Paso County.|$|E

25|$|Mr. Trowbridge {{returned}} from the school {{to say that the}} only hope for safety to any Americans seemed to be to return to the school, staying there alone, separated from the Armenians. He declared that we were powerless to save the Armenians. It seems that after we left the school, Miss Wallace, Mr. Chambers, and a young Armenian preacher attempted to cross the street from Miss Wallace's to the school. Just at this time a mob rushed around the corner. The infuriated Turks recognized the preacher as an Armenian, and although Mr. Chambers threw his <b>arms</b> <b>about</b> him and did all in his power to save the man's life, they shot him dead. Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins shouted, as Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his <b>arms</b> <b>about</b> when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E
25|$|For a while, {{the dinner}} party {{proceeds}} smoothly. Inexperienced {{in the ways}} of the aristocracy, Myshkin is deeply impressed by the elegance and good humour of the company, unsuspicious of its superficiality. It turns out that one of those present—Ivan Petrovich—is a relative of his beloved benefactor Pavlishchev, and the Prince becomes extraordinarily enthusiastic. But when Ivan Petrovich mentions that Pavlishchev ended by giving up everything and going over to the Roman Church, Myshkin is horrified. He launches unexpectedly into a tirade against Catholicism, claiming that it preaches the Antichrist and in its quest for political supremacy has given birth to Atheism. Everyone present is shocked and several attempts are made to stop or divert him, but he only becomes more animated. At the height of his fervor, he begins waving his <b>arms</b> <b>about</b> and knocks over the priceless Chinese vase, smashing it to pieces. There is a lull as Myshkin emerges from his profound astonishment and the general horror turns to amusement and concern for his health; but it is only temporary, and he soon begins another spontaneous discourse, this time {{on the subject of the}} aristocracy in Russia, once again becoming oblivious to all attempts to quell his ardour. The speech is only brought to an end by the onset of an epileptic seizure: Aglaya, deeply distressed, catches him in her arms as he falls. He is taken home, having left a decidedly negative impression on the guests.|$|E

500|$|In {{possession}} of these newly-bestowed honours, Luan Da spent every evening at home, attempting to summon spirits. According to the Shih ji, no spirits appeared, but only [...] "a multitude of ghosts who gathered around". These, the text claims, {{he was able}} to command. The Shih jis author, Sima Qian, was scornful of Luan Da, noting that [...] "Everyone on the seacoast of Yan and Qi began waving their <b>arms</b> <b>about,</b> declaring that they possessed secret arts and could summon spirits and immortal ones." [...] Indeed, Luan Da's dramatic growth in reputation and stature became a great topic of discussion in the Han capital of Chang'an, and mystics were eager to imitate his success.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a hearing}} of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Anne-Marie Brady, a University of Canterbury {{political}} science professor, testified that China considers propaganda work the [...] "life blood of the Party-State in the current era", and promotes foreign propaganda towards the Overseas Chinese community through Confucius Institutes and activities such as [...] "root-seeking" [...] cultural tours. Three years later, Professor Brady analogized, [...] "If we had a U.S. government agency that was stating {{that it was a}} tool for U.S. government propaganda, my colleagues would be up in <b>arms</b> <b>about</b> having a center like that on campus." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chain's {{image has}} also made it popular in more {{non-traditional}} ways. For example, In-N-Out is still considered acceptable in some areas with a strong opposition to corporate food restaurants, such as McDonald's. Local business leaders in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf district said they opposed every other fast food chain except In-N-Out, {{because they wanted to}} maintain the flavor of family-owned, decades-old businesses in the area, with one saying locals would ordinarily [...] "be up in <b>arms</b> <b>about</b> a fast-food operation coming to Fisherman's Wharf," [...] but [...] "this is different." [...] California native and Colorado Rockies player Jason Giambi would often visit In-N-Out Burger when on the West Coast with his former team, the New York Yankees. He said he tried to open an In-N-Out Burger restaurant in New York, but was unsuccessful.|$|E

2500|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} of another favorite, Bagoas; a eunuch [...] "exceptional in beauty {{and in the}} very flower of boyhood, with whom Darius was {{intimate}} and with whom Alexander would later be intimate." [...] Plutarch recounts an episode (also mentioned by Dicaearchus) during some festivities {{on the way back}} from India in which his men clamor for him to kiss the young man: [...] "We are told, too, that he was once viewing some contests in singing and dancing, being well heated with wine, and that his favorite, Bagoas, won the prize for song and dance, and then, all in his festal array, passed through the theatre and took his seat by Alexander's side; at sight of which the Macedonians clapped their hands and loudly bade the king kiss the victor, until at last he threw his <b>arms</b> <b>about</b> him and kissed him tenderly." [...] A novel by Mary Renault, The Persian Boy, chronicles that story with Bagoas as narrator.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{liability}} can {{be traced}} from ancient Anglo-Saxon law through the time of Bracton. From Alfred the Great: [...] "A man acts at his own peril. If a man have a spear over his shoulder, and any man stakes himself upon it, that man will pay the wer but not the wite... if he be accused of wilfulness in the deed, let him clear himself according to the wite, and with that, let the wite abate. And let this be: if the point be three fingers higher than the hindmost part of the shaft; if they both be on the level, {{the point of the}} hindmost part of the shaft, be that without danger. If a man leaves his <b>arms</b> <b>about,</b> and another knocks them over so that they kill or injure a man, the owner is liable. If a man lend his horse to another and the borrower is injured, the lender is liable." [...] This is similar to the modern concept of strict liability in tort. Liability, at that time, was not dependent upon negligence, but the act.|$|E
2500|$|The record also {{contains}} lyrics {{that have been}} considered to be homophobic. The song [...] "Criminal" [...] features the line [...] "My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge/That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or les...Hate fags?/The answer's yes. [...] " [...] The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) condemned his lyrics and criticized the album for [...] "encourag violence against gay men and lesbians". However, writing for the LGBT interest magazine The Advocate, editor Dave White writes, [...] "If he has gay-bashed you or me, then it logically follows that he has also raped his own mother, killed his wife, and murdered his producer, Dr. Dre. If he's to be taken literally, then so is Britney Spears' invitation to 'hit me baby, one more time'. [...] " [...] Eminem noted that he began using the word [...] "faggot" [...] more frequently when [...] "people got all up in <b>arms</b> <b>about</b> it...to piss them off worse" [...] but added that [...] "I think its hard for some {{people to understand that}} for me the word 'faggot' {{has nothing to do with}} sexual preference. I meant something more like assholes or dickheads. [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|Masterson soon made a {{complete}} recovery {{and settled in}} Dodge City. On June 6, 1877, Masterson tried to prevent the arrest of a certain Robert Gilmore – who was known to the locals as Bobby Gill. To do this, Bat somehow managed to wrap his <b>arms</b> <b>about</b> the girth of 315-lb City Marshal Lawrence Edward [...] "Larry" [...] Deger (1845–1924), thereby permitting Gill to escape. Masterson was grabbed by friends of Deger and pistol-whipped by the balloon-shaped lawman. The following day, Masterson was fined $25 for disturbing the peace. Bobby Gill, the cause of Masterson's fine, was assessed only $5. During July 1877, Masterson was hired to serve as under-sheriff to Sheriff Charles E. Bassett (1847–1896). Sheriff Bassett was prohibited by the Kansas State Constitution from seeking a third consecutive term. With the job up for grabs, Masterson wasted no time throwing his derby into the ring. The sheriff's race became particularly interesting when Masterson's opponent {{turned out to be}} Larry Deger. On November 6, 1877, Masterson was elected county sheriff of Ford County, Kansas, by the narrow margin of three votes. Within a month of Masterson's election, on December 6, 1877, Ed Masterson replaced Larry Deger as city marshal of Dodge. Together, the Masterson brothers then controlled the city and county police forces.|$|E
