5000|$|During this live {{televised}} draft lottery ceremony, {{the league}} used {{a system where}} sealed envelopes representing the teams with the worst records were mixed in a tumbler, and then drawn by NBA Commissioner David Stern {{one at a time}} to determine which of these clubs would get the first pick onwards. However, when these envelopes were added to the tumbler, one envelope was put in forcibly and banged against the edge, bending the corner, while {{all the rest of the}} envelopes were set in gently. Stern closely watched the tumbler spinning <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> when drawing for the first pick, and went for the envelope with the bent corner, which upon opening the envelope, it was revealed that the New York Knicks logo was inside. The large-market New York Knicks, who finished with the third-worst record in the league that season, eventually used the first pick to draft Ewing with (who would become a legend on the team, leading the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals.

Moreover, a check made at the hotel room yielded maps, articles on military aviation and other curious items. All of these items were turned over to the FBI.|$|R

30|$|In this context, Bradfield et al. [2] {{provide a}} good {{overview}} of the existing schools of scenario technique using several criteria for classification. One classification criterion {{is the use of}} probabilities {{for the development of the}} scenarios. Probabilities within scenario technique are well discussed in literature – along with their advantages and disadvantages [1, 3, 4]. We will pick up these discussions <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> look at probabilities in scenario development. We divide our consideration into three parts in order to do this: the use of probabilities within the scenario creation process; the attachment of probabilities to the developed scenarios; and probabilities in the scenario controlling process.|$|R

From an abundance of volunteers, Koenig chooses Paul Morrow and Sandra Benes for the final test - breathing the new air.

40|$|Smartphones {{have emerged}} as a popular and {{frequently}} used platform for the consumption of multimedia. New display technologies, such as AMOLED, have been recently introduced to smartphones {{to fulfill the requirements}} of these multimedia applications. However, as an AMOLED screen’s power consumption is determined by the display content, such applications are often limited by the battery life of the device they are running on, inspiring many researches to develop new power management schemes. In this work, we evaluate the power consumption of several applications on a series of Samsung smartphones <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> look into AMOLED's power consumption and its relative contributions for multimedia apps. We improve AMOLED power analysis by considering the dynamic factors in displaying, and analyze the individual factors affecting power consumption when streaming video, playing a video game, and recording video via a device’s built-in camera. Our detailed measurements refine the power analysis of smartphones and reveal some interesting perspectives regarding the power consumption of AMOLED displays in multimedia applications...|$|R
