5|$|Migrating birds rely {{largely on}} stored fat {{and they also}} metabolise protein as a {{supplementary}} source of energy. Those with a relatively large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat,</b> may make stops during migration of only 1–2 days; although they have lost weight since commencing their journey, they have enough energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore {{lower than that of}} the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat,</b> protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dietary fat {{and energy}} have been implicated as factors {{controlling}} circulating total and LDL-cholesterol concen-trations. Whether these factors work independently or synergis-tically in regulating human cholesterol metabolism {{remains to be}} fully elucidated. Objective: The objective {{was to determine whether}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> restriction on circulating lipid concentrations and synthesis differ from those of energy restriction in hypercholesterolemic subjects fed controlled diets. Design: Eleven men (LDL> 3. 6 mmol/L) participated in a ran-domized crossover study. Subjects consumed 4 prepared diets, each for 4 wk and separated by 6 wk, that contained either typical <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> and energy (TF), low <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> but adequate energy (LF), low <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> and energy through carbohydrate restriction (LFE), or typical <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> and low energy through carbohydrate restriction (LE). Results: Body weights declined (P < 0. 001) after the LE and LFE diets. Total cholesterol concentrations were not significantly differ-ent between the diets. LDL cholesterol was lower (P < 0. 05) after the LF and LFE diets (8. 2 % and 8. 0 %, respectively) than after the TF diet. The LE diet increased HDL cholesterol (46. 8 %) and decreased triacylglycerols (22. 7 %), whereas the LF diet increased triacylglyc-erols (23. 6 %), relative to the TF diet. LDL:HDL decreased after the LE and LFE diets (P < 0. 05). Cholesterol fractional synthesis rates after the LF, LE, and LFE diets were lower (35. 2 %, 27. 7 %, and 25. 5 %, respectively; P < 0. 05) relative to the TF diet. Conclusion: Reductions in both dietary fat and energy may modify LDL cholesterol by lowering cholesterol biosynthesis; however, the increase in HDL cholesterol and the suppression of triacylglycerol concentrations and LDL:HDL suggests that favorable plasma lipid profiles were also achieved through energy restriction alone.

500|$|A {{few studies}} have {{suggested}} that total dietary fat intake is linked to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. However, a number of very large studies, including the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, an eight-year study of 49,000 women, the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, revealed no such links. None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage of calories from fat and risk of cancer, heart disease, or weight gain. The Nutrition Source, a website maintained by the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, summarizes the current evidence on the impact of dietary fat: [...] "Detailed research—much of it done at Harvard—shows that the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> in the diet isn't really linked with weight or disease." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sweets and Sour Marge" [...] {{was written}} by Carolyn Omine and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January20,2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by Omine, who based it on a lawsuit at the time, wherein smokers sued tobacco companies for selling harmful wares. Omine found it [...] "kinda weird" [...] that the people did not {{take responsibility for their}} own health, and joked that, in the future, people might sue food companies for [...] "making them fat", which eventually became the episode's plot. While making the episode, the Simpsons writers decided to compile a list of Springfield's fat residents. According to Omine, the list [...] "never ended", and when the writers realized the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> people there were in Springfield, they decided that the residents should try and [...] "go for the world record" [...] in the [...] "fattest people" [...] category. The writers then decided that the residents were trying to set the world record for largest human pyramid, and then accidentally set the record for fattest population. The episode features the first appearance of Cletus' cousin Dia-Betty. The character was animated by Kirkland's assistant Matt Faughnan, who has since become a regular director for the series. Garth Motherloving, the head of the [...] "Motherloving Sweets and Sugar Company", was portrayed by American actor and comedian Ben Stiller.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the cell}} location {{can alter the}} size of the larva and eventually determine which female Vespula vulgaris is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the hierarchy of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> stored, the [...] "higher" [...] the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate.

2500|$|The raw fruit {{can have}} a {{somewhat}} bitter taste, or even an astringent quality, but becomes tender when cooked and develops a rich, complex flavor. The fruit is capable of absorbing large amounts of cooking fats and sauces, making for very rich dishes, but salting reduces the amount of oil absorbed. Many recipes advise salting, rinsing, and draining the sliced fruit (a process known as [...] "degorging") to soften it and to reduce the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> absorbed during cooking, but mainly to remove the bitterness of the earlier cultivars. Some modern cultivars—including large purple ones commonly imported into western Europe—do not need this treatment.|$|E
2500|$|A horse may be gelded at any age; however, if {{an owner}} intends to geld a {{particular}} foal, {{it is now}} considered best to geld the horse prior to becoming a yearling, [...] and definitely before he reaches sexual maturity. [...] While it was once recommended to wait until a young horse was well over a year old, even two, this was a holdover {{from the days when}} castration was performed without anesthesia and was thus far more stressful on the animal. [...] Modern veterinary techniques can now accomplish castration with relatively little stress and minimal discomfort, so long as appropriate analgesics are employed. [...] A few horse owners delay gelding a horse {{on the grounds that the}} testosterone gained from being allowed to reach sexual maturity will make him larger. [...] However, recent studies have shown that this is not so: [...] any apparent muscle mass gained solely from the presence of hormones will be lost over time after the horse is gelded, and in the meantime, the energy spent developing muscle mass may actually take away from the energy a young horse might otherwise put into skeletal growth; the net effect is that castration has no effect on rate of growth (although it may increase the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> the horse carries).|$|E
2500|$|In about 2 months, (early june) {{the first}} workers [...] emerge, {{attending}} to {{tasks such as}} maintaining the nest {{and taking care of}} the brood inside, or defending it if threatened. [...] The first workers take over all the duties in the colony, hunting for preys (larvae are fed with other insects that adults hunt) and collecting water, carbohydrates and nest material. The foundress is now a queen, that lays eggs and rests all day long while her workers do all the other work. More workers emerge, and the number of wasps soon increases. Newly hatched workers are bigger than the first ones, because they were well fed as larvae (unlike the first generation, reared solely by a single hard working wasp queen). In June and July, the colony grows and new cells are built. The nest can reach an extraordinary size for this genus, containing up to a couple thousand cells and a hundred of workers. But more often, this size is never reached. The time of development of brood contracts. The eggs laid in early July develop throughout a single month due to the warmer summer conditions and the increased availability of food, provided by an ever increasing amount of restless workers. Among those eggs, there are several unfertilized ones that the queen willingly chooses not to fertilize. Those eggs will mature in males, while the others develop in larger females that don't cooperate to the nest. Those are the future foundresses, that rapidly develop their ovaries and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> in their body. The reproductive phase happens when those females emerge, in late July or early August. Males generally emerge first, because their development requires a minor amount of time and food. Soon after August, the month of reproductive wasps rearing, worker numbers start dropping due to a decline in brood care as the older individuals start dying and replacements no longer exist. The initial foundress dies, while some workers start developing ovaries and laying eggs themselves. They are unfertilized, so their offspring will exclusively result in other males, if anything.|$|E
