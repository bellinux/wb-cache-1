5000|$|... "Plant Of Doom" [...] is {{notorious for}} {{its place in}} the {{original}} ATV broadcast order and its continuity place in the series. The episodes marks the first appearance of <b>Aphony,</b> Marinaâ€™s father, and shows that the other characters know little about Marina. <b>Aphony</b> himself reappears in the episode Tune Of Danger, which was broadcast before this episode. For continuity purposes this story should have been the second episode to be broadcast, but was moved to being the 34th (7th from last) to be broadcast. ITV commonly changes the broadcast order of many of its series, because ratings for shows drop during the middle, so they like to have the strongest episodes at the beginning and end, with the weaker episodes in the middle. This must have meant they thought [...] "Plant Of Doom was a good episode", and thus should have been left at number 2. When the BBC re-broadcast the show in the 1990s and 2000s, the original ITC-devised order (which followed the production order) was used instead, meaning that [...] "Plant of Doom" [...] was restored to its early position.|$|E
