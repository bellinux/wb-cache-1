40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Business and {{recreation}} {{in the modern}} day world often include air travel as their cornerstone. Travelers who are disabled and wheelchair bound have to undergo a transfer process to board and deplane a commercial aircraft. This transfer process is typically done manually, with agents physically lifting the passenger who is disabled. This manual process exposes the passenger and agents to risk of injury. By developing a mechanical device {{to aid in the}} transfer process, those risks could be minimized while simultaneously providing a better experience for those involved. Other Individuals have investigated and quantified various aspects of this design challenge. The work presented in this document was conducted to first combine the previous research, and then make further developments through analysis, design, and testing. The developmental efforts were focused on four major components of the prototype: the lifting column, the passenger interface, the links of the <b>articulating</b> <b>arm,</b> and the base. In this development process, care was taken to ensure that the individual components would integrate to make a single prototype device capable of completing a passenger transfer on board a commercial aircraft...|$|E

40|$|The {{abnormal}} structure of cutaneous capillaries {{is associated with}} many skin diseases including skin cancer and port wine stain. Consequently, the demand for an imaging modality that can provide non-invasive visualization of capillary level blood flow is high. The major challenge in such imaging is to achieve high resolution and great flow sensitivity over a sufficient depth. Numerous imaging techniques derived from optical coherence tomography have provided a technical breakthrough and produced promising images of capillary networks of retina and brain tumors. However, these modalities have never been applied in clinical dermatological studies. This thesis illustrates the process of design and complete construction of an optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) system for dermal vasculature imaging {{that can be used}} in a clinical environment. The system consists of optical hardware, electronics, and a microscope; every part is contained in a portable cart that can be readily carried to a clinic. The optical subsystem includes a wavelength-swept laser source, a fiber optic interferometer with a delay stage and a polarization-sensitive balanced receiver. All power supplies, control drivers and monitoring circuits are integrated and enclosed in a case with a control interface. The microscope is attached to an <b>articulating</b> <b>arm</b> to be positioned as desired while the patient sits at ease. The system performance is summarized as 10 [mu]m resolution with frame rate of 100 frames per second. Further studies, in collaboration with dermatologists, will involve imaging the vascular structure of port wine stain lesions and investigating their correlation to laser treatment. by Ahhyun Nam.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Cardiopulmonary bypass {{and global}} cardiac arrest enable safe {{coronary}} artery bypass grafting but have adverse effects. In off-pump coronary bypass grafting, invasiveness is reduced, but anastomosis suturing is jeopardized by cardiac motion. Therefore the key to successful off-pump coronary bypass grafting is effective local cardiac wall stabilization. Methods: We prospectively assessed the safety and efficacy of the Octopus tissue stabilizer (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.) in the first 100 patients selected for off-pump coronary bypass via full or limited surgical access. To immobilize and expose the coronary artery, two suction paddles (– 400 mm Hg), fixed to the operating table-rail by an <b>articulating</b> <b>arm,</b> stabilized the anastomosis site. Results: One hundred forty-one grafts (96 % arterial) were used to create 172 anastomoses (17 % side-to-side), up to 4 per patient, on average 2. 3 in the full access group (46 patients) and 1. 2 in the limited access group (54 patients). Complications included conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass (2 %), conversion from limited to full access (3 %), myocardial infarction (4 %), predischarge coronary reintervention (2 %), and late coronary reintervention (1 %). Median postoperative length of hospital stay was 4 days (limited access) or 5 days (full access). Rapid recovery allowed 96 % of patients to resume social activities within 1 month. At the 6 -month angiographic follow-up, 95 % of anastomoses was patent. At the 2 - to 22 -month follow-up (mean, 13 months), 98 patients were in Canadian Cardiovascular Society class I and 2 patients were in class II. Conclusion: These results suggest that off-pump {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting with the Octopus tissue stabilizer is safe. Early clinical outcome and patency rates warrant a randomized study comparing this methods with conventional coronary bypass grafting. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998; 116 : 60 - 7...|$|E
40|$|This {{software}} {{consists of}} a set of application programs that support ground-based image processing for in situ missions. These programs represent a collection of utility routines that perform miscellaneous functions {{in the context of the}} ground data system. Each one fulfills some specific need as determined via operational experience. The most unique aspect to these programs is that they are integrated into the large, in situ image processing system via the PIG (Planetary Image Geometry) library. They work directly with space in situ data, understanding the appropriate image meta-data fields and updating them properly. The programs themselves are completely multimission; all mission dependencies are handled by PIG. This suite of programs consists of: (1) marscahv: Generates a linearized, epi-polar aligned image given a stereo pair of images. These images are optimized for 1 -D stereo correlations, (2) marscheckcm: Compares the camera model in an image label with one derived via kinematics modeling on the ground, (3) marschkovl: Checks the overlaps between a list of images in order to determine which might be stereo pairs. This is useful for non-traditional stereo images like long-baseline or those from an <b>articulating</b> <b>arm</b> camera, (4) marscoordtrans: Translates mosaic coordinates from one form into another, (5) marsdispcompare: Checks a Left Right stereo disparity image against a Right Left disparity image to ensure they are consistent with each other, (6) marsdispwarp: Takes one image of a stereo pair and warps it through a disparity map to create a synthetic opposite- eye image. For example, a right eye image could be transformed to look like it was taken from the left eye via this program, (7) marsfidfinder: Finds fiducial markers in an image by projecting their approximate location and then using correlation to locate the markers to subpixel accuracy. These fiducial markets are small targets attached to the spacecraft surface. This helps verify, or improve, the pointing of in situ cameras, (8) marsinvrange: Inverse of marsrange. given a range file, re-computes an XYZ file that closely matches the original.. marsproj: Projects an XYZ coordinate through the camera model, and reports the line/sample coordinates of the point in the image, (9) marsprojfid: Given the output of marsfidfinder, projects the XYZ locations and compares them to the found locations, creating a report showing the fiducial errors in each image. marsrad: Radiometrically corrects an image, (10) marsrelabel: Updates coordinate system or camera model labels in an image, (11) marstiexyz: Given a stereo pair, allows the user to interactively pick a point in each image and reports the XYZ value corresponding to that pair of locations. marsunmosaic: Extracts a single frame from a mosaic, which will be created such that it could have been an input to the original mosaic. Useful for creating simulated input frames using different camera models than the original mosaic used, and (12) merinverter: Uses an inverse lookup table to convert 8 -bit telemetered data to its 12 -bit original form.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>Articulated</b> <b>Arm</b> Coordinate Measuring Machines (AACMM) have {{gradually}} evolved and are increasingly used in mechanic industry.

The work carried out consists on determining the measurement uncertainties of a mechanical part by an <b>Articulated</b> <b>Arm</b> Coordinate Measuring Machine. The studies aiming to develop a model of measurement uncertainties are based on the Monte Carlo method developed in Supplement 1 of the Guide to Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement [1] but also identifying and characterizing the main sources of uncertainty.

The first Monte Carlo level is the most complex and is thus divided into 3 sub-levels, namely characterization on positioning error of a point, estimation of calibration errors and evaluation of fluctuations of the “localization point”. The global method is thus presented and results of the first sub-level are particularly developed. The main sources of uncertainty, including AACMM deformations are exposed...|$|R
