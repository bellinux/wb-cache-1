They finished with a 611 record and were ranked #16 in the final AP poll.|$|E
5|$|Blue Bombers {{management}} {{decided that}} they needed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach</b> prior to the 1957 season. On January 30, 1957, Grant accepted the Blue Bombers head coaching position after impressing management with his ability to make adjustments on offense and defense as a player. Club president, J.T. Russell, thought that Grant could coach even though nobody else did. Grant would remain the {{head coach of the}} Blue Bombers until 1966. At age 29 (he would be 30 by the time he coached his first game), Grant became the youngest head coach in CFL history.|$|E
5|$|After much {{speculation}} for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach,</b> United announced Ben Olsen became {{head coach}} on 29 November 2010. His three-year contract {{as an assistant}} coach was replaced with a new three-year guaranteed contract that also includes options for additional seasons. At the time of the announcement Olsen had only selected one assistant coach, Chad Ashton, who had been serving as technical director during the previous season. Mark Simpson, the goalkeeping coach, decided not to return to the club. Kris Kelderman, who had another year under his contract {{as an assistant coach}}, was named the head coach of the UW–Green Bay Phoenix men's soccer team in May, 2010.|$|E

5|$|Another {{knee injury}} ended his 2008–09 season after 75 games {{and left him}} {{unavailable}} for the playoffs. He expressed his frustrations with coach Mike Keenan, who was fired by the team after failing to advance past {{the first round of}} the playoffs, criticizing Keenan's lack of structure and expressing optimism for the team's chances under <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach.</b> After failing to score a goal in 2008–09 and the first half of the 2009–10 season, Regehr scored his first goal in 141 games on January 18, 2010, against the San Jose Sharks. He finished with 2 goals and 17 points that season and matched those totals in 2010–11. Upon playing his 804th game late in the season, Regehr surpassed Al MacInnis as the team's all-time leader in games played by a defenceman.|$|E
5|$|As {{the end of}} his Northwestern career {{approached}} in November 1963, Parseghian called Father Edmund Joyce, the vice president and chairman of the athletics board at Notre Dame, a Catholic university near South Bend, Indiana. He asked whether Hugh Devore, who was then interim head football coach, was going to be given the job on a longer-term basis. When Joyce said the university was searching for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach,</b> Parseghian expressed interest in the job. Joyce did not immediately seem warm to the idea, however, and Parseghian explored an offer to coach at the University of Miami, where his old friend Andy Gustafson had been promoted from head coach to athletic director. Notre Dame was also considering Dan Devine for its coaching job, but ultimately offered it to Parseghian. Parseghian waffled at first, recalling his father's dislike of Catholics who had {{played a role in the}} Armenian deportations, but accepted in December and was given a salary of about $20,000 a year ($ today).|$|E
5|$|For 2011, Robson hired <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach,</b> Frenchman Patrick Mouratoglou, {{and moved}} her working base to Paris. Her season was {{disrupted}} by injury at the Hopman Cup {{and she did}} not compete in a tournament until March 2011; her comeback was then delayed for a further month by an injury in her second competition. Returning again at the end of April 2011, Robson's best performance to date came at the $50,000 tournament at Indian Harbor Beach, Florida, where she reached the semifinal. Robson split from Mouratoglou just before Wimbledon. Robson then won her first match at a Grand Slam as she defeated Angelique Kerber, but lost to Maria Sharapova in the second round.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Ross {{had signed}} Georges Boucher as coach, but Boucher {{did not work}} well with Ross and team {{president}} Weston Adams. Looking to hire <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach</b> {{in the summer of}} 1950, Ross phoned Lynn Patrick, the son of Lester, who had just resigned from the New York Rangers after coaching the team to the Stanley Cup Final. Lynn had moved his family back to Victoria, British Columbia, where he grew up as a child, with the intention of coaching the Victoria Cougars, a team in the minor professional Pacific Coast Hockey League. Though reluctant to move back to the eastern United States, Lynn was hired by Ross after he was offered a salary of $12,000. He would coach the team for the next four seasons and become the second general manager of the Bruins when Ross retired at the end of October 1954.|$|E
5|$|In the 1962–63 NBA season, Eddie Gottlieb {{sold the}} Warriors {{franchise}} for $850,000 (equal to about $ today) {{to a group}} of businessmen led by Marty Simmons from San Francisco, and the team relocated to become the San Francisco Warriors under <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach,</b> Bob Feerick. This also meant, however, that the team broke apart, as Paul Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his family and his job at IBM in Philadelphia, and Tom Gola was homesick, requesting a trade to the lowly New York Knicks halfway through the season. With both secondary scorers gone, Chamberlain continued his array of statistical feats, averaging 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds per game that year. Despite his individual success, the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Ron Springett was the goalkeeper for England as Banks rose to prominence, {{but after}} the 1962 World Cup in Chile, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach</b> was {{appointed}} in former England right-back Alf Ramsey. Ramsey demanded sole control of the team and began looking towards the next World Cup. Banks won his first cap on 6 April 1963 against Scotland at Wembley, after Springett was dropped following a poor performance. England lost 2–1, though Banks was blameless as Scotland's goals came firstly from an error by Jimmy Armfield and then secondly from the penalty spot. He was picked for the next match against Brazil, which ended in a credible 1–1 draw after Bryan Douglas cancelled out Pepe's opener. Banks continued to play consistently to become established as England's first-choice goalkeeper. In 1963, he was picked to play against the Rest of the World, in a celebration match to mark 100 years of The Football Association.|$|E

5|$|The Bulls {{showed signs}} of {{improvement}} after hiring coach Scott Skiles in 2003, reaching the playoffs in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Some of the primary contributors on those teams were Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, and Kirk Hinrich. The Bulls' new playoff streak ended in 2008, when the team finished fourth in their division with a 33–49 record. After the season, the team hired <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach,</b> Vinny Del Negro. The Bulls' poor record did help them win the 2008 NBA Draft Lottery, which allowed them to select Derrick Rose with the first pick in the NBA Draft. They made the 2009 NBA Playoffs, only to lose in a seven-game series against the Boston Celtics which included a record seven overtime periods. In 2010, Del Negro was replaced by Tom Thibodeau, and the Bulls reached the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, losing to the Miami Heat in five games.|$|E
5|$|The year 2005 signalled a {{fresh start}} for Bolt {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach,</b> Glen Mills, and a new {{attitude}} toward athletics. Mills recognised Bolt's potential and aimed to cease what he considered an unprofessional approach to the sport. Bolt began training with Mills in preparation for the upcoming athletics season, partnering with more seasoned sprinters such as Kim Collins and Dwain Chambers. The year began well, and in July, he knocked {{more than a third of}} a second off the 200 m CAC Championship record with a run of 20.03 s, then registered his 200 m season's best at London's Crystal Palace, running in 19.99 s.|$|E
5|$|Modell said {{he would}} look outside the Browns {{organization}} for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach,</b> a break from past hirings that drew from the team's own ranks. Peter Hadhazy, who Modell had hired as the Browns' first general manager, recommended a 45-year-old New Orleans Saints receivers coach named Sam Rutigliano. After an interview before Christmas in which Modell and Rutigliano spent hours talking and watching game film in Modell's basement, the owner named him head coach on December 27, 1977. An affable, charismatic man with an even temper, Rutigliano was {{a stark contrast to}} Gregg. Sipe immediately flourished under Rutigliano, racking up 21 touchdowns and 2,906 passing yards during the 1978 season, when the NFL moved to a 16-game schedule. His prime targets were Reggie Rucker, a veteran receiver the Browns signed in 1975, and Ozzie Newsome, a rookie tight end out of Alabama who the Browns drafted with a pick acquired in the Phipps trade. Cleveland won its first three games, but poor defense dashed the team's playoff chances and the Browns finished with an 8–8 record.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the club}}'s website, {{the club is}} {{currently}} revising and updating its development plan to incorporate <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coaching</b> programme {{and the desire to}} increase the number of teams and expanded facilities.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, <b>new</b> head <b>coach</b> Jimmy Johnson {{brought in}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coaching</b> staff and drafted two rookie quarterbacks (Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh), {{so he was}} traded to the Miami Dolphins in {{exchange}} for a fifth round draft choice (#120-James Gray) on August 6.|$|R
25|$|Within {{several days}} after being hired, Smith put {{together}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coaching</b> staff, includingTony Cuccinello as third base coach, Johnny Sain as pitching coach, Hal Naragon as the bull-pen coach, and Wally Moses as first-base coach.|$|R
5|$|Nonetheless {{he was not}} traded and the Rockets {{began the}} season with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach,</b> Rudy Tomjanovich. Olajuwon {{improved}} his passing in 1992–93, setting a new career high of 3.5 assists per game. This willingness to pass the ball increased his scoring, {{making it more difficult}} for opposing teams to double and triple-team him. Olajuwon set a new career high with 26.1 points per game. The Rockets set a new franchise record with 55 wins, and advanced to {{the second round of the}} playoffs, pushing the Seattle SuperSonics to a seventh game before losing in overtime, 103–100. He finished second in the MVP race to Charles Barkley with 22 votes to Barkley's 59. The team rewarded him with a four-year contract extension toward the end of the regular season. In stark contrast to the previous year, the Rockets entered the 1993–94 season as a team on the rise. They had a solid core of young players and veterans, with a leader in Olajuwon who was entering his prime.|$|E
5|$|Several {{weeks after}} the {{departure}} of those assistants, reports began to surface that O'Brien had interviewed for the Houston Texans' head coaching position to replace Gary Kubiak, who was fired late in the season. Subsequently, the two sides were reported to be negotiating a contract, and on January 3, 2014, the Texans {{held a press conference}} announcing O'Brien as their new head coach. Assistant head coach and wide receivers coach Stan Hixon, safeties coach Anthony Midget, defensive coordinator John Butler, running backs coach Charles London, and strength coach Craig Fitzgerald submitted resignations on January 6, and most were expected to follow O'Brien to the NFL, leaving only offensive line coach Mac McWhorter, who was 63 years old and came out of retirement to coach at Penn State, defensive line coach Larry Johnson, a long-time member of the staff, and tight ends coach John Strollo, as assistant coaches on the staff, and thus making Penn State more attractive of a coaching position to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach,</b> as he could bring in his own staff.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 {{season began}} well for Zolak, whose {{contract}} was extended through 1998. However, {{to remain with}} the Patriots, Zolak took a $250,000 pay cut to work around the salary cap. While he appeared set to keep his backup job heading into training camp, he faced tough competition from Jay Barker. While Zolak welcomed the challenge, his status as the backup quarterback began to seem uncertain a few weeks into training camp. By the end of training camp, Barker had been cut, and Zolak's quarterback job was safe. He took the role of emergency quarterback throughout the 1996 season, with Bledsoe taking nearly all the snaps and Tom Tupa serving as the backup upon his signing. Zolak played in three games, completing one pass for five yards. He saw some playing time in the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but did not play in Super Bowl XXXI. Parcells ordered Zolak to lose weight, which Zolak did {{throughout much of the}} season. The 1997 season was more of the same for Zolak, backing up Bledsoe, though the Patriots did have <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>coach</b> in Pete Carroll. As training camp ended, Zolak gained significantly more playing time during drills and the preseason matchups then he had under Parcells. As the regular season came and went, however, he had minimal playing time. Zolak saw action in four games, completing six of nine passes for 67yards and two touchdowns, giving him a quarterback rating of 128.2.|$|E
