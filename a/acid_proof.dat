40|$|Biological protein {{assemblies}} are {{the products}} of evolutionary necessity that have arisen to protect the cell, improve reaction rates, and/or compartmentalize biological systems. Belonging to this category of sel-assembling bionano-structures are cage proteins. Cage proteins are composed of multiple protomers (subunits) that self-assemble into many unique structures, all having interior, exterior, and interface surfaces available for controllable modification. Bacterioferritins (Bfr) are a set of cage proteins belonging to the ferritin superfamily of iron storage proteins, are roughly spherical with a 12 nm exterior diameter and an 8 nm interior diameter, are composed of 24 identical protomers, and contain 12 heme cofactors. An important feature of Bfr that was utilized for advancement in platform development was the locality of the N- and C- termini. These termini point towards the exterior and interior of the protein cage, which made them ideal for genetic engineering these two surfaces. Polyhistidine amino acid sequences (His 6 -tags) {{were added to the}} C-termini of the Bfr protein subunits in order to provide new selective affinity interactions on the interior protein surface of this multiprotein cavity.

Higher amino acid analogues, in which the α-hydrogen of amino acid is replaced by a chlorovinyl or fluorovinyl group, are potential mechanism-based enzyme inhibitors for their cognate amino acid decarboxylases. This dissertation describes, to our knowledge, the first syntheses and enzymatic evaluation of these two families of quaternary amino acids. ^ Our synthetic approach to quaternary α-chloro and α-bromovinyl amino acids is based upon addition of the appropriate phenylselenenyl halide to suitably protected α-vinyl amino acids, followed by selenide oxidation and pyrolysis. Under conditions of kinetic control (PhSeX, MeCN, 2 ∼ 3 hours), primarily the (±) -(E) -α-(2 -chlorovinyl) amino acids are obtained. At longer times for the PhSeX addition step, the (±) -α-(1 -chlorovinyl) regioisomer is seen, comprising 50 ∼ 100 % of the α-halovinyl amino acids mixture. ^ The direct α-(1 -chloro) vinylation using 2, 2 -dichlorovinyl phenyl sulfone was accomplished as a potential synthetic route to (±) -α-(1 -chlorovinyl) amino <b>acids.</b> As <b>proof</b> of principle, free (±) -α-(1 -chlorovinyl) alanine and (±) -α-(1 -chlorovinyl) glutamate have been synthesized using this chemistry. ^ A series of (±) -(Z) -α-(2 -fluorovinyl) amino acids was synthesized from α-formyl amino acids via a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction with very high stereoselectivity. The resultant α-fluorovinyl sulfone functionality was transformed into an α-fluorovinyl stannane group with high stereoselectivity for all quaternary amino acids examined. Protodestannylation and deprotection were accomplished to give six (±) -(Z) -α-(2 -fluorovinyl) amino acids (Ala, DOPA, Glu, Lys, Phe, m-Tyr). ^ A coupled continuous UV assay was used to evaluate inhibitory effects of (±) -α-vinyllysine and (±) -α-vinylarginine. Time-dependent inhibition was observed for both compounds. (±) -(E) -α-(2 -Chlorovinyl) lysine, (±) -α-vinyllysine, (±) -(Z) -α-(2 -fluorovinyl) lysine, (±) -α-vinylglutamate, and (±) -(Z) -α-(2 -fluorovinyl) glutamate were tested with their cognate amino acids decarboxylases with a radioactive time-point assay. Lineweaver-Burk analysis was used to test each assay and to obtain values of Km for each natural substrate (L-lysine/LDC Km = 1. 9 mM, L-glutamate/GAD Km = 1. 3 mM) and Kitz-Wilson analysis were used to obtain KI, kinact, and t 1 / 2. Extended dialysis showed the inhibition of lysine decarboxylase to be essentially irreversible. ^ In the case of the best lysine decarboxylase inactivator found, (±) -(Z) -α-(2 -fluorovinyl) lysine, non-pseudofirst order kinetics (ln (Et/Eo) vs. preincubation time) were observed. A Kitz-Wilson analysis of these data using tangents to the inactivation curves provided KI = 1. 3 mM, kinact = 0. 15 min– 1, t 1 / 2 = 5 minutes. Consistent with the notion that this compound is a “suicide substrat”, the product of its enzymatic decarboxylation was observed by 19 F NMR and the ratio of turnover product observed to total enzyme inactivated is approximately 46. That the observed 19 F NMR signal was due to product has been confirmed by independent synthesis of (Z) -α-(2 -fluorovinyl) cadaverine. ...|$|R

A HPLC coupled to a photodiode array detector and an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer (LC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS) was utilized to characterize Dp- 3 -p-coumrut- 5 -glc.

40|$|The biocatalytic {{conversion}} of hydrophobic substrates indicates {{the application of}} nonpolar solvents in an aqueous/organic two phase system. The substrate can be dissolved in high concentrations within the organic bulk phase and diffuses, according to the partition equilibrium into the aqueous phase, where it is converted. A hydrogel-stabilized aqueous phase is capable of protecting the enzymes from surface deactivation and hydrodynamic stress. The reduction of acetophenone catalyzed by the carbonyl reductase from Candida parapsilosis (CPCR 2) and the alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH G 37 D) is a model reaction for the {{conversion of}} hydrophobic substrates. The co-factor NADH is regenerated in situ by oxidizing formic acid, catalyzed by formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii (FDH). Aim of this work was to develop, establish and analyze options for process control, enabling stable oxidoreductions without pH-increase by oxidized formic acid. Further, the prerequisites for establishing the two processes, a reliable enzyme supply and an appropriate immobilization technique were addressed. In order to discover alternative methods to cryo-gelation of polyvinylic alcohol (PVA) for the hydrogel entrapment of enzymes, due to low residual activities obtained for CPCR 2 and FDH and limited protein capacity, CPCR 2 and FDH were immobilized by different methods. The immobilization within glutaraldehyde-cross-linked polyallylamine (PAAm) was applied successfully. Methylene-bis-acrylamide-(BIS) -cross-linked poly-N-isopropyl amide (PNIPAAm) only lead to a residual activity of FDH. An existing method for cryo-gelation of PVA for immobilization of enzymes within defined (PVA) hydrogel beads was adapted, established and characterized for the application within this work. A controlled process in a two phase reaction system was developed for {{the reduction of the}} hydrophobic model substrate acetophenone dissolved in n-heptane to 1 -phenylethanol catalyzed by CPCR 2, immobilized in a PVA hydrogel. After an experimental proof of the process concept, simulation studies with a holistic process model were performed in order to identify limitations for a rational improvement and to point out the potential of the process. As the measurement of CO 2 produced during co-factor regeneration occurs time shifted, depending on the CO 2 solubility within the immobilisates and the organic bulk phase, volume of the CO 2 -sink, temperature and CO 2 concentrations within the dissolving phases, a more direct measurement technique, especially for high reaction rates, is indicated. To this end, dual lifetime referencing (DLR), a fluorescence spectroscopic method, was applied for online-monitoring of the pH-value within the immobilisates during the reaction, allowing a controlled dosage of formic <b>acid.</b> An experimental <b>proof</b> of concept could maintain a reaction, resulting in an increased substrate conversion, compared to the CO 2 -based control.

40|$|The last 20 {{years has}} {{witnessed}} {{a surge in}} the development of fluidic devices and techniques aimed at the generation of novel tools for chemical transformations, chemical analysis, bioassays, therapeutics, medical diagnostics, and in vivo tissue research. A growing area of research involves the use of microfluidics to facilitate reaction optimization and chemical synthesis on a large scale. Although there have been significant gains such as the incorporation of microwave heating, better mass-heat transport, and reduction of impurities through accurate control of reagent addition and reaction parameters, {{there is a lack of}} continuous purification techniques to accompany these processes. The development of continuous in-line purification processes is required for the wide scale adoption of continuous flow synthesis. It is necessary since multistep syntheses generally require changing solvents and removal of spent reagents and salts for downstream unit operations or analysis. Developing homogeneous in-line purification processes for flow synthesis would be a boon for industry by enhancing multistep fluidic processes by streamlining unit operations, enabling on demand synthesis of pharmaceuticals for market, resulting in lower costs from storage, spoilage and consignment returns. To achieve this, a method must continuously purify reaction mixtures of salts and by-products for mass spectrometric analysis to produce real-time second by second analysis of flow reactions. We have developed a microfluidic device to perform a tandem extraction process utilizing reversible acid/base phase switching properties of stable arylboronic acids. Using the complexation of boronic acids to 1, 3 diol containing sugars, such as glucitol to produce boronic esters with strong hydrogen bonding ability, an aliphatic boronic acid functionalized molecule can be phase transferred from organic to aqueous media and vice versa, to facilitate the removal of impurities under continuous flow conditions. The current project involved the design and optimization of a simple hybrid device composed of perfluoropolymer film and stainless steel to construct a cheap, easily fabricated and configurable for rapid phase partitioning of boronic <b>acids</b> as a <b>proof</b> of concept methodology for continuous flow purification. Although continuous flow synthesis using fluidic systems has shown promise for single step synthesis, there is considerable difficulty in performing sequential steps to build complex small molecules. However, with the development of a continuous flow purification method this may be ameliorated so that a general method of multistep synthesis can be developed. The use of extraction techniques to facilitate purifications in continuous flow systems may prove to be a reliable and sustainable method for small scale as well as industrial scale synthesis as opposed to the use of liquid chromatography of intermediates, which introduces greater unit operations, steps and exponentially increases costs of APIs. Although the current project was not successful in generating a fully optimized device with a total arylboronic acid recovery of ~ 95 %, we did achieve a high recovery of 75 %. The proof of concept device demonstrated the utility and promise this system holds for developing multistep inline synthesis and analysis in-flow but requires further work to fabricate a more suitable microfluidic device to conduct arylboronic acid phase-switching purifications...|$|R
60|$|There {{is another}} {{experiment}} which I must give {{you before you}} are fully acquainted with the general nature of carbonic acid. Being a compound body, consisting of carbon and oxygen, carbonic acid is a body {{that we ought to}} be able to take asunder. And so we can. As we did with water, so we can with carbonic acid--take the two parts asunder. The simplest and quickest way is to act upon the carbonic acid by a substance that can attract the oxygen from it, and leave the carbon behind. You recollect that I took potassium and put it upon water or ice, and you saw that it could take the oxygen from the hydrogen. Now, suppose we do something of the same kind here with this carbonic acid. You know carbonic acid to be a heavy gas. I will not test it with lime-water, as that will interfere with our subsequent experiments; but I think the heaviness of the gas and the power of extinguishing flame will be sufficient for our purpose. I introduce a flame into the gas, and you will see whether it will be put out. You see the light is extinguished. Indeed, the gas may, perhaps, put out phosphorus, which, you know, has a pretty strong combustion. Here is a piece of phosphorus heated to a high degree. I introduce it into gas, and you observe the light is put out; but it will take fire again in the air, because there it re-enters into combustion. Now, let me take a piece of potassium, a substance which, even at common temperatures, can act upon carbonic acid, though not sufficiently for our present purpose, because it soon gets covered with a protecting coat; but if we warm it up to the burning point in air, as we have a fair right to do, and as we have done with phosphorus, you will see that it can burn in carbonic acid; and if it burns, it will burn by taking oxygen, so that you will see what is left behind. I am going, then, to burn this potassium in the carbonic <b>acid,</b> as a <b>proof</b> of the existence of oxygen in the carbonic acid. [In the preliminary process of heating, the potassium exploded.] Sometimes we get an awkward piece of potassium that explodes, or something like it, when it burns. I will take another piece; and now that it is heated, I introduce it into the jar, and you perceive that it burns in the carbonic acid--not so well as in the air, because the carbonic acid contains the oxygen combined; but it does burn, and takes away the oxygen. If I now put this potassium into water, I find that, besides the potash formed (which you need not trouble about), there is a quantity of carbon produced. I have here made the experiment in a very rough way; but I assure you that if I were to make it carefully, devoting a day to it, instead of five minutes, we should get all the proper amount of charcoal left in the spoon, or in the place where the potassium was burned, so that there could be no doubt as to the result. Here, then, is the carbon obtained from the carbonic acid, as a common black substance; so that you have the entire proof of the nature of carbonic acid as consisting of carbon and oxygen. And now, I may tell you, that whenever carbon burns under common circumstances, it produces carbonic acid.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityAlthough the 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acids {{have been}} known for sixty years, the {{assignment}} of configuration of these acids has not been definite. All of the pertinent arguments have been based either on the known stereospecificity of the reagents used to produce these acids from oleic acid, or on physical measurements on the product. The purpose {{of this research was}} to demonstrate the configuration of these acids by unequivocal means. The methods starting from the stereospecificity of reagents, have as their basis the analogy that the stereospecificity would be carried over to this new reactant. The interpretation of the physical measurements requires an assumption of a certain conformation that is reasonable on the basis of X-ray diffraction measurements on similar compounds but has never been demonstrated in the compounds studied in this investigation. Both of these methods give concordant results in assigning the threo configuration to the lower melting 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic. The method of attack on this problem was the synthesis of an eighteen carbon compound having the elements of symmetry lacking in 9, 10 -dihydro:xystearic acid and capable of conversion to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid. The compound chosen was 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid. This acid exists in two forms, meso and racemic. The configuration at the nine and ten positions could be demonstrated unequivocally in this case by the actual resolution of the racemic mixture. Conversion of the racemic 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid would produce the threo configuration if no inversion took place at the nine and ten positions. In this manner, a total synthesis of 9, 10 -dibydroxystearic acid would also be accomplished. The synthesis of the desired 9, 10 -dibydroxyoctadecanedioic acid was accomplished as outlined below. 8 -Chlorooctyne- 1 and 1 -iodo- 6 -chlorohexane were prepared from hexamethylene glycol. Condensation of these compounds afforded 1, 14 -dichlorotetradecyne- 7. This, after conversion to the diiodo compound and reaction with ethyl malonate in sodium ethoxide solution, afforded 1, 1, 16, 16 -tetracarbethoxyhexadecyne- 8. A partially saponified and decarboxylated byproduct was also isolated but its constitution was not definitely established. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the pure tetraester afforded 9 -octadecynedioic acid. From the yield data from reactions with tetraester of different history, {{it was found that the}} highest yield of pure 9 -octadecynedioic acid was obtained when the tetraester had been exposed least to alkali. Migration of the acetylenic bond under alkaline conditions is a possible explanation for this observation. The position of the acetylenic bond in the 9 -octadecynedioic acid was determined by ozonolysis. Hydrogenation of 9 -octadecynedioic acid afforded cis 9 -octadecenedioic acid, agreeing in physical constants with those reported in the literature. A remarkable example of a poisoned palladium catalyst was discovered in developing this reaction. Analytically pure 9 -octadecynedioic acid absorbed two molar equivalents of hydrogen with the rate of hydrogen absorption slower during the absorption of the second mole. However, material that had a wider melting point range absorbed only molar equivalent of hydrogen even on prolonged exposure to hydrogen. The cis 9 -octadecynedioic acid was hydroxylated (a) with potassium permanganate and (b) with performic acid. These two methods had been used to produce the two forms of 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid from oleic acid. In this case, two different dihydroxy acids, m. p. 's 157 ° and 122 °, were produced. The acid, m. p. 122 ° (phloionic acid) was also isolated from cork. Two methods were emplqyed to determine the configuration, meso or racemic, of these 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acids. One method involved the formation of a cyclic benzylidene compound by reaction with benzaldehyde. Consideration of the geometry of these molecules indicated that the meso compound would afford a mixture of two compounds that should be separable whereas the racemic modification would afford only one compound. Experiment showed that only one compound was isolated when the 122 ° acid was used whereas the 157 ° acid afforded material that melted over a wide range. The analytical figures for this mixture were in agreement with those expected for the benzylidene compound. Crystallization from several solvents, and chromatography on several adsorbents were tried but with no success in separating the mixture. Since separation of the mixture was not accomplished, this proof of configuration is not conclusive. However, the method indicated that the 122 ° acid is racemic and the 157 ° acid is the meso modification. The configuration of the 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acids was established definitely by resolution of the 122 ° acid as its brucine salt. The resolution was accomplished by equilibrating the salt of the racemic acid with small amounts of cold ethanol. The residue after eight equilibrations differed in specific rotation from the starting material. The salt was decomposed with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the free acid was isolated. This acid was optically active with a specific rotation of + 4. 4 ± 1. 1 °. No claim is made that this material is optically pure since no further resolution attempts were made. For the purpose of the establishment of configuration, the demonstration of optical activity is sufficient. This activity was enhanced by benzoylation. The activity was not due to impurities since this acid was analytically pure. Examination of the alcoholic solution from the equilibration afforded an acid that had a specific rotation of - 0. 5 ± 1. 0 °. This activity is within experimental error and is not too significant. Naturally occurring phloionic acid was found to be optically inactive. This material would appear to originate from non-enzymatic processes since otherwise it would be optically active. The optically active acid appears resistant to racemization. No further work was done on the state or origin of phloionic acid in cork and cork wax. The last part of the problem was the conversion of the racemic 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid (phloionic acid) to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid which would be the threo modification. This conversion was accomplished in the following way: Phloionic acid was converted to the monoester by transesterification with ethyl acetate and sulfuric acid. Normal Fischer esterification afforded the diester mainly even when the reaction was interrupted at shorter time intervals. Hydrolysis of the diester with sodium hydroxide afforded phloionic acid with very small amounts of monoester being formed at the point of half hydrolysis. These facts would indicate that the rate of hydrolysis of the monoester is faster than the diester, and that the monoester is hydrolyzed as rapidly as it is formed. In the transesterification reaction, unchanged starting material was always recovered, a fact indicating that this reaction involved no change in the configuration at the nine and ten positions. The ethyl hydrogen phloionate was reduced to 9, 10, 18 -trihydroxystearic acid by a modification of the Bouvealt-Blanc procedure with sodium in absolute ethanol. The reaction proceeded smoothly and in good yield. A sample of phloionic acid was subjected to these conditions and was recovered unchanged. This observation demonstrated that the nine and ten positions were not involved in this reaction. The 9, 10, 18 -trihydroxystearic acid isolated from this reaction differed in physical constants from the values reported by Zetsche in 1938 for a trihydroxystearic isolated from cork wax and called phloionolic <b>acid.</b> The structure <b>proof</b> was not very conclusive since the degradation products were not compared directly with the known compounds. Phloionolic acid may possibly have the other configuration (erythro). However, this research makes it doubtful that the erythro form would have a lower melting point than the threo form. If this conclusion is correct, Zetsche has incorrectly assigned the 9, 10, 18 -tribydroxystearic acid structure to phloionolic acid. The conversion of threo 9, 10, 18 -trihydroxystearic acid to threo 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid was accomplished in a manner analogous to the conversion of glucose to 6 -desoxyglucose. The 18 -tosyl ester was formed without protection of the vicinal hydroxyl groups by isopropylidene formation. The ester grouping was converted to the 18 -iodo compound by reaction with sodium iodide in acetone. Iodine was replaced by hydrogen by reaction with zinc and hydrochloric acid in glacial acetic acid solvent. The material isolated was identical in analysis, melting point, and mixed melting point with authentic 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid, m. p. 95 °. Both forms of 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid were carried through this process unchanged. The conversion of the racemic 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid without alteration of configuration at the nine and ten positions definitely establishes the low-melting 9, 10 -dibydroxystearic acid as the threo form. In summary, the accomplishments of this research are: 1. The definite assignment of the three configuration to the low-melting 9, 10 -dibydroxystearic acid. 2. The first recorded total synthesis of tb. e 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acids from materials that are not derived from fats and oils. 3. A synthesis of oleic and elaidic acids, since Ames and Bowman have shown that the dihydroxystearic acids can be converted to the unsaturated acids in a stereospecific manner so that the erythro acid affords oleic acid exclusively and threo, elaidic. 4. The demonstration of configuration of the 9, 1. 0 -dibydroxyoctadecanedioic acids. 5 · The questioning of the assignment assigned by Zetsche to phloionolic acid as a 9, 10, 18 -tribydroxyetearic acid. 6. The assignment of configuration to aleurtic acid, 9, 10, 16 -trihydroxypalmitic acid, as threo as a corollary of this work. The assignment is made on the basis of the formation of a trans unsaturated acid when treated in the manner of Bowman, the ease of isoproproylidene formation analogous to the reactivity of the now known threo 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid, and its lower melting point than its isomer...|$|R
