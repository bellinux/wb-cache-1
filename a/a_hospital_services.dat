40|$|Introduction: Quality of {{services}} extremely {{depends on how}} personnel have contact and interaction with the clients. Moreover, the personnel’s attitudes and their behaviors with the clients significantly affect clients’ perception of quality {{of services}} and consequently influence their satisfaction {{as well as their}} absorption to the services of an institution. This study intends to investigate the supervisor’s attitude towards the effect of persons or the personal element (as one of the elements of the service marketing mix) on choosing the hospital by the patients and their companions. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in the winter of 2012. The study participant involved 35 supervisors in Yazd educational hospitals of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences; Shahid Rahnemoun and Afshar. The research data were gleaned via a researcher-made questionnaire on factors of the marketing mix which its validity and reliability were confirmed. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software. Results: Results revealed that supervisor’s belief in the increasing of market share of <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> in public hospitals are consist of: 1 -Physical evidence 2 - Service or product 3 - People or persons 4 - Efficiency and quality 5 - Process 6 - Distribution 7 -Promotion or propagation and 8 - Price. Therefore, the significance of the personnel role in absorption of a definite patient involves the third element in choosing the hospital by the patients. Conclusion: Based on this study, since the third factor in clients’ (patients, etc.) choices of hospital are the personnel and persons who provide services, it is confirmed that in service-based organizations like hospitals, the most important elements of quality of services in retaining and absorbing new clients and surviving the organization are the personnel activities who has been connected with organization clients. Moreover, it is regarded as a vital factor in developing effective relationships with the clients as well as their absorption in the hospital...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{small area}} {{analysis}} {{studies have shown}} that hospital admission rates (total, medical and surgical) vary among <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> areas. Using 1983 Michigan hospital inpatient data from 53 nonmetropolitan Detroit lower peninsula <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> areas, one physician characteristic and 13 hospital characteristics (in the categories of resource supply, services offered and organization) were tested for their association with and explanation of 14 hospital use rates. Registered nurses per bed and the weighted proportion of board certified physicians to total physicians were inversely related to and offered significant contribution to the explanation of the variation in total use rates and in four medical causes for admission rates (circulatory, respiratory, digestive and genito-urinary). Physician and hospital variables provided significant explanation for six of the seven surgical procedure rates tested (appendectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair, prostatectomy and hysterectomy). Four causative factors derived from the characteristics studied were postulated to influence the hospital use rates. The first factor was the small rural nature of the average high use <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> area. High use areas had a lower proportion of board certified physicians and fewer RNs per bed, beds per hospital, and house staff per 10, 000 population than did low use areas. Another factor was the inequality in the distribution of high technology diagnostic <b>services.</b> High use <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> areas had fewer diagnostic services than did low use areas. The third factor was the inequality in the rural hospital environment produced by {{the presence or absence of}} medical education programs. The fourth factor was the impact of the definition and size of <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> area. Current small area analysis methodology assigns every small area to <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> area, no matter what the probability of the population using the <b>hospital(s)</b> within the <b>service</b> area. This research questions that methodology, suggests the need for <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> area definitions based upon the specific diagnosis or procedure being studied and postulates that some rural hospital distance decay curves may turn upward at farther distances when the immediate availability of treatment is too critical to allow patients to return to distant residences. small area analysis hospital use rates hospital characteristics Michigan...|$|R

40|$|Modelling {{patient flow}} {{in health care}} systems is {{considered}} vital in understanding the system's activity and may therefore prove to be useful in improving their functionality. A measure, extensively used, is {{the average length of}} stay which, although easy to calculate and quantify, assumes normally distributed data thus making the subsequent modelling of resources totally unsuitable. In fact, simple deterministic models are generally considered inadequate, hence the necessity for models to reflect the complex, variable, dynamic and multidimensional nature of the systems. This paper focuses on modelling length of stay and flow of patients. An overview of such modelling techniques is provided, with particular attention to their impact and suitability in managing <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>service...</b>|$|R

The response rate was high, indeed higher than that ever achieved in other Italian hospitals. This research presents a summary of the quantitative results in narrative and table format.
