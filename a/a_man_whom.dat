5|$|Meanwhile, Liz attends singles {{activities}} at the YMCA and her friend, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), joins her as her wingman. Nancy accompanies Liz {{to one of the}} activities, and is concerned when Liz speaks critically of everyone there and rebuffs <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> Nancy has drawn into conversation. Nancy encourages Liz to focus not on the negative, but on what she does want from a man. Liz tries to follow Nancy's advice the next day at a dodgeball game, and she tells a man (Ariel Shafir), whom she hit in the face during a previous dodgeball game, what traits she wants from a man. However, the man does not speak English, and a disappointed Liz hits him with another ball.|$|E

25|$|The {{first choice}} of the Committee for Change was AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Thomas R. Donahue, who had {{developed}} a reputation as an effective innovator.

But Donahue refused to challenge <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> he had served loyally for nearly 16 years.|$|E

Also to testify at this second trial was Sir Bernard Spilsbury, who testified that Mona had been strangled from behind with a bootlace or a cord of similar diameter.|$|E
25|$|In 1775 Frances Burney {{turned down}} a {{marriage}} proposal from one Thomas Barlow, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> she had met only once. Her side of the Barlow courtship is amusingly told in her journal. During the period 1782–85 she enjoyed the rewards of her successes as a novelist; she was received at fashionable literary gatherings throughout London. In 1781 Samuel Crisp died. In 1784 Dr Johnson died, and that year also saw the failure of her romance with a clergyman, George Owen Cambridge. She was 33 years old.|$|E

25|$|While still a {{profitable}} company, Packard suffered alongside other independents as it struggled to compete when Ford and General Motors {{engaged in a}} price war. James Nance, President of Packard, decided to merge the company with Studebaker Corporation in 1954. A subsequent proposed merger with American Motors Corporation never passed the discussion phase. DeLorean considered keeping his job and moving to Studebaker headquarters in South Bend, Indiana, when he {{received a call from}} Oliver K.

25|$|Dostoyevsky uses {{individual}} {{styles of}} speech {{to express the}} inner personality of each person. For example, the attorney Fetyukovich (based on Vladimir Spasovich) is characterized by malapropisms (e.g. 'robbed' for 'stolen', {{and at one point}} declares possible suspects in the murder 'irresponsible' rather than innocent). Several plot digressions provide insight into other apparently minor characters. For example, the narrative in Book Six is almost entirely devoted to Zosima's biography, which contains a confession from <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> he met many years before. Dostoyevsky does not rely on a single source or a group of major characters to convey the themes of this book, but uses a variety of viewpoints, narratives and characters throughout.|$|E

25|$|The mercenaries of the Ever Victorious Army, {{comprising}} some of {{the worse}} social elements of China, Britain and the United States were notorious for their practice whenever they marched into a new district of stealing everything while raping all of the women, which led Gordon to impose harsh discipline, with those soldiers accused of looting and/or rape being taken out and shot. Gordon also {{had the pleasure of}} defeating Burgevine (<b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> Gordon detested) who had raised a mercenary force and joined the Taipings. After Gordon had surrounded Burgevine's force outside of Soochow, the latter had abandoned his own men and attempted to rejoin the Imperial side, which led Gordon to arrest him and send him to the American consul in Shanghai together with a letter asking that Burgevine be expelled from China.|$|E

As she climbs back down, the crew finds {{the body of the}} first mate, Mr. Hollybrass, stabbed in the back, by the dirk Zachariah gave her. She is ordered to the brig, where she finds Zachariah, who has been hiding there since he was thrashed nearly to death. Captain Jaggery holds a trial and conveniently finds her guilty of Mr. Hollybrass' murder after accusing Charlotte of being unnatural in many aspects of her life, and comparing this to the unnatural murder of Hollybrass. Captain Jaggery tells Charlotte that he won't be the jury; instead the crew will be the jury. As Charlotte has vowed to expose his cruelty when they land, he threatens to hang her unless she will align herself with him and become a respectable young woman again.|$|E
25|$|The Inuit {{say that}} Raven was {{born out of}} the darkness. He was weak and lost. As he began {{traveling}} aimlessly experiencing the world, he realized that he was the Raven Father, Creator of All Life. Once he realized who he was, he gathered up his strength and flew out of the darkness to a new place which he called earth, but he was still alone, so he decided to create plants. As he flew around exploring this new world, he came upon <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> the legend claims {{was the first of the}} Inuit people. Raven fed the man and taught the man to respect the world around him. Soon after, a woman came to be and Raven taught the both of them how to cloth themselves, build shelter, and make canoes to travel the water. As the two bred and spawned children, Raven cared for their children and educated them as he had done before.|$|E

25|$|If Plato's {{important}} dialogues do {{not refer}} to Socrates' execution explicitly, they allude to it, or use characters or themes that {{play a part in}} it. Five dialogues foreshadow the trial: In the Theaetetus (210d) and the Euthyphro (2a–b) Socrates tells people that he is about to face corruption charges. In the Meno (94e–95a), {{one of the men who}} brings legal charges against Socrates, Anytus, warns him about the trouble he may get into if he does not stop criticizing important people. In the Gorgias, Socrates says that his trial will be like a doctor prosecuted by a cook who asks a jury of children to choose between the doctor's bitter medicine and the cook's tasty treats (521e–522a). In the Republic (7.517e), Socrates explains why an enlightened man (presumably himself) will stumble in a courtroom situation. The Apology is Socrates' defense speech, and the Crito and Phaedo take place in prison after the conviction. In the Protagoras, Socrates is a guest at the home of Callias, son of Hipponicus, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> Socrates disparages in the Apology as having wasted a great amount of money on sophists' fees.|$|E
25|$|In turn, Masters demands $30,000 {{in front}} money, which {{is three times}} the {{authorized}} agency limit for buy money. To get the cash, Chance persuades Vukovich to aid him in robbing Thomas Ling, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> Ruth previously told Chance is bringing $50,000 cash to purchase stolen diamonds. Chance and Vukovich intercept Ling {{at the train station}} and seize the cash in an industrial area. Ling's cover people follow them, though, open fire and accidentally shoot Ling. Chance and Vukovich try to evade them through the streets, freeways and even one of the flood control channels, before a final escape by going the wrong way on the freeway. The next day, the end of their daily briefing includes an FBI bulletin that Ling was its undercover agent, kidnapped, robbed and murdered while on a sting operation. Only a generic description of the assailants and their vehicle is given. While Chance and Vukovich did not kill Ling, Vukovich is nonetheless consumed by guilt, while Chance is apathetic and focused solely on getting Masters. Unable to persuade Chance to come clean about their role in Ling's death, Vukovich meets with Grimes, who advises him to turn himself in and testify against Chance in exchange for a lighter sentence. Vukovich refuses to implicate his partner.|$|E
25|$|In 1408 Mahamu was {{succeeded by}} his son Toghan, who {{continued}} his strife with Arugtai chingsang. By 1437, Toghan had totally defeated Arugtai and an Ögedeid Emperor Adai Khan. Toghan made Genghisid princes his puppet khans of the Mongolia-based Northern Yuan dynasty. When he died in 1438, his son Esen became a taishi. The Oirats had close relations with Moghulistan and Hami where the Chagatayid Khans reigned. From the Ming chronicles, {{it is known that}} the Oirats conducted regular raids on those areas. Esen crushed the Moghulistan and Hami monarchs and forced them to accept him as their overlord. He also conquered Outer and Inner Mongolia and subjugated the Jurchens in Manchuria. The Ming's Zhengtong Emperor was captured by Esen in 1449. During his reign, the Oirat headquarters was centered on north-west Mongolia and Barkol and the Irtysh were the western limits of their settlement. Esen relied on Muslim merchants from Samarkand, Hami and Turpan and his own royal house: Choros was related to Moghulistan according to a myth. After murdering Khagan Agbarjin, Esen took the title khan for himself. But soon after he was overthrown by the Oirat noblemen and killed by a son of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> he executed.|$|E

25|$|At this point, Tacfarinas sent envoys to Rome {{to offer}} peace {{in return for}} land in the {{province}} {{for himself and his}} followers. It is doubtful that this implied a desire by Tacfarinas' men to become sedentary farmers. More likely, they simply sought restored access to their traditional grazing grounds. If his demands were not met, Tacfarinas warned, he would wage a war without end on the Romans. Although this was probably a serious offer, Tiberius was outraged. He considered it the height of impudence that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> he regarded as a deserter and common brigand should be demanding terms like a foreign head of state. The offer was dismissed and Tacfarinas resumed hostilities. Tiberius now demanded that the Senate appoint an especially experienced general to command in Africa so that Tacfarinas could be dealt with once and for all. The man selected by Tiberius was Quintus Junius Blaesus, a veteran who as governor of Pannonia had narrowly escaped lynching by his troops in the great mutinies that broke out on Tiberius' accession in 14 AD. Blaesus owed his selection to his nephew, Sejanus, Tiberius' commander of the Praetorian Guard and trusted right-hand man. For the task, Tiberius gave Blaesus an additional legion (the IX Hispana, transferred from Pannonia on the Danube) and its attached auxiliary regiments, doubling the total force in Africa to around 20,000. He also authorised Blaesus to offer a general pardon to any of Tacfarinas' associates who surrendered - but not to Tacfarinas himself, who was to be captured or killed at all costs.|$|E
25|$|In {{her version}} of events, she had fled civil war in Somalia, was forced into an {{arranged}} marriage with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>whom</b> she had never met, and was not present at her own wedding. Upon escaping she was forced into hiding in the Netherlands, for her ex-husband and father's brothers would have been by Somali custom, required to perform an honor killing. The accounts of various witnesses varied greatly from hers. According to them, she left Somalia prior to any mass violence, and led a comfortable, upper-middle class life in neighboring Kenya, where she attended a Muslim Girls' school and received a full western-style education with focus on the Humanities and Science, her brother attended a Christian school, she lied to the Dutch immigration service about coming from Somalia {{in order not to}} be sent back to Kenya, and they allege she met her husband a few days before her wedding. After several meetings with him, they allege she agreed to the marriage, even though her mother said Ayaan should finish her education so she could afford to leave him if the marriage should have been unsuccessful. They also allege that Hirsi Ali was present at the wedding, something her brother later denied, and according to several witnesses appeared to be enjoying herself. Hirsi Ali denies all of this. On her way to Canada, she says she travelled to Holland by train during a stopover in Germany, and applied for political asylum. During her stay in Holland she regularly received letters from her father. The documentary also quoted several native Somalians as saying there is no tradition of honor killing in Somalia, something that is disputed.|$|E
