40|$|Based on the expert-analytical {{study of}} {{literature}} and websites {{on the results of}} toxicological experiments of varying duration, a hygienic evaluation of the new class of insecticides – macrocyclic lactones: abamectin and emamectin was done. It was found that by the parameters of acute oral and inhalation toxicity abamectin isreferred to a highly dangerous pesticides (class 1), by <b>acute</b> <b>percutaneous</b> <b>toxicity</b> – to moderately dangerous (3), by irritating and allergenic action – to low dangerous (4). According to LD 50 emamectin in single administration into the stomach and on the skin belongs to class 3, by acute inhalation toxicity and irritation of the mucous membranes – to class 2 (dangerous), by skin irritation – to 3 - 4 class, having allergenic potential – 4 class of danger. CF- 1 mice are animals most sensitive to the effects of avermectins due to polymorphism of their mdr 1 a gene, coding P-glycoprotein. The main target organ to avermectin action was recognized to be the central nervous system. ADI of abamectin for humans was established at the level of 0, 0002 mg/kg (the lowest NOAEL by systemic toxicity for parent and offspring generation was set in the experiment studying reproductive toxicity on rats – 0, 12 mg/kg, a safety factor – 600) and emamectin – 0, 001 mg/kg (the lowest NOEL was established in 16 -day experiment on CF- 1 mice – 0, 1 mg/kg and a safety factor – 100) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a novel barrier cream formulation at reducing the <b>percutaneous</b> <b>toxicity</b> of a 2 xLD(50) liquid challenge of nerve agent (VX). The study was conducted in vitro and in vivo using the domestic pig. Pretreatment of the (inner ear skin) exposure site with barrier cream eliminated mortality, reduced cholinesterase inhibition and prevented any physiological or biochemical signs of intoxication. In contrast, untreated animals exposed to VX exhibited severe signs of intoxication, near total AChE inhibition and generally died within the (3 hr) exposure period (5 / 6 animals). Application of the barrier cream caused a significant decrease in the area of skin contaminated by VX. It was tentatively concluded that spreading was predominantly a surface phenomena (possibly mediated by capillary movement of the agent through the microrelief or between hair follicles) with little or no contribution from lateral diffusion within the stratum corneum. There was a disparity between the in vitro and in vivo skin absorption measurements that was ascribed to the absence of systemic clearance in vitro. However, both models indicated a substantial reservoir of VX within the skin, providing a potential strategy for future investigations into "catch-up therapies". In summary, the novel barrier cream formulation was effective against a 2 xLD(50) (liquid, percutaneous) dose of VX applied for 3 hr.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2003, a total of 319 consecutive patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction presenting within 6 - 12 hr after onset of symptoms were prospectively enrolled in a registry. Of 296 patients undergoing primary PCI, 40 patients were >/=>/= 75 years old (group A) and 256 patients younger than 75 years (group B). Elderly patients presented with a lower ejection fraction (49 +/- 14 % vs. 53 +/- 13 %, P = 0. 046) and a higher number of cardiovascular risk factors. PCI success was achieved in 80 % (group A) and 91 % (group B, P = 0. 031), respectively with comparable door-to-balloon times (87 +/- 49 and 95 +/- 79 min, P = ns). Periprocedural complications in both groups were low and major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization and cardiac rehospitalization) after 6 months amounted to 23 % (group A) and 20 % (group B, P = ns), respectively.

With the use of cardiac MRI (CMR), we evaluated the effects of supplemental O 2 in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) accepted for <b>acute</b> <b>percutaneous</b> coronary intervention (PCI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a randomized-controlled trial conducted at two university hospitals in Sweden. Normoxic STEMI patients were randomized in the ambulance to either supplemental O 2 (10 l/min) or room air until {{the conclusion of the}} PCI. CMR was performed 2 - 6 days after the inclusion. The primary endpoint was the myocardial salvage index assessed by CMR. The secondary endpoints included infarct size and myocardium at risk. RESULTS: At inclusion, the O 2 (n= 46) and air (n= 49) patient groups had similar patient characteristics. There {{were no significant differences in}} myocardial salvage index [53. 9 ± 25. 1 vs. 49. 3 ± 24. 0 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : - 5. 4 to 14. 6], myocardium at risk (31. 9 ± 10. 0 % of the left ventricle in the O 2 group vs. 30. 0 ± 11. 8 % in the air group; 95 % CI: - 2. 6 to 6. 3), or infarct size (15. 6 ± 10. 4 % of the left ventricle vs. 16. 0 ± 11. 0 %; 95 % CI: - 4. 7 to 4. 1).

RESULTS: T 2 DM patients had lower circulating endothelial progenitor cell counts, decreased plasma vascular endothelial growth factor and &# 945; levels, and higher plasma high-sensitivity C reactive protein levels compared with non-diabetic controls. After receiving perindopril, the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells increased from day 3 to 7, as did the plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor-&# 945;, compared with the levels in T 2 DM controls.

40|$|Abstract Background Pre-hospital {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) transmission to {{an expert}} for interpretation and triage reduces time to <b>acute</b> <b>percutaneous</b> coronary intervention (PCI) {{in patients with}} ST elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). In order to detect all STEMI patients, the ECG should be transmitted in all cases of suspected acute cardiac ischemia. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the ability of an artificial neural network (ANN) to safely reduce the number of ECGs transmitted by identifying patients without STEMI and patients not needing acute PCI. Methods Five hundred and sixty ambulance ECGs transmitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) in routine care were prospectively collected. The ECG interpretation by the ANN was compared with the diagnosis (STEMI or not) and the need for an acute PCI (or not) as determined from the Swedish coronary angiography and angioplasty register. The CCU physician's real time ECG interpretation (STEMI or not) and triage decision (acute PCI or not) were registered for comparison. Results The ANN sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for STEMI was 95 %, 68 %, 18 % and 99 %, respectively, and for a need of acute PCI it was 97 %, 68 %, 17 % and 100 %. The area under the ANN's receiver operating characteristics curve for STEMI detection was 0. 93 (95 % CI 0. 89 - 0. 96) and for predicting the need of acute PCI 0. 94 (95 % CI 0. 90 - 0. 97). If ECGs where the ANN did not identify a STEMI or a need of acute PCI were theoretically to be withheld from transmission, the number of ECGs sent to the CCU could have been reduced by 64 % without missing any case with STEMI or a need of immediate PCI. Conclusions Our ANN had an excellent ability to predict STEMI and the need of acute PCI in ambulance ECGs, and has a potential to safely reduce the number of ECG transmitted to the CCU by almost two thirds. </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) was {{developed}} {{because of the}} need for a reliable, valid and sensitive instrument to evaluate symptoms and their effects on physical activity in patients following either conservative or surgical management of an Achilles tendon rupture.

Even though the score was published in English, the actual English version has not be validated and compared to the results of the Swedish version. METHODS: From 2009 to 2010, all patients who received treatment for Achilles tendon rupture were followed up using the English version of the ATRS. Patients were asked to complete the score at 3, 6 and 12 months following treatment for Achilles tendon rupture. The ATRS was completed on arrival in the outpatient clinic and again following consultation. RESULTS: The outcomes of 49 (13 female and 36 male) patients were assessed. The mean (SD) age was 49 (12) years, and 27 patients had treatment for a left-sided rupture, 22 the right.

We aimed to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms of two cytochromes (CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 2 C 9) and ABCB 1 modify effect of such dose-adjustment strategy. Materials and methods: We enrolled 118 patients undergoing elective or <b>acute</b> <b>percutaneous</b> coronary intervention (PCI) with drug eluting stent (DES). Platelet reactivity index (PRI) was measured using the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) index and a cut-off value of ≥ 60 % was defined as hyporesponsiveness. Polymorphism of two cytochromes (CYP 2 C 19, CYP 2 C 9) and gene ABCB 1 were determined. In patients hyporesponsive to the initial LD the dose-adjustment was performed using up to 3 additional 600  mg LDs in order to achieve PRI < 60 %, and both 150  mg and 75  mg MD were tested at the follow-up. Results: Patients with at least one CYP 2 C 19 * 2 allele had higher baseline PRI after the initial LD (78. 2  ±  13. 1 vs. 65. 3  ±  19. 5, P =  0. 005). The PRI reduction with additional LD was significantly smaller in carriers of the CYP 2 C 19 * 2 (25. 2  ±  15. 6 vs. 35. 5  ±  16. 8, P =  0. 025) and similar trend was observed with subsequent additional LDs. Both MDs were less effective in presence of CYP 2 C 19 * 2. Target PRI was, however, more frequently achieved with higher MD even in presence of CYP 2 C 19 * 2 (in 70. 6 % vs. 23. 5 % of hyporesponders, P =  0. 008). No such differences were observed for other polymorphisms. Conclusions: In patients hyporesponsive to a routine clopidogrel doses the potency of additional LD and higher MD of clopidogrel is compromised by presence of CYP 2 C 19 * 2 allele.

From 1982 to 1985, 69 patients were treated with emergency angioplasty to attempt reperfusion of the infarctrelated artery. Balloon angioplasty was unsuccessful in 20 patients (group 1) and successful in 49 patients (group 2). Initial clinical and angiographic findings in the groups with unsuccessful and successful angioplasty were similar with respect to age (60. 5 ± 2. 3 versus 57 ± 1. 8 years), infarct location (65 % versus 65 % anterior) and gender (65 % versus 67 % male). Hemodynamic variables in the two groups, including systolic blood pressure (68 ± 4. 3 versus 73 ± 1. 6 mm Hg), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (24. 4 ± 2. 4 versus 27 ± 1. 0 mm Hg) and initial ejection fraction (28. 5 ± 4 % versus 32 ± 2 %), were also similar. Twenty-nine patients received thrombolytic therapy with Streptokinase; the overall rate of reperfusion was 34 %. Group 1 patients had a short-term survival rate of 20 %, compared with 69 % in group 2 patients (p < 0. 0005). Thirty-eight patients survived the hospital period and were followed up for 24 to 54 months (mean 32. 5 ± 2. 4). Five patients (all in group 2) died during follow-up. The long-term incidence rate of congestive heart failure was 19 %, arrhythmia 21 %, need for repeat angioplasty 17 % and coronary artery bypass grafting 26 %. Twenty-four month survival was significantly better in group 2 patients (54 %) versus group 1 patients (11 %, p = 0. 003). It is concluded that emergency coronary angioplasty improves initial and long-term survival in cardiogenic shock complicating myocardial infarction with survival contingent on establishing reperfusion.

Contradictory evidence about the safety of such topical applications of the alcohol {{can be found in the}} scientific literature, yet an up-to-date risk assessment of ethanol application on the skin and inside the oral cavity is currently lacking. The first and foremost concerns of topical ethanol applications for public health are its carcinogenic effects, as there is unambiguous evidence for the carcinogenicity of ethanol orally consumed in the form of alcoholic beverages. So far there is a lack of evidence to associate topical ethanol use with an increased risk of skin cancer. Limited and conflicting epidemiological evidence is available on the link between the use of ethanol in the oral cavity in the form of mouthwashes or mouthrinses and oral cancer. Some studies pointed to an increased risk of oral cancer due to locally produced acetaldehyde, operating via a similar mechanism to that found after alcoholic beverage ingestion. In addition, topically applied ethanol acts as a skin penetration enhancer and may facilitate the transdermal absorption of xenobiotics (e. g. carcinogenic contaminants in cosmetic formulations). Ethanol use is associated with skin irritation or contact dermatitis, especially in humans with an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) deficiency. After regular application of ethanol on the skin (e. g. in the form of hand disinfectants) relatively low but measurable blood concentrations of ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde may occur, which are, however, below acute toxic levels. Only in children, especially through lacerated skin, can <b>percutaneous</b> <b>toxicity</b> occur. As there might be industry bias in many studies about the safety of topical ethanol applications, as well as a general lack of scientific research on the long-term effects, there is a requirement for independent studies on this topic. The research focus should be set on the chronic toxic effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde at the point of impact, with special regard to children and individuals with genetic deficiencies in ethanol metabolism. </p...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{diabetes}} mellitus {{have an increased}} prevalence of vascular disease. Pathologic thrombosis associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture is {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality. Platelets are intimately involved in the initiation and propagation of thrombosis. Evidence suggests that platelets from patients with type 2 diabetes have increased reactivity and baseline activation compared to healthy controls. We review the pathophysiology of platelet hyperreactivity in DM patients and its implications in clinical practice, with particular focus on <b>acute</b> coronary syndromes, <b>percutaneous</b> coronary intervention, and novel antiplatelet agents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a {{systemic}} vascular pathology that is preceded by endothelial dysfunction. Vascular inflam-mation “fuels ” atherosclerosis and creates the milieu for episodes of intravascular thromboses. Thrombotic {{events in the}} coronary vasculature may lead to asymptomatic progression of atherosclerosis or could manifest as acute coronary syn-dromes or even sudden cardiac death. Thrombus encountered {{in the setting of}} acute coronary syndromes has been corre-lated with <b>acute</b> complications during <b>percutaneous</b> coronary interventions such as no-reflow, acute coronary occlusion and long term complications such as stent thrombus. This article reviews the pathophysiology of coronary thrombogenesis and explores the complications associated with thrombus during coronary interventions...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Previous {{studies have}} shown that smokers {{presented}} with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) a decade earlier than non-smokers. However, no account has been made for population smoking trends, an important deficit addressed by this study. Methods The combination of admission data on patients with <b>acute</b> STEMI undergoing <b>percutaneous</b> coronary intervention and demographic data supplied by the Office for National Statistics for the South Yorkshire population between 2009 – 2012 were analysed to generate incidence rates and rate ratios (RR) to quantify the relative risk of STEMI from smoking, overall and by age group. Results There were 1795 STEMI patients included of which 72. 9...|$|R
40|$|Bifurcation stenoses {{have been}} {{recognized}} to be at "high risk " for <b>acute</b> closure during <b>percutaneous</b> transluminal coronary angioplasty. Use of the tra-ditional single balloon technique in such situations often results in acute closure or worsening of the stenosis in the other branch. A technique utilizing simulta-neous inflation of two balloons, ("kissing balloon " technique) has been utilized to avoid this complication. A double balloon technique has been developed using sequential inflations rather than simultaneous inflations to preserve the integ-rity of both branches while avoiding the arterial trauma produced by inflating two balloons in a small artery simultaneously. Twelve of 13 bifurcation stenoses were successfully treated with this sequential inflation double balloon tech-nique. (Primary success rate = 92 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{find the}} {{time-to-peak}} for creatine kinase MBmass (CKMB) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) after acute reperfusion, to compare peak and cumulative values to estimate infarct size (IS), and to evaluate clinical routine sampling for assessment of IS. Design. <b>Acute</b> primary <b>percutaneous</b> coronary intervention (PCI) {{was performed in}} 38 patients with first-time myocardial infarction. In 21 patients, CKMB and cTnT were acquired before PCI and at 1. 5, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 hours thereafter. In 17 patients, clinical routine samples were acquired at arrival, and at 10 and 20 h. IS was assessed by delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DE- MRI). Results. Time-to-peak was 7. 6 +/- 3. 6 h for CKMB and 8. 1 +/- 3. 4 h for cTnT. Peak values correlated strongly to cumulative values (r(s) = 0. 97 - 0. 98) {{as well as to}} DE-MRI (r(s) = 0. 8 - 0. 82). Clinical routine sampling showed lower r(s) values (0. 47 - 0. 60). Conclusions. Peak values are likely captured if CKMB and cTnT are acquired at 3, 6, and 12 h after acute PCI. These peak values can be used to estimate myocardial infarct size after acute PCI...|$|R
