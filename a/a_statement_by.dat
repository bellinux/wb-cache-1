5|$|Irish {{immigrants}} generally remained {{loyal to}} the Democratic Party, but McKinley's promises of sound money attracted German-Americans who were appalled by Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans had long been Democratic; efforts by that party to rebut McKinley, including circulating <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> Bismarck in support of bimetallism, were ineffective. Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association had for him.|$|E

5|$|The RIRA has {{a command}} {{structure}} {{similar to the}} Provisional IRA, with a seven-member Army Council consisting of a chief of staff, quartermaster general, director of training, director of operations, director of finance, director of publicity, and adjutant general.

5|$|Archimedes {{was born}} c. 287BC in the seaport city of Syracuse, Sicily, {{at that time}} a self-governing colony in Magna Graecia, located {{along the coast of}} Southern Italy. The date of birth is based on <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> the Byzantine Greek {{historian}} John Tzetzes that Archimedes lived for 75 years. In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an astronomer about whom nothing is known. Plutarch wrote in his Parallel Lives that Archimedes was related to King Hiero II, the ruler of Syracuse. A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children. During his youth, Archimedes may have studied in Alexandria, Egypt, where Conon of Samos and Eratosthenes of Cyrene were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his friend, while two of his works (The Method of Mechanical Theorems and the Cattle Problem) have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.|$|E

MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E

Team Meat sells charms, plush toys, and posters related to the game, as well as T-shirts, stickers, stress balls, and a limited edition Super Meat Boy comic.

5|$|The {{extent of}} Zenobia's {{territorial}} control during her early reign is debated; according to historian Fergus Millar, her authority {{was confined to}} Palmyra and Emesa until 270. If this was the case, the events of 270 (which saw Zenobia's conquest of the Levant and Egypt) are extraordinary. It {{is more likely that}} the queen ruled the territories controlled by her late husband, a view supported by Southern and historian , and backed by ancient sources (such as the Roman historian Eutropius, who wrote that the queen inherited her husband's power). The Augustan History also mentioned that Zenobia took control of the East during Gallienus' reign. Further evidence of extended territorial control was <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> the Byzantine historian Zosimus, who wrote that the queen had a residence in Antioch.|$|E

5|$|In 1974 Boycott's form dipped, when {{he scored}} only 75runs {{in the first}} innings of the season, other than a non-championship century against Cambridge University. He did, however, score 152* against Worcestershire on 15 May to {{complete}} his tour of centuries against every first-class county. Both he and Yorkshire suffered through 1975 and 1976, as did his international career, since he refused to play for England from 1974 until 1977. During the summer of 1978 Boycott broke a finger, so John Hampshire temporarily took over as captain. Boycott returned later in the season, scoring 968runs at 50.94, but this was second to Hampshire's 1,463 at 54.18. A poll of the dressing room showed that 95% of the players wanted a permanent change in the captaincy. On 15 September 1978 Boycott's mother, to whom he was very close, died of cancer, placing further pressure on him. On 29 September, the Yorkshire club committee met with Boycott to discuss terminating his captaincy. <b>A</b> <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> the club outlined Yorkshire's intention to retain Boycott as a player while giving the captaincy to Hampshire. Boycott, in response, attacked the Yorkshire club and its decision in an appearance on the BBC's flagship chatshow Parkinson on 7 October, prompting both strong criticism from the club and strong public support for his own position.|$|E
