25|$|Some lakes can {{disappear}} seasonally. These {{are called}} intermittent lakes, ephemeral lakes, or seasonal lakes {{and can be}} found in karstic terrain. A prime example of an intermittent lake is Lake Cerknica in Slovenia or Lag Prau Pulte in Graubünden. Other intermittent lakes <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> result of above-average precipitation in a closed, or endorheic basin, usually filling dry lake beds. This can occur in some of the driest places on earth, like Death Valley. This occurred in the spring of 2005, after unusually heavy rains. The lake did not last into the summer, and was quickly evaporated (see photos to right). A more commonly filled lake of this type is Sevier Lake of west-central Utah.|$|E
25|$|The Green Bay Packers {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 10–6 record and became the first number 6-seeded team in the NFC to compete in the Super Bowl.

Green Bay also joined the 2005 Steelers as the only teams ever to defeat the top three seeded teams on the road in the playoffs. In order to secure their fifth Super Bowl bid they defeated their longtime rivals, the Chicago Bears, in the NFC Championship Game at Soldier Field.|$|E
25|$|Volcanoes {{are also}} part of the {{extended}} carbon cycle. Over very long (geological) time periods, they release carbon dioxide from the Earth's crust and mantle, counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological carbon dioxide sinks. The US Geological Survey estimates are that volcanic emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human activities, which generate 100–300 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes. A review of published studies indicates that annual volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide, including amounts released from mid-ocean ridges, volcanic arcs, and hot spot volcanoes, <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> equivalent of 3 to 5 days of human-caused output. The annual amount put out by human activities may be greater than the amount released by supererruptions, the most recent of which was the Toba eruption in Indonesia 74,000 years ago.|$|E

25|$|Experience in South Africa {{had shown}} him that {{underlying}} the difficulties of the situation there was the wider problem of imperial unity. In his farewell speech at Johannesburg he concluded with {{a reference to the}} subject. 'When we who call ourselves Imperialists talk of the British Empire, we think of a group of states bound, not in an alliance or alliances that can be made and unmade but in a permanent organic union. Of such a union the dominions of the sovereign as they exist to-day <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> raw material.' This thesis he further developed in a magazine article written in view of the colonial conference held in London in 1907. He advocated the creation of a permanent deliberative imperial council, and favored preferential trade relations between the United Kingdom and {{the other members of the}} empire; and in later years he took an active part in advocating the cause of tariff reform and Imperial Preference.|$|E
25|$|The Philippines is {{predominantly}} a Christian society with a complicated history {{of relations between}} Islam and Christianity. Despite historic evidence of Islamization spreading throughout the islands in the 13th-16th centuries, the archipelago came under Spanish rule in the 16th century. The Spanish proselytized many natives, and labelled those who remained Muslims as Moro, a derogatory term recalling the Moors, an Islamic people of North Africa who occupied Spain for 800 years. Today, this term Moro is {{used to refer to}} the indigenous Muslim tribes and ethnic groups of the country. When the Spanish came to the Philippine islands, most of the natives in Luzon and Visayas were pagans with Muslim minorities, and while Spanish proselytized many natives, many Muslims in Luzon and Visayas were not exempted by the Spaniards from the Spanish Inquisition, wherein Muslims to become Catholics or die for their faith. Those who remained Muslims <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> natives of Mindanao and Sulu which the Spaniards did not invade or had control of only briefly and partially.|$|E

[...] Cameron emphasized people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were [...] "celebrating their own essential humanity" [...] by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally [...] "incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric" [...] and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. [...] "Turan mistakes archetype for cliche," [...] he said.
