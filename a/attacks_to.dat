5|$|A Titan's {{durability}} {{depends on}} its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's <b>attacks.</b> <b>To</b> defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Aikido {{techniques}} are usually {{a defense against}} an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 2016, an {{explosion}} near Damascus International Airport killed top military commander Mustafa Badreddine. Lebanese media sources attributed the <b>attack</b> <b>to</b> an Israeli airstrike. Hezbollah attributed the <b>attack</b> <b>to</b> Syrian opposition.|$|R

5000|$|Irimi (ee-ree-mee) is {{the second}} pillar of Aikido (Aikido {{techniques}} are structured around six main pillars). [...] Irimi involves entering deeply around or behind an <b>attack</b> <b>to</b> defuse or neutralize the attack. The concept of irimi teaches one to blend with or enter into an opponent’s <b>attack</b> <b>to</b> become one with the opponent’s movement and leaving the opponent with nowhere to strike. This movement is utilized during {{the moment of the}} opponent’s <b>attack.</b> <b>To</b> complete the movement, one moves out of the opponent's line of <b>attack</b> <b>to</b> the opponent’s shikaku, or blind spot. When executed properly, one can strike an opponent with great force, combining his attacking momentum and one's forward movement.|$|R
5|$|Astaroth's {{gameplay}} {{was developed}} around {{the concept of}} a powerful fighter that struck at a distance, and has been noted as one of the strongest characters in the Soul series, requiring few mistakes to be made when fighting against Astaroth to defeat him. Measures were put into effect to make the character unique by allowing the player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen <b>attacks,</b> <b>to</b> contrast against other large character fighting styles in Soulcalibur such as Nightmare's multiple fighting stances.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of dugong {{predation}} {{was identified}} {{in one study}} that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast. Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark <b>attacks.</b> <b>To</b> minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when the sharks are abundant.|$|E

In July 2001, Atta met with bin al-Shibh in Spain, where they coordinated details of the plot, including final target selection. Bin al-Shibh also passed along bin Laden's wish for the <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> be carried {{out as soon as}} possible. Some of the hijackers received passports from corrupt Saudi officials who were family members, or used fraudulent passports to gain entry.|$|E

5|$|InsideOut Music {{released}} Office of Strategic Influence on February 17, 2003. Moore {{chose the}} group's name and album's title, {{referring to the}} Office of Strategic Influence, established by the US Government after the September 11 <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> spread propaganda. The album was critically well received. Critics praised the members' musicianship {{and the fact that}} the album differed significantly from the members' other projects.|$|E
5|$|On 8 April, the German XLVI Motorised Corps {{continued}} with its limited objective <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> expand their bridgeheads on the 4th Army front, including at Zákány. The resistance offered by both flanking divisions was very limited. The 36th Infantry Regiment of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska, {{which had been}} concentrating in the Ludbreg district northwest of Koprivnica, {{was transferred to the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska, in an attempt to bolster the left flank of the divisional sector.|$|E
5|$|Sasaki {{described}} her fighting style as revolving around her dual weapons, comparing her to previous series character Cervantes {{but with the}} combination of her spear and short sword weapons allowing for both long distance and close-quarters combat. Control of her weapons is mapped to different inputs from the player's controller, allowing the <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> be combined and create different horizontal and vertical strikes. However, as a result at long range Hilde's attacks become limited to entirely linear strikes.|$|E

5|$|The Paradigm {{system allows}} the player to program six {{different}} roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle {{in response to}} specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but they can learn others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, {{which is the only}} way that the player can control the AI characters during a fight. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up before the battle. Monsters only have one role; different ones are used when the player switches paradigms. The player selects up to three monsters they wish to use in paradigms outside of battle. Unlike in Final Fantasy XIII, the player cannot summon the Eidolons, as the giant creatures were only available to the protagonists of that game.|$|E
5|$|The {{album is}} named after the Office of Strategic Influence, an {{organization}} set up after the September 11 <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> spread misinformation and plant false news items in the media, among other functions. The Office was shut after The New York Times published a story on it; many of its operations were transferred to the Information Operations Task Force. The album's lyrics were written by Moore {{in reaction to the}} September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a 2.5D, third-person {{perspective}} replicating the aesthetic of the television series. The New Kid is able to freely explore {{to the town of}} South Park, interacting with characters and undertaking quests, and accessing new areas by progressing through the main story. Selecting one of four character archetypes, Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Jew, each offering specific abilities, the New Kid and a supporting party of characters use a variety of melee, ranged, and magical fart <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> combat with their enemies.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third-person {{perspective}} and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands. Development was shared between DMA Design, based in Edinburgh and Rockstar, in New York City. Much of the development work constituted transforming popular series elements into a fully-3D world. The game was delayed following the September 11 <b>attacks,</b> <b>to</b> allow the team to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|The second phase, {{scheduled}} to begin on 23 August, was to capture Bapaume and then advance further east to Reincourt-les-Bapaume and Bancourt-Fremicourt and the high ground beyond. The New Zealanders were to play a key role; the 1st and 2nd Infantry Brigades of the New Zealand Division, kept in reserve, were {{to be ready to}} exploit any breakthrough on the front. To distract the Germans from the main attack being carried out by the Third Army, the French Tenth Army conducted diversionary <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> the south.|$|E
5|$|A reboot of the series, with Bond winning his 00 {{status in}} the pre-credits sequence. Bond is {{instructed}} to investigate the funding of terrorism. He tracks down and kills a bomb-maker and takes his mobile phone. Searching through the phone, Bond discovers a text message which he traces to Alex Dimitrios, {{and then on to}} financer Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre's investments involve short-selling stock in successful companies and then engineering terrorist <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> sink their share prices. Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype Skyfleet airliner, which forces Le Chiffre to set up a high-stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale to recoup his fortune. Bond is instructed to beat Le Chiffre and is aided by a member of HM Treasury, Vesper Lynd.|$|E

5|$|A young {{specimen}} of the Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite {{marks on the}} face that were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, indicating that the animal survived the bite. A full-grown Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> the face were not limited to younger animals. While {{it is possible that}} the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as well as in other theropod genera like Sinraptor and Saurornitholestes. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the bites are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{landed on}} Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an airfield, later called Henderson Field, that was under {{construction}} by the Japanese military. There were several subsequent {{attempts by the}} Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship, to recapture the airfield, which ultimately failed. In early November 1942, the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield. Several Japanese warship forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field {{with the goal of}} destroying Allied aircraft that posed a threat to the convoy. Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> defend Henderson Field and prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|As {{characters}} gain experience points their mutant superpowers {{and unique}} abilities can be upgraded. Items found during gameplay {{can also be}} equipped to further enhance a character's abilities. Characters can combine <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> create a combo, in which two or more players punch or kick a single enemy at the same time. The character's special abilities {{can also be used}} in the same manner to create a Super Combo which inflicts massive damage on enemies. Each character has several mutant powers that players can assign to controller buttons. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E
