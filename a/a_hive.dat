5|$|Ants {{also are}} quite popular {{inspiration}} for many science-fiction insectoids, {{such as the}} Formics of Ender's Game, the Bugs of Starship Troopers, the giant ants in the films Them! and Empire of the Ants, Marvel Comics' super hero Ant-Man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in Phase IV. In computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the Master of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II. These characters are often credited with <b>a</b> <b>hive</b> mind, a common misconception about ant colonies.|$|E
50|$|Colonies {{in trees}} have fixed comb, so {{inspection}} and management is impossible, as is most harvesting without destroying the colony. A beekeeper can perform a cut-out on <b>a</b> gum <b>hive.</b> The trunk is cut open {{to expose the}} cavity, and the comb is carefully removed and strapped into standard frames. The frames are then put to <b>a</b> conventional <b>hive,</b> such as <b>a</b> Langstroth <b>hive.</b> The bees will follow into the new hive especially if the queen and brood can be transferred.|$|R

5|$|At Dunder Mifflin, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{announces that}} the Scranton branch, {{previously}} the company's most profitable office, has lost ten major clients to Michael's company. Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) visits Scranton {{to see what}} can be done to stem the losses. In a blatant about-face from his no-nonsense persona, Charles blatantly sucks up to David, which Jim notices. David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present because he had been Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing <b>a</b> <b>hive</b> of bees.|$|E
5|$|Nafash was a zerg broodmother, {{and leader}} of the Nafash Brood. Hoping to make the Swarm {{stronger}} by evolving {{a way to deal with}} extreme cold, Sarah Kerrigan sent Nafash and her brood to infest Kaldir. After Kerrigan's deinfestation, Nafash sought to create her own Swarm. Shortly after setting up <b>a</b> <b>hive,</b> Nafash moved off into the ice valleys. When the protoss struck, Nafash fell back to prepared positions. The protoss hunted her down and killed her.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of <b>a</b> <b>Hive</b> Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to web search {{that is based on}} <b>a</b> bee <b>hive</b> metaphor is presented. We proposed a modified model of <b>a</b> bee <b>hive.</b> Our model comprises of a dance floor, an auditorium, and a dispatch room. We have shown that the model is a true model of <b>a</b> bee <b>hive</b> in the sense it simulates several kinds of its typical behaviour. However, more importantly it is a simple model that describes some processes taking place in web search. Our model incorporates also several kinds of uncertainty. Experiments show that uncertainty increases robustness of the search and makes it actually more efficient...|$|R
50|$|His {{technique}} for introducing new queen bees to <b>an</b> existing <b>hive</b> {{was published in}} 1874. New queens are usually rejected by <b>an</b> existing <b>hive.</b> In his technique, Mr. Bechly removes a comb from the hive, places the comb and <b>hive</b> bees into <b>an</b> empty <b>hive,</b> and closes them in with the new queen. The bees being stressed by foreign imprisonment are unconcerned about the new queen. The old hive is left queenless and is also closed. Over the next several days, as the hives are reopened, the bees return to the old hive along with their new queen.|$|R

5|$|The Zerg are a {{collective}} consciousness {{of a variety}} of different races assimilated into the Zerg genome. The Zerg were originally commanded by the Zerg Overmind, a manifestation of this hive mind, and under the Overmind's control the Zerg strove for genetic perfection by assimilating the favorable traits of other species. After a species has been assimilated into the Swarm, it is mutated towards a different function within its hierarchy, from being <b>a</b> <b>hive</b> worker to a warrior strain. StarCrafts manual notes that some species bear little resemblance to their original forms after just a short time into assimilation (An example would be the formerly peaceful Slothien species, which was assimilated and mutated into the vicious Hydralisk strain and so on). The Overmind controls the Swarm through secondary agents called cerebrates. Cerebrates command an individual brood of Zerg, each with a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Cerebrates further delegate power through the use of overlords for battlefield direction and queens for hive watch.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} factions within Invisible War that Alex is {{contacted}} by and {{can choose to}} side with and represent different viewpoints on how humanity's post-Collapse society should develop. The two factions handling reconstruction in city enclaves are a future version of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which builds and maintains the emergent city states, acting as the defacto government body; and the Order, a religion combining concepts from multiple faiths which has gained support from people outside the enclaves and is opposed to the WTO's policies. Both the Order and the WTO are puppet organizations of the Illuminati, respectively led by Illuminati members Nicolette DuClare and Chad Dumier, the latter {{a veteran of the}} war against Majestic 12. Two other factions are the Knights Templar, a group led by former Order leader Saman that makes militant strikes against groups espousing biomod use; and the Omar, a cult of cybernetically-enhanced humans who share <b>a</b> <b>hive</b> mind.|$|E
5|$|The Overmind is {{the center}} of the Zerg Swarm's hive mind society, created by the Xel'Naga as a single {{consciousness}} for their experiments on the Zerg. It is the antagonist of StarCraft, where it is voiced by Jack Ritschel; Paul Eiding voices the character in Wings of Liberty. At some point during its creation, it was secretly enslaved by the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, who implanted it with a directive to destroy the Protoss and bound the Zerg to <b>a</b> <b>hive</b> mind. The Overmind becomes aware of Xel'Naga, attacking and assimilating its masters. Through this, the Overmind learns of the existence of the Protoss and is determined to assimilate the fellow Xel'Naga-empowered species, believing this will result in perfection. To provide the necessary force to overcome the Protoss, the Overmind targets the psionic potential of the Terrans for assimilation. He also assimilated Sarah Kerrigan so as to create a weapon to free the Zerg from the control of his Dark Master. The Zerg and Protoss clash on various Terran worlds, eventually leading to Zeratul assassinating the cerebrate Zasz. Zasz's death momentarily links the minds of the Overmind and Zeratul, allowing Overmind to learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind quickly launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet's surface. Following a lengthy and costly campaign on Aiur, Tassadar harnesses the energies of the dark templar to strike at the Overmind directly, disintegrating it.|$|E

25|$|A virgin queen is a {{queen bee}} {{that has not}} mated with a drone. Virgins are {{intermediate}} in size between workers and mated, laying queens, and are much more active than the latter. They are hard to spot while inspecting a frame, because they run across the comb, climbing over worker bees if necessary, and may even take flight if sufficiently disturbed. Virgin queens can often be found clinging to the walls or corners of <b>a</b> <b>hive</b> during inspections.|$|E

50|$|When {{males and}} females of a bee species often {{encounter}} one another without environmental recognition cues, natural selection is likely to favor a mechanism of naturally borne cues. In addition, sexually active {{males and females}} often fail to disperse during the mating season and will thus encounter one another. This failure to disperse makes the recognition of naturally born cues vital {{for the success of}} <b>a</b> <b>hive’s</b> genes.|$|R
25|$|Although the Ottomans did {{not manage}} to retake the forts, they were {{successful}} in blocking {{the spread of the}} insurgency to the island's western provinces. The insurgents were besieged in Gramvousa {{for more than two years}} and they had to resort to piracy to survive. Gramvousa became <b>a</b> <b>hive</b> of piratical activity that greatly affected Turkish–Egyptian and European shipping in the region. During that period the population of Gramvousa became organised and built a school and a church dedicated to the Panagia i Kleftrina ("Our Lady the piratess")—St Mary as the patron of the klephts.|$|E
25|$|The drones' main {{function}} is {{to be ready to}} fertilize a receptive queen. Drones in <b>a</b> <b>hive</b> do not usually mate with a virgin queen of the same hive because they drift from hive to hive. Mating generally takes place in or near drone congregation areas. How these areas are selected is poorly understood, but they do exist. When a drone mates with a queen, the resultant queen will have a spotty brood pattern (numerous empty cells on a brood frame) due to the removal of diploid drone larvae by nurse bees (i.e., a fertilized egg with two identical sex genes will develop into a drone instead of a worker).|$|E
