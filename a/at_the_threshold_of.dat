5|$|North of Sirius lie Theta and Mu Canis Majoris, Theta {{being the}} most northerly star with a Bayer {{designation}} in the constellation. Around 8 billion years old, it is an orange giant of spectral type K4III that is around as massive as the Sun but has expanded to 30 times the Sun's diameter. Mu is a multiple star system located around 1244 light-years distant, its components discernible in a small telescope as a 5.3-magnitude yellow-hued and 7.1-magnitude bluish star. The brighter star is a giant of spectral type K2III, while the companion is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V. Nu Canis Majoris is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 5.7, 278 light-years away; it is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> naked-eye visibility.

They have already won 19 {{straight}} – 9 in the eliminations, 8 in the semifinals, {{and the first}} 2 games of the finals series against arch rivals Toyota. In Game 3, and behind by three points at halftime, Toyota team manager Pablo Carlos fired Coach Fort Acuña on the spot for refusing to heed Carlos' demand thrice to field in Robert Jaworski in the game. The feud between Acuña and Jaworski was never revealed although rumors at that time said that their differences were “professional transcending into the personal.” Jaworski re-entered the court {{at the start of}} the 3rd canto with Carlos coaching, and although didn't exactly play well, emotionally lifted the Tamaraws to a hotly contested 97-94 victory against the Redmanizers, spoiling Crispa's chances to win the crown unbeaten. Crispa eventually won Game 4, 105-91 and ended the conference with a 20-1 slate.|$|E

The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements.

2500|$|Other {{critics of}} the concept of {{adolescence}} do point at individual differences in brain growth rate, citing that some (though not all) early teens still have infantile undeveloped corpus callosums, concluding that [...] "the adult in *every* adolescent" [...] is too generalizing. These people tend to support the notion that a more interconnected brain makes more precise distinctions (citing Pavlov's comparisons of conditioned reflexes in different species) {{and that there is a}} non-arbitrary threshold at which distinctions become sufficiently precise to correct assumptions afterward as opposed to being ultimately dependent on exterior assumptions for communication. These people argue that this threshold is the one at which an individual is objectively capable of speaking for himself or herself, as opposed to culturally arbitrary measures of [...] "maturity" [...] which often treat this ability as a sign of [...] "immaturity" [...] merely because it leads to questioning of authorities. These people also stress the low probability of the threshold being reached at a birthday, and instead advocate non-chronological emancipation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> afterward correction of assumptions. They sometimes cite similarities between [...] "adolescent" [...] behavior and KZ syndrome (inmate behavior in adults in prison camps) such as aggression being explainable by oppression and [...] "immature" [...] financial or other risk behavior being explainable by a way out of captivity being more worth to captive people than any incremental improvement in captivity, and argue that this theory successfully predicted remaining [...] "immature" [...] behavior after reaching the age of majority by means of longer-term traumatization. In this context, they refer to the fallibility of official assumptions about what is good or bad for an individual, concluding that paternalistic [...] "rights" [...] may harm the individual. They also argue that since it never took many years to move from one group to another to avoid inbreeding in the paleolithic, evolutionary psychology is unable to account for a long period of [...] "immature" [...] risk behavior.|$|E
