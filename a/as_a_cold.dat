5|$|Snowfall {{is rare in}} Florida. The {{earliest}} recorded {{occurrence of}} snow or sleet occurred in 1774 in the far northern portion of the state. The latest occurrence of snow or sleet in the spring fell on January 7, 8, and 9, 2010, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front brought scattered snow flurries in the northern and central portions of the state.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton is {{an impact}} crater that {{lies at the}} south pole of the Moon. The peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight, while the {{interior}} is perpetually in shadow (a Crater of eternal darkness). The low-temperature interior of this crater functions <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> trap that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the Moon. Measurements by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater, which may indicate the presence of water ice. The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton.|$|E

5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} simply <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> is a viral {{infectious}} {{disease of the}} upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|During the Gallipoli campaign, Godley {{commanded}} the composite New Zealand and Australian Division, before taking over {{command of the}} Australian and New Zealand Army Corps for {{the final stages of}} the campaign. Promoted to lieutenant general, he had a brief period in command of I Anzac Corps before being given command of the II Anzac Corps. He led the corps for most of its service on the Western Front. Regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> and aloof commander, his popularity was further dented in October 1917 when he insisted on continuing an offensive in the Ypres salient when weather and ground conditions were not favourable. His corps suffered heavy losses in the ensuing battle. In 1918, II Anzac Corps was re-designated as British XXII Corps and he led it {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Robert James Fischer (March 9, 1943January 17, 2008) was an American chess {{grandmaster}} and {{the eleventh}} World Chess Champion. Many consider {{him to be}} the greatest chess player of all time. In 1972, he captured the World Chess Championship from Boris Spassky of the USSR in a match held in Reykjavík, Iceland, publicized <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> War confrontation, which attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since. In 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE, the game's international governing body, over one of the conditions for the match. This allowed Soviet GM Anatoly Karpov, who had won the qualifying Candidates' cycle, to become the new world champion by default under FIDE rules.|$|E

5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.|$|E

A similarly loveless relationship is depicted in the film A Waste of Shame (2005).|$|E
25|$|The {{alterations}} {{in the sense}} of taste, usually a metallic taste, and sometimes smell are the only symptoms. The duration of the symptoms of dysgeusia depends on the cause. If the alteration {{in the sense of}} taste is due to gum disease, dental plaque, a temporary medication, or a short-term condition such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> the dysgeusia should disappear once the cause is removed. In some cases, if lesions are present in the taste pathway and nerves have been damaged, the dysgeusia may be permanent.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases are}} caused by a viral infection. Strep throat is the cause in about 25% of {{children}} and 10% of adults.

Specific testing is not recommended in people who have clear symptoms of a viral infection such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold.</b> Otherwise a rapid antigen detection test (RAPD) or throat swab is recommended. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include epiglottitis, thyroiditis, retropharyngeal abscess, and occasionally heart disease.|$|E
