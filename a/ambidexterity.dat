Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} five, Burke's local youth {{basketball}} league had {{to change}} its rules {{so that he would}} not keep stealing the ball from the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball. He became Jared Sullinger's best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however. At the age of nine, Burke's father made him do everything with his left hand, including brushing his teeth and eating dinner, in order to develop his <b>ambidexterity.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{prolific}} goalscorer, Villa {{is regarded}} by pundits {{as one of}} the best forwards of his generation, and one of the best Spanish strikers of all-time. An opportunistic, versatile and well-rounded player, Villa is naturally right-footed, but an accurate and powerful finisher with either foot, due to his <b>ambidexterity,</b> both inside and outside the area, despite his lack of height or physicality; he is also a set piece and penalty kick specialist. Villa is a quick, agile, and mobile team player, with excellent technique and dribbling skills, who is also known for his work-rate and intelligent offensive movement, as well as his ability to either create space for teammates or make attacking runs into the area. Due to his vision and passing ability, he is also capable of dropping deep to link up play with midfielders, and of creating chances and providing assists for teammates, which has allowed him to be deployed as a supporting forward, as an attacking midfielder or as a winger throughout his career, in addition to his more common role as a centre-forward.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} {{psychologist}} J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism. Another study found creativity {{to be greater}} in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals {{were found to have}} much greater activation of their right prefrontal cortex. This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, <b>ambidexterity</b> is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals. Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{freshman}} season, Okafor {{was regarded as}} the second best college basketball prospect in the Chicago area behind Jabari Parker.

Prior to his sophomore season Dave Spahn of SLAM Magazine described Okafor as a player with the footwork and <b>ambidexterity</b> to dominate his opponents, placing him in the conversation for the role of best player in the national class of 2014. In August 2011, ESPN ranked him as the third best player in the class of 2014.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} written that Leonardo [...] "may be the most universally {{recognized}} left-handed artist of all time", a fact documented by numerous Renaissance authors, and manifested conspicuously in his drawing and handwriting. In his notebooks, he wrote in mirror image because of his left handedness (it was easier for him), and he was falsely {{accused of trying to}} protect his work. Early Italian connoisseurs were divided as to whether Leonardo also drew with his right hand.

[...] Tatum also displayed phenomenal independence of the hands and <b>ambidexterity,</b> which was particularly evident while improvising counterpoint.

2500|$|During the 1970s, calypso's {{popularity}} waned {{throughout the}} world, including the Caribbean. [...] Derivatives include an uptempo version of Calypso music called soca, and a hip-hop-influenced style called rapso both became popular in Trinidad and other islands. Soca {{was by the}} more influential in terms of international sales, since rapso's crossover appeal to mainstream tastes has been extremely limited. Old-time calypsonians and purists, however, preferred rapso's continuation of the lyrical <b>ambidexterity</b> that helped make calypso the world-famous, innovative art form it has become; many criticized soca's perceived watering-down of calypso, including veteran calypsonians such as Chalkdust, who asked: [...] "Are we to put water in the brandy, singing just two or three words [...] can understand and dance to?" [...] Indo-Trinidadians began popularising chutney music {{during the same time}} period. In the mid-1970s, artists like Sundar Popo made the music mainstream.|$|E

60|$|And herein, I think, we {{find the}} true answer to Charles Reade's mistaken notion of the {{advantages}} of <b>ambidexterity.</b> You couldn't make both hands do everything alike without a considerable loss of time, effort, efficiency, and convenience. Each hand learns to do its own work and to do it well; if you made it do the other hand's into the bargain, it would have a great deal more to learn, and we should find it difficult even then to prevent specialisation. We should have to make things deliberately different for the two hands--to have rights and lefts in everything, as we have them now in boots and gloves--or else one hand must inevitably gain the supremacy. Sword-handles, shears, surgical instruments, and hundreds of other things have to be made right-handed, while palettes and a few like subsidiary objects are adapted to the left; in each case for a perfectly sufficient reason. You can't upset all this without causing confusion. More than that, the division of labour thus brought about is certainly a gain to those who possess it: for if it were not so, the ambidextrous races would have beaten the dextro-sinistrals in the struggle for existence; whereas we know that the exact opposite has been the case. Man's special use of the right hand is one of his points of superiority to the brutes. If ever his right hand should forget its cunning, his supremacy would indeed begin to totter. Depend upon it, Nature is wiser than even Charles Reade. What she finds most useful in the long run must certainly have many good points to recommend it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ambidexterity</b> {{is often}} {{considered}} a capacity or skill and {{can therefore be}} facilitated by either the organization as a whole or managers / CEOs. From the structural ambidexterity's view, organizations can solve the paradox by temporarily cycling through periods of exploitation and periods of exploration. From the other point of view (contextual <b>ambidexterity),</b> firms ought to address exploitation and exploration simultaneously and internally to achieve the goal <b>ambidexterity.</b> Contextual <b>ambidexterity</b> {{is more difficult to}} achieve than structural <b>ambidexterity</b> because managing two inconsistent alignments within an organization simultaneously is far more complex than managing one consistent strategy after another. Thus most studies on how to build ambidextrous organizations in literature focused on contextual <b>ambidexterity</b> rather than structural <b>ambidexterity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Recently {{the focus}} on {{organizational}} <b>ambidexterity</b> has become more concentrated on how leaders act ambidextrously to achieve organizational <b>ambidexterity.</b> Senior managers {{may be the key}} for facilitating the context and social base for <b>ambidexterity.</b> Noting that ambidextrous organizations require significant amounts of mobilization, coordination, and integration activities to maintain both exploitation and exploration, informal and social integration of the senior team as well as the cross-functional interfaces of the formal organization contribute to the success of organizational <b>ambidexterity</b> significantly (Jansen, Tempelaar, van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2009). A recent model of <b>ambidexterity</b> and leadership suggests that CEOs and top management teams (TMT) play an integral role in establishing <b>ambidexterity</b> in small-to-medium-sized organizations (Cao, Simsek, & Zhang, 2010). The model suggests TMTs are where processes such as information sharing and knowledge processing, which influence <b>ambidexterity,</b> are likely to occur. Furthermore, it is the CEO who has the ability to access the most valuable and diverse information needed to avoid separation of explorative and exploitative behaviors. The greater the interface between TMTs and CEOs in small-to-medium-sized organizations, the greater the amount of <b>ambidexterity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Organizational <b>ambidexterity</b> can be {{considered}} primarily from two angles. One is architectural or structural <b>ambidexterity,</b> which uses dual organizational structures and strategies to differentiate efforts towards exploitation and exploration. Structural <b>ambidexterity</b> includes dual parts, with one part focusing on exploitation and the other focusing on exploration. It's {{also known as the}} spatial separation of the dual strategies concepts outlined above. The other approach is contextual <b>ambidexterity,</b> which uses behavioral and social means to integrate exploitation and exploration at the organizational unit level. Contextual <b>ambidexterity</b> is a balanced type that takes a mid-level position between exploitation and exploration, also known as parallel structures or hybrid strategies.|$|E
5000|$|A form of {{organizational}} <b>ambidexterity</b> that requires simultaneous attention to different resource categories {{with a view}} to their creative combination. The <b>ambidexterity</b> entails the balancing and integration of a range of resources in the bundling of competitive attributes.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>ambidexterity</b> {{can promote}} some other {{positive}} organizational outcomes besides innovation. It {{has been proved}} in literature that the interaction between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies (in other words, <b>ambidexterity)</b> is positively related to sales growth rate, and imbalance between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies is negatively related to sales growth rate (He & Wong, 2004). Various organizations {{have been able to}} overcome organizational challenges and become more innovative because of <b>ambidexterity.</b> A study looking at 41 businesses found that <b>ambidexterity</b> was highly correlated with performance. Similarly, another study of 34 high-tech organizations showed that their ability to simultaneously execute exploration and exploitation was associated with higher performance (Chandrasekaran et al. 2012).|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{controversy}} surrounding the possibility of organizational <b>ambidexterity,</b> {{it is likely to}} continue to be a highly researched concept in the future. Future research is likely to focus on the role of ambidextrous leaders, ambidextrous teams and the social context of organizational <b>ambidexterity.</b> (Rosing et al., 2011).|$|E
50|$|The {{functional}} {{definition of}} <b>ambidexterity</b> was originally {{used to describe}} organizations, but recently this concept was extended to multiple organizational levels, including individuals, teams, and leaders. On the most general level, the concept of <b>ambidexterity</b> implies successfully managing the dichotomy of explorative variability creation and exploitative variability reduction.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{earlier studies}} {{regarded}} the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation to be insurmountable, more {{recent research has}} paid attention {{to a range of}} organizational solutions to engender the existence of <b>ambidexterity.</b> One recent hot research topic in this area focused on the leadership characteristics that enable organizations to manage the contradictions that they face and achieve <b>ambidexterity,</b> which is the origin of the concept ‚Äòambidextrous leadership‚Äô. Several antecedents, outcomes of organizational <b>ambidexterity</b> as well as related moderators have also been identified in the existing literature. These topics are introduced in later sections.|$|E

50|$|Boundary {{conditions}} were also addressed on choosing between structural and contextual <b>ambidexterity.</b> For example, spatial separation was suggested {{as an appropriate}} solution for environments characterized by long periods of stability, disrupted by rare events of discontinuous change. Research also found that firms operating in dynamic competitive environments rely on contextual <b>ambidexterity</b> rather than developing spatially separated units (Jansen, van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2005).|$|E

50|$|<b>Ambidexterity</b> is when {{a person}} has {{approximately}} equal skill with both hands and/or {{both sides of the}} body. True <b>ambidexterity</b> is very rare. Although a small number of people can write competently with both hands and use both sides of their body well, even these people usually show preference for one side of their body over the other. However, this preference is not necessarily consistent for all activities. Some people may for example use their right hand for writing, and their left hand for playing racket sports and eating (see also: cross-dominance).|$|E

50|$|Organizational <b>ambidexterity</b> {{was defined}} as an organization's ability to be aligned and {{efficient}} in its management of today's business demands {{as well as being}} adaptive to changes in the environment at the same time. This term of organizational <b>ambidexterity</b> was first used by Duncan, however, it was March that had been credited for developing and generating greater interest in this concept, especially in the late 20th and early 21st century. <b>Ambidexterity</b> in an organization is achieved by balancing exploration and exploitation, which allows the organization to be creative and adaptable, while also continuing to rely on more traditional, proven methods of business. Exploration includes things such as search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery or innovation, whereas exploitation includes such things as refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, and execution. Companies that focus only on exploration face the risk of wasting resources on ideas that may not prove useful or never be developed. On the other hand, companies that focus only on exploitation may accept status quo performance and products and fail to reach optimal levels of success.|$|E

50|$|Although both angles {{are related}} to the theme of {{organizational}} <b>ambidexterity,</b> they strongly differ in the way how they are configured. There has always been a debate of which of the two different approaches is right. The dual type allows both discrete orientations and fit across dimensions at the unit level but creates a misfit between organizational units. Some researchers argued that inconsistent structures may lead to low performance. There are also some researchers trying to investigate the external and internal contingencies under which different configurations can be found. One factor would be the speed and type of technological change that organizations confront. On the other hand, the balanced type (i.e. contextual <b>ambidexterity)</b> is consistent with the systems approach of fit across multiple dimensions, but contradicts the opinion that organizational choice is discrete. In an environment where changes are slow, there will be sufficient time to react to the radical changes by constructing dual structures and strategies. However, in a high-competitive environment, balanced structures may be better prepared to deal with the constant need for alignment. In future studies, the different organizational <b>ambidexterity</b> configurations can be compared to find a better solution for dealing with the exploitation and exploration paradox.|$|E
