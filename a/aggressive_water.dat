Depending {{on the ground}} layers from which groundwater is extracted, groundwater is characterized as <b>aggressive</b> <b>water.</b> The disadvantage of <b>aggressive</b> <b>water</b> {{is its ability to}} cause corrosion of metal pipelines and cement bound materials. In drinking water practice this water type is conditioned by means of air stripping, dosing of hydroxides or filtration through carbonate rich media. Currently the drinking water company SWM in Suriname suffers from water quality problems regarding low pH and occasionally low hardness and low alkalinity. These water quality problems are observed at pumping stations with aggressive raw water. Despite the conditioning of the aggressive groundwater by means of shell filtration, the drinking water quality does not satisfy the National Drinking Water Standards and VEWIN recommendations. It is noticed that in Suriname there are no strict guidelines for the water quality of drinking water and for the treatment of aggressive groundwater. Due to the fact that shells are also used for many other purposes such as the improvement and neutralization of acidic agricultural grounds, the shell provision is threatened to run out in the long term. Therefore it is important that alternative materials are found for shells.

Recent efforts have consolidated the fuel storage systems and L-Basin has become the SRS site for wet storage of spent nuclear fuels. Corrosion surveillance of coupons in this basin is being performed to provide assurance of safe storage of spent fuel. This paper describes the highlights of recent studies on these aluminum coupons after immersion for more than 7 years in L-Basin. Selected coupons were metallurgically characterized to establish the existence of general corrosion and pitting.

40|$|The {{largest oil}} {{production}} field in Venezuela {{is located in}} the Maracaibo lake, where 900, 000 barrels are extracted daily. As part of the production system there exist 20, 000 kilometers of underwater pipes, which transport crude oil, natural gas, and water among thousands of production platforms. One important problem faced in the maintenance of this complex system of pipes is the wall thickness loss caused by corrosion and/or erosion from the inside of the pipes [1]. Even though the occurrence of these two phenomena have been somehow reduced in the last five years, the problem of monitoring the wall thickness still remains. In this regard, the pipes at the Maracaibo lake present a unique condition that is not share by any other piping system in the international oil industry: the pipes are coated with thick layers of polyethylene or vulcanized neoprene, depending on their location or their depth below the lake level, in order to avoid external corrosion caused by the highly <b>aggressive</b> <b>waters</b> of the lake. Although, ultrasonic underwater inspection systems have been applied in the offshore oil industry for many years to inspect platform structures and piping systems, an ultrasonic inspection procedure capable to inspect underwater piping system covered with thick coatings of polyethylene or neoprene has not yet been developed.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the uses}} of {{reinforced}} concrete pipes (RCPs) is the distribution of <b>aggressive</b> <b>water</b> in industrial systems, for example, in water-cooling systems of nuclear power plants. Some of them carry seawater and can deteriorate with time because of internal corrosion. Because of the low O(2) content of <b>aggressive</b> <b>water,</b> slow corrosion is expected for such applications. If the RCPs are not periodically replaced, they will eventually fail. Replacement strategies for these pipes depend on (1) {{the risks associated with}} the failure of the water distribution network, and (2) the costs associated with replacing the pipes, including the removal of existing pipes, installation of new pipes, and associated production losses. Because of the lack of statistical data regarding RCP failure, the development of a risk-based replacement strategy is not an easy task. This article demonstrates how predictive models for the evolution of the failure of RCPs and the associated consequences of failure can be used to develop risk-based replacement strategies for RCPs. An application for the replacement strategies of a network modeled as a system consisting of 228 RCPs is presented as a case study.

40|$|Streams that drain from non-karstic {{surfaces}} tend to {{have great}} discharge fluctuations and low concentrations of dissolved solids. Where these streams encounter karstic rocks they can form caves with hydraulic and chemical dynamics quite different from those fed by autogenic recharge (e. g. through dolines). In either case, caves form only along those paths in which the discharge can increase with time. Only a few favorable paths achieve this goal, while the others stagnate with small and diminishing enlargement rates. Caves in carbonate rocks that are fed by allogenic streams have a relatively short inception period, after which the mean-annual rate of dissolutional wall retreat is typically about 0. 01 cm/yr. Most of the annual growth takes place during a few major floods that occupy {{only a small fraction}} of the year. Local growth rates can be enhanced by abrasion from sediment. During floods, highly <b>aggressive</b> <b>water</b> is delivered rapidly to points deep within the karst aquifer. As flood discharge increases, cave streams become ponded by constrictions caused by detrital sediment, insoluble beds, or collapse material. The head loss across a constriction varies with the fifth power of the diameter ratio under pipe-full conditions. Head loss also increases with the square of the discharge. Because the discharge during a flood rises by several orders of magnitude, the head loss across constrictions can increase enormously, causing water to fill parts of the cave under considerable pressure.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} the L-Basin Corrosion Surveillance Program for the fiscal year 2004. Test coupons were removed from the basin on February 12, 2004, shipped to Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), and visually examined in a contaminated laboratory hood. Selected coupons were metallurgically characterized to establish the extent of general corrosion and pitting. Pitting was observed on galvanically coupled and on intentionally creviced coupons, thus demonstrating that localized concentration cells were formed during the exposure period. In these cases, the susceptibility to pitting was not attributed to <b>aggressive</b> basin <b>water</b> chemistry but to localized conditions (intentional crevices and galvanic coupling) that allowed the development of oxygen and/or metal ion concentration cells that produced locally <b>aggressive</b> <b>waters.</b> General oxidation was also observed on all of the coupons with localized corrosion observed on some of the coupons. These coupons were not pretreated to produce a protective oxide layer prior to exposure in the basin water. Non-protected coupons are more susceptible to corrosion than fuel cladding which has developed a protective oxide layer from high temperature reactor operations. However, the oxide on spent nuclear fuel (SNF) stored in L-Basin is not necessarily in pristine condition. Some of the oxide may have spalled off or been mechanically damaged prior to arrival at SRS. These areas on the fuel cladding would have the same susceptibility to corrosion as the coupons. Current observations from the test coupons demonstrate that, even with rigorously controlled basin <b>water</b> chemistry, localized <b>aggressive</b> conditions can develop in intentional crevice and galvanic samples. These results do illustrate the potential for corrosion induced degradation and thus the importance of a routine surveillance program similar to that conducted on the Uruguay fuel and on the surveillance coupons stored in L-Basin and future in-service inspections proposed for additional SNF in L-Basin. The 2004 results are compared to previous results on coupons removed from SRS basins in fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. The extent of corrosion is correlated with sample and storage conditions as well as the water chemistry during the storage period. Coupon weight gains from 2004 coupons are similar to those from 2003. Oxides were removed from furniture rack coupons from 2003 and 2004 and comparable pit depths were found in the filler metal. Corrosion induced-degradation of the spent nuclear fuels stored in L-Basin could potentially impact the storage process by causing cladding penetration, exposing fuel core material, and allowing release of radionuclides to the basin waters. Such releases could potentially lead to high water activity levels which could impact fuel integrity and present problems in future fuel handling and transfer operations. However, the collective results (to date) of the coupon and water chemistry evaluations and Uruguay spent fuel inspections indicate that the fuel in the SRS storage basins has not experienced corrosion-induced degradation that will limit the time for interim storage in the basin waters. Continued surveillance and inspection is essential due to the potential for corrosion induced degradation. The next withdrawal of surveillance coupons from L-Basin occurred on March 29, 2005...|$|R

30|$|These {{findings}} can {{be explained}} by the geology of the study area, in particular the variation of the mineralogical composition of the bedrock from upstream to downstream. A similar impact of the bedrock composition to the water quality has been also described by Gamvroula et al. (2013). It is commonly known that the ionic composition of water is the result of several factors during water–rock interaction (Hamzaoui-Azaza et al. 2011). The water samples undersaturated with dolomite indicate that dolomite may also dissolve in this system, adding Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and HCO 3 − to the solution. Furthermore, the undersaturation by calcite indicates a chemically <b>aggressive</b> <b>water</b> able to dissolve limestone. As the water moves along the river, CO 2 is lost in such quantities that the SI for calcite shifts from an undersaturated to a saturated state (point 16) where water cannot dissolve limestone anymore and the calcite can precipitate to form secondary calcite (Hui et al. 2011; Sappa et al. 2012; Wanda et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|Karst {{aquifers}} evolve {{where the}} dissolution of soluble rocks causes the enlargement of discrete pathways along fractures or bedding planes, thus creating highly conductive solution conduits. To identify general interrelations between hydrogeological conditions and {{the properties of the}} evolving conduit systems the aperture-size frequency distributions resulting from generic models of conduit evolution are analysed. For this purpose, a process-based numerical model coupling flow and rock dissolution is employed. Initial protoconduits are represented by tubes with log-normally distributed aperture sizes with a mean &mu; 0 = 0. 5 mm for the logarithm of the diameters. Apertures are spatially uncorrelated and widen up to the metre range due to dissolution by chemically <b>aggressive</b> <b>waters.</b> Several examples of conduit development are examined focussing on influences of the initial heterogeneity and the available amount of recharge. If the available recharge is sufficiently high the evolving conduits compete for flow and those with large apertures and high hydraulic gradients attract more and more water. As a consequence, the positive feedback between increasing flow and dissolution causes the breakthrough of a conduit pathway connecting the recharge and discharge sides of the modelling domain. Under these competitive flow conditions dynamically stable bimodal aperture distributions are found to evolve, i. e. a certain percentage of tubes continues to be enlarged while the remaining tubes stay small-sized. The percentage of strongly widened tubes is found to be independent of the breakthrough time and decreases with increasing heterogeneity of the initial apertures and decreasing amount of available water. If the competition for flow is suppressed because the availability of water is strongly limited breakthrough of a conduit pathway is inhibited and the conduit pathways widen very slowly. The resulting aperture distributions are found to be unimodal covering some orders of magnitudes in size. Under these suppressed flow conditions the entire range of apertures continues to be enlarged. Hence, the number of tubes reaching aperture sizes in the order of centimetres or decimetres continues to increase with time and in the long term may exceed the number of large-sized tubes evolving under competitive flow conditions. This suggests that conduit development under suppressed flow conditions may significantly enhance the permeability of the formation, e. g. in deep-seated carbonate settings...|$|R

Besides, several water chemistry parameters influencing corrosion or scale formation are not considered in the calculation of the indexes.

The lake's shoreline has been receding severely with no sign of recovery, which has been partly blamed on prolonged droughts. We use the lake basin's satellite-based gauge-adjusted climate record of the Standardized Precipitation Index data to demonstrate that the on-going shoreline retreat is not solely an artifact of prolonged droughts alone. Drastic changes to lake health are primarily consequences of <b>aggressive</b> regional <b>water</b> resources development plans, intensive agricultural activities, anthropogenic changes to the system, and upstream competition over water. This commentary is a call for action to both develop sustainable restoration ideas and to put new visions and strategies into practice before Lake Urmia falls victim to the Aral Sea syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The {{progression}} of corrosion loss and maximum pit depth, once initiated, is of much interest for predicting the future or remaining long-term life for steel infrastructure {{systems such as}} nuclear waste disposal storages and offshore pipelines. These often operate under adverse environmental exposures, including seawater or <b>aggressive</b> ground <b>waters.</b> Failure can have substantial economic and environmental consequences. The model widely used for the prediction of long-term corrosion is the strictly concave power law function. However, it is inconsistent with many longer-term empirical field observations for corrosion loss and for maximum pit depth. These often exhibit a monotonic bi-modal trend. Earlier it was proposed {{that this may be}} due in part to microbiological influences. Herein an experiment is described in which mild steel coupons were exposed for 2. 5 years to natural seawater and also, separately, to sterilised seawater. It was found that coupons in both streams exhibited the bi-modal behaviour. It is proposed that the bi-modal phenomenon largely {{is the result of a}} change in the nature of the corrosion reactions as the rust layers deposited on the exterior surface of the steel become increasingly less permeable, particularly to oxygen and that eventually hydrogen evolution and diffusion becomes the rate controlling mechanism...|$|R
