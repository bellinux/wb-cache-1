This function is particularly critical when pilots have to recall series of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>instructions.</b> However, working memory limitations may jeopardize flight safety. Since the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) method seems promising for assessing working memory load, our objective is to implement an on-line fNIRS-based inference system that integrates two complementary estimators. The first estimator is a real-time state estimation MACD-based algorithm dedicated to identifying the pilot’s instantaneous mental state (not-on-task vs. on-task). It {{does not require a}} calibration process to perform its estimation. The second estimator is an on-line SVM-based classifier that is able to discriminate task difficulty (low working memory load vs. high working memory load). These two estimators were tested with 19 pilots who were placed in a realistic flight simulator and were asked to recall <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>instructions.</b> We found that the estimated pilot’s mental state matched significantly better than chance with the pilot’s real state (62 % global accuracy, 58 % specificity, and 72 % sensitivity). The second estimator, dedicated to assessing single trial working memory loads, led to 80 % classification accuracy, 72 % specificity, and 89 % sensitivity. These two estimators establish reusable blocks for further fNIRS-based passive brain computer interface development...|$|R

40|$|Working {{memory is}} a key {{executive}} function for operating aircraft, especially when pilots have to recall series of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>instructions.</b> There {{is a need to}} implement tools to monitor working memory as its limitation may jeopardize flight safety. An innovative way to address this issue is to adopt a Neuroergonomics approach that merges knowledge and methods from Human Factors, System Engineering and Neuroscience. A challenge of great importance for Neuroergonomics is to implement efficient brain imaging techniques to measure the brain at work and to design Brain Computer Interfaces. We used functional near infrared spectroscopy as it has been already successfully tested to measure working memory capacity in complex environment with <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers, pilots or unmanned vehicle operators. However, the extraction of relevant features from the raw signal in ecological environment is still a critical issue due to the complexity of implementing real-time signal processing techniques without a priori knowledge. We proposed to implement the Kalman filtering approach, a signal processing technique that is efficient when the dynamics of the signal can be modeled. We based our approach on the Boynton model of hemodynamic response. We conducted a first experiment with 9 participants involving a basic working memory task to estimate the noise covariances of the Kalman filter. We then conducted a more ecological experiment in our flight simulator with 18 pilots who interacted with <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controller instructions (two levels of difficulty). The data was processed with the same Kalman filter settings implemented in the first experiment. This filter was benchmarked with a classical pass-band IIR filter and a Moving Average Convergence Divergence filter. Statistical analysis revealed that the Kalman filter was the most efficient to separate the two levels of load, by increasing the observed effect size in prefrontal areas involved in working memory. In addition, the use of a Kalman filter increased the performance of the classification of working memory levels based on brain signal. The results suggest that Kalman filter is a suitable approach for real-time improvement of near infrared spectroscopy signal in ecological situations and the development of Brain Computer Interfaces...|$|R
40|$|If the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) {{identifies}} {{an imminent}} collision, it issues a Resolution Advisory (RA). The RA takes precedence of <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) <b>instructions</b> and the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controller should {{not interfere with}} the according collision avoidance manoeuvre. To date, the only source of information for the controller to know about the RA is the pilot report. However, pilot reports of RAs are often incomplete, delayed, incorrect or even missing. This introduces ambiguity about tasks and responsibilities of pilots and controllers. One option to address this problem consists in downlinking RAs for display at the controller working position (CWP). The present paper gives an overview of EUROCONTROL’s Feasibility of RA Downlink Study (FARADS) and describes the results of one of the experiments that have been conducted to determine the impact of RA downlink on the controller’s performance, situational awareness and workload. The results of the experiment point to operational benefits of RA downlink. Contradictory clearances to aircraft involved in an RA were exclusively observed in the absence of RA downlink. Controller’s recollection of RA events caused by pilot or controller error was superior if RA downlink was provided. Furthermore, there was no evidence for negative effects of RA downlink, such as cognitive tunnelling on the RA event and a lower ability to separate other traffic in the sector...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 47 - 48) Codeswitching - {{alternating between}} two languages - is commonly studied in social contexts. Switching in such casual situations {{has been shown}} to reduce cognitive load because the speaker may draw from the most accessible lexicon, syntax or semantic representation. The switching is subconscious and spontaneous rather than deliberate or cued as in cases of English for Specific Purposes (ESP), such as Aviation English. Codeswitching occurs under these very different circumstances during international and domestic flights involving non-native English speakers, as well as flight training and operations with deaf persons who use signed language. Additional cognitive resources are required to support codeswitching when it is demanded as only one lexicon suddenly becomes serviceable [...] though vocabulary, grammar and semantic interpretation from either language may interfere. Further, codeswitching between languages of different modalities (e. g. a signed language to a verbal language) does not produce the same behaviors as codeswitching between languages of the same modality, such as two spoken languages. Fifty-seven bilingual participants - 30 Spanish-English and 27 ASL-English - were engaged in several passive tasks in both English and their non-English language. Following each, they were asked to conduct a navigation task simulating compliance with English-based <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) <b>instructions.</b> A 2 x 2 mixed-measures factorial, measuring response times and error rates, was analyzed to investigate performance degradation on the navigation task when codeswitching, compared with the same participant's performance when not switching. Contrary to hypothesis, both groups actually performed better in the codeswitching condition, particularly the ASL group, suggesting a facilitation effect occurred, rather than a cost effect. Due to the passive nature of the established language tasks, it is likely the effects of codeswitching were not actually measured. Instead, {{it seems as if the}} effects of task-switching between multimodal tasks were measured, revealing a potential facilitation of spatial tasks for those fluent in a manual language, which hosts a spatial component...|$|R
40|$|At {{airports}} sustaining commercial operations, Runway Incursions, {{defined as}} the incorrect presence or manoeuvre of an aircraft, vehicle or person on a runway, constitute the most severe hazard to flight safety. In fact, the worst-ever accident in civil aviation to date, the collision of two Boeing B 747 s on Tenerife in March 1977 with 583 fatalities, {{was caused by a}} Runway Incursion. As early as 1986, a special investigation report of the National Transportation Safety Boards (NTSB), which is responsible for investigating aviation incidents and accidents in the USA, concluded that Human Factors issues and not technical malfunctions were the primary causal factors of Runway Incursions. This is remarkable, because although surface movement {{is one of the most}} challenging cockpit tasks, pilots are currently not supported by sophisticated assistance systems in this critical phase of flight, but still mainly rely on visual acquisition of their environment and <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) <b>instructions</b> conveyed via radio. The only mandatory additional equipment consists of paper charts, compass and Notices to Airmen (NOTAM). Consequently, the goal of this thesis is to investigate to what extent Runway Incursions can be attributed to an inadequate presentation or lack of required information on the flight deck, and how flight deck instrumentation will possibly have to be supplemented in order to increase safety in the airport environment. Following a scrutiny of current procedures for surface movement with respect to potential deficiencies, an in-depth analysis of 40 incidents and accidents is conducted to identify and categorize generic, recurring causal factors of Runway Incursions. Apart from several exceptions that can be attributed to incorrect ATC instructions or clearances, results clearly indicate that the investigated Runway Incursions were primarily caused by a lack of pilot situation awareness. The underlying reasons are a lack of suitable navigation aids, missing means of acquiring the surrounding traffic including potential conflicts, insufficient presentation of information on the airport operational environment (such as closed or restricted runways) or misunderstandings in the communication with ATC. In order to address these deficiencies, a holistic flight deck visualisation and warning concept based on Airport Moving Map (AMM) technology, an already commercially available database-driven electronic airport chart presentation, is developed in the frame of this thesis, integrating all of the information required for Runway Incursion avoidance in an intuitive fashion. In case the mere presentation of information is not sufficient to prevent a hazardous situation, e. g. due to the dynamics of an emerging traffic conflict, pilots are alerted in a manner consistent with current flight deck alerting systems. A prototypic realisation of the resulting onboard surveillance system is validated with airline pilots in field trials at Frankfurt and Prague airport, using a Navigation Test Vehicle, followed by a further evaluation campaign employing a Research Flight Simulator...|$|R
