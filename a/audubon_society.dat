5|$|He {{also served}} on the {{editorial}} boards of numerous prestigious scientific and professional journals. A lover of nature, bird watching, and botany from an early age, he was {{a founding member of}} the South Bend, Indiana chapter of the <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society,</b> and of both the first local chapter of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in New York, and the Conservancy's Indiana Chapter. He {{served on the}} Board of Governors of TNC from 1959 to 1965.|$|E
5|$|One of Paul's {{specialties}} was environmental law, and {{he represented}} the National <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society</b> in a late-1960s lawsuit to stop an airport from being {{constructed in the}} Florida Everglades, a protected region of subtropical wetlands. He also acted as a parks activist, protesting the removal of sidewalks designed by Brazilian architect Roberto Burle Marx. Paul {{played a major role}} in amending Miami's city code to block the construction of buildings within fifty feet of the shore.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the National <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society</b> has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may be due to loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E

5|$|Amid rainy weather, {{thousands}} of people attended the demonstration, gathering at a rally at Tom McCall Waterfront Park before marching 44 blocks of downtown Portland. Speakers included Earl Blumenauer, Suzanne Bonamici, and Elizabeth Steiner Hayward. Organizations that promoted the protest included the <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society</b> of Portland, Oregon Environmental Council, Oregon Health & Science University, and Xerces Society. Reporters noted organizers' attempts to create a political yet nonpartisan atmosphere, and participants' public criticism of Trump. The event featured activities for children and was described as having a family-friendly atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{colonies of}} Atlantic puffins provide an {{interesting}} spectacle for both bird watchers and tourists. For example, four thousand puffins nest {{each year on}} islands {{off the coast of}} Maine and visitors can view them from tour boats which operate during the summer months. There is a Project Puffin Visitor Centre in Rockland providing information on the birds and their lives, and on the other conservation projects being undertaken by the National <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society</b> who run the centre. Similar tours operate in Iceland, the Hebrides, and Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Plume {{harvesting}} {{became a}} dangerous business. The <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society</b> became {{concerned with the}} amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting. Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} {{population of}} brown and Peruvian pelicans {{is estimated at}} 650,000 birds, with around 250,000 in the United States and Caribbean, and 400,000 in Peru. The National <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society</b> estimates the global population of the brown pelican at 300,000. Numbers of brown pelican plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s, largely {{as a consequence of}} environmental DDT pollution, and the species was listed as endangered in the US in 1970. With restrictions on DDT use in the US from 1972, its population has recovered, and it was delisted in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984 stopped any further geothermal prospecting. Mono Basin {{was the first}} National Scenic Area in the United States. It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater {{and much of the}} northern half of the Mono Craters. Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society</b> and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from serious poisoning inflicted by the SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb (in From Russia, with Love) the MI6 agent James Bond is sent by his superior, M, on an undemanding {{mission to the}} British colony of Jamaica. He is instructed to investigate the disappearance of Commander John Strangways, the head of MI6's Station J in Kingston, and his secretary. Bond is briefed that Strangways had been investigating the activities of Doctor Julius No, a reclusive Chinese-German who lives on the fictional island of Crab Key and runs a guano mine. The island has a colony of roseate spoonbills at one end while local rumour is that a vicious dragon also lives there. The spoonbills are protected by the American National <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society,</b> two of whose representatives died when their plane crashed on No's airstrip.|$|E

50|$|In {{the midst}} of her career with the U.S. government, Shirley Briggs gained {{employment}} in the <b>Audubon</b> Naturalist <b>Society</b> in 1948, where she worked as an editor of The Wood Thrush, a periodical published by the organization. This periodical was later renamed The Atlantic Naturalist, of which Briggs became the editor in chief. Her work with the <b>Audubon</b> Naturalist <b>Society</b> entailed writing, photography, {{and other forms of}} art. Prior to her employment as an editor for the <b>Audubon</b> Naturalist <b>Society,</b> she had volunteered in its education and publication departments. Briggs was also a longtime teacher of courses on U.S. conservation philosophy and politics for the <b>Audubon</b> Naturalist <b>Society</b> and U.S. Department of Agriculture. Her contributions to the <b>Audubon</b> Naturalist <b>Society</b> resulted in her receiving the Paul Bartsch Award in 1972.|$|R
5|$|Among {{the most}} famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose {{paintings}} of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society.</b> Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2. The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led {{to the use of the}} term as a metaphor for a 'burden'. Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.|$|E
5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, the <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society</b> of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter is from Northampton, Massachusetts. His father, Tom, {{worked as}} a {{computer}} program analyst for the Department of Veterans Affairs, while his mother, Gail, served as an administrative assistant for the Massachusetts <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society.</b> In 1986, he enrolled at Rutgers University and graduated in 1990 {{with a degree in}} economics. In January 1991, he joined the Internal Revenue Service after completing government exams and tests. In November 1996, Carpenter met his future wife, Deborah, who was studying for a master's degree at Southern Connecticut State University and {{worked as a}} manager of a Fleet Bank branch in New Haven. They married in August 1998. At the time of his appearance on Millionaire, he was 31years old. When he revealed his profession as an IRS officer on Millionaire, Carpenter was playfully booed by the audience.|$|E

50|$|The Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary, {{which is}} the Massachusetts <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society’s</b> largest {{wildlife}} sanctuary, is located in Topsfield and Wenham, Massachusetts. Much of its 2800 acre landscape was created by a glacier 15,000 years ago.|$|R
5|$|Smith favored women's suffrage, {{and was an}} Episcopalian by religion. She was {{a member}} of the Chicago Woman's Club, Chickaming Country Club, North Side Branch Equal Suffrage League, and the <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society.</b> In 1897, she moved into the {{settlement}} house and lived there until 1924. At that time, she lived in the home of Mary Rozet Smith, where she remained until around 1934. Smith returned to Hull House as a resident until she retired in 1936, and was succeeded by her sister, Gertrude. For health reasons, at that time, Smith moved to Midland, Michigan, where she resided with a niece until her death on June 30, 1942 in Midland. She was buried in Annapolis, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The Sierra Club and the San Diego National <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society,</b> {{as well as}} {{some other}} groups, sued the FHWA, USACE, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to block the {{construction}} of the toll road over alleged breaches of the Endangered Species Act in October 2001; however, a San Diego judge sided with the contractor and the federal government in March 2003. The environmental concerns were resolved by the developer for $3.07 million and an agreement to work outside breeding times for the endangered species involved in May of that year; in return, the environmental groups agreed not to appeal the court decision. Some community groups also opposed the project.|$|E
5|$|Commercial logging {{had also}} been {{operating}} for years in the Trinity River country, {{but most of the}} timber produced was used locally. After World War II, logging greatly increased both due to high demand for housing domestically and abroad, and the introduction of more advanced technologies. In 1959 alone, loggers took 439 million board feet from Trinity County. The rate dropped after that, but logging continued at 200–300 million board feet per year well into the 1980s. Many logged areas were on steep mountains, and improper construction of roads and skid trails exposed slopes to erosion and landslides. In 1988 several environmentalist groups including the Wilderness Society, <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society</b> and Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, preventing the cutting of 18.4 million board feet of salvage lumber in an area with particularly high erosion risk. This generated pushback in the local timber industry, whose decline has partly been attributed to more stringent environmental regulations.|$|E
50|$|The Brooks Woodland Preserve {{is part of}} an area of over 3000 acre of {{protected}} opean space including The Trustees of the Reservation's North Common Meadow, Harvard University's Harvard Forest, and the Massachusetts <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society's</b> Rutland Brook Sanctuary.|$|R
50|$|Today, Sunny Hill {{is listed}} {{as part of the}} <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society's</b> Important Bird Areas Of Florida as a {{conservation}} easement along with Tall Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy, Horseshoe Plantation, Chemonie Plantation, Foshalee Plantation, and Woodfield Springs Plantation.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from these}} state-maintained trail networks, some nature-advocacy groups and other {{entities}} have defined their own [...] "trails" [...] (a notable example being the <b>Audubon</b> <b>Society's</b> Great River Birding Trail that spans the entire Mississippi River). These are not discussed here.|$|R
