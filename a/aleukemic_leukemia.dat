50|$|The patient {{suddenly}} {{starts to}} pee blood, {{and he goes}} into cardiac arrest. They manage to stabilize him, {{but he has no}} red or white cells and almost no platelets either. Foreman suggests <b>aleukemic</b> <b>leukemia</b> meaning the marrow wouldn't be making normal cells. House tells them to ablate the patient's bone marrow, despite the team's arguments that this could kill the patient. He faxes this information and information on the patient's condition to Taub and Thirteen for their opinions. They both are shown to ignore the fax. However, as Thirteen receives a message from the community clinic she applied to, she ignores it and looks at House's fax. Taub looks at the fax as he talks to a rather silly patient. They both call House as the team is about to ablate the patient's marrow.|$|E

40|$|<b>Aleukemic</b> <b>leukemia</b> cutis {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{characterized by}} the invasion of leukemic blasts into the skin before their appearance in the peripheral blood. Leukemia cutis usually occurs in patients with myeloid leukemia, especially the myelomonocytic and monocytic types of acute myeloblastic leukemia. We describe {{the case of a}} 62 -year-old woman with <b>aleukemic</b> <b>leukemia</b> cutis who developed Philadelphia-positive acute leukemia 1 month after skin involvement. Leukemic cells expressed both myeloid and B-cell lineage surface markers, and monoclonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain was detected by Southern blot analysis.

40|$|Leukemia cutis {{describes}} cutaneous lesions {{produced by}} infiltrates of leukemic cells. It usually manifests contemporaneously {{with the initial}} diagnosis of systemic leukemia, but may also precede or follow systemic leukemia. Most cases are associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Adult B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cutis is very rare. We report a 59 -year-old woman {{with a history of}} B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who relapsed with <b>aleukemic</b> lymphoblastic <b>leukemia</b> cutis. Lymphoglandular bodies were conspicuous on biopsy and may serve as a morphologic clue to lymphocytic differentiation while molecular and immunophenotypic studies are pending.

40|$|In up to 40 % of {{systemic}} mastocytosis (SM) cases, an associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease such as AML is diagnosed before, simultaneously with, {{or after the}} diagnosis of SM. A 40 -yr-old man was diagnosed with AML with t(8; 21) (q 22;q 22). Mast cells were not noted at diagnosis, but appeared as immature forms at relapse. After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), leukemic myeloblasts were not observed; however, neoplastic metachromatic blasts strikingly proliferated during the state of bone marrow aplasia, and finally, <b>aleukemic</b> mast cell <b>leukemia</b> developed. As the dis-ease progressed, we observed serial morphologic changes from immature mast cells with myeloblasts to only metachromatic blasts and atypical mast cells as mast cell leukemia; FISH analysis showed that the neoplastic mast cells originated from the same clone as the leukemic myeloblasts of AML.

40|$|<b>Aleukemic</b> <b>leukemia</b> cutis {{has always}} been a {{dermatological}} curiosity. It is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of skin by leukemic cells before their appearance in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. A 20 year old man had presented with nodular swelling on the scalp of 6 months duration along with cervical lymphadenopathy. Biopsy and immunohistochemistry revealed myeloid sarcoma. The initial presentation was aleukemic and repeated peripheral blood counts and marrow examinations were normal. However, the outcome was fatal within 3 months of diagnosis of cutaneous lesions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aleukemic</b> <b>leukemia</b> cutis (ALC), a {{discrete}} tumor of leukemic cells involving the skin, {{may be the}} first manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia, preceding the onset in marrow and blood by months and years. ALC is often difficult to diagnose and is associated with a dismal prognosis. A 63 -year-old male presented with nodular swellings on the face, a plaque extending over the right shoulder and multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes. The skin biopsy of the plaque lesion showed a diffuse neoplastic infiltration extending from the dermis to subcutaneous tissue with diffuse positivity for myeloperoxidase and focal positivity for CD 34 on immunohistochemical staining. The diagnosis was leukemia cutis. One month later, acute monocytic leukemia (FAB AML-M 5 b) was diagnosed. The patient died on the seventh month of diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cytopenia were {{recognized}} in three cats infected with feline leukemia virus. In one cat, marrow blast cells were increased in number, and {{a diagnosis of}} <b>aleukemic</b> <b>leukemia</b> was made. The disease progressed slowly for 3 ? 4 months before terminating in acute myelo-monocytic leukemia, recognized as a blast crisis in blood. In the other two cats, neutropenia and altered granulopoiesis in bone marrow preceded development of myeloid leukemia. Preleukemia and smoldering leukemia are terms used to describe a group of hematologic abnormalities that precede acute myeloid leukemia in man. The term preleukemia refers to patients with acquired chronic cytopenias who develop mye-loproliferative disorders (acute myeloid leukemia or myelomonocytic leukemia) months or years later [5]. These syndromes also are called hemopoietic dysplasias [27]. Laboratory abnormalities have dominated the clinical picture of preleukemia; anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurring singly or in various combi-nations {{have been the most}} common findings [29]. In none of these disorders is there an excess of leukemic blast cells in either the bone marrow or blood at the onset, and the conclusion that the condition was preleukemic can be made only in retrospec...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{describe}} some investigations which attempt to define the nature and incidence of naturally occurring leucocyte ag-glutinins. Agglutinins have been demonstrated in the sera of patients with acquired hemolytic anemia (1) and thrombocytopenic purpura (2, 3) and these have been distinguished from naturally occurring anti-red cell (4) and anti-platelet (5) agglutinins. Leucocyte agglutinins have been demonstrated in various clinical conditions including lupus erythe-matosus (6), <b>aleukemic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (6), pancyto-penia (6, 7), agranulocytosis due to pyramidon (8) and chronic neutropenia (9). Some have implicated these agglutinins as the causative fac-tors for the leukopenia in these diseases. Goudsmit and van Loghem (6) tested the sera of 100 healthy donors against type 0 white cells. They found weakly positive clumping reactions in 10 instances. Dausset, Nenna, and Brecy (10) studied the sera of 300 normal donors {{for the presence of}} agglutinins to compatible leucocyte suspensions and failed to demonstrate any. Daus-set (11) cited some unpublished experiments in collaboration with van Loghem in which combina-tions of 50 normal sera and 50 corresponding va-rieties of white cells were tested for leucocyte ag-glutination. They observed frequent but incon-stant agglutinations in the combinations which were incompatible for the ABO blood groups. Moe-schlin and Schmid (12) tested blood samples of 30 persons in 380 leucocyte serum combinations without regard for A, B and 0 blood groups. They noted leucocyte agglutination in 60 cases o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{highlight}} the orbital manifestations of {{acute myeloid leukemia}} {{and the role of}} peripheral blood smear in the diagnosis of these cases. A total of 12 patients who presented with proptosis and were subsequently diagnosed to have acute myeloid leukemia based on incision biopsy or peripheral blood smear were included in the study. Results A retrospective review of all cases of acute myeloid leukemia presenting to the Orbital clinic was performed. The age at presentation, gender, presenting features, duration of symptoms and fundus features were noted. In addition the temporal relationship of the orbital disease to the diagnosis of leukemia, laterality, location of the orbital mass, imaging features and the diagnostic tools used to diagnose leukemia were noted. The median age at presentation was 6 years. The male: female ratio was 0. 7 : 1. None of these patients had been diagnosed earlier as having acute myeloid leukemia. The presenting features included proptosis in all patients, orbital mass in 5 (41. 7 %), visual symptoms in 2 (16. 7 %) and subconjunctival hemorrhage in one patient (8. 3 %). A diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was established by incision biopsy in 4 patients, subsequently confirmed by peripheral blood smear testing and bone marrow biopsy in 2 patients which revealed the presence of systemic involvement. Imprint smears of the biopsy identified blasts in 2 of 4 cases. In 8 patients presenting with ocular manifestations, diagnosis was established by peripheral blood smear examination alone which revealed a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. Conclusion A peripheral blood smear should be performed in all cases of sudden onset proptosis or an orbital mass in children and young adults along with an orbital biopsy. It can always be complemented with a bone marrow biopsy especially in cases of <b>aleukemic</b> <b>leukemia</b> or when the blood smear is inconclusive. </p...|$|E
