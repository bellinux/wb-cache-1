40|$|Six {{adult male}} meat-type guinea pigs were {{subjected}} to three subsequent digestibility trials with 100 % alfalfa, 50 % alfalfa and 50 % sugar cane and 50 % alfalfa and 50 % concentrate. For each animal in each period, feed intakes were recorded and all faeces were collected and stored at - 20 degrees C until analysis. Feeds and faeces were analysed for dry matter, crude ash, crude protein, ether-extract, crude fibre and <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash.</b> Coefficients of apparent digestibility were calculated according to both the total collection method and the marker method with <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> as internal marker. The present study suggests that <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> is not valid as an internal marker when looking at differences between individuals, but might be useful to demonstrate differences between diets, albeit with lack of accuracy for estimating the absolute digestibility coefficients obtained through the total collection method. Sugar cane was slightly less digestible than alfalfa in meat-type guinea-pigs...|$|E

The samples were analyzed at several processing stages: wet unground (WU), dried unground (DU) and dried and sieved (DS). Partial least squares models were built, and the models for the analytes exhibited R- 2 > 0. 80, with the exceptions of rhamnose, arabinose, galactose, mannose and ash from all fractions, and the lignin content from the WU fraction, which were predicted poorly (R- 2 < 0. 70). There were some significant differences between the models for the main lignocellulosic components at the various stages of biomass. These results proved that NIR spectroscopy is useful for analysis at biorefineries, and it {{can be used as a}} faster and more economical alternative to the standard methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

An assay was carried out with the objective of measuring the coefficients of ileal apparent (CIAD) and standardized digestibility (CISD) of amino acids in meat and bone meal for swine using different markers. Eight crossbred barrows were equipped with T-cannulas in the distal ileum. Four animals received a free protein diet and another four received a diet containing meat and bone meal as the only protein source in the diet. The treatments consisted in evaluating the chromic oxide, <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> naturally occurring in the diet, cellulose and lignin as markers to determine the apparent and standardized digestibility of the amino acids contained in the meat and bone meal. All data were submitted to analysis of variance and means were compared using the Tukey test, with a significance of 5 %. The CIAD, obtained using chromic oxide as external marker, were lower (P< 0. 05) than those obtained when acid insoluble ash, lignin and cellulose were used as markers, observing differences for all the amino acids evaluated. Similarly, the CISD from all the studied amino acids were lower (P< 0. 05) when the chromic oxide was used for determining the indigestibility factor. It is concluded that chromic oxide used as a external marker, to determine the coefficients of apparent and standardized ileal digestibility of the amino acids of the meat and bone meal, is most appropriate than the acid insoluble ash naturally occurring in diets, lignin and cellulose.

40|$|Important to the {{evaluation}} of potential feed ingredients for inclusion in fish diets should be their digestibility and amino acid requirement so that feeds can be formulated on a digestible basis rather than a gross nutrient basis. This thesis established techniques for faecal collection, the validity of digestibility markers, it determined apparent digestibility coefficients for various novel feed ingredients, and it established the optimal lysine requirement for Argyrosomus japonicus, which was used to estimate each of the essential amino acid requirements by using the ideal protein concept. There {{were no significant differences}} in dry matter apparent digestibility coefficients when faeces were collected by stripping (77. 0 %), dissection (80. 1 %) or settlement (83. 5 %). Faecal collection by the settlement method produced the most reliable digestibility data. Apparent digestibility coefficients for dry matter, crude protein and energy calculated using <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> were higher (84. 0 %, 93. 2 % and 93. 0 %, respectively) than those using chromic oxide (55. 7 %, 79. 1 % and 78. 2 %) and titanium dioxide (58. 6 %, 79. 7 % and 80. 5 %). The magnitude of variation in digestibility coefficients obtained using <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> was always lower than that obtained with the other markers. Therefore, <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> was preferred as a dietary marker. Using the above protocol, protein and amino acid digestibility of some animal and plant protein ingredients were evaluated in a series of experiments. The first trial compared the apparent digestibility coefficients of some animal products included as single protein source in the test diets. Apparent protein digestibility values were 84. 5 %, 83. 8 %, 85. 8 % and 83. 1 % for fishmeal-prime, fishmeal-standard, poultry meal and pork meal, respectively. Apparent digestibility coefficients for poultry meal were comparable to those of fishmeal, which indicate its potential as a substitute for fishmeal in the diets of A. japonicus. The second trial determined the apparent coefficients of plant and animal protein sources included at 30 % into a practical reference diet (70 %). Apparent protein digestibility ranged from 92. 4 % in sunflower meal to 85. 5 % in corn gluten meal. Soybean meal is a promising feed ingredient in A. japonicus due to the high apparent digestibility of its protein (92. 0 %) and essential amino acid digestibility (mean average 91. 4 %). A fundamental assumption in fish feed formulation is that the digestibility of nutrients is additive, i. e., digestibility of a nutrient in one ingredient does not interact with the digestibility of the same nutrient in another ingredient. In the third trial, additivity of feed ingredients was tested using pork meal and poultry meal. The results indicate that the apparent digestibility coefficient of animal protein ingredients could be calculated from compound diets to accurately determine protein and amino acid digestibility in A. japonicus, and possibly other carnivorous fish species. Dietary essential amino acid requirements were determined for juvenile A. japonicus in two trials. A dose-response study was conducted using crystalline lysine to determine the optimal requirement of dietary lysine for A. japonicus. Optimal dietary lysine was estimated at 31. 7 g kg-¹ dry diet, corresponding to 73. 5 g kg-¹ of dietary protein, based on specific growth rate and broken-line segmented regression analyses. Dietary requirements for other essential amino acids ranged from 22 g kg-¹ (histidine) to 71 g kg-¹ (leucine) crude protein. The results of the present study provided a research tool that could be used to assess and verify the conclusions of earlier dietary work on A. japonicus and in further studies to develop least cost diet formulations for this species. The study also adds to the knowledge of the nutritional requirements of A. japonicus by providing information on the digestibility of plants and animal protein ingredients. It also contributes to future dietary research for this species because this study determines, for the first time, the most suitable methods for investigating the digestibility of raw materials for A. japonicus...|$|E

40|$|Ajisamat, an herb {{commonly}} {{used as an}} aphrodisiac in the Malaysian traditional medicine, corresponds to two different species from different families - Salacia macrophylla Blume, Celastraceae, and Prismatomeris glabra (Korth.) Valeton, Rubiaceae. Macromorphological inspection of the vegetative parts both plants reveals only a slight difference in {{the arrangement of the}} petioles. Microscopic investigation of the plants roots used as crude drugs revealed however distinctive anatomical features. Prismatic calcium oxalate crystals and banded paratracheal parenchyma are characteristics of S. macrophylla while P. glabradisplays an abundance as crystals. Other features such as vessels diameters and arrangements are also of diagnostic importance. Some of these characters were also identified in the powder of thes e plant materials and proposed for diagnostic purpose. The values for extraction of ethanol and water as well as total ash, <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash,</b> water-soluble ash and sulfated ash were determined for both plants. Phytochemical studies were carried out on hexane and chloroform extracts of S. macrophylla and methanolic extract of P. glabra. S. macrophylla was shown to contain highly oxidized pentacyclic triterpenes while P. glabra contains anthraquinones. The pharmacognostical and hytochemical information can be utilised as the identification tools for Salacia macrophylla and Prismatomeris glabr...|$|E
40|$|Croton echioides Baill., Euphorbiaceae, is a {{small tree}} found in Bahia, Northeastern Brazil. Its stem bark has been widely sold as an aphrodisiac and tonic, as a {{substitute}} for the roots of Ptychopetalum olacoides Benth. Olacaceae, the Amazon Muira Puama or Marapuama, and C. echioides is characterized as the "Northeastern Marapuama". This contribution describes a morphoanatomical analysis and pharmacognostic study of stem bark of this species. The stem has a thick cortex with compound starch grains and laticifers; a sclerenchymatic sheath which consists of brachysclereids with large crystals externally to the phloem, and abundant fiber in the secondary xylem, as the main features of the species. The data obtained for water content (9. 26 ± 0. 07 %), water-soluble extractives (3. 92 ± 0. 19 %), total ash (1. 24 ± 0. 06 %) and <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> (0. 16 ± 0. 01 %), together with the chromatographic profile obtained by TLC, contribute to the quality control and standardization for the plant drug. The pharmacological screening indicated LD 50 values above 500 mg/kg orally and equal to 500 mg/kg by the i. p. route, as well as some stimulant potential, depending on the dose...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{present study was to}} perform {{phytochemical}} screening and explore anti-inflammatory properties of Alangium salviifolium root extract. The Alangium salvifolium root was studied for phytochemical characteristics and thin layer chromatography (TLC) was studied. The percentage inhibition of carrageenan induced paw oedema was studied in rats. Alangium salvifolium root gave maximum extractive values of 6. 4 % w/w with Ethanol and the Loss on Drying value, total Ash value, <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash,</b> water soluble Ash values were within limits. The ethanol extract gave total solid content of 91. 96 % w/w. The extract gave positive tests for Phytosterols, Triterpenes, Flavonoids, Carbohydrates and Alkaloids. The extract was free from Glycosides, Saponins, Tannins, Proteins and Amino Acids. The TLC of Alangium salviifolium ethanolic extract was clearly developed with 5 % H 2 SO 4 in methanol as spraying agent and Chloroform: Methanol (8 : 2) solvent system. The Alangium salvifolium root gave significant per cent inhibition of the maximal paw Oedema in 6 h and very highly significant per cent inhibition of total paw Oedema during 6 h. This study revealed that Alangium salvifolium root has good anti-inflammatory actions when compared with Diclofenac sodium...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} ileal digestibility of {{amino acids}} in eight feed ingredients were determined using broilers and layers. The ingredients included three cereals (wheat, sorghum and maize), one cereal by-product (wheat middlings), three oilseed meals (canola, cottonseed and soybean meals) and one animal protein meal (meat and bone meal). Dietary protein in the assay diets was supplied solely by the test ingredient. All diets contained 20 g kg- 1 <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> as an indigestible marker, and each diet was offered ad libitum in mash form to five replicate pens of 42 -day-old broilers and 60 -week-old layers. The digestibility coefficients of most amino acids for wheat and sorghum were similar (P > 0. 05) in broilers and layers. The digestibility of most amino acids for maize was higher (P 0. 05) between broilers and layers. The influence of class of bird on digestibility in canola meal was variable. The digestibility of threonine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid and alanine were higher (P < 0. 05), {{and those of}} methionine, histidine and lysine were lower (P < 0. 05) in broilers compared to layers.

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} effects of a {{post-weaning}} water restriction on performance, nutrient digestibility, carcass traits and meat quality of 84 -day-old rabbits. A total of 1388 weaned rabbits (35 days) were randomly divided into two groups on the basis of BW and sex. The two groups were fed the same diets ad libitum both in the post-weaning (35 to 60 days) and fattening (61 to 84 days) periods. In the post-weaning period, one group (AL) also received drinking water ad libitum, whereas the other (WR) had a water restriction from 35 to 41 days 2 h/day; from 42 to 48 days 2. 5 h/day; from 49 to 55 days 3 h/day; and from 56 to 60 days 4 h/day. During the fattening period, both groups had water-free access. Individual live weights and feed intake per cage were recorded weekly for 32 cages randomly chosen per group (64 rabbits) to calculate the BW gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The apparent digestibility values of nutrients were measured using <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash.</b> Carcass data were collected from 16 rabbits (8 males and 8 females) per group selected for similar final BW in both groups.

40|$|In this experiment, {{methods of}} total fecal {{collection}} (TFC) and internal markers (<b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> - AIA, crude fiber - CF, and acid-detergent fiber - ADF) were compared for {{determination of the}} coefficients of apparent digestibility (CAD) for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), nitrogen-free extracts (NFE), and gross energy (GE) of commercial feline dry kibble for ocelots (Leopardus pardalis). Six adult animals, weighing 12. 45 ± 1. 37 kg, gradually received experimental kibble in their usual diet {{until the beginning of}} the experiment and were submitted to an adaptation period ten days prior to the collection period. CAD obtained by TFC, AIA, CF, and ADF were, respectively, 73. 7, 76. 83, 62. 01, and 46. 03 % for dry matter; 81. 9, 84. 8, 75. 8, and 63. 8 % for crude protein; 85, 86. 7, 78. 5, and 69. 1 % for ether extract; 78. 52, 79. 55, 69. 11, and 53. 04 % for nitrogen-free extracts; and 80. 5, 82. 2, 71. 4, and 58. 4 % for gross energy. The AIA method showed to be efficient in determining coefficients of apparent digestibility and may contribute to investigations on the digestibility of diets for wild felines. In comparison to the items of ocelot's usual diet, the kibble used in this paper provided an adequate nutritional supply with reduced daily costs per animal...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} ileal digestibility of {{amino acids}} in 7 feed ingredients was determined using broilers, layers, and roosters. The ingredients included 3 cereals (wheat, sorghum, and corn), 3 oilseed meals (canola, cottonseed, and soybean meals), and 1 animal protein meal (meat and bone meal). Dietary protein in the assay diets was supplied solely by the test ingredient. All diets contained 20 g/kg of <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> as an indigestible marker, and each diet was offered ad libitum in mash form to 5 replicate pens of broilers and layers, and 4 replicate pens of roosters. The digestibility coefficients of individual amino acids for wheat, corn, and sorghum were higher (P < 0. 05) in broilers than in layers and roosters. The digestibility of most amino acids for corn and sorghum was higher (P < 0. 05) in roosters {{compared with those}} in layers, whereas the digestibility for wheat in layers and roosters was similar. In general, the digestibility of amino acids in canola meal, cottonseed meal, and meat and bone meal was similar among the 3 classes of chickens. The digestibility of amino acids in soybean meal was higher (P < 0. 05) for layers compared with those for broilers and roosters but similar between broilers and roosters.

40|$|SUMMARY Transmission of Oesophagostomum dentatum and Trichuris suis was {{studied in}} outdoor reared pigs. Six {{farrowing}} paddocks were naturally contaminated in May to mid June 2001 by experimentally infected seeder pigs. Early July, 1 sow farrowed on each paddock and starting week 3 post partum (p. p.) the offspring was slaughtered serially every 2 weeks for recovery of O. dentatum and T. suis. Faeces was collected regularly for parasite egg counts and <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> (AIA) content {{as an indicator}} for geophagy. Weaning took place week 7 p. p. by removing the sow. Paddock infection levels were estimated in mid June (O. dentatum) and late November (O. dentatum and T. suis) using helminth naïve tracer pigs. Soil and vegetation samples were collected regularly. Despite a high initial contamination by the seeder pigs, O. dentatum paddock infectivity was negligible to low throughout the raising of the experimental piglets, which had a slow accumulation of nodular worms ending {{with a mean of}} 422 worms/pig week 19 p. p. As only few eggs developed to infectivity overall T. suis transmission was minimal. The first T. suis were recovered week 11 p. p. and the highest mean burden of 21 worms/pig was recorded week 19 p. p. The experimental pigs had high faecal levels of AIA though it was decreased from 53...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{and energy}} {{are two of}} the main {{limiting}} factors for sea urchin growth. However, the requirement of daily protein and energy to maximize gonadal production is still unknown. Paracentrotus lividus were fed three experimental diets: Ulva lactuca, Gracilaria conferta and a prepared diet for 2 months in the fall of 1999 and spring of 2000. Sea urchins from a laboratory-cultured population of equal age, weight and test diameter were used. Apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC%) for protein and energy, using <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> as a marker, were measured for all experimental diets. Apparent digestibility coefficients for protein was high (> 75 %) for all diets. Energy digestibility varied among the diets and was lowest for G. conferta (50 - 62 %). The three diets contained varying digestible protein (DP) to digestible energy (DE) ratios of 25, 26 and 12 mg kJ- 1 for U. lactuca, G. conferta and the prepared diet respectively. Digestible protein intake was similar for all treatments, but DE intake was greater for sea urchins fed the prepared diet in both seasons. As a result, the gonad production was significantly higher for urchins fed the prepared diet, suggesting that energy was limiting in the algal diets. Paracentrotus lividus spawned during the spring experiment, resulting in protein loss in all treatments. Protein loss was lowest in the sea urchins fed the prepared diet. Enhanced gonadal growth and gamete development of P. lividus resulted from the higher dietary energy content of the prepared diet...|$|E
