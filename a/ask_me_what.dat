500|$|The series {{features}} numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him {{a couple of things that}} have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E
500|$|With the {{new season}} of the J.League commencing in March 1995, Wenger set about {{assembling}} his squad and backroom staff. He hired former Valenciennes manager Boro Primorac, whom he had befriended during the match-fixing scandal, as his assistant. Alexandre Torres joined Nagoya after Wenger identified the defender by watching Brazilian football on the television, and the manager brought in Franck Durix and his former player Passi. Nagoya finished bottom of the J.League the season before Wenger's arrival, and continued their poor form into the following campaign, losing several matches in a row. In response to the situation, Wenger altered his managerial style, becoming less amicable with his players and openly questioning their desire. To boost morale, he took his squad to Versailles for their mid-season break, where they went through a rigorous, but creative, training regime. Players were expected to make decisions for themselves on the pitch, instead of relying on the manager; Wenger {{was reported to have}} shouted to his players [...] "Don't look at me to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> to do with the ball!" [...] and [...] "Decide for yourself! Why don't you think it out?" [...] One player who greatly benefited from Wenger's guidance was Dragan Stojković, a midfielder whose disciplinary record improved considerably.|$|E
500|$|Fuller was {{an early}} proponent of {{feminism}} and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical [...] "feminine" [...] roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, [...] "If you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> office women should fill, I reply—any... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office". She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women {{to be careful about}} marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, [...] "I wish woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty". By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: [...] "There is no wholly masculine man... no purely feminine" [...] but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the Minerva) and the [...] "lyrical" [...] or [...] "Femality" [...] side (the Muse). She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed men and women shared [...] "an angelic ministry", as she wrote, as well as Charles Fourier, who placed [...] "Woman on an entire equality with Man". Unlike several contemporary women writers, including [...] "Mrs. Sigourney" [...] and [...] "Mrs. Stowe", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as [...] "Margaret".|$|E

2500|$|Also, Gulen {{said in an}} {{interview}} with NPR: [...] "To this day, I have stood against all coups. My respect for the military aside, I have always been against interventions. ...If any one among those soldiers had called me and told me of their plan, I would tell them, 'You are committing murder.' ... If they <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> my final wish is, I would say the person [...] who caused all this suffering and oppressed thousands of innocents, I want to spit in his face." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Bolland {{wrote and}} drew the story [...] "An Innocent Guy" [...] for the {{anthology}} , in which an otherwise normal inhabitant of Gotham City documents his plan {{to carry out the}} ultimate perfect crime and assassinate the Dark Knight Detective. Drawing inspiration from a cover by Alex Toth, and intended as an homage to the Silver Age Batman, Bolland wrote in 2006 that [...] "If anyone were to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> is the thing I've done in my career that I'm most pleased with, it would be this." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, he {{received}} praise from Darlington's manager, David Hodgson, after reviewing {{a decision made}} during their FA Cup first round tie at home to Yeovil Town on 13 November 2004. [...] "Joslin ... admitted he was wrong to send [...] Close off in the closing stages", and rescinded the red card. Hodgson said: [...] "It's not often that a referee will admit {{he is in the}} wrong but he has and I think he deserves {{a lot of credit for}} that. He has taken it upon himself to ring me and <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> I saw. I told him and he agreed that he'd made a mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Compared by {{many music}} critics to the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds {{because of its}} {{inclusion}} of harmonies and orchestrated sounds, The Soft Bulletin also featured greater use of synthesizers, drum machines, sound effects and more studio manipulation. After this album was released, Coyne stated that, [...] "if someone was to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> instrument do I play, I would say the recording studio." [...] As the band considered an attempt to recreate this complex album live solely with additional musicians to be complex and expensive, they decided to tour as a three-piece and make extensive use of pre-recorded music to fill out those parts that were not performed live {{by the members of}} the band. Perhaps most notably, this led to the decision to have the drummer Drozd play primarily keyboards and guitar live instead of the drums. This, in turn, led to a decision to utilize video recordings and projections of Steven playing the drums for some of the band's older songs, so the band added Kliph Scurlock on drums and percussion, Drozd focused on guitars, keyboards, bass (when he plays bass, Ivins plays keyboards), drums and occasional vocals, when he sings, Coyne plays guitars, keyboards and theremin.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Reynolds {{released}} the album <b>Ask</b> <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> I Am and sang along with Dolly Parton in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. On March 15, 1978, Reynolds earned {{a star on}} the Hollywood Walk of Fame and built a dinner theatre in Jupiter, Florida followed by other franchise locations of the Reynolds Celebrity Dinner Theater including the Beacham Theater in Orlando. His celebrity was such that he drew not only big-name stars to appear in productions, but also to sell-out audiences. He sold the venue in the early 1990s, but a museum highlighting his career still operates nearby. From 1977 to 1981, Reynolds topped the Quigley Publications poll of movie exhibitors, who voted him the top box-office attraction in the country. Only Bing Crosby won the poll more consecutive years. Despite much success, Reynolds' finances expired, and he filed for bankruptcy, {{due in part to}} an extravagant lifestyle, a divorce from Loni Anderson and failed investments in some Florida restaurant chains in 1996. [...] The filing was under Chapter 11, from which Reynolds emerged two years later. Reynolds co-authored the children's book Barkley Unleashed A Pirate, a [...] "whimsical tale [...] illustrates the importance of perseverance, the wonders of friendship and the power of imagination". In 2002, he voiced Avery Carrington in [...]|$|E
