However, after demanding {{a share of the}} profits from the games, Lapensée disappeared from the sport in 1918, still aged under 20. There were a number of rumours: that she had died in the 1918 flu pandemic, that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that she had always been a draft dodging man, though none provided any credible evidence. A 1940 profile of her father refuted all those claims, detailing her as living as a woman in New York.|$|E

25|$|A day later, on Saturday, August 25, Rolling {{broke into}} the {{apartment}} where 18-year-old Christa Hoyt lived by prying open a sliding glass door with a KA-BAR knife and a screwdriver, {{but she was not}} home. He waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m. she entered the apartment and Rolling surprised her from behind, placing her in a choke-hold. After she had been subdued, he taped her mouth shut, bound her wrists together <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> into the bedroom, where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her face-down and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her heart.

25|$|At the {{penultimate}} {{level of}} the tower they meet the ghost of Keledon (Dwight Schultz), first captain of {{the company of the}} Westering Sun. He explains that Eldrith once served Baldur's Gate as its greatest general, fighting a crusade against the Black Horde. Upon successfully defending the city, she defied orders <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> army in pursuit of the retreating Horde. Trapping them in a ravine, they proved stronger than she had anticipated, and she sent word to the city for re-enforcements. The re-enforcements never came, and Eldrith's army was defeated, although she survived. Furious, she rallied her remaining soldiers to attack Baldur's Gate itself, but was again defeated. The city's soldiers then pursued her and her few remaining men to the Marshes of Chelimber where they were all killed. However, Eldrith's rage was such that she returned to life, bringing forth the Onyx Tower, which gave her access to the portals. Seeking revenge, she orchestrated the attacks against Baldur's Gate, and created a dark alliance between Xantam's guild, the drow, and Sess'sth's tribes.|$|E

A {{reluctant}} speaker, Corazon Aquino campaigned on behalf of her husband, {{and for the first time}} in her life delivered a political speech. In 1980, upon the intervention of U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Marcos allowed Senator Aquino and his family to leave for exile in the United States, where he sought medical treatment. The family settled in Boston, and Aquino would later call the next three years as the happiest days of her marriage and family life. On August 21, 1983, however, Ninoy ended his stay in the United States and returned without his family to the Philippines, only to be assassinated on a staircase leading to the tarmac of the Manila International Airport (now Ninoy Aquino International Airport or NAIA), which was later renamed in his honor (see Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.). Corazon Aquino returned to the Philippines a few days later <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> husband's funeral procession, in which more than two million people participated.|$|E
25|$|The couple faced another hurdle when Brenda {{wanted to}} publish {{an article about}} the alarm of her {{pregnancy}} but Dylan objected, arguing that it was very personal. Typical of their relationship, Brenda and Dylan were once again reconciled after another dispute. In addition, Brenda was the victim of an armed robbery at the Peach Pit. This scene shocked her a lot <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> to see a psychologist, Dylan helped her a lot when she began to have nightmares about this event. Things get more serious when Brenda {{spends a lot of time}} with Dylan without worrying about the limitations imposed by her parents. The latter invited her to a trip to Mexico and Brenda agrees, despite the formal prohibition of her father. The trip will be punctuated by a dispute and a passage at the customs where Brenda will realize that she does not have her passport and is therefore forced to phone her parents.

500|$|Dunn {{then moved}} {{onto the scene}} during the funeral, when the child trembled from seeing her mother's lips sewn shut. Described by her {{as one of the}} most troubling shots in {{mainstream}} music videos, the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother lying in her wake. The singer recalled in a 1991 interview with Vanity Fair, that she remembered that her mother's lips looked funny in the funeral. When she got closer, she saw that Madonna Sr's lips had been sewn together. This image of her mother had haunted Madonna for many years, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> to comment that she never could resolve her Electra complex. The singer further explained: ...|$|E
500|$|The planes {{scored three}} hits on Littorio, one hit on , {{and one on}} [...] Of the torpedoes that struck Littorio, two hit in the bow and one struck the stern; the stern hit {{destroyed}} the rudder and shock from the explosion damaged the ship's steering gear.

500|$|Davies had a {{reasonably}} quiet 2006 domestic season with both bat and ball. In four 50-over matches for Somerset she scored 34 runs {{at an average}} of 8.50, and took four wickets {{at an average of}} 33.75, taking a wicket in each match. Davies was again selected for the Super Fours, this time playing for the Emeralds.

Davies performed well for England A during a match against the touring Indian side, restricting the visitors to just fifteen runs off her ten overs, taking two wickets as she did so. [...] Opening both the batting and bowling for England in this match, she then added an unbeaten 27, albeit off 77 balls, to help England A secure victory via the Duckworth–Lewis method.

500|$|Jackson {{returned}} to the Capitals for {{the last half of}} the 2009/2010 season. The Capitals started an effort to re-sign Jackson, and in March 2011, she signed a contract for a million dollars to play in the WNBL. [...] This was the most an Australian woman had ever been offered to play for a domestic side in the country, with most of the top women earning only $50,000 a year. Despite returning to Australia and being present at every Capitals game, injuries prevented Jackson from playing in the 2012–13 NBDL season. For the 2013–14 season, the Capitals missed the deadline date to sign Jackson <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> to play in China instead. Jackson was signed for the Capitals' next two seasons, and expected to join the team in November 2014, after recovering from a hip surgery she went through in September. Jackson's return happened in December 19 against the Adelaide Lightning. Jackson managed to play five more games in the 2014–15 WNBL season, losing only one as she averaged 13 points and seven rebounds. [...] Still her physical ailments prevented Jackson from training with her teammates, and requiring weekly drainings of synovial fluid out of her knee. During a double-header road trip in Victoria, Jackson's knee gave in. A subsequent MRI scan showed further damage to her knee that required new surgeries, forcing Jackson to sit out the rest of the season. The Capitals released Jackson from her contract in January 2016.|$|E
