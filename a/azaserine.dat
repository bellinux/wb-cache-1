Human endothelial cells isolated from umbilical veins were exposed either to a high (30. 5 mmol/l) or low concentration of glucose (5. 5 mmol/l) for 4 days, followed by a stimulation with TNF-α (1 ng/ml, 24 h). The blockade of the rate-limiting enzyme glutamine:fructose- 6 -phosphate amidotransferase inhibited HBP flux and oxidative stress (generation of superoxide and peroxynitrite) under the hyperglycemic condition and prevented the synergistic stimulation of VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1 expression by hyperglycemia and TNF-α. In the cells cultured under a low-glucose condition when no increased HBP flux occurred, <b>azaserine</b> enhanced the manganese-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protein level and also inhibited the oxidative stress and the expression of VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1 in response to TNF-α. Moreover, the polyphenol resveratrol inhibited the oxidative stress and adhesion molecule expression and did not decrease the HBP flux under the hyperglycemia condition. In addition, in isolated rat aortas exposed to hyperglycemic buffer for 5 h when no significant HBP flux occurred, <b>azaserine</b> upregulated the MnSOD protein level and prevented decreased endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine.

Collectively, our results demonstrate that the metabolism of glutamine to glucosamine is necessary for the inhibition of endothelial NO generation by glutamine.

As expected, putative preneoplastic lesions were formed in the pancreata of the azaserine-treated but not in the control animals. The pancreata of control rats contained receptors for cholecystokinin, bombesin, somatostatin, secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide.

Low or absent c-Src immunoreactivity and c-Src tyrosine kinase activity were found in the pancreas of untreated control rats. Compared with these controls, c-Src protein immunoreactivity was increased in "normal" acinar cells and even more in putative preneoplastic atypical acinar cell nodules (AACN) after <b>azaserine</b> treatment. In contrast, more advanced (secondary transformed) acinar cell lesions demonstrated no c-Src immunoreactivity. Rats treated with <b>azaserine</b> showed a 7 -fold-higher c-Src tyrosine kinase activity in their pancreas. The level of c-Src tyrosine kinase activity correlated positively with the number of lesions in the pancreas, inasmuch as promotion of azaserine-initiated carcinogenesis by cerulein resulted in a more than 10 -fold {{increase in the number of}} AACN, which was accompanied by a 6 -fold increase in c-Src activity when compared with <b>azaserine</b> treatment alone. c-Src tyrosine kinase activity was responsible, on average, for 40 % of the total tyrosine kinase activity in the pancreatic homogenates and was predominantly found in the cytoskeletal subcellular fraction. Furthermore, the transformation from normal to preneoplastic pancreatic tissue in azaserine-treated rats was accompanied by a change in the localization of the c-Src protein.

40|$|SUMMARY We have {{previously}} shown that rats fed raw soya flour (RSF) {{for more than}} four months develop hyperplastic foci of pancreatic acinar cells, which undergo malignant change if feeding RSF is continued throughout the life of the animals. The tendency to undergo malignant change is augmented by the additional use of a genotoxic carcinogen such as <b>azaserine.</b> The present study has sought to examine the reversibility of the focal neoplastic change in the pancreas. Rats fed RSF for 24 weeks and then given a diet not containing soya flour (NSC) had a normal pancreas when killed after 60 weeks of study. When RSF was fed for only 36 weeks, however, some of the rats developed pancreatic cancer even though the diet had been switched to NSC. Similarly, while <b>azaserine</b> in the dose {{used in the present study}} does not produce pancreatic cancer in our strain of Wistar rats, coincident administration of RSF for 12 weeks (but not for six weeks) resulted in progression to pancreatic adenoma. Although change from RSF to NSC after 30 weeks resulted in rapid reduction in pancreatic weight and content of RNA, neoplastic foci persisted and became frankly malignant. We conclude that phenotypic reversion to normal of the RSF diet- and azaserine-treated rat pancreas is only possible if RSF alone is fed continuously for not more than about 24 weeks or six weeks if the rats have been exposed to a pancreatic initiating carcinogen. In our previous studies, we have shown that con-tinuous administration of a diet of raw soya flour (RSF) for up to two years stimulates abnormal growth of the rat pancreas with eventual neoplastic change. 12 We have also shown that a diet containing RSF potentiates the effect of pancreatic carcinogens such as <b>azaserine.</b> 34 The present study was undertaken to monitor aspects of the reversibility of the morphological changes produced in the pancreas by raw soya flour and <b>azaserine...</b>|$|E

In vivo, exclusively the δ-nitrogen of Gln is labeled in the cyanobacterium Microcystis firma when glutamate synthase is inhibited by <b>azaserine.</b> In contrast, the green alga Chlorella fusca is additionally capable of incorporating nitrogen into Glu, thus providing evidence for an anabolic function of glutamate dehydrogenase in this organism...|$|E
40|$|The {{level of}} {{asparagine}} synthetase {{is low in}} 10 -mm root tips from corn seedings (Zea mays W 64 × W 182 F) but relatively high in mature root sections taken 20 to 35 mm from the tip. When root tips are excised there is a marked increase in asparagine synthetase over a 5 -hour period. In mature root sections, on the other hand, the asparagine synthetase activity declines over the same 5 -hour period. The increase in the root tip is sensitive to cordycepin, 6 -methylpurine, and cycloheximide, which indicates that both RNA and protein synthesis {{are involved in the}} formation of asparagine synthetase in the root tip sections. The glutamine analogue <b>azaserine</b> also inhibits formation of the enzyme in root tips, as does glucose. The increase in the root tip is not sensitive to asparagine. Additions of glucose or asparagine have no effect on enzyme activity in extracts. When cycloheximide, <b>azaserine,</b> or glucose is added to the mature root sections there is no effect on recovered enzyme activity...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 143 - 154) Microfiche. xxi, 154 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmFive {{experiments were}} done {{to discern the}} involvement of de novo synthesis of purines on ovine corpus luteum (CL) function, and to establish a model for assessing the in vivo effects of purines on CL function. In order to identify specific purine involvements, the adenylic, guanylic, and inosinic biosynthesis pathways were isolated using the de novo synthesis pathway inhibitors hadacidin, mycophenolic acid, and <b>azaserine.</b> In three in vivo experiments, these treatments were delivered into the sheath surrounding the ovarian vascular pedicle (OVP) ipsilateral to the ovary bearing the corpus hemorrhagicum via an exteriorized indwelling catheter. Delivery of the drugs to the CL by uptake into the vasculature was confirmed indirectly by HPLC analysis of luteal AMP, IMP, and GMP levels. <b>Azaserine,</b> hadacidin, or mycophenolic acid, or these drugs plus replacement compounds (inosine, adenosine, or guanosine, respectively), were delivered in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) via the OVP catheter at 4 or 6 hour intervals over days 1 - 7 or 1 - 8 post-estrus. Daily jugular blood samples were taken over the treatment period and quantified for estradiol- 17 γ and progesterone by RIA. CL, collected on day 7 or 8 post-estrus, were dissociated, and luteal cell populations and live/dead ratios of luteal cells were noted. Augmented profiles of progesterone and estradiol- 17 γ were seen in ewes treated with 150 µg of <b>azaserine,</b> or mycophenolic acid, respectively, as compared to ewes treated with 500 µg {{of any of the}} drugs or controls. Estradiol- 17 γ and progesterone profiles for drug + replacement compound-treated animals were not different from control ewes. In vitro experiments involving incubation of luteal slices in PBS + luteinizing hormone (LH) with <b>azaserine</b> alone or combined with one of the pathway replacement compounds revealed that azaserine-treated luteal slices were able to produce progesterone levels that were not different from those produced either by controls, or adenosine-treated slices (amplifies LH-stimulated progesterone production). These data suggest that either a) the CL is less dependent on de novo synthesized purines than the readily available salvage pathway-derived purines, or that b) there may be a non-purinergic dependent second messenger system controlling biosynthesis of steroids in luteal cells...|$|E
40|$|An azaserine-resistant {{derivative}} of Escherichia coli B/UV, AZA/R 1, {{was found to}} carry a mutator gene. This gene, designated mutS 1, was mapped by means of conjugation and P 1 kc-mediated transduction. The mutS 1 gene was cotransduced with argB at a frequency of 2. 4 %; the gene order in this region of the chromosome is thy argB mutS 1. To determine whether a relationship commonly exists between <b>azaserine</b> resistance and the mutator property, 12 additional azaserine-resistant derivatives of B/UV were developed and tested for the mutator phenotype. None of the twelve was a mutator strain. The level of <b>azaserine</b> resistance was not increased over that of the recipient parent when mutS 1 was transduced to an azaserine-susceptible strain. Reversion studies indicated that mutS 1 induced adenosine-ribosylthymine to guanosine-cytidine and guanosine-cytidine to adenosine-ribosylthymine transitions. Because such mutational changes are suppressible with deoxynucleosides when induced by base analogues, {{an attempt was made}} to suppress the mutator activity of mutS 1 by the addition of deoxyribonucleosides to the medium. No suppression was found. Recombinants were prepared containing mutS 1 and the Treffers mutator gene of E. coli K- 12. The effect of the mutator genes appears to be additive...|$|E
40|$|Although {{angiogenesis}} {{is considered}} to be indispensable for continuous tumour growth, only very few studies have been published performing microvessel quantification during tumour progression. We mea- sured the tumour vascularity in different stages of rat pancreatic carcinogenesis induced by <b>azaserine</b> and promoted by raw soya flour-containing pancreatotrophic diet. Besides the tumour samples taken at 6 (atypical acinar cell nodules), 15 (adenomas) and 20 (localised adenocarcinomas) months after carcino- gen initiation, we also investigated 3 control groups: tumour-bearing host tissue of azaserine-treated rats and normal tissue of untreated rats kept on standard or pancreatotrophic diet. In contrast with the usual microvessel counting on hot spots, we determined microvascular surface density (SV) and volume den- sity (VV) by electron microscopic morphometry. There {{was no significant difference in}} these respect between the control groups. At month 6 after the <b>azaserine</b> induction SV and VV showed slight, non- significant decrease as compared to the host control. Both values remained unchanged until the 15 th month and increased significantly by the 20 th month. These results may indicate comparable growth rate of tumour and new microvessels in the premalignant stages of carcinogenesis while a more intense angio- genesis than tumour growth afterwards...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study, we studied {{the role of}} TRIB 3 in glucose-induced insulin resistance, and whether the {{induction}} of TRIB 3 by glucose is dependent upon the nutrient-sensing hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) known to mediate glucose toxicity in diabetes. In diabetic rats, TRIB 3 expression in skeletal muscle was increased after 10 days of hyperglycemia, both glycemia and muscle TRIB 3 were restored towards normal by insulin therapy. In L 6 myocytes, the induction of TRIB 3 by high glucose or glucosamine was reversible upon removal of these substrates. To assess the role of HBP in the induction of TRIB 3, we demonstrated that the ability of high glucose to augment TRIB 3 expression was prevented by <b>azaserine,</b> an inhibitor of GFAT which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the HBP pathway. TRIB 3 expression was also substantially stimulated by glucosamine which bypasses GFAT, accompanied by decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose transport rate, and both responses were not affected by <b>azaserine.</b> Further, knockdown of TRIB 3 inhibited, and TRIB 3 overexpression enhanced, the ability of both high glucose and glucosamine to induce insulin resistance. These data provide the mechanistic link between the HBP flux and insulin resistance, and poin...|$|E
40|$|The ureides, {{allantoin}} and allantoic acid, are {{the major}} nitrogenous substances transported within the xylem of N 2 -fixing soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr. cv Amsoy 71). The ureides accumulated in the cotyledons, roots and shoots of soybean seedlings inoculated with Rhizobium or grown {{in the presence of}} 10 millimolar nitrate. The patterns of activity for uricase and allantoinase, enzymes involved in ureide synthesis, were positively correlated with the accumulation of ureides in the roots and cotyledons. Allopurinol and <b>azaserine</b> inhibited ureide production in 3 -day-old cotyledons while no inhibition was observed in the roots. Incubation of 4 -day-old seedlings with [14 C]serine indicated that in the cotyledons ureides arose via de novo synthesis of purines. The source of ureides in both 3 - and 4 -day-old roots was probably the cotyledons. The inhibition of ureide accumulation by allopurinol but not <b>azaserine</b> in 8 -day-old cotyledons suggested that ureides in these older cotyledons arose via nucleotide breakdown. Incubation of 8 -day-old plants with [14 C]serine suggested that the roots had acquired the capability to synthesize ureides via de novo synthesis of purines. These data indicate that both de novo purine synthesis and nucleotide breakdown are involved in the production of ureides in young soybean seedlings...|$|E
