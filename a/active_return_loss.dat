40|$|Abstract—Uniplanar compact {{electromagnetic}} bandgap (UC-EBG) substrate {{has been proven}} {{to be an effective}} measure to reduce surface wave excitation in printed antenna geometries. This paper investigates the performance of a microstrip antenna phased array embedded in an UC-EBG substrate. The results show a reduction in mutual coupling between elements and provide a possible solution to the “blind spots ” problem in phased array applications with printed elements. A novel and efficient UC-EBG array configuration is proposed. A probe fed patch antenna phased array of 7 5 elements on a high dielectric constant substrate was designed, built and tested. Simulation and measurement results show improvement in the <b>active</b> <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> and active pattern of the array center element. The tradeoffs used to obtain optimum performance are discussed.

The measurements of S parameters (basically insertion <b>loss</b> and <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of the ports) were conducted in two steps. First, we measured the impedance match of the 3 -step circular-to-square waveguide transition using a circular waveguide-to coax adapter with a SMA probe in the place of the Multiple Injector Noise Source Assembly (MINSA) assembly shown in Fig.  2. A <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of about − 40  dB was found within 200  MHz of the proposed center frequency of 5  GHz. This <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> was accounted for as an additional calibration offset during the measurement of the overall <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of the OMT. Second, using the above measurement as a calibration offset, we obtained a <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> below − 30  dB for the entire OMT. The measurements for port 1 at 4.9, 5.0, and 5.1  GHz are plotted in Fig.  5 together with simulated profiles for the two possible polarization modes (labelled as S 11 and S 22). Similar <b>return</b> <b>losses</b> were obtained at the SMA probes of the rectangular waveguide-to-coax adapters labelled 10 in Fig.  2.

50|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). Unfortunately, there is no easy, non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, <b>return</b> <b>loss.</b> <b>Return</b> <b>loss</b> by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> with frequency. The minimum <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> so measured is called the structural <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> (SRL). SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. The measurement must also be carried out at all in-band frequencies to be significant. The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to quarter wave impedance transformer action.|$|R
