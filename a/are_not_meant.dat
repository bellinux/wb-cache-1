5|$|Yellowfang's Secret was {{released}} on 9 October 2012. It is a Super Edition about the former medicine cat of ThunderClan, Yellowfang and her life in ShadowClan. It follows Yellowfang as she first trains to be a warrior, then a medicine cat, as Sagewhisker tells her that her paws <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> for shedding blood. She decides to switch {{to the role of}} medicine cat instead because she can feel the injuries of all the other cats in ShadowClan. A few moons later she breaks the code of medicine cats when she gives birth to kits; as a result, she and her whole Clan are punished for her disloyalty to the code, as her only surviving kit, Brokenkit proves to be vicious, bloodthirsty, and driven only by ambition, qualities that his own father, Raggedstar, ignores. In the end, Yellowfang herself is cast out of ShadowClan to live as a rogue by her own kit, now having gone on to follow in his father's footsteps and become Brokenstar for a crime she did not commit.|$|E

For {{the sake of}} {{identification}} and particularly for travelling, almost 95 per cent of the monks are forced to seek a voter ID card. But they use it only for identification purpose and not for voting. As individuals, the monks may have political opinions, but these <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to be discussed in public.|$|E

Use of acyclovir therefore is not currently recommended for individuals with normal immune function.

25|$|Novelist Deborah Crombie {{uses the}} turmoil {{following}} the Stephen Lawrence murder as a flashback setting in her 2017 book, The Garden of Lamentations. The story includes {{police officers who}} were undercover {{on both sides of}} the protests, as well as widespread corruption for years afterward. Crombie includes an explanation of the murder in her Author's Note at the end of the book, but specifies that the rest of the characters <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to represent actual people.|$|E
25|$|By reading Bradstreet's {{works and}} {{recognizing}} her intended audience, {{one can get}} an idea of how life was for Puritan women. According to U.S. History.org Puritan women were required to attend worship services, yet they could not to speak or offer prayer. Women were also not allowed to attend town meetings or be involved in the decisions that were discussed. If Puritan women were to be seen and not heard in public, then one can say that most of their works <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> for public consumption.|$|E

25|$|India {{currently}} has 10 remote sensing satellites in orbit. Though most <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to be dedicated military satellites, some have a spatial resolution of 1 metre or below {{which can be}} also used for military applications. Noteworthy satellites include the Technology Experiment Satellite (TES) which has a panchromatic camera (PAN) with a resolution of 1-metre, the RISAT-2 which is capable of imaging in all-weather conditions and has a resolution of one metre, the CARTOSAT-2, CARTOSAT-2A and CARTOSAT-2B which carries a panchromatic camera which has a resolution of 80 centimetres (black and white only).|$|E
25|$|In India and in Indian-Zoroastrian {{communities}} overseas, non-Zoroastrians {{are strictly}} prohibited from entering any space from which {{one could see}} the fire(s). While {{this is not a}} doctrinal requirement (that is, it is not an injunction specified in the Avesta or in the so-called Pahlavi texts), it has nonetheless developed as a tradition. It is, however, mentioned in a 16th-century Rivayat epistle (R. 65). In addition, entry into any part of the facility is sometimes reserved for Zoroastrians only. This then precludes the use of temple hall for public (also secular) functions. Zoroastrians insist, though, that these restrictions <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to offend non-Zoroastrians, and point to similar practices in other religions.|$|E
25|$|A genealogical DNA test {{examines}} the nucleotides at specific locations on a person's DNA for genetic genealogy purposes. The test results <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> {{to have any}} medical value; they are intended only to give genealogical information. Genealogical DNA tests generally involve comparing the results of living individuals to historic populations. The general procedure for taking a genealogical DNA test involves taking a painless cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab) at home and mailing the sample to a genetic genealogy laboratory for testing. Genetic testing results showing specific sub-Haplogroups of Q, R1 and C3b implies that the individuals ancestry is, in whole or in-part, indigenous to the Americas. If one's mtDNA belonged to specific sub-Haplogroups of, A, B, C, D or X2a, the implication {{would be that the}} individual's ancestry is, in whole or part, indigenous to the Americas.|$|E

25|$|Otonashi {{is asked}} to join the SSS by its founder and leader Yuri Nakamura. The SSS fight against Kanade Tachibana, also {{referred}} to as Angel, the student council president of the afterlife school whose responsibilities require her to suppress the team's disruptive activities. Although the SSS initially views Kanade as their enemy, Otonashi eventually befriends her and she joins the SSS. Following this, Otonashi begins helping the other SSS members overcome any regrets they had in life so they can move on. In the process, Otonashi grows closer to the other characters as he learns more about them. Although the story contains romantic plot lines between Otonashi and each of the heroines, the pasts and conflicts of the characters <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to simply enliven the romantic elements, but also provide a significance that goes beyond romance.|$|E
25|$|In this way, Wodiczko’s visual {{repertoire}} for his projections expanded {{beyond the}} body (ears, eyes, and hands {{as indicators of}} human sensibility) to include chains, missiles, tanks, coins, cameras, boots, swastikas, guns, candles, food baskets, and corporate logos. “In these projections,” writes Kathleen MacQueen, “the artist alternates between symbolic, iconic, and indexical images – the principal relations an image can have to its subject, according to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce – that is, predicated on a cultural reference, a physical resemblance, or a physical relation respectively. In many instances they scramble all relations: the hand, an index of the body – someone’s body – is also an iconic representation of communication that might symbolically represent an open or closed ideological position.” The reductive, visual signs monumentally-sized to fit the facades on which they are projected, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to read as logos for a political agenda, instead they suggest a perceptual contradiction to disrupt the kind of assumptions that beset the casual passerby.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of wine faults are detected by the nose and the distinctive aromas that they give off. However, the presence of some wine faults can be detected by visual and taste perceptions. For example, premature oxidation can be noticed by the yellowing and browning of the wine's color. The sign of gas bubbles in wines that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to be sparkling can {{be a sign of}} refermentation or malolactic fermentation happening in the bottle. Unusual breaks in the color of the wine could be a sign of excessive copper, iron or proteins that were not removed during fining or filtering. A wine with an unusual color for its variety or wine region could be a sign of excessive or insufficient maceration or as well as poor temperature controls during fermentation. Tactile clues of potential wine faults include the burning, acidic taste associated with volatile acidity that can make a wine seem out of balance.|$|E

25|$|Alice, Dowager Countess of Derby {{was also}} Dowager Viscountess Brackley. Her second husband Thomas Egerton, Lord Ellesmere, an eminent lawyer and Lord Chancellor of England, {{had died in}} 1617. But the Derby title was the one she {{preferred}} to be known by, {{and it is the}} one by which she is described on her funeral monument, which is surely one of the finest of its time anywhere in England. The mourning daughters beside the tomb <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to be lifelike representations of her actual daughters, Anne, Frances and Elizabeth; they conform to a stereotype often observed on grand monuments of this kind. But the figure of Alice Countess of Derby is probably closer to historical reality. She wears the coronet of a Countess, not a Viscountess, and at the foot of her tomb is a coroneted eagle, a reminder of the Stanleys' armorial crest. This commemorates their descent from the Lathoms, which was the foundation of their fortunes.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} {{experiences}} two separate flashbacks that reveal {{the true nature}} of the Origami Killer. The first takes place 34 years earlier, with two twin brothers playing in a construction site. One of the two, John Sheppard, falls into a broken pipe and gets his leg trapped, just as a rainstorm causes the pipe to begin filling with water. The second occurs shortly after, with John's brother running home to warn their father, only to find him too drunk to help. Scared and confused, the boy could only watch helplessly as his brother drowned. Thus, the Origami Killer was born: a killer who searches for a father willing to sacrifice himself. He kills his victims the same way his brother died. The boy turns out to be Scott; after he reached adulthood, he changed his surname to Shelby. His actions as an investigator <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to get justice for his victims; rather, he needed to collect the evidence of his crimes, which he burns in his office wastebasket.|$|E

Parker and Stone have always asserted that due to Cartman's actions and dialogue, his appearances in South Park <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to be viewed by younger children, and they note that the show is certified with TV ratings that indicate its intention for mature audiences.|$|E

500|$|For modern readers he is {{most famous}} for the Kitab al-I'tibar and his {{descriptions}} of life in Syria during the early crusades.

Since this style of literature, adab in Arabic, does not necessarily have to be factual, historians {{are quick to point out}} that Usama's historical material cannot always be trusted.

Production and visual effects staff collaborated under a difficult schedule and limited budget. The studio has used the technology Zoic's Environmental Unification System (Z.E.U.S.) for real time camera tracking, allowing for creative flexibility among the cast and crew, who work on a green screen stage. Andrew Orloff, Zoic's Executive Creative Director, commented [...] "Once Upon A Time is an amazing creative opportunity for Zoic.
