50|$|The {{legal system}} of Ireland {{grew out of}} the common law system of English law, and so Irish {{jurisprudence}} on blasphemy largely reflected that of England. The common law offence of blasphemous libel applied only to Christianity. Blasphemy could be committed by written or spoken words, by <b>pictures</b> <b>or</b> <b>gestures.</b> Profanity was generally regarded by legal scholars as synonymous with blasphemy. In 1328, Adam Duff O'Toole was burned alive in Dublin for alleged heresy and blasphemy. Initially tried under canon law, he was handed over to the civil power as a repeat offender. He {{was a member of the}} O'Toole family which launched Gaelic raids on the Anglo-Norman Pale, and modern historians regard the charges as politically motivated. In later times, the penalty for a first offence of blasphemous libel was an unlimited fine and imprisonment; for a second offence it was banishment. The Anglican Church of Ireland was the established church from 1536 to 1871. Whether the crime could be committed against a denomination other than the established church was unclear; John Kelly suggested not.|$|R
40|$|The early {{chapters}} of the book attempt to characterize the general notion of meaning, {{in terms of a}} relationship of 'appropriateness' between meaningful items (words, <b>pictures,</b> <b>gestures</b> <b>or</b> whatever) and, in the final analysis, a 'form of life'. Further chapters discuss the role of this idea of meaning in linguistics, the social sciences and the arts. A final chapter addresses the issue of 'the meaning of life'...|$|R
40|$|Literacy is {{a process}} that takes a longer period of time. During this process, an {{individual}} learns how to read and write. At the beginning, this process is unsystematic and becomes systematic upon entering school. School teachers apply different procedures and methods to teach literacy. One of such methods that are the most frequently used in special schools with programme for mentally retarded children is the so-called phonomimic literacy development method. This method derives from a whole (for example, a story or song) from which students learn to extract the sound in focus. A letter, associated with it, is learnt multisensory: with a <b>picture,</b> sound <b>or</b> <b>gesture.</b> Due to its multisensory approach, the phonomimic literacy development method is appropriate for various groups of students. It is especially suitable for students with difficulties in the area of thinking and perceiving. In my dissertation I gathered the existing material on phonomimic literacy development method, analysed it, and complemented with songs and composed songs for each phoneme or grapheme. ...|$|R

The function of figures like the bottom left was best described by Leon Battista Alberti almost a century earlier in 1435.

50|$|Libel {{is defined}} as {{defamation}} by written <b>or</b> printed words, <b>pictures,</b> <b>or</b> in any form other than by spoken words <b>or</b> <b>gestures.</b> The law of libel originated in the 17th century in England.

40|$|Infrastructure (SKI) is {{generally}} {{to connect the}} right users with the right knowledge at the right time. True [...] but let me add two critical parameters: {{the right amount of}} knowledge that must be conveyed, and [...] perhaps critically [...] at the right cost. The purpose of this note is to propose one user interface, an interface that is designed to optimally control floods of knowledge and allow their conversion into meaningful working knowledge. This interface serves as an organizer of knowledge for the users, the knowledge leaders, the IT personnel that need to support them, and the managers who must fund and evaluate the overall value of the Standard Knowledge Infrastructure. The users' first encounter with a knowledge infrastructure is with the interface. The interface is a set of signs that convey meaning, much like words, <b>pictures,</b> road signs, <b>or</b> <b>gestures</b> are signs. The signs of the interface, be they verbal or graphic, bridge between the user and the function...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAt present, it {{is largely}} unclear how the human brain optimally learns foreign languages. We {{investigated}} teaching strategies that utilize complementary information (“enrichment”), such as <b>pictures</b> [1] <b>or</b> <b>gestures</b> [2], to optimize vocabulary learning outcome. We found that learning while performing gestures was more efficient than the common practice of learning with pictures and that both enrichment strategies were better than learning without enrichment (“verbal learning”). We tested the prediction of an influential cognitive neuroscience theory that provides explanations for the beneficial behavioral effects of enrichment: the “multisensory learning theory” [3, 4] attributes the benefits of enrichment to recruitment of brain areas specialized in processing the enrichment. To test this prediction, we asked participants to translate auditorily presented foreign words during fMRI. Multivariate pattern classification allowed us to decode from the brain activity under which enrichment condition the vocabulary had been learned. The visual-object-sensitive lateral occipital complex (LOC) represented auditory words that had been learned with pictures. The biological motion superior temporal sulcus (bmSTS) and motor areas represented auditory words that had been learned with gestures. Importantly, brain activity in these specialized visual and motor brain areas correlated with behavioral performance. The cortical activation pattern found {{in the present study}} strongly supports the multisensory learning theory [3, 4] in contrast to alternative explanations. In addition, the results highlight the importance of learning foreign language vocabulary with enrichment, particularly with self-performed gestures...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted to}} describes important concepts involved in functional analysis of verbal behavior {{as well as to}} evaluates empirical research findings on acquisition of picture exchange-based vs. signed mands to suggest instructional implications for teachers and therapists to teach functional communication skills to children with autism. Research findings indicate that children with autism acquire picture exchange responses to mand for reinforcing items more easily and rapidly than signed responses. There is also a strong relation between motor imitation, matching skills and sign language acquisition. It is suggested that both motor imitation and matching skills be examined to teach manual signs to children with autism. Speech is the most common response form, but writing, typing, signs, <b>pictures,</b> <b>gestures,</b> <b>or</b> eye gaze should also be considered for manding. A decision making process is proposed to determine a proper communicative form considering abilities and environmental conditions of a child concerned...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{proposes to}} present and <b>analyse</b> the <b>pictures</b> <b>or</b> {{representations}} of Paris in Ernest Hemingway’s, Francis Scott Fitzgerald’s and Gertrude Stein’s different works. The theoretical {{framework of the}} piece is geocriticism by which the author attempts to discover how these works contributed to the literary construction of the French capital. The other objective of the essay is however to show {{the birth of a}} Parisian literary myth. After giving a brief overview of recent spatiality studies, the paper explains in-depth the geocritical method by the analysis of certain extracts of the different literary perceptions of Paris in the twenties, written by Francis Scott Fitzgerald (Babylon Revisited), Ernest Hemingway (A Moveable Feast) and Gertrude Stein (Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, Paris, France). The latter approach can help to shed some light on the reasons why these expatriates (American and British writers, artists) came to Paris {{in the first place and}} what attracted them so much. Later on, the paper explains that the artists of the Lost Generation were disoriented and aimless after the war, so they headed to Paris to find some ‘old’ values and rebuild their lifes. These authors found there a new and very inspirational atmosphere, new friends, new goals, they started interesting publishing initiatives and searched for their proper literary voices. In the meantime, by representing the always exciting and crowded Parisian life, they created a literary myth of Paris which considers the city as safe haven for artists and writers – saying that Paris is a never resting “moveable feast”...|$|R

40|$|Background: Spatial {{communication}} {{consists of}} both verbal spatial language and gesture. There has been minimal research investigating {{the use of}} spatial communication, and even less focussing on people with aphasia. Aims: The aims of this exploratory study were to describe the frequency and variability of spatial language and gesture use by three participants with aphasia in comparison to nine control participants. This included: 1) frequency of gestures; 2) types of gesture; 3) number of spatial descriptions described by gestures but no language; and 4) frequency and variety of locative prepositional, verb, and noun phrases. Methods & Procedures: Each participant was videoed undertaking 11 spatial communication tasks: four description tasks, and seven tasks involving directing the researcher in the placement of objects <b>or</b> <b>pictures.</b> <b>Gestures</b> and language produced were transcribed and analysed. Outcomes & Results: Participants with aphasia used significantly more gesture. Participants with aphasia also used more gesture without spoken phrases when spatial vocabulary was unavailable. Finally, there were differences between the participants {{with regards to the}} types of gesture that they used when they were unable to access language. Conclusion & Implications: The results suggest that the analysis of gesture produced by people with aphasia may provide insight into their underlying language impairment. As this was an exploratory study, with just three participants with aphasia, further research is needed...|$|R
