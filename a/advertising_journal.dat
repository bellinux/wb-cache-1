40|$|The {{question}} has been raised in academia whether there is global inclusion of authors in publishing. This has generally not been explored in the 30 years of research on advertising research activity and those works that do exist in advertising have generally only examined three North American focused journals. This paper expands the set of <b>journals</b> to five <b>advertising</b> focused <b>journals</b> and thus is a global examination of publishing in advertising. Within these five <b>advertising</b> <b>journals</b> there is an increased international involvement and thus it appears that a broader set of perspectives are being considered in the advertising literature.

Of the 5, 269 articles, 2, 856 were coded as research articles. Data were partitioned by replication approach to address the criticism that intrastudy replication is not true replication, and then were compared by decade and journal. When both intrastudy and the interstudy approaches were considered replication, 184, or 6. 4 percent, of the research articles were identified as replication studies, and replications were found to gradually increase over time and especially after 2000. However, the number of replications dropped to 84, or 2. 9 percent, of the journal research articles when intrastudy replications were excluded as replicative studies.

40|$|We analyze {{why some}} firms {{advertise}} product quality {{at a level}} different from the actual quality of a product. By considering the interacting effects of product quality and advertising, we develop a dynamic model of consumer expectations about product quality {{and the development of}} brand goodwill to determine the optimal values for the decision variables. The model parameters are determined based on prior literature and we use numerical techniques to arrive at the solution. We then derive conditions under which a firm will find it optimal to overstate or understate product quality. The results suggest that quality may be overstated in markets characterized by high price sensitivity, low quality sensitivity, low brand loyalty, and high source credibility, suggesting the need for vigilance on the part of consumers, upper level managers and regulatory authorities in such market conditions. This is important because current regulatory resources are insufficient to reduce deceptive advertising practices (Davis JJ. 1994. Ethics in advertising decision-making: implications for reducing the incidence of deceptive <b>advertising.</b> <b>Journal</b> of Consumer Affairs 28 : 380 - 402). Further, the law of deceptive advertising prohibits some advertising claims on the ground that they are likely to harm consumers or competitors (Preston IL, Richards JI. 1993. A role for consumer belief in FTC and Lanham Act deceptive advertising cases. American Business Law Journal 31 : 1 - 29). Also, Nagler (1993. Rather bait than switch: deceptive advertising with bounded consumer rationality. Journal of Public Economics 51 : 359 - 378) shows that deceptive advertising causes a net social welfare loss and a public policy effectively preventing deception will improve social welfare.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} how advertising pioneers {{endeavored to}} professionalize the advertising trade in Norway {{in the years}} 1914 - 1918. Professionalization is usually understood as a process whereby an occupation goes through a transformation to become a profession. I argue that the reform work of Norwegian advertising pioneers is a special case of professionalization. By interpreting the thoughts and intentions of these pioneers through the professional journal Romilla Revue I explain this professionalization as a dual process. Robert Millar {{was the leader of}} these pioneers as they strived to develop a group of advertising consultants who would enjoy a status in society that was similar to that of traditional professions such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, priests and architects. The advertising consultant was the product of the ideas of Millar, based on models of advertising experts in countries such as the U. S and Great Britain where the advertising trade was more advanced than in Norway. As such the advertising consultant was very much an imagined profession. There was no existing or coherent occupational group that claimed jurisdiction over this area of work. An occupational group of consultants had to created before it could claim professional status. Further, Millar and other pioneers worked to professionalize the advertising trade as a whole. This entailed a cooperation between the different parts of the advertising trade, such as advertising experts, advertisement agencies, newspapers, printers, writers, draftsmen and various businesses, to create a more effective and coherent advertising trade. The analytical chapters are divided according to what I have seen as different phases of professionalization. This includes the establishment of a professional journal, advertising clubs and associations, developing advertising education and the establishment of a control or licensing office, among other developments. 1914 marks the beginning of the process as both the first <b>advertising</b> <b>journal</b> and advertising club was established in Trondheim in this year. The reform work of the Norwegian pioneers was influenced by developments abroad, especially in the U. S. The period until 1918 was highly active in terms of organizing and exchange of ideas between advertising pioneers, of how reform could be implemented. From the end of 1918 followed a period of low activity due to consequences brought by the ending of the First World War among other factors. The War had significant implications for how the advertising trade developed, because of its impact on the Norwegian economy leading to a boom period {{and at the same time}} a period of high cost of living. I analyze how the two concepts of professionalization were connected and how the professionalization of the advertising trade as a whole was a premise for the professionalization of advertising consultants...|$|E

In the thematic analysis the work focusses on the volume of advertisements and specifically whether and when it rises (or drops). The textual analysis tries to record language and orthography norms as they evolved. The work is also focused on vocabulary changing and advertisers' active vocabulary. The corpus of researched material comes from years 1968 and 1988 of Lidová demokracie, always first week of March, June, September and December and the same months of Lidové noviny from years 1998 and 2008. Both journals can be paralleled because of their relatively comparable edition, number of readers and position on the newspaper market. On the basis of practical comparation of the analysis a demonstration of the line advertisement is made.
