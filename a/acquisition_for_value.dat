30|$|Typically, two b {{values are}} {{sufficient}} {{to generate the}} ADC map, which is reconstructed following acquisition of the scans [12]. More b values {{can be used to}} strengthen further the ADC map, but would incur a longer scanning time and a higher risk of patient movement during scanning and image misregistration. Crucially, for non-multidirectionally acquired sequences (such as HASTE), which require separate <b>acquisitions</b> <b>for</b> each b <b>value,</b> the measurement parameters and the slice positions for the various b values have to be identical (copy-referenced) to promote better image registration and generation of the ADC map. Getting the patient to co-operate by keeping still during DWI scanning is vital for achieving good slice registration and image quality.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether mergers and <b>acquisitions</b> create <b>value</b> <b>for</b> shareholders in the Athens Stock Exchange, during an extremely volatile period. The results indicate, on average, statistically insignificant investor reaction around merger announcements. However, further analysis suggests that investors react negatively to announcements by bidder {{firms in the}} food and fish farm sectors, and positively to announcements in the commercial/advertising and technology sectors. There is also evidence that information arrives at the market {{a few days before}} the official announcement. Contrary to earlier empirical evidence, insignificant returns are reported for target firms. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{contribute}} to the debate on whether stock-financed <b>acquisitions</b> destroy <b>value</b> <b>for</b> shareholders. A stock-financed acquisition is a joint takeover/equity-issue event. Using seasoned equity offering announcement returns, we estimate through linear prediction and propensity-score matching the share price drop that stock acquirers experience due to the financing choice. Net of this effect, stock-financed acquisitions are not value destructive, and the method of payment generally has no further explanatory power in the cross-section of acquirer returns. Our evidence is largely inconsistent with the agency costs of overvalued equity hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Acquisitions</b> <b>for</b> a <b>value</b> of {{approximately}} $ 2 trillion are conducted globally every {{year with the}} motives of i. e., enhanced market power and increased shareholder value. Despite the interest in acquisitions the failure rate on acquisitions in 2011 was estimated to 70 - 90 %. Thus researchers have called for further examination on acquisitions and especially on the acquisition process, and strategic fit and organizational fit, which is believed to facilitate {{the outcome of the}} acquisitions. The acquisition process is described as a linear process con- sisting of two sub processes, pre-acquisition and post-acquisition, that acquiring organiza- tions progress through step-wise. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine how the acquisition process and strategic fit and organizational fit can be handled to facilitate successful acquisitions. In order to get a deep and comprehensive understanding of the acquisitions process, the authors of this thesis have conducted a case study. The company, ITAB Shop Concept AB, has a background of 20 successful acquisitions, which have contributed to a steady growth in both turnover and share price. ITAB Shop Concept AB has been researched through in- depth interviews with key persons in the management, responsible <b>for</b> the <b>acquisitions</b> conducted. By adopting a dynamic approach to the acquisition process and taking an overall view of the strategic fit and organizational fit in each phase of the acquisition process, organiza- tions can understand and prevent the possible issues leading to failure. Furthermore organ- izations might benefit from having an <b>acquisition</b> process adapted <b>for</b> each <b>acquisition</b> tar- get. <b>For</b> example it is found that by conducting due-diligence in the post-acquisition pro- cess instead of the pre-acquisition process, and keeping the same persons in the acquisition team, more efficient use of resources and prior experience is facilitated. ...|$|R
30|$|Emerging {{research}} {{is beginning to}} show that managerial oversight enhances the relationship between firm acquisition experience and acquisition performance (Schijven et al. 2017). Two broad motives drive acquisition behavior: value enhancement and private interest. CEOs that pursue acquisitions and view them as opportunities to increase firm value tend to argue for synergies, access to superior information, and/or attempts to obtain market power. By contrast, personal interests such as increasing compensation, discretion, and bargaining power may also drive CEO acquisition decisions (Devers et al. 2013). Recent work shows that where there are strong internal and external governance mechanisms firms {{are more likely to}} have positive results from their acquisition experience because those governance mechanisms compel managers to use their <b>acquisition</b> experience <b>for</b> firm <b>value</b> enhancement (Schijven et al. 2017). As a result, firms should structure boards of directors that are independent of managerial influence, design CEO compensation that is heavily stock-based, and facilitate the presence of institutional investors as monitoring mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{focus of}} the research on mergers and acquisitions is the conditions under which <b>acquisitions</b> create <b>value</b> <b>for</b> the acquiring firm 2 ̆ 7 s shareholders. Given that the acquisition process is plagued by serious issues of information asymmetry, which are exacerbated in the context of knowledge acquisitions, we examine whether prior alliances with potential targets reduce the information asymmetry enough to create “partner-specific absorptive capacity” and yield superior stock returns on acquisition, compared with acquisitions not preceded by alliances. We test our hypotheses on a sample of high-technology acquisitions by U. S. firms during 1990 – 1998 using an event study methodology to assess abnormal stock returns. We find, unexpectedly, that no significant general effect emerges <b>for</b> <b>acquisitions</b> with prior alliances. However, international acquisitions following alliances show significantly better returns relative to both acquisitions without prior alliances and domestic acquisitions. Additionally, stronger forms of prior alliances lead to better acquisition performance than weaker forms of alliances. Together, the results broadly support our thesis that partner-specific absorptive capacity may be at work and suggest that under certain prior alliance conditions, acquisitions can indeed create <b>value</b> <b>for</b> acquirers...|$|R

This study examines the valuation consequences of 276 U.

40|$|Proceedings at comeThe ANTARES deep-sea {{neutrino}} {{telescope is}} located {{at a depth of}} 2475 m in the Mediterranean Sea, close to Toulon, France. The detector comprises a three dimensional array of 885 photomultipliers, distributed on twelve detection lines. It is designed to detect the Cherenkov light produced by neutrino-induced muons passing close to the detector. Since June 2008 the construction of the detector is completed. Calibration is a key issue in the reconstruction of the muon tracks, therefore several calibration systems are operated in the ANTARES telescope. A first system aims to measure the position of the Optical Modules with a precision of the order of 10 cm, by the mean of an acoustic system together with tilt-meters and compasses. A second system, made of LED beacons, performs the measurement of the arrival time of light with a precision of 0. 5 ns, which is the ultimate performance of the embedded electronics, the overall uncertainty being dominated by the PMT transit time spread (1. 3 ns) and the light scattering and chromatic dispersion in the water (2 ns). The charge calibration is made at the photo-electron (pe) level using dedicated data <b>acquisition</b> (<b>for</b> pedestals) and standard data <b>acquisition</b> (<b>for</b> 1 pe <b>value),</b> allowing an estimate of the integrated charge of the PMT pulses and an estimate of the effective thresholds, set at 1 / 3 pe. Moreover, statistical methods based on the muon tracks are currently being applied to check the calibration: for example, the Moon shadow observed on down-going events is a way to check the absolute pointing, as well as the operation of a floating surface detector in coincidence with ANTARES. On another hand, the study of reconstructed tracks themselves allows to check the time calibration. In this talk, these calibration systems and methods will be presented. Their impact on physics performances will also be discussed...|$|R
