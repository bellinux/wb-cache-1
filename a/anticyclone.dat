5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary <b>anticyclone</b> can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the <b>anticyclone,</b> a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking <b>anticyclone</b> or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|An upper-level <b>anticyclone</b> {{north of}} the system {{provided}} a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated {{for it to be}} considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby <b>anticyclone</b> moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade was due to the system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E

40|$|The {{causes of}} the {{seasonal}} cycles of the subtropical <b>anticyclones,</b> and the associated zonal asymmetries of sea surface temperature (SST) across the subtropical oceans, are examined. In all basins the cool waters {{in the east and}} warm waters in the west are sustained by a mix of atmosphere and ocean processes. When the <b>anticyclones</b> are best developed, during local summer, subsidence and equatorward advection on the eastern flanks of the <b>anticyclones</b> cool SSTs, while poleward flow on the western flanks warms SSTs. During local winter the SST asymmetry across the subtropical North Atlantic and North Pacific is maintained by warm water advection in the western boundary currents that offsets the large extraction of heat by advection of cold, dry air of the continents and by transient eddies. In the Southern Hemisphere ocean processes are equally important in cooling the eastern oceans by upwelling and advection during local winter. Ocean dynamics are important in amplifying the SST asymmetry, as experiments with general circulation models show. This amplification has little impact on the seasonal cycle of the <b>anticyclones</b> in the Northern Hemisphere, strengthens the <b>anticyclones</b> in the Southern Hemisphere, and helps position the <b>anticyclones</b> over the eastern basins in both hemispheres. Experiments with an idealized model are used to suggest that the subtropical <b>anticyclones</b> arise fundamentally as a response to monsoonal heating over land but need further amplification to bring them up to observed strength.

5|$|Hurricane Ginger {{originated}} in a cold-core upper-level low that persisted {{for several days}} in early September in the Western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level low was located within a large, persistent area of convection from the Gulf of Mexico through the central Atlantic, which resembled the Intertropical Convergence Zone but at a higher latitude. The convective feature was influenced by an <b>anticyclone</b> located over northern South America, which was opposite of the typical flow for September. The <b>anticyclone</b> also {{led to the formation}} of Hurricane Fern, Tropical Storm Heidi, and two tropical depressions.

5|$|A {{cold front}} moved southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong <b>anticyclone</b> {{developed}} behind the cold front, and on December 26 a trough extended southward {{from the cold}} front. The <b>anticyclone</b> moved southeastward as the trough and cold front moved eastward. The trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the trough as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1 °C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 31 while located 770miles (1245km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

50|$|The Mediterranean {{climate is}} characterised by dry summers and mild, rainy winters. They are {{generally}} {{located on the}} western sides of continents, between roughly 30 and 45 degrees {{north and south of}} the Equator. Mediterranean climate zones are typically associated with the five large subtropical high-pressure belts of the oceans: the Azores High, South Atlantic High, North Pacific High, South Pacific High, and Indian Ocean High. These high-pressure belts, called <b>anticyclones,</b> rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. <b>Anticyclones</b> cause air in the surrounding atmosphere to diverge and descend, sinking the air in opposing directions until there are no clouds present; leaving clear skies. Climatological high-pressure <b>anticyclones</b> migrate by latitude according to the direct angle of the Sun, shifting northward in the summer and toward the equator in the winter. These semi-permanent <b>anticyclones</b> {{play a major role in}} the formation of the world's subtropical and tropical deserts as well as the rainless summers associated with the Mediterranean climate.|$|R

5|$|Early on August 21, the JMA {{upgraded}} Bolaven to {{a severe}} tropical storm, with maximum estimated winds at 95km/h (60mph). Throughout the day, a large central dense overcast developed around the low-level circulation and banding features became more prominent, especially over the southern {{half of the}} storm. However, the northwestern quadrant of Bolaven struggled to organize as quickly due to moderate wind shear produced by a nearby upper-level <b>anticyclone.</b> Due to the improved structure, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded Bolaven to a typhoon during {{the latter half of}} August21. Gradual intensification ensued over the following days as the storm became increasingly organized. A second <b>anticyclone</b> developed over the center of Bolaven later that day and enhanced the cyclone's poleward outflow. Although subsidence and wind shear increased along the northern edge of the storm on August23, the system's outflow allowed it mitigate the negative effects ahead of it.|$|E
5|$|Moving on a west-northwest {{track at}} roughly 20 mph (30 km/h) early on September 22, the storm {{initially}} changed little in intensity. However, a large upper tropospheric <b>anticyclone</b> {{developed over the}} southern Atlantic coast, producing the favorable wind shear needed for tropical cyclone development. A second reconnaissance flight reported an intensifed tropical cyclone, indicating that the storm system had reached tropical storm strength. At 0000 UTC on September 23, the depression attained tropical storm strength, with maximum winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a central minimum pressure of 1013 mbar (hPa; 29.92 inHg). The US Weather Bureau issued their first advisory on the newly developed tropical storm at 1600 UTC later that day, giving the storm the name Helene. Despite the storm's poor organization, Helene gradually intensified in favorable conditions generated by the large <b>anticyclone.</b> Throughout the day, a second <b>anticyclone</b> moved eastward until it was situated off of the Mid-Atlantic states, while a mean trough in {{the lower levels of}} the atmosphere became situated over the United States East Coast. This would set up a path for Helene to pass very close to the United States. The tropical storm attained hurricane intensity by 2200 UTC on 2200 UTC on September 24, while located 425 mi (685 km) east of Fort Pierce, Florida. However, in post-season analysis, it was found that Helene reached hurricane intensity earlier that day, by 1200 UTC. At the time, gale-force winds extended up to 220 mi (355 km) out from the storm's center of circulation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>anticyclones</b> in Jupiter's {{atmosphere}} {{are always}} confined within zones, {{where the wind}} speed increases in direction from the equator to the poles. They are usually bright and appear as white ovals. They can move in longitude, but stay at approximately the same latitude as {{they are unable to}} escape from the confining zone. The wind speeds at their periphery are about 100 m/s. Different <b>anticyclones</b> located in one zone tend to merge, when they approach each other. However Jupiter has two <b>anticyclones</b> that are somewhat different from all others. They are the Great Red Spot (GRS) and the Oval BA; the latter formed only in 2000. In contrast to white ovals, these structures are red, arguably due to dredging up of red material from the planet's depths. On Jupiter the <b>anticyclones</b> usually form through merges of smaller structures including convective storms (see below), although large ovals can result from the instability of jets. The latter was observed in 1938-1940, when a few white ovals appeared as a result of instability of the southern temperate zone; they later merged to form Oval BA.|$|R

5|$|The season {{produced}} 13 named storms, {{slightly below}} {{the average of}} 15named storms per season. However, the season total of nine hurricanes was one above the average, and the total of six major hurricanes surpassed the average of three. Activity during the season was hindered by the northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The ITCZ, which is normally situated south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, shifted northward into Central and Southern Mexico, making the cyclone closer to cooler sea surface temperatures, hence {{limiting the number of}} storms that formed during the season. Although a semi-permanent <b>anticyclone</b> persisted through the summer of 1998, causing most of the storms to remain at sea, some storm did threaten the Baja California Peninsula due to a weakness in the <b>anticyclone.</b> Except for Hurricane Kay, all of the storms of the season originated from tropical waves.|$|E

40|$|Marine animals, such as turtles, seabirds and pelagic fishes, are {{observed}} {{to travel and}} congregate around eddies in the open ocean. Mesoscale eddies, large swirling ocean vortices with radius scales of approximately 50 - 100 km, provide environmental variability that can structure these populations. In this study, we investigate the use of mesoscale eddies by 24 individual juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence region. The influence of eddies on turtles is assessed by collocating the turtle trajectories to the tracks of mesoscale eddies identified in maps of sea level anomaly. Juvenile loggerhead sea turtles are {{significantly more likely to}} be located in the interiors of <b>anticyclones</b> in this region. The distribution of surface drifters in eddy interiors reveals no significant association with the interiors of cyclones or <b>anticyclones,</b> suggesting higher prevalence of turtles in <b>anticyclones</b> is a result of their behavior. In the southern portion of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence region, turtle swimming speed is significantly slower in the interiors of <b>anticyclones,</b> when compared to the periphery, suggesting that these turtles are possibly feeding on prey items associated with anomalously low near-surface chlorophyll concentrations observed in those features...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims at {{analysing}} {{the impact}} of oceanic turbulence and air-sea interactions on the sea surface temperature (SST) of the extra-tropical oceans on spatial scales {{of a few hundred}} kilometres (the so-called "mesoscale"). Using satellite-based measurements of SST and sea level, as well as surface tracks of mesoscale oceanic cyclones and <b>anticyclones,</b> it is shown that turbulence does not transport heat through systematic motions of cold cyclones and warm <b>anticyclones,</b> as was previously thought in regions of strong mean flows like the Gulf Stream. Rather, it is suggested that heat is transported {{as a result of the}} slight phase shift between temperature and pressure fluctuations developing on the mean flow. In addition, tentative estimates of the rate at which air-sea heat fluxes damp the SST signatures of cyclones and <b>anticyclones</b> are provided. The weak values obtained (20 W/m 2 K) contrast sharply with theoretical expectations, but are in agreement with the observed long-lived thermal heat content anomalies associated with the cyclones and <b>anticyclones.</b> These observations provide important benchmarks for high-resolution ocean models and may moreover guide the parametrization of subgrid-scale heat transport in climate models.

40|$|The most {{striking}} shortcomings of previous 1000 -mb. forecast {{models have been}} over-intensification of pressure systems, especially <b>anticyclones,</b> and inferior predictions in and near mountains. In this article a graphical-numerical two-level prediction model that incorporates a variable mean stability is developed and tested. When the mean stability is small, the 1000 -mb. prediction is determined primarily by the 500 -mb. steering and height changes. As the stability increases the 500 -mb. control decreases and the effective mountain wind exerts {{more control over the}} 1000 -mb. changes. Since the stability is generally larger in <b>anticyclones</b> than cyclones thc <b>anticyclones</b> are steered by a smaller percentage of the 500 -mb. wind and are more influenced by the mountain topography.

5|$|Hurricane Edith rapidly {{weakened}} {{over the}} mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18 hours after it made landfall, it emerged into the Gulf of Honduras as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken {{as it moved}} northwestward, and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70 mph (115 km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Campeche, Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters. This was because an <b>anticyclone</b> over the Gulf was closely connected with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the Gulf of Mexico. The <b>anticyclone</b> resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification. As Fern moved inland over Texas, the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36 hours after entering the Gulf of Mexico, the storm began to reintensify slightly.|$|E
5|$|On June7, {{small area}} of low {{pressure}} developed off {{the west coast}} of India. Over the following two days, convection associated with the low gradually organized and by June9, satellite intensity estimates from the JTWC reached 55km/h (30mph). A TCFA was subsequently issued for the system before it made landfall in Gujarat early on June10. Although overland, the low maintained significant convection as it turned westward and through its re-emergence into the Arabian Sea on June11. Once back over water, convection rapidly spread westward in response to an <b>anticyclone</b> over the Arabian Peninsula and Afghanistan. Early on June12, the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm status based on a ship report near the center of 65km/h (40mph) sustained winds and a surface pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg). Later that day, strong wind shear stemming from the <b>anticyclone</b> displaced convection from the tropical storm by more than 110km (70mi), prompting the final advisory from the JTWC.
