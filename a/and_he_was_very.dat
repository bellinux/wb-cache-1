25|$|Yves Douleac is {{a driver}} for the Vaillante team. He lost his father, {{a truck driver}} for Vaillante at Marseilles, at 7. He was brought up by his mother <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> admirative of Michel Vaillant, getting to know him {{personally}} and being employed as a driver. Courageous and proud, he later {{fell in love with}} Gabriele Spangenberg, and succeeded in marrying her despite his modest origin.|$|E
25|$|Bolte used {{state debt}} {{to provide a}} wide range of state {{infrastructure}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> successful at winning overseas investment for the state. Some of his large projects were increased coal production and power generation in the Latrobe Valley, new offshore oil and gas fields in Gippsland, the West Gate Bridge over the lower Yarra River, a new international airport for Melbourne at Tullamarine and two new universities (Monash University and La Trobe University). Bolte was easily re-elected at the 1958, 1961 and 1964 state elections.|$|E
25|$|Alvertis was {{regarded}} {{for a long}} time {{as one of the best}} perimeter shooters in Europe. His shooting style, combined with his height, made him very hard to defend. His lack of athleticism did not allow him to show great regularity; nevertheless, he was never afraid to take clutch shots, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> often successful. He was also an above-average defender. He sometimes played at the power forward position in Panathinaikos, over the last 5years of his career, due to his height and size, although his all-around skills were quite average.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} the tour hit hard on Gunn in 1902 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> disappointing with both bat and ball apart from a few good bowling performances. The {{following}} year, though, bowling in a slower style, he had his finest season ever and was momentarily second as an all-rounder to Hirst. In the process, on a featherbed wicket at Trent Bridge, he hit 294 against Leicestershire, which was amazingly his first century since his third first-class match! As a bowler, Gunn took 28 wickets in two games against Surrey and Essex during the August Bank Holiday week. He was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden for 1904, but the following three years were not quite up to the standard set in 1903 – though he bowled wonderfully against Essex in 1905 on a perfect pitch. In 1906 Gunn again changed his style, bowling very slowly and tossing the ball up, with barely improved success.|$|E
25|$|After Joan Crawford's third divorce, Gable and she {{resumed their}} affair and lived {{together}} for a brief time. Gable was acclaimed for his performance in The Hucksters (1947), a satire of postwar Madison Avenue corruption and immorality. A very public and brief romance with Paulette Goddard occurred after that. In 1949, Gable married Sylvia Ashley, a British model and actress who was previously married to Douglas Fairbanks. The relationship was profoundly unsuccessful; they divorced in 1952. Soon followed Never Let Me Go (1953), opposite Gene Tierney. Tierney was a favorite of Gable <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> disappointed when she was replaced in Mogambo (because of her mental health problems) by Grace Kelly. Mogambo (1953), directed by John Ford, was a somewhat sanitized remake of his earlier Pre-Code film Red Dust, with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor, which had been a greater success. Gable's on-location affair with Grace Kelly (1929–1982), who was {{young enough to be}} his daughter, gradually ended after filming was completed.|$|E
25|$|When he was young, Dian Wei once {{agreed to}} help a certain Liu family in Xiangyi (襄邑) take revenge by killing Li Yong (李永), a man from Suiyang (睢陽). Li Yong was {{formerly}} the Chief (長) of Fuchun County (富春縣), <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> cautious about his personal protection. Dian Wei disguised himself as a marquis and travelled to Li Yong's house in a carriage filled with food and wine. He entered the house without challenge, stabbed Li with a concealed dagger, and killed Li's wife as well. He then left the house and retrieved his weapons (a sword and a ji) from the carriage and walked away. As Li Yong lived near the marketplace, news of his death spread quickly and the whole town was shocked. Hundreds of men went to pursue the murderer {{but none of them}} dared to approach Dian Wei. After travelling four or five li on foot, Dian Wei met his companions and they escaped after a brief fight with the pursuers. Dian Wei became recognised as a hero after that incident.|$|E

500|$|Bertuzzi {{immediately}} began producing with Vancouver, tallying 15 points in 22 games after the trade. Combined with his totals from New York, {{he finished with}} 23 points over 74 games in 1997–98. Contrasting his strained relationship with Milbury in New York, Canucks head coach Mike Keenan has recalled his experience with Bertuzzi upon his arrival as positive: [...] "He came as a young player <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> open-minded about learning about the game." [...] Similar to the Islanders, Bertuzzi joined a struggling club in Vancouver; the team finished last in the Western Conference {{in his first two}} seasons after the trade.|$|E
500|$|Professional wrestler Bret Hart guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> insistent that he be shown wearing his pink wrestling outfit. He {{explained}} that [...] "It's so cool {{to be part of}} a show that makes people laugh really, really hard." [...] The media, aware that the animated Hart would want to purchase Mr. Burns' home, mistakenly anticipated that [...] "Bret offers to wrestle him [...] for the place." [...] In a 2009 interview with the A.V. Club's Dave Hofer, Hart explained that the reason why his animated counterpart sounds nothing like him was that initially, he was brought in to voice a generic wrestler. When Mark Kirkland realised how famous Hart actually was, he told Hart that if the artwork had not been started yet, he would be drawn in as himself. Later, Hart moved on to do voice work on the animated television series Jacob Two-Two. The press noted that at that time Hart was [...] "no stranger to cartoon-land," [...] having been [...] "immortalized" [...] by [...] "The Old Man and the Lisa".|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the serial, Nigel Kneale said, [...] "Frankly, I {{was never}} {{happy with the}} whole idea in the first place. The central idea was too ordinary". Although Kneale {{was pleased with the}} high {{production}} values, he was dissatisfied with the casting, believing that John Mills [...] "didn't have the authority for Quatermass". He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that [...] "We had him in Beasts playing an idiot <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> good at that". Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that [...] "the primary problems with it were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television... And we just couldn't afford that". Executive producer Verity Lambert's opinion is that it [...] "didn't have the staying power of the originals, but then that's almost inevitable when you try to bring something back in a slightly different form".|$|E
6000|$|The Inspector {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "I don't quite know, sir. Between ourselves, I think Mr. Holmes had not quite got over his illness yet. <b>He's</b> <b>been</b> {{behaving}} <b>very</b> queerly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> much excited." ...|$|R

500|$|Wisden {{said that}} as a bowler, Peel had a [...] "fine length, easy action and splendid command of spin", which meant that he [...] "was often a match-winner". Peel {{consistently}} bowled a good length and varied the flight of the ball to deceive batsmen. He also bowled a quicker ball which, in contrast to his usual delivery, travelled {{in a straight line}} instead of turning. On a pitch affected by rain, batsmen found him very difficult to face, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> successful in these conditions. When bowling on pitches where the ball came more slowly off the surface, Peel often bowled faster; this pace made it difficult for batsmen to score runs against him even when conditions were in their favour. After he delivered the ball, the spin he imparted often made it curve in the air before it reached the batsman. According to Woodhouse, when bowling, [...] "Peel brought his arm behind his back with a peculiar flourish-like action and then 'whipped the ball down. He generally opened the bowling, including when he played for England. At the time, it was general practice to open the bowling with a fast bowler and a left-arm spinner.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E
500|$|Brian Epstein {{managed the}} Beatles from 1962 until his {{untimely}} death in 1967. He had no prior experience managing artists, {{but he had}} a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, [...] "I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me". McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Pete Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would entertain millions of fans until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, [...] "Love Me Do", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, [...] "Twist and Shout". The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With few exceptions—one being the album title itself—Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: [...] "We were just writing songs... pop songs with no more thought of them than that—to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised John: [...] "He was like our own little Elvis... We all looked up to John. He was older <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest." ...|$|E

On October 23, 1967, Helen committed suicide; Geisel married Dimond on June 21, 1968. Though he devoted {{most of his life}} to writing children's books, Geisel had no children of his own, saying of children: [...] "You have 'em; I'll entertain 'em." [...] Dimond added that Geisel [...] "lived his whole life without children <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> happy without children." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon Friedkin {{revealing}} his intentions to Clouzot, Clouzot was surprised Friedkin wanted to reimagine Wages of Fear because of enormous praise {{he had received}} at the time for his two recent pictures. Friedkin offered Clouzot {{a percentage of the}} film's shares, for which the French director was thankful. [...] In 2013, after a screening of Sorcerer at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Friedkin mentioned that he [...] "went to Georges Arnaud's home through his attorney, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> pleased to have this done because he didn't like Clouzot's film, if you can believe that".|$|E
