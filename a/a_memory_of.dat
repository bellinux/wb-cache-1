5|$|Jordan {{originally}} intended to finish the series in a single volume titled <b>A</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>of</b> Light, but when Sanderson began writing the book it became clear a split was required as it was believed a single volume would be too large to print. The expected final book was then split into three volumes: The Gathering Storm, Towers of Midnight, and <b>A</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>of</b> Light. The books would be published a year apart with the first volume, The Gathering Storm, published on October 27, 2009; a week earlier than originally announced. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the No. 1 position on The New York Times hardcover fiction Best Seller list, making it the fifth consecutive Wheel of Time book to achieve this feat.|$|E
5|$|Sanderson was {{originally}} working to {{a target of}} 200,000 words, later 250,000 words and by April 2008 up to 400,000 words. By the end of October 2008 the 400,000 estimate was still in effect. Sanderson later estimated the final length of <b>A</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>of</b> Light {{to be at least}} 750,000 words. Information emerged on the Internet pertaining to the book, with a draft cover suggesting it was to be split into volumes. On March 30, 2009, Tor Books confirmed <b>A</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>of</b> Light was to be split into three volumes, the first of which, The Gathering Storm, would be released on November 3, 2009. This date was later changed to October 27, 2009, a week earlier than planned.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{synthesis}} of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the genetic mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As more was understood about these mechanisms {{it came to be}} held that there was no naturalistic way in which the newly discovered mechanism of heredity could be far-sighted or have <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> past trends. Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the methodological naturalism of the sciences.|$|E

50|$|Processors in the Firefly {{communicated with}} the main memory through their {{individual}} caches and over the MBus. Memory was implemented by one to four memory modules that connect to the MBus. The original Firefly had <b>a</b> master <b>memory</b> module with <b>a</b> capacity of 4 MB and up to three slave <b>memory</b> modules <b>of</b> the same capacity for <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> capacity <b>of</b> 4 to 16 MB. Later Firefly systems used <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> module with <b>a</b> capacity of 32 MB, for <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> capacity <b>of</b> 32 to 128 MB. The memory access time in the original MicroVAX-based Firefly was 400 ns, while the CVAX version had <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> access time <b>of</b> 200 ns.|$|R

5|$|During one Occlumency lesson, Snape {{is called}} away and Harry, left alone, looks into Snape's Pensieve, viewing <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> {{his time as}} a student at Hogwarts. Harry is shocked to witness his father, James Potter, and Sirius {{bullying}} and humiliating Snape. Snape catches Harry and, enraged, refuses to continue the lessons. Distraught at this revelation of his father's character, Harry talks to Sirius and Lupin by using Floo powder through the fireplace in Umbridge's own office and learns more about his parents and their background. After helping Harry break into Umbridge's office, Fred and George then leave Hogwarts to start a joke-shop in Diagon Alley.|$|E
5|$|Eric Church {{wrote the}} song with Jeff Hyde and Ryan Tyndell. The {{basis for the}} song came from <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> a girl and {{involved}} another artist's song. Church chose to base the song around an idol of his, Bruce Springsteen, whose career he admires. During {{the course of the}} song, Church makes several allusions to Springsteen; he mentions the Springsteen songs Born to Run, Born in the USA, Glory Days, and I'm on Fire. While being named after Springsteen and making several references to him, the song however {{tells the story of a}} teenage romance.|$|E
5|$|French {{intelligence}} {{states that}} weapons manufacturer Conrad {{is involved in}} a sale, leading to Olivia returning to the sensory deprivation tank in order to find out more from Scott's memories. In a motel room they used to share, Scott talks to Olivia, scaring her into shooting him. Olivia next appears in an alleyway, where she follows Scott into <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> him almost killing Conrad. He reveals that he, Hicks, and Marshall are all undercover government agents for the NSA, and tells Olivia to ask Hicks where the meeting is going to happen. They awake Hicks, who tells them more about the weapons sale.|$|E

5|$|The SSEM had a 32-bit {{word length}} and <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> 32words (1 kilobit). As it was {{designed}} to be the simplest possible stored-program computer, the only arithmetic operations implemented in hardware were subtraction and negation; other arithmetic operations were implemented in software. The first of three programs written for the machine found the highest proper divisor of 218 (262,144), a calculation that was known would {{take a long time to}} run—and so prove the computer's reliability—by testing every integer from 218−1 downwards, as division was implemented by repeated subtraction of the divisor. The program consisted of 17instructions and ran for 52minutes before reaching the correct answer of 131,072, after the SSEM had performed 3.5million operations (for an effective CPU speed of 1.1 kIPS).|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, the runways, parking ramp and other {{features}} of Tamiami Airport were still visible on campus and clearly discernible in aerial photos. Construction has removed all of these features, and only the University Tower remains as <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the university's past. University Park is a lush, heavily vegetated campus, with many lakes and a 15-acre nature preserve, {{as well as a}} palm arboretum and has over 90 buildings. As of late 2009, current construction at University Park includes the Nursing and Health Sciences Building, the School of International and Public Affairs Building, and a fifth parking garage.|$|E
5|$|In July 803, an Abbasid army under al-Qasim, {{a son of}} the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), began {{advancing}} {{towards the}} Byzantine frontier. As Nikephoros had broken his foot in early May, it fell to Bardanes to lead the Byzantine army against the Arabs. He therefore ordered the thematic armies of Anatolia assembled in the Anatolic Theme. In mid-July 803 (the date is variously interpreted by modern scholars as 16, 18 or 19 July), Bardanes was proclaimed emperor by the assembled troops of the Anatolic, Opsician, Thracesian and Bucellarian themes. Crucially, the Armeniac Theme, either because of its traditional rivalry with the Anatolics, or because it had not yet joined up {{with the rest of}} the army, did not join the uprising. It has also been hypothesized that Bardanes may have participated in the suppression of the Armeniacs' revolt in 793, leaving <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> hostility towards him amongst its troops. Among the Byzantine chronicles that report on Bardanes's revolt, the 10th-century Theophanes Continuatus and the 13th-century Synopsis Chronike indicate that the troops were motivated chiefly by economic concerns. Nikephoros had initiated a strict budgetary policy to shore up the Empire's finances. The Emperor had revoked the exemption on inheritance tax for the soldiers, and had apparently left them unpaid for some time as well. Bardanes, on the other hand, had a good reputation in this regard, fairly dividing the booty won from the campaigns against the Arabs amongst the soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The National Archives of Malta, {{like its}} {{counterparts}} {{in other areas}} of the world, has been moving to increase the availability of its services on the Internet. A number of items in its collection have been, or are in the process of being, digitised, and a catalogue listing search, along with a short description of each item, is available online on the Archives' web site. The Archives releases many of its publications, including periodical newsletters, its annual report and the State of the Archives report, on its web site, and maintains an 'e-shop' to facilitate the sale of copies of some of its text and image holdings to interested members of the public. It is also possible to search the holdings of Malta's National Memory Project, <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> those who have contributed to the history of Malta, through the Archives' web site.|$|E
5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be <b>a</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E
