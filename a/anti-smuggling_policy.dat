The companies agreed to pay a collective total of $2.15 billion to the EU and Member States. With the agreements, the manufacturers have also committed themselves to comprehensive rules concerning sales and distribution practices to promote compliance with EU and national rules as well as to ensure that their genuine cigarettes are sold, distributed, stored and shipped in accordance with all legal requirements.|$|E

This was quite unusual {{because he was a}} staunch anti-militarist. As President, Zinsou promoted <b>anti-smuggling</b> <b>policies,</b> countermeasures against strikes, and a more efficient tax collecting system. This upset some people and military officers were infuriated by his independent actions. As a result, his chief of staff Maurice Kouandété deposed him on 10 December 1969. Although Zinsou was injured when machine guns fired on the presidential palace, two of his bodyguards were murdered. Zinsou received a mere 3 percent of votes in the 1970 presidential election and rejected an offer to join the presidential council. Instead, he opted to move to Paris.|$|R
