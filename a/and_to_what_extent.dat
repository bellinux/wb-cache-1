5|$|The nearby hill forts of Figsbury Ring, Quarley Hill, and Bury Hill were {{probably}} established {{around the same}} time as Danebury.

Cunliffe interprets the ramparts as essentially defensive, although he concedes that they may have been a means of displaying wealth and power, as Danebury would have been visible for miles around.|$|E

25|$|Many modern {{historical}} {{scholars have}} focused on the timing and the formation of the Mishnah.

Are Mishnaic disputes distinguishable along theological or communal lines, and in what ways do different sections derive from different schools of thought within early Judaism?
