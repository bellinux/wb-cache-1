5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive.

5|$|One {{possible}} {{interpretation of}} these provisions is that unlawful non-citizens {{should be kept}} in detention for as long as necessary to remove them, and that if removing them never became practicable, that they would be detained until death. In contrast, Al-Kateb argued that the provisions only allowed unlawful non-citizens to be detained while removal was <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> possibility, and that if removal was not <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> possibility, then they should be released from detention, at least while it remained impractical.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{solution to this}} problem, however, is to liberate the SI system's dependency on the IPK by developing <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> realization of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The units of measure in such <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> realization would have their magnitudes precisely defined and {{expressed in terms of}} fundamental physical constants. While major portions of the SI system would still be based on the kilogram, the kilogram would in turn be based on invariant, universal constants of nature. Much work towards that end is ongoing, though no alternative has yet achieved the uncertainty of 20 parts per billion (~20µg) required to improve upon the IPK.|$|E

5|$|The {{virtue of}} <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> {{realization}} based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E

This act solved <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> problem, but the colony had no authority to do so from the crown. Although this did not become an issue while Endecott was governor, it eventually became a source of controversy with the crown, and the mint had apparently ceased operations around 1682.|$|E

The authors claim that the verification of Hypothesis 3.1 is very important to establish <b>a</b> satisfactorily <b>practical</b> ultrasonic CT technique.

5|$|Because Wells Cathedral was secular {{rather than}} monastic, cloisters were not <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> necessity. They were omitted from several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their {{construction}} at these two secular cathedrals {{range from the}} processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a scriptorium.|$|E
