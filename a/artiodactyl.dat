5|$|The even-toed {{ungulates}} are ungulates whose weight is borne about equally {{by the third}} and fourth toes, rather than mostly or entirely by the third as in perissodactyls. There are about 220 <b>artiodactyl</b> species worldwide, including many that are of great economic importance.|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the <b>artiodactyl</b> order (even-toed ungulates). They {{are related to}} the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago. Primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5–10 million years later. What defines an archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans, alongside other primitive features not found in modern cetaceans, such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes included their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (Ambulocetus 49 mya), a streamlined body and the growth of flukes on the tail (Protocetus 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils toward the top of the cranium (blowholes), and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers (Basilosaurus 35 mya), and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).|$|E

50|$|<b>Artiodactyls</b> {{are native}} to almost {{all parts of}} the world, with the {{exception}} of Oceania and Antarctica. Humans have introduced different <b>artiodactyls</b> worldwide as hunting animals. <b>Artiodactyls</b> inhabit almost every habitat, from tropical rain forests and steppes to deserts and high mountain regions. The greatest biodiversity prevails in open habitats such as grasslands and open forests.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>artiodactyls</b> {{looked like}} today's {{chevrotains}} or pigs: small, short-legged creatures that ate leaves {{and the soft}} parts of plants. By the Late Eocene (46 million years ago), the three modern suborders had already developed: Suina (the pig group); Tylopoda (the camel group); and Ruminantia (the goat and cattle group). Nevertheless, <b>artiodactyls</b> were far from dominant at that time: the perissodactyls were much more successful and far more numerous. <b>Artiodactyls</b> survived in niche roles, usually occupying marginal habitats, and it is presumably {{at that time that}} they developed their complex digestive systems, which allowed them to survive on lower-grade food. While most <b>artiodactyls</b> were taking over the niches left behind by several extinct perissodactyls, one lineage of <b>artiodactyls</b> began to venture out into the seas.|$|R

25|$|Toothed whales, {{as well as}} baleen whales, are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the <b>artiodactyl</b> order (even-toed ungulates). They {{are closely related to}} the hippopotamus, sharing a common ancestor that lived around 54 million years ago (mya).|$|E
25|$|The {{red blood}} cells of mammals are {{typically}} shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a torus-shaped rim {{on the edge of}} the disk. This distinctive biconcave shape optimises the flow properties of blood in the large vessels, such as maximization of laminar flow and minimization of platelet scatter, which suppresses their atherogenic activity in those large vessels. However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the <b>artiodactyl</b> order (even-toed ungulates including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny spherical cells in mouse deer (family Tragulidae), and cells which assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family Cervidae). Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm. Overall, mammalian {{red blood cells}} are remarkably flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen load.|$|E
500|$|The common {{hippopotamus}} (Hippopotamus amphibius), or hippo, is a large, mostly herbivorous, semi-aquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa, {{and one of}} only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis).

40|$|Since the Eocene, the {{diversity}} of <b>artiodactyls</b> has increased while that of perissodactyls has decreased. Reasons given for this contrasting pattern are that {{the evolution of a}} ruminant digestive tract and improved locomotion in <b>artiodactyls</b> were adaptively advantageous in the highly seasonal post-Eocene climate. We suggest that evolution of a carotid rete, a structure highly developed in <b>artiodactyls</b> but absent in perissodactyls, was at least as important. The rete confers an ability to regulate brain temperature independently of body temperature. The net effect is that in hot ambient conditions <b>artiodactyls</b> are able to conserve energy and water, and in cold ambient conditions they are able to conserve body temperature. In perissodactyls, brain and body temperature change in parallel and thermoregulation requires abundant food and water to warm/cool the body. Consequently, perissodactyls occupy habitats of low seasonality and rich in food and water, such as tropical forests. Conversely, the increased thermoregulatory flexibility of <b>artiodactyls</b> has facilitated invasion of new adaptive zones ranging from the Arctic Circle to deserts and tropical savannahs...|$|R

50|$|The {{molecular}} data {{is supported by}} the discovery of Pakicetus, the earliest archaeocete. The skeletons of Pakicetus show that whales did not derive directly from mesonychids. Instead, they are <b>artiodactyls</b> that began to take to the water soon after <b>artiodactyls</b> split from mesonychids. Archaeocetes retained aspects of their mesonychid ancestry (such as the triangular teeth) which modern <b>artiodactyls,</b> and modern whales, have lost. The earliest ancestors of all hoofed mammals were probably at least partly carnivorous or scavengers, and today's <b>artiodactyls</b> and perissodactyls became herbivores later in their evolution. Whales, however, retained their carnivorous diet because prey was more available and they needed higher caloric content in order to live as marine endotherms (warm-blooded). Mesonychids also became specialized carnivores, but this was likely a disadvantage because large prey was uncommon. This may be why they were out-competed by better-adapted animals like the hyaenodontids and later Carnivora.|$|R

Two archaic whales (Pakicetus and Artiocetus) formed the sister group of the hippopotamid-anthracotheriid clade, but this relationship was weakly supported.|$|R
