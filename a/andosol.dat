We studied the effects of such depositions in two types of <b>Andosols</b> exposed to volcanogenic emission (Masaya, Nicaragua), namely Eutric <b>Andosols</b> rich in allophanic constituents, and Vitric <b>Andosols</b> rich in volcanic glass. Small mineral reserves and large contents of secondary short-range ordered minerals indicate a more advanced weathering of the Eutric than the Vitric <b>Andosols.</b> Strong correlations between soil specific surface and oxalate-extractable Al, Si and Fe contents highlight the predominant contribution of short-range ordered minerals to surface area. Both types of <b>Andosols</b> showed a decrease in pH upon acid input. Sulphur deposition increased the soil's S content to 5470 mg S kg- 1. However, the acid neutralizing capacity of the soil solid phase (ANCs) was not significantly affected by the acid and S inputs. Non-exchangeable (mineral reserve) and exchangeable cations and total contents of sulphur and phosphorus dictate most of the ANCs variation.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Volcanic ash soils (<b>Andosols)</b> {{may offer}} great {{opportunities}} for paleoecological studies, {{as suggested by}} their characteristic accumulation of organic matter (OM). However, understanding of the chronostratigraphy of soil organic matter (SOM) is required. Therefore, radiocarbon dating of SOM is necessary, but unfortunately not straightforward. Dating of frac-tions of SOM obtained by alkali-acid extraction is promising, but which fraction (humic acid or humin) renders the most accu-rate 14 C dates is still subject to debate. To determine which fraction {{should be used for}} 14 C dating of <b>Andosols</b> and to evaluate if the chronostratigraphy of SOM is suitable for paleoecological research, we measured 14 C ages of both fractions and related calibrated ages to soil depth for <b>Andosols</b> in northern Ecuador. We compared the time frames covered by the <b>Andosols</b> with those of peat sequences nearby to provide independent evidence. Humic acid (HA) was significantly older than humin, except for the mineral soil samples just beneath a forest floor (organic horizons), where the opposite was true. In peat sections, 14 C ages of HA and humin were equally accurate. In the soils, calibrated ages increased significantly with increasing depth. Age inversions and homogenization were not observed at the applied sampling distances. We conclude that in <b>Andosols</b> lacking a thick organic horizon, dating of HA renders the most accurate results, since humin was contaminated by roots. On the other hand, in mineral soil samples just beneath a forest floor, humin ages were more accurate because HA was then contaminated by younger HA illuviated from the organic horizons. Overall, the chronostratigraphy of SOM in the studied <b>Andosols</b> appears to be suitable for paleoecological research...|$|R
40|$|A {{thorough}} understanding of the mechanisms and factors involved in the dynamics of organic carbon in soils is required to identify and enhance natural sinks for greenhouse gases. Some tropical soils, such as <b>Andosols,</b> have 3 - 6 fold higher concentrations of organic carbon than other kinds of soils containing classical clays. In the tropics, toxic pesticides permanently pollute soils and contaminate crops, water resources, and ecosystems. However, not all soils are equal in terms of pesticide contamination or {{in their ability to}} transfer pollution to the ecosystem. <b>Andosols</b> are generally more polluted than the other kinds of soils but, surprisingly, they retain and trap more pesticides, thereby reducing the transfer of pesticides to ecosystems, water resources, and crops. <b>Andosols</b> thus have interesting environmental properties in terms of soil carbon sequestration and pesticide retention. <b>Andosols</b> contain a nano porous clay (allophane) with unique structures and physical properties compared to more common clays; these are large pore volume, specific surface area, and a tortuous and fractal porous arrangement. The purpose of this mini review is to discuss the importance of the allophane fractal microstructure for carbon sequestration and pesticide trapping in the soil. We suggest that the tortuous microstructure (which resembles a labyrinths) of allophane aggregates and the associated low accessibility partly explain the poor availability of soil organic matter and of any pesticides trapped in <b>andosols...</b>|$|R
50|$|Volcano rabbits are an {{endangered}} species endemic to Mexico. Specifically, the rabbit is native to four volcanoes just south of Mexico City, the largest of which is called El Pelado. The range of the volcano rabbit has been fragmented into 16 individual patches by human disturbance. Vegetation within the patches include Nearctic and Neotropical varieties. Elevation of these patches is between 2900 and 3660 meters above sea level. The soil consists mostly of <b>Andosol</b> and Lithosol. The local climate is temperate, subhumid, and has a mean annual temperature of 11 °C. Annual rainfall averages at about 1000 millimeters. In the patches that are the most heavily populated with volcano rabbits, the plants Festuca tolucensus and Pinus hartwegii are most abundant. Volcano rabbits show strong preferences for habitat types that are categorized as pine forests, open pine woodland, and mixed alder pine forest. Human activity in the area has had a great impact upon the preferred habitat of the volcano rabbit. Humans have fragmented the rabbits' habitat by constructing highways, farming, burning, and allowing grazing. Ecological fragmentation has been caused by environmental discontinuity.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{emissions of}} SO 2, HCl and HF by Masaya volcano, Nicaragua, represent a substantial source of atmospheric S-, Cl- and F-containing acid inputs for local ecosystems. We {{report on the}} effects of such acid depositions on the sulfate, chloride and fluoride contents in soils (0 - 40 cm) from two distinct transects located downwind from the volcano. The first transect corresponds to relatively undifferentiated Vitric <b>Andosols,</b> and the second transect to more weathered Eutric <b>Andosols.</b> These soils are exposed to various rates of volcanogenic acid addition, with the Vitric sites being generally more affected. Prolonged acid inputs have led to a general pH decrease and reduced exchangeable base cation concentrations in the <b>Andosols.</b> The concentrations of 0. 5 M NH 4 F- and 0. 016 M KH 2 PO 4 -extractable sulfate (NH 4 F-S and KH 2 PO 4 -S, respectively) indicate that volcanic S addition has increased the inorganic sulfate content of the Vitric and Eutric soils at all depths. In this process, the rate of sulfate accumulation is also dependent on soil allophane contents. For all soils, NH 4 F extracted systematically more (up to 40 times) sulfate than KH 2 PO 4. This difference suggests sulfate incorporation into an aluminum hydroxy sulfate phase, whose contribution to total inorganic sulfate in the Vitric and Eutric <b>Andosols</b> is estimated from ∼ 34 to 95 % and ∼ 65 to 98 %, respectively. The distribution of KH 2 PO 4 -extractable chloride in the Vitric and Eutric <b>Andosols</b> exposed to volcanic Cl inputs reveals that added chloride readily migrates through the soil profiles. In contrast, reaction of fluoride with Al and Fe oxyhydroxides and allophanes is an important sink mechanism in the Masaya <b>Andosols</b> exposed to airborne volcanic F. Fluoride dominates the anion distribution in all soil horizons, although F is the least concentrated element in the volcanic emissions and depositions. The soil anion distribution reflects preferential retention of fluoride over sulfate and chloride, and of sulfate over chloride.

40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) in Alu-andic <b>Andosols</b> and Alu-humic Umbrisols is {{believed}} to accumulate because of the protection caused by binding to aluminium (Al). We investigated soils that differed in the abundance of organo-Al complexes {{to determine the effect}} of such binding on SOM chemistry. For this, the surface horizons of three types of acid soils in the Basque Country (northern Spain) under forest stands were studied: (i) Alu-andic <b>Andosols</b> (AND soils) on basalts and trachytes, (ii) Umbrisols or so-called ‘aluminic’(ALU) soils also on basalts and trachytes and (iii) soils with a podzolizing trend (POD), on quartzites. Values of Al extractable with sodium pyrophosphate (Alp) in the surface horizons of these soils ranged between 8. 5 and 13. 1, 1. 9 and 9. 3, and 0. 8 and 3. 7 g kg- 1 dry weight, for the AND, ALU and POD soils respectively. For POD and ALU soils, surface horizons were sampled at two depths, 0 – 5 and 5 – 20 cm, whereas the AND soils were sampled at different depths down to the B horizon. NaOH-extractable SOM from three AND soils, 12 ALU soils and 12 POD soils was studied by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The POD soils had the largest loads of plant-derived markers (lignin, long-chain alkanes and alkenes, methyl ketones, fatty acids); SOM of the AND soils had the smallest amounts of plant-derived SOM and the largest amounts of microbial products (microbial sugars and N-compounds) of the soils studied. ALU soils had an intermediate pattern, as expected. The results indicate that the SOM of Alu-andic <b>Andosols,</b> developed from basalt and trachyte rocks, is essentially dissimilar to that of soils derived from quartz-rich parent material, under the same climate conditions and similar forest stands.

The two Aluandic <b>Andosols</b> of the Nilgiri Highlands (south India) have formed {{at the expense of}} intensively weathered lateritic formations of the Eocene. Data revealed that Al and Fe were predominantly stored in end-weathering products of laterites, mainly as gibbsite and Fe (hydr) oxides in B horizons of the Aluandic <b>Andosols.</b> These secondary minerals are gradually replaced by organo-metallic complexes in the topsoil A horizons exhibiting andic properties. We then indicate that formation of the organo-metallic complexes results from weathering of the dominant crystalline Al- and Fe-(hydr) oxides mediated by the organic ligands and complexation of the polyvalent metals following the accumulation of organic matter. Such weathering and complexation mechanisms are therefore similar to those recently ascribed to deferralitization and the formation of freely drained Umbric Podzols (Humus-Podzols) in the upper Amazon Basin.

Imogolite is easily distinguishable because of its tubular structure, whereas allophane compounds—usually described as spheres—are harder to identify, especially because of their variable structure and occurrence patterns. In addition, the local structure of allophanes can be very similar to that of proto-imogolite (imogolite precursor). Strangely, this similarity is seldom considered in most characterization studies. In this context, our study focuses on the structure of two Al-rich short range-ordered aluminosilicates of two different origins, from: (i) an <b>Andosol</b> B horizon (<b>Andosol</b> sample); and (ii) a weathered pumice grain (pumice sample).

A tendency has been observed that ZPC increases whwn the ratio SiO 2 /al 2 O 3 decreases, the resulting sequence is related to the chronological sequence formed by the <b>Andosols.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} the speciation and distribution of iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) between minerals and organic species in A and B horizons of two Aluandic <b>Andosols</b> with X-ray diffraction, thermal analyses, visible diffuse reflectance and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies, together with selective and total chemical extractions. The two Aluandic <b>Andosols</b> of the Nilgiri Highlands (south India) have formed {{at the expense of}} intensively weathered lateritic formations of the Eocene. Data revealed that Al and Fe were predominantly stored in end-weathering products of laterites, mainly as gibbsite and Fe (hydr) oxides in B horizons of the Aluandic <b>Andosols.</b> These secondary minerals are gradually replaced by organo-metallic complexes in the topsoil A horizons exhibiting andic properties. We then indicate that formation of the organo-metallic complexes results from weathering of the dominant crystalline Al- and Fe-(hydr) oxides mediated by the organic ligands and complexation of the polyvalent metals following the accumulation of organic matter. Such weathering and complexation mechanisms are therefore similar to those recently ascribed to deferralitization and the formation of freely drained Umbric Podzols (Humus-Podzols) in the upper Amazon Basin. In the present case, large supplies of both Al- and Fe-bearing minerals provide large metal:carbon ratios that prevent the mobility of the organo-metallic complexes and induce the formation of Aluandic <b>Andosols</b> rather than Podzols...|$|R
40|$|The {{retention}} of 137 Cs in {{various types of}} <b>Andosols</b> in Iceland was investigated. Soils were sampled at 29 sites with varying precipitation and environmental conditions. Samples were obtained from 0 to 5, 5 to 10, and 10 to 15 cm depths. The amount of radiocaesium present was quite variable, ranging between 300 and 4800 Bq m− 2 and correlated closely to total annual precipitation (r 2 = 0. 71). The majority of 137 Cs, 82. 7 % on average, was retained in the uppermost 5 cm of the soil. The greatest penetration of 137 Cs was observed for organic Histosols (76. 3 % in top 5 cm). The Icelandic Vitrisols (barren, poorly developed <b>Andosols)</b> are coarse grained with only 2 – 5 % clay content and contain little organic matter (< 1 %). Yet these soils retained 74 % of 137 Cs in the top 5 cm. The results indicate that radiocaesium fallout is strongly retained by colloidal materials characteristic of <b>Andosols,</b> such as allophane and ferrihydrite. Most soils in Iceland are subject to severe and prolonged freezing and waterlogging; despite this, 137 Cs is retained in the upper soil horizons and vertical migration is negligible in Icelandic <b>Andosols.</b> However, erosion and aeolian activity can markedly influence the amount and vertical distribution of radiocaesium in Icelandic soils...|$|R
