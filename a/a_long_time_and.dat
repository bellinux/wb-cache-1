5|$|On 22 April 2012, Chen {{escaped from}} house arrest. Chen's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen had been {{planning}} escape for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> had previously attempted to dig a tunnel for escape. In {{the weeks leading up}} to his escape, Chen gave his guards the impression that he was ill in bed, and stopped appearing outside the house, which allowed him several days before any absence would be discovered. Under cover of darkness and with the help of his wife, Chen climbed over the wall around his house, breaking his foot in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust {{has been}} known for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Sverdrup {{joined with}} his former University of Minnesota {{engineering}} professor John Ira Parcel {{in the formation of}} Sverdrup & Parcel, a civil engineering firm with a speciality field of bridges. Parcel had tenure at Minnesota for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> was reluctant to sever his ties completely, but eventually he decided to join the new company, taking an unpaid Sabbatical from the university for one year. Sverdrup owned 60% and Parcel 40%of the new firm, which opened its doors on 1 April 1928. The company's headquarters was located in St. Louis, Missouri. Sverdrup & Parcel's first contract was for the design of a bridge over the Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri, for which it received a fee of $33,000. While at the Missouri State Highway Department Sverdrup met D. C. Wolfe and E. R. Grant, and he asked them if they would join the company. Sverdrup subsequently hired design engineer Brice R. Smith from Missouri's leading supplier of bridge components. By 1936, all three would become partners in the firm.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt like he had known her for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{while working}} on Ghare Baire (Home and the World), Ray {{suffered}} a heart attack; it would severely limit his productivity in the remaining 9 years of his life. Ghare Baire was completed in 1984 {{with the help of}} Ray's son (who operated the camera from then on) because of his health condition. He had wanted to film this Tagore novel on the dangers of fervent nationalism for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> wrote a first draft of a script for it in the 1940s. In spite of rough patches due to Ray's illness, the film did receive some critical acclaim. It had the first kiss fully portrayed in Ray's films. In 1987, he made a documentary on his father, Sukumar Ray.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Constantine {{returned}} to the West Indies to face England (represented by the MCC as was usual in those days) in a four-match Test series early in 1930. The first Test was drawn; Constantine scored few runs, but bowled for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> fielded well. After the game, he was awarded a bat for his contribution. Calthorpe, the MCC captain, criticised his use of short-pitched bowling to a leg side field; one such ball struck Andy Sandham, but Constantine only reverted to more conventional tactics after a request from the MCC manager. During the second Test Constantine scored a rapid 58 and took six wickets, but the West Indies lost by 167 runs. In the following match the West Indies recorded their first win in Test matches; after centuries from George Headley and Clifford Roach, Constantine took four for 35 and five for 87 to secure the victory. Constantine was omitted from the final match in Jamaica, because inter-island politics meant that selectors tended to pick players from the island hosting the Test. In the series, 29 players represented the West Indies and the team had a different captain in each match. In the three matches in which he played, Constantine scored 144 runs at 14.40 and took 18 wickets at 27.61.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry {{the mimic}} shares signals {{similar to the}} model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics {{are less likely to be}} found out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the mimic occur, and where the model is more abundant than the mimic. This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E
5|$|Nancy {{then starts}} {{to think that}} Darren and Sienna are having an affair, and sleeps with Robbie Roscoe (Charlie Wernham) and his father Rick Spencer (Victor Gardener). Things are {{eventually}} sorted between Darren and Nancy, however as their wedding gets closer, they start to argue again as Nancy believes that Darren is not taking the wedding seriously. Nancy sleeps with Rick again although the next morning she has regrets. On the night of her hen do, Nancy is attacked by Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice) following an argument, and he attempts to rape her while wearing a mask. However, she is saved by Phoebe McQueen (Mandip Gill), and Darren and Nancy get remarried anyway. Finn is arrested and Darren stands by Nancy in court, however due to the DNA tests, Nancy is forced to admit her affair and that she slept with Rick within 24 hours before the attack. This creates more strife between Darren and Nancy; Darren sleeps with Sienna. Darren cannot forgive Nancy for her affair, they realise that married life has not been right for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> they agree to get divorced again. Darren offers to buy Nancy's half of The Dog In The Pond Pub {{in order to give}} her enough money to restart her life. The deed of transfer for The Dog has been signed and Darren is now the sole owner of The Dog In The Pond.|$|E
