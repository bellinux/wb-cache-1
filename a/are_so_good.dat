500|$|By 1792, Lady Charlotte Finch {{had become}} ill and deaf. Princess Sophia remarked that autumn, [...] "I am grieved to death about her, she is if {{possible}} more kind {{to us than}} ever. Indeed, both [...] and her <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> {{to us that we}} should not be deserving of having such treasures about us, if we did not feel their kindness in the highest degree". Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with {{members of the royal family}} and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received £600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace.|$|E

RPGFan said [...] "the pieces are beautifully composed, wonderfully played (...). has a stellar soundtrack with music that easily stands alone outside {{the context of the}} game.

Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard. At the jail, visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates. They can also buy souvenir prison shirts.

500|$|During the 2000s, 44singles {{reached the}} number one {{position}} on the Christian Songs chart. MercyMe was the most successful group, with seven of their singles topping the chart during the 2000s. MercyMe's [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] was the longest-running number one single of the 2000s, having spent a total of 23non-consecutive weeks atop the chart. Casting Crowns spent the longest time atop the chart during the decade, as their six number one singles spent a combined total of 62weeks at the summit. Out of the 44singles that hit the number-one position during the 2000s, 15 singles spent two separate runs atop the chart. Three singles ("Word of God Speak", [...] "My Savior My God", and [...] "Cry Out to Jesus") returned to the top position for three distinct runs. Nineteen artists recorded number-one singles during the decade. The first number-one single of the 2000s on the chart was Third Day's [...] "You <b>Are</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good</b> to Me", which led the chart's debut week of June21, 2003, and seven consecutive weeks afterward; the final number-one single was tobyMac's [...] "City On Our Knees", which led the chart for the final eleven weeks of the 2000s, and continued to lead into 2010.|$|E
500|$|In 1931 Beecham was {{approached}} by the rising young conductor Malcolm Sargent with a proposal {{to set up a}} permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent's patrons, the Courtauld family. Originally Sargent and Beecham envisaged a reshuffled version of the LSO, but the orchestra, a self-governing body, balked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch. The BBC having attracted a large number of the finest musicians from other orchestras, many in the musical world doubted that Beecham could find enough good players. He was fortunate in the timing of the enterprise: the depressed economy had severely reduced the number of freelance dates available to orchestral players. Moreover, Beecham himself was a strong attraction to many musicians: he later commented, [...] "I always get the players. Among other considerations, they <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> they refuse to play under anybody but me." [...] In a study of the foundation of the LPO, David Patmore writes, [...] "The combination of steady work, occasionally higher than usual rates, variety of performance and Beecham's own magnetic personality would make such an offering irresistible to many orchestral musicians." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Q magazine, Like a Virgin was {{the album}} that [...] "propelled [...] into the {{stratosphere}} – and rightly so. The songs are smart, funny, sexy and irresistible." [...] Taraborrelli said, [...] "It was Like a Virgin which reflected Madonna as a more versatile and artistic performer and vocals on this album being reflectively sharper in contrast to her early works in the music industry." [...] Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the songs on the album sustain a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic commented, [...] "Overall, the album adds up to less {{than the sum of}} its parts—partially because the singles <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>good,</b> but also because on the first album, she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that's part of Madonna's essence—even something that makes her fun—it throws the record's balance off a little too much for it to be consistent, even if it justifiably made her a star." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone preferred Madonna's debut album over Like a Virgin. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau was also lukewarm towards the record, writing [...] " [...] so sure of herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade. And to make the music less mechanical, she's hired Nile Rodgers, who I won't blame for making it less catchy." ...|$|E

500|$|In The Observer, Tony Palmer {{wrote that}} [...] "if {{there is still}} any doubt that Lennon and McCartney are the {{greatest}} songwriters since Schubert", the album [...] "should surely see {{the last vestiges of}} cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in a deluge of joyful music making". Richard Goldstein of The New York Times considered the double album to be [...] "a major success" [...] and [...] "far more imaginative" [...] than Sgt. Pepper or Magical Mystery Tour, due to the band's improved songwriting and their relying less on the studio tricks of those earlier works. In The Sunday Times, Derek Jewell hailed it as [...] "the best thing in pop since Sgt. Pepper" [...] and concluded: [...] "Musically, there is beauty, horror, surprise, chaos, order. And that is the world; and that is what The Beatles are on about. Created by, creating for, their age." [...] Although he dismissed [...] "Revolution 9" [...] as a [...] "pretentious" [...] example of [...] "idiot immaturity", the NMEs Alan Smith declared [...] "God Bless You, Beatles!" [...] to the majority of the album. Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone called it [...] "the history and synthesis of Western music", and the group's best album yet. Wenner contended that they were allowed to appropriate other styles and traditions into rock music because their ability and identity were [...] "so strong that they make it uniquely theirs, and uniquely the Beatles. They <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> that they not only expand the idiom, but they are also able to penetrate it and take it further." ...|$|E

I'd say {{the two have}} created great chemistry, but I'm ashamed to say such a cheap thing." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today also praised Cranston and Paul, exclaiming [...] "There is humor in the show, mostly in Walt's efforts to impose scholarly logic on the business and on his idiot apprentice, a role Paul plays very well.

2500|$|Not all {{the reviews}} were bad. Vincent Canby in The New York Times, for example, {{expressed}} [...] "great reservations" [...] {{about the film}} and Ball's close-ups, but noted that the film is [...] "as determined to please in its way as Mame is in hers" [...] and that the opening credits, [...] "which look like a Cubist collage in motion, <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> they could be a separate subject." [...] Canby went on to praise Ball as well: [...] "When the character of Lucy, an inspired slapstick performer, coincides with that of Auntie Mame, the Big-Town sophisticate, 'Mame' is marvelous. I think of Lucy's turning a Georgia fox hunt into a gigantic shambles, or of her bringing the curtain down on a New Haven first-night when, as a budding actress, she falls off a huge cardboard moon. I even treasure her prying loose the fingers of a sloshed Beatrice Arthur who won't give up her martini glass." [...] Variety reported in its February 27, 1974 review that Ball was “showcased, coiffed, made-up and ably guided from almost television-like slapstick to character sincerity with loving care.” Molly Haskell in The Village Voice was [...] "pro-Ball but anti-'Mame'" [...] and felt that Lucy made the character of Mame—someone [...] "you'd walk a mile to avoid" [...] in real life—palatable. In the March 18, 1974 issue of New York magazine, Judith Crist was similarly displeased with the film but supportive of its star: [...] "Lucille Ball is – and no 'still' about it – a first-rate entertainer, supplementing her superb comedic sense with a penetrating warmth and inner humor. She is without peer in making a hung-over stagger from bed to bathroom an exercise in regal poise, in using her slightly crooked smile to vitiate the soppiness of an overly sentimental sequence, in applying her Goldwyn Girl chorine know-how to a dash of song and dance." [...] Milton Krims, the film critic for The Saturday Evening Post, wrote (in the magazine's March 1974 issue) a breathless paean to Lucille Ball and the film, concluding that [...] "Mame is Lucille Ball and Lucille Ball is Mame." ...|$|E
