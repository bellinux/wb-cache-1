5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. <b>Asystole</b> is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Scientifically, this {{is readily}} explained. Barbiturate overdoses {{typically}} cause death by {{depression of the}} respiratory center, but the effect is variable. Some patients may have complete cessation of respiratory drive, whereas others may only have depression of respiratory function. In addition, cardiac activity can last {{for a long time}} after cessation of respiration. Since death is pronounced after <b>asystole</b> and given that the expectation is for a rapid death in lethal injection, multiple drugs are required, specifically potassium chloride to stop the heart. In fact, in the case of Clarence Ray Allen, a second dose of potassium chloride was required to attain <b>asystole.</b> The position of most death-penalty supporters is that death should be attained in a reasonable amount of time.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, John Alexander MacWilliam {{reported}} in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) of his experiments in which application of an electrical impulse to the human heart in <b>asystole</b> caused a ventricular contraction and that a heart rhythm of 60–70 beats per minute could be evoked by impulses applied at spacings equal to 60–70/minute.|$|E

40|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep-related brady-arrhytmia syndrome is a cardiac rhythm disorder characterised by <b>asystoles</b> lasting several seconds during REM sleep in otherwise healthy individuals. In contrast to arrhythmias associated with obstructive sleep apnea, REM sleep-related sinus arrests and atrioventricular (AV) blocks are {{not associated with}} episodes of apnea or hypopnea. In literature, only few cases have been published, suggesting that the prevalence of this nighttime rhythm disorder is very rare. In this paper, we report two new cases of REM sleep-related sinus arrests and one case of REM sleep-related total AV block. To explore the underlying mechanism, an analysis of heart rate variability was performed. In a matched control population, we observed a significant lower low-to-high frequency (LF/HF) ratio in slow wave sleep as compared to REM sleep (2. 04 +/- 1. 2 vs 4. 55 +/- 1. 82, respectively [Mann-Whitney U test p < 0. 01]), demonstrating a global increase in sympathetic activity during REM. When using the same technique in two of three patients with REM-related arrhythmias, the shift to an increased LF/HF ratio from slow wave sleep to REM sleep tended to be lower. This may reflect an increased vagal activity (HF component) during REM sleep in these subjects. We, therefore, hypothesise that, in our patients with REM sleep-related arrhythmias, the overall dominance of sympathetic activity during REM is present but {{to a lesser extent}} and temporarily switches into vagal dominance when the bursts of REMs occur. As it was still unclear whether these REM sleep-related <b>asystoles</b> needed to be paced, we compared our treatment and these of previously reported cases with the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for implantation of cardiac pacemakers. status: publishe...|$|R

Some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine V-fib {{in the hope that}} it can be reverted to a cardiac rhythm compatible with life, whereas others will deliver CPR and sometimes drugs as described in the advanced cardiac life support protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation.|$|E
25|$|Administration {{of oxygen}} at 15 litres per minute by face mask or bag valve mask is often sufficient, but {{tracheal}} intubation with mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Suctioning of pulmonary oedema fluid should be balanced against {{the need for}} oxygenation. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory pressure will generally improve oxygenation. Drug administration via peripheral veins is preferred over endotracheal administration. Hypotension remaining after oxygenation may be treated by rapid crystalloid infusion. Cardiac arrest in drowning usually presents as <b>asystole</b> or pulseless electrical activity.

40|$|The trigemino-cardiac reflex {{has been}} {{reported}} to occur during various craniofacial surgeries or procedures including manipulation of the trigeminal ganglion, tumor resection in the cerebellopontine angle, various facial reconstructions and trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy. Regarding risk factors during trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy, invasiveness close-ly related to the size of tumor and the degree of manipulation of cavernous sinus wall have been reported. We report the case of a 40 -year-old female patient who had a relatively small-sized (< 10 mm) pituitary adenoma. Repetitive <b>asystoles</b> occurred during microscopic trans-sphenoidal operation of the wall of the cavernous sinus, which strongly suggests the importance of careful manipulation of the cavernous sinus wall.

40|$|Aging is {{associated}} to disrupted contractility and rhythmicity, among other cardiovascular alterations. Drosophila melanogaster shows {{a pattern of}} aging similar to human beings and recapitulates the arrhythmogenic conditions found in the human heart. Moreover, the kinase CaMKII has been characterized as an important regulator of heart function and an arrhythmogenic molecule that participate in Ca 2 + handling. Using a genetically engineered expressed Ca 2 + indicator, we report changes in cardiac Ca 2 + handling at two different ages. Aging prolonged relaxation, reduced spontaneous heart rate (HR) and increased the occurrence of arrhythmias, ectopic beats and <b>asystoles.</b> Alignment between Drosophila melanogaster and human CaMKII showed {{a high degree of}} conservation and indicates that relevant phosphorylation sites in humans are also present in the fruit fly. Inhibition of CaMKII by KN- 93 (CaMKII-specific inhibitor), reduced HR without significant changes in other parameters. By contrast, overexpression of CaMKII increased HR and reduced arrhythmias. Moreover, it increased fluorescence amplitude, maximal rate of rise of fluorescence and reduced time to peak fluorescence. These results suggest that CaMKII in Drosophila melanogaster acts directly on heart function and that increasing CaMKII expression levels could b...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the vertebrate heart originates from migratory mesothelial cells (epicardium) {{that give rise to}} coronary vascular smooth muscles and fibroblasts. The role of the epicardium in myocardial morphogenesis and establishment of normal heart function is still largely unknown. Here, we use Drosophila to investigate non-autonomous influences of epicardial-like tissue surrounding the heart tube on the structural and functional integrity of the myocardium. It has previously been shown that during Drosophila heart formation, mesodermal expression of the homeobox transcription factor even-skipped (eve) is required for specification of a subset of non-myocardial progenitors in the precardiac mesoderm. These progenitors may share some similarities with the vertebrate epicardium. To investigate a non-autonomous epicardial-like influence on myocardial physiology, we studied the consequences of reduced mesodermal Eve expression and epi/pericardial cell numbers on the maturation of the myocardial heart tube, its contractility, and acquisition of a normal heart rhythm in the Drosophila model. Targeting the eve repressor ladybird early (lbe) with the minimal eve mesodermal enhancer efficiently eliminates the mesodermal Eve lineages. These flies exhibit defects in heart structure, including a reduction in systolic and diastolic diameter (akin to ‘restrictive cardiomyopathy’). They also exhibit an elevated incidence of arrhythmias and intermittent <b>asystoles,</b> as well as compromised performance under stress. These abnormalities are restored by eve reexpression or by lbe-RNAi co-overexpression. The data suggest that adult heart function in Drosophila is likely to be modulated non-autonomously, possibly by paracrine influences from neighboring cells, such as the epi/pericardium. Thus, Drosophila may {{serve as a model for}} finding genetic effectors of epicardial–myocardial interactions relevant to higher organisms...|$|R

2500|$|Increased {{extracellular}} potassium levels {{result in}} depolarization of the membrane potentials of cells {{due to the}} increase in the equilibrium potential of potassium. [...] This depolarization opens some voltage-gated sodium channels, but also increases the inactivation at the same time. Since depolarization due to concentration change is slow, it never generates an action potential by itself; instead, it results in accommodation. Above a certain level of potassium the depolarization inactivates sodium channels, opens potassium channels, thus the cells become refractory. This leads to the impairment of neuromuscular, cardiac, and gastrointestinal organ systems. [...] Of most concern is the impairment of cardiac conduction, which can cause ventricular fibrillation, abnormally slow heart rhythms, or <b>asystole.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the possibility that}} infants with breath-holding spells have breathing disorders during sleep. Seventy-one breath holders with a median age of 14 weeks were selected from a well babies clinic because of their histories: 34 infants without loss of consciousness, and 37 with loss of consciousness (21 of the latter had had cyanotic spells, 14 pallid spells, and 2 combined cyanotic and pallid spells). For each breath holder, one control infant without a history of breath holding was chosen from the same clinic. All infants were healthy and had no known cause of disrupted breathing during sleep. Their histories indicated that the breath holders were covered with sweat during sleep (p = 0. 005) or wakefulness (p = 0. 006) significantly more often than were the control infants. The infants were studied during a one-night monitoring session, and the 142 sleep recordings were analyzed without knowledge of the history. The breath holders had significantly less nonrapid eye movement (stage III) sleep, more indeterminate sleep, more arousals, and more sleep-stage changes than the control infants had. Central apneas were evenly distributed in the two groups. Airway obstructions were found in 41 breath holders and six control infants; the obstruction lasted longer in the breath holders. The infants with airway obstruction during sleep snored more often (p = 0. 023) and sweated more (p = 0. 035) during sleep. The water evaporation rate, measured on the forehead with an evaporation meter, was significantly greater in the breath holders (p = 0. 001). Ocular compression induced longer <b>asystoles</b> in the infants with pallid syncopes than in either those with cyanotic syncopes (p = 0. 036) or those without loss of consciousness (p = 0. 031). We conclude that the obstructed breathing during both wakefulness and sleep {{could be related to}} a common immature breathing control. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
2500|$|In a study {{relating}} to relationship of neurocardiology of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, they {{hypothesized that the}} individual with a diseased heart has a greater likelihood of experiencing cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death when the neurocardiac axis is activated.
