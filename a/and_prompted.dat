5|$|Initially, Ma-on posed {{a slight}} {{threat to the}} Mariana Islands <b>and</b> <b>prompted</b> the {{issuance}} of tropical storm warnings. However, the system remained {{far away from the}} area and only produced scattered rainfall. In Japan, hundreds of people evacuated from mudslide-prone areas. Torrential rains produced by the storm, estimated at more than 1,200mm (48in), led to widespread and damaging floods. Five people perished as a result of Ma-on, and damage reached ¥3.9billion (2011JPY, $50million 2011USD).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{tensions}} in Jordan between an increasingly autonomous PLO and King Hussein's government had been simmering; following the Dawson's Field hijackings, a military campaign was launched to rout out PLO forces. The offensive elevated risks {{of a regional}} war <b>and</b> <b>prompted</b> Nasser to hold an emergency Arab League summit on 27 September in Cairo, where he forged a ceasefire.|$|E
40|$|Alerts <b>and</b> <b>prompts</b> {{represent}} promising {{types of}} decision support in electronic prescribing to tackle inadequacies in prescribing. A systematic review {{was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy of computerized drug alerts <b>and</b> <b>prompts</b> searching EMBASE, CINHAL, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO up to May 2007. Studies assessing the impact of electronic alerts <b>and</b> <b>prompts</b> on clinicians' prescribing behavior were selected and categorized by decision support type. Most alerts <b>and</b> <b>prompts</b> (23 out of 27) demonstrated benefit in improving prescribing behavior and/or reducing error rates. The impact appeared to vary based {{on the type of}} decision support. Some of these alerts (n = 5) reported a positive impact on clinical and health service management outcomes. For many categories of reminders, the number of studies was very small and few data were available from the outpatient setting. None of the studies evaluated features that might make alerts <b>and</b> <b>prompts</b> more effective. Details of an updated search run in Jan 2009 are included in the supplement section of this review...|$|R

30|$|As discussed, AutoTutor {{attempts}} to get the student to articulate the expectations. Students are notoriously incomplete in articulating answers so AutoTutor agents provide pumps, hints, <b>and</b> <b>prompts</b> to encourage the student to articulate the content. For example, some of the hints <b>and</b> <b>prompts</b> for expectation E 2 would be “What is the current gain of the transistor?”, “The current gain of the common-base transistor is less than what?”, and “What is less than one in the common-base transistor?” The selection of the hints <b>and</b> <b>prompts</b> {{attempts to}} elicit missing words and phrases in the expectation and thereby achieve pattern completion.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} a {{quasi-experimental}} research conducted in Mojtame-Fani in Tehran. The 60 participants were homogenized through a PET test, moreover, they were homogenized through their level of motivation Dornyei's (1990) Questionnaire and autonomy through Zhang and Li ‘s (2004) Questionnaire. Then they were assigned to two experimental groups. One group received <b>prompt</b> <b>and</b> the other received recast. Finally, the autonomy and motivation tests were administered; and the result revealed {{that there was no}} significant difference between the effect of recast <b>and</b> <b>prompt</b> on the learners’ motivation. Furthermore, it was found that recast <b>and</b> <b>prompt</b> increased the EFL learners’ autonomy; however, {{there was no significant difference}} between the impact of recast <b>and</b> <b>prompt</b> on autonomy...|$|R

5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, {{the need for}} an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, <b>and</b> <b>prompted</b> the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{was born}} in Triesen, Liechtenstein, a small town with a {{population}} of 4,500, close to the border with Switzerland. He is the younger son of Heinz and Elsbeth, following Patrick Burgmeier, who played football for Vaduz and USV Eschen/Mauren. From a young age, Franz played both football and skied. He played for the Liechtenstein youth team in Swiss competitions from ages 11 to 16, winning the championship when he was 13. However, at 16, a knee injury, which he suffered while skiing, nearly ended his football career <b>and</b> <b>prompted</b> him to stop the former sport.|$|E

5|$|By June 1991, Banovina {{declared}} {{itself a}} part of the Serbian Autonomous Oblast Krajina (SAO Krajina), and the Serb–Croat conflict began to escalate. Clashes peaked in late July, when Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive codenamed Operation Stinger. It was primarily aimed at the Croat-populated villages between Dvor and Hrvatska Kostajnica, and the police station in the town of Glina. The offensive was successful in securing Glina, <b>and</b> <b>prompted</b> the withdrawal of Croat forces from the Una River valley south and west of Hrvatska Kostajnica on 27 July. During the fighting, 12 Croatian policemen and 20 civilians were killed.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower gave Nixon {{responsibilities}} {{during his}} term as vice president—more {{than any previous}} vice president. Nixon attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings and chaired them when Eisenhower was absent. A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States <b>and</b> <b>prompted</b> Nixon to appreciate {{the potential of the}} region as an industrial center. He visited Saigon and Hanoi in French Indochina. On his return to the United States at the end of 1953, Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} the British surrendered, Congress passed a {{resolution}} agreeing to erect a structure dedicated to commemorating {{those who participated in}} the battle. Construction of the monument was delayed, however, as the federal government had several other financial obligations that were considered to be of a more urgent nature. The battle's centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm in the resolution <b>and</b> <b>prompted</b> the government to begin building the monument in 1881 amid national support. The structure was formally erected in 1884 and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park.|$|E

The storm's approach also closed down beaches <b>and</b> <b>prompted</b> officials to cancel outdoor activates as a precaution and the American Red Cross opened shelters and provided emergency services.
