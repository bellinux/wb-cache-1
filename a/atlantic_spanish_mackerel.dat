5000|$|The cero (Scomberomorus regalis) , {{also known}} as the pintado, kingfish, [...] cero {{mackerel}}, or painted mackerel, is a ray-finned bony fish in the family Scombridae, better known as the mackerel family. More specifically, this fish {{is a member of the}} tribe Scomberomorini, the Spanish mackerels, and is the type species of the genus Scomberomorus. It is similar in appearance and coloration to the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Scomberomorus maculatus, except the cero has a longitudinal stripe in addition to the spots of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel.</b>|$|E

40|$|Year-class {{effects may}} be very {{important}} when analysing fish growth. This work aims to compare growth in weight and in length between year classes of <b>Atlantic</b> and <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> found off the Portuguese coast. The analysis included Atlantic mackerel data from year classes 1986 – 1993 and <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> data from year classes 1988 – 1995. The analyses indicated significant differ-ences between year classes in terms of mean weight-at-length and mean length-at-age. Atlantic mackerel year classes also showed significant differences in mean weight-at-length between males and females, and <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> year classes showed significant differences between sexes for mean length-at-age. No significant effects were found for the two-way interaction between year class and sex. Growth variability may be linked with variability in environmental factors as well as density-dependence...|$|R

40|$|Spearing <b>spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> {{one of the}} {{traditional}} fishing technique in Japan, is very interesting from the view point of fishing technology because of its primitive but highly developed luring fish technique. In spearing <b>spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> relatively large lure and luring model fish with {{same size as the}} <b>spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> are used to attact fish up to sea surface at the spearing position. <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> is attracted by these luring gears, and its behaviour toward them varies depending on the size, movement and moving speed of the luring gear. Though <b>spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> attracted actively tries to feed on a lure, it comes near the luring model fish which made of wood or cloth and stays around it recognizing the model fish as a schooling companion...|$|R

50|$|The first (spiny) {{dorsal fin}} on <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> and cero has a {{prominent}} black patch. The king mackerel does not. As all three species normally keep the first dorsal folded {{back in a}} body groove, this difference is not immediately evident.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the cero reaches larger sizes {{than the}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> often 10 lb or more, but those over 30 lb are {{extremely}} rare. The first dorsal fin is black anteriorly, the lateral line descends slowly from the shoulder without the sharp break {{seen on the}} king mackerel, Scomberomorus cavalla.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> have {{prominent}} yellow {{spots on}} the flanks at all sizes. In addition to such spots, cero have one or more yellow stripes along the centerline.

50|$|The Serra Spanish {{mackerel}} (Scomberomorus brasiliensis) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Scombridae. Specimens have been recorded at up to 125 cm in length, and weighing up to 6.71 kg.

Literature records for S. maculatus (<b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel)</b> from the area apply to S. brasiliensis, which has erroneously been considered a synonym of S. maculatus by many authors. It feeds on small fish, squid/cuttlefish, shrimp/prawn, and isopods.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus maculatus) {{occupy the}} waters off {{the east coast of}} North America from the Cape Cod area south to the Yucatan Peninsula. Its {{population}} is considered to include two fish stocks, defined by geography. As summer approaches, one stock moves in large schools north from Florida up the coast to spawn in shallow waters off the New England coast. It then returns to winter in deeper waters off Florida. The other stock migrates in large schools along the coast from Mexico to spawn in shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico off Texas. It then returns to winter in deeper waters off the Mexican coast. These stocks are managed separately, even though genetically they are identical.|$|E
50|$|The king {{mackerel}} is a medium-sized fish, typically encountered from 5 to 14 kg, but {{is known to}} exceed 40 kg. The entire body is covered with very small, hardly visible, loosely attached scales. The first (spiny) dorsal fin is entirely colorless and is normally folded back into a body groove, as are the pelvic fins. The lateral line starts high on the shoulder, dips abruptly at mid-body and then continues as a wavy horizontal line to the tail. Coloration is olive on the back, fading to silver with a rosy iridescence on the sides, fading to white on the belly. Fish under 5 kg show yellowish-brown spots on the flanks, somewhat smaller than the spots of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Scomberomorus maculatus. Its cutting-edged teeth are large, uniform, closely spaced and flattened from side to side. These teeth look {{very similar to those}} of the bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix.|$|E

5000|$|The literal {{translation}} of the toponym is [...] "Japanese <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> arc".

40|$|Abstract. To utilize low-value fish, <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein was hydrolyzed using alcalase for {{production}} of antioxidant peptide. The antioxidant activities of antioxidant peptide from <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein were evaluated. Results: The radical-scavenging properties on hydroxyl and superoxide of protein hydrolysates were 53. 11 % and 23. 1 %. And their reducing power was increased with the peptide {{content of the}} hydrolysates. The hydrolysates significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation in linoleic acid emulsion system, and effectively inhibit autoxidation of linoleic acid; and the inhibition ability increased with the increasing of peptide content in hydrolysates. The hydrolysates inhibited the activity of LOX to a certain extent. Conclusion: The hydrolysates from <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein exhibited high antioxidative activity...|$|R
