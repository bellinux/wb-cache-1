40|$|Rewilding {{is a novel}} nature {{management}} {{type that}} aims at restoring natural processes with minimal human intervention. It is increasingly employed on <b>abandoned</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> in Europe, but empirical studies are scarce. Rewilding may lead to formation of wood-pastures, arguably the primeval landscape in parts of Europe before Neolithic times. We investigated sapling establishment, a key process for wood-pasture formation, in the Oostvaarclersplassen: Europe's oldest large-scale rewilding area, with high densities of free-roaming large herbivores. We transplanted saplings of pioneers, spiny shrubs, and hardwood species and studied how herbivore accessibility (grazed control, partial and full exclosure), vegetation type (tall roughs; short lawns) and soil-tillage (mimicking wild boar rooting) affected sapling survival for four years. No single sapling survived in grazed controls, while survival in exclosures was 25 %. Differences in survival between partial and full exclosures were minor, indicating that reduced herbivore access is sufficient for sapling survival. Survival was higher in lawn than in rough in both exclosure types and for all species, indicating positive effects of preceding grazing. Soil tillage initially benefitted all species, but effects lasted for pioneers only, suggesting that - once introduced - wild boar rooting may affect woody species composition. We conclude that rewilding with herbivores can successfully form wood-pasture landscapes on abandoned agricultural land as long as grazing refuges are present that allow for sapling establishment. As grazing refuges are generally lacking on <b>abandoned</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands,</b> where most rewilding is foreseen, we recommend that future projects consider the presence - or creation - of grazing refuges.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Puget Lowland Prairies {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} ecosystems in the United States. Restoration has been occurring for more than thirty years and has focused on extant sites with some native species present. Generally, actions first began with invasive species control, followed by reintroduction of fire, and then seeding and planting. Significant improvements have been made, however existing habitat continues to be converted and additional strategies to restore the ecosystem need to be explored. Developing techniques and methods for restoring <b>abandoned</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands,</b> and other lands with no native species present, to native prairie is a critical information need, as it will likely be an important future strategy. This dissertation explored techniques to restore native prairie habitat on a suite of <b>abandoned</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> over a large spatially and temporally replicated experiment, the Prairie Habitat Restoration Project (PHRP). I first explored techniques and factors affecting the seedling establishment and survival of a rare species, a hemiparasitic plant endemic to the Puget Lowland Prairies, Castilleja levisecta. I seeded C. levisecta in combination with different site preparation and seeding treatments across 4 sites over 2 years. Next, I tested the effect of host plant identity and container size on survival and reproduction of C. levisecta in a replicated outplanting study with two potential host species. Finally, I tested a novel approach we call "Staged-Scale Restoration" (SSR) that rigorously explored multiple habitat treatments within an adaptive management framework. I implemented SSR by identifying several promising restoration strategies and testing them in small, replicated experimental plots. Based on the results of these small-scale tests, the most successful treatments were applied to increasingly larger scaled-up areas. My first study demonstrated that direct seeding is an effective strategy for establishing large populations of C. levisecta. My second study found that the presence of a host species, and the identity of that host, significantly affected the survival and performance of C. levisecta. My final study demonstrated that SSR enables adaptive management to be implemented in restoration projects while minimizing risks, improving scientific rigor, and providing a cost effective approach...|$|E
