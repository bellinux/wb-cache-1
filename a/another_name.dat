5|$|Slavery by <b>Another</b> <b>Name</b> {{began as}} an article which Blackmon wrote for The Wall Street Journal {{detailing}} the use of black forced labor by U.S. Steel Corporation. Seeing the popular response to the article, he began conducting research for a more comprehensive exploration of the topic. The resulting book was well received by critics and became a New York Times Best Seller. In 2009, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. In 2012, it was adapted as a documentary film for PBS, also titled Slavery by <b>Another</b> <b>Name.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} book, Slavery by <b>Another</b> <b>Name,</b> {{was published}} by Anchor Books in 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{first version}} of the poem was sent {{in a letter to}} Southey and was only 56 lines. The first {{published}} edition, in 1800, was 76 lines long. The poem was revised and published under <b>another</b> <b>name</b> in Southey's Annual Anthology. A later revised edition was included in Sibylline Leaves, Coleridge's 1817 collection of poems.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{study of}} Justo and colleagues showed that Volvariella gloiocephala and related taxa are a {{separate}} clade {{from the majority}} of the species traditionally classified in Volvariella and therefore <b>another</b> <b>name</b> change was necessary, now as the type species of the newly proposed genus Volvopluteus.|$|E
5|$|As {{the state}} religion, Saivism enjoyed all the prerogatives of the {{establishment}} {{during the period of}} the Jaffna kingdom. The Aryacakravarti dynasty was very conscious of its duties as a patron towards Saivism because of the patronage given by its ancestors to the Rameswaram temple, a well-known pilgrimage center of Indian Hinduism. As noted, one of the titles assumed by the kings was Setukavalan or protector of Setu <b>another</b> <b>name</b> for Rameswaram. Setu was used in their coins as well as in inscriptions as marker of the dynasty.|$|E

5|$|The {{belief that}} certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has {{historical}} antecedents, though cattle {{have never been}} so classified. Julius Caesar recorded a belief that a European elk (moose) had no knee joints and could not get up if it fell. Pliny said the same about the hind legs of an animal he called the achlis, which Pliny's 19th-century translators Bostock and Riley said was merely <b>another</b> <b>name</b> for the elk. They also noted that Pliny's belief about the jointless back legs of the achlis (elk) was false.|$|E
5|$|North of this highway, SR 347 passes Honeycutt Road {{and passes}} by the Pinal County Justice Court. After an {{intersection}} with Edison Road, SR 347 passes several businesses before intersecting SR 238, named Smith Enke Road. The route then enters another residential area before abruptly passing into the desert. The road turns more northeasterly, heading through the Gila River Indian Community. Turning back north and slightly northeast again, the road crosses from Pinal County into Maricopa County. After intersecting Riggs Road, Maricopa Road veers away from John Wayne Parkway, which SR 347 follows. Now as Queen Creek Road, {{which serves as}} <b>another</b> <b>name,</b> SR 347 heads east for a small distance, ending at a diamond interchange at I-10's exit 164. Queen Creek Road continues toward Chandler Municipal Airport.|$|E
5|$|Officially, {{the entire}} length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. As a {{practical}} matter, this name is not used on the southernmost segments of the Interstate. The American Legion was honored with the designation in 1969 in a state law that required private interests to finance the signage. Public Act174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands. <b>Another</b> <b>name</b> that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976. The designation was formally repealed in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The name Efa first appears during Roman rule, {{some time}} {{after the end of}} the 1st century, when a Roman {{fortress}} and small Jewish settlement were established not far from Tel Shikmona. Haifa is also mentioned more than 100 times in the Talmud, a work central to Judaism. Hefa or Hepha in Eusebius of Caesarea's 4th-century work, Onomasticon (Onom. 108, 31), is said to be <b>another</b> <b>name</b> for Sycaminus. This synonymizing of the names is explained by Moshe Sharon, who writes that the twin ancient settlements, which he calls Haifa-Sycaminon, gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names Sycaminon or Sycaminos Polis. References to this city end with the Byzantine period.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there has}} been {{controversy}} over the names used at various times, with names being dropped for religious and political reasons. Female names were exclusively used in the basins at various times between 1945 and 2000, and were the subject of several protests. At present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven meteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes. Due to the potential for longevity and multiple concurrent storms, the names reduce the confusion about what storm is being described in forecasts, watches and warnings. Names are assigned in order from predetermined lists once storms have one, three, or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than , depending on which basin it originates in. Standards vary from basin to basin, with some tropical depressions named in the Western Pacific, while {{a significant amount of}} gale-force winds are required in the Southern Hemisphere. The names of significant tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Australian region are retired from the naming lists and replaced with <b>another</b> <b>name,</b> at meetings of the World Meteorological Organization's various tropical cyclone committees.|$|E
5|$|Issues arose {{after the}} {{erection}} of the memorial concerning the names {{inscribed on the}} Cenotaph. The committee had identified 1,793 names of Southampton men, {{and a number of}} women, who had died during the war and these had been inscribed on the Cenotaph. After the unveiling of the monument various relatives approached the committee requesting that additional names be added; after a newspaper campaign in the Southern Daily Echo newspaper, Kimber agreed to this and 203 additional names were inscribed in 1921. <b>Another</b> <b>name</b> was added in 1922, bringing the total to 1,997. More controversy surrounded the exclusion of the Jewish war dead from the memorial. Jews in Southampton had donated to the committee on the understanding that the memorial would commemorate not only Christian casualties but Jewish ones as well: one in ten adult male Jews in Southampton died during the conflict, twice the proportion for Southampton as a whole. Following the final decision on the design of the Cenotaph, however, which featured a prominent Christian cross, Jewish names were predominantly excluded from the memorial and only one Jewish name was finally inscribed on it.|$|E

5|$|On {{the south}} side of Kenongo Island is a row of small {{buildings}} called the Tajug. These buildings were originally used as air vents for the tunnel located below the lake. This underground tunnel, constructed in 1761,was an alternative way to reach the Kenongo Island other than by a vessel. Also on {{the south side}} of the Kenongo Island is another artificial island called Cemethi Island (Javanese Pulo Cemethi) or Panembung Island (Javanese Pulo Panembung). It is a one-storeyed structure for the Sultan to meditate, or some said, a hiding place for the royal family during an attack. <b>Another</b> <b>name</b> for this island is Sumur Gumantung, because on {{the south side of}} this island is a well that hangs above the ground. This place could only be reached via the underwater tunnel. The building of Cemethi Island is now also in ruin. A legend says that there is a secret tunnel that connects the palace with the south sea (Indian Ocean) where Nyai Roro Kidul or the Queen of the South has her palace. The supernatural Queen becomes the spiritual wife of Yogyakarta Sultan for many generations.|$|E
5|$|However, the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized Hinduism's {{followers}} of the Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation to god Vishnu or god Shiva. The Sanjan inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the Lakshmi temple at Kolhapur to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the Hiranyagarbha (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and Cambay plates of King Govinda IV mention Brahmins performing such rituals as Rajasuya, Vajapeya and Agnishtoma. An early copper plate grant of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend Parama Maheshwara (<b>another</b> <b>name</b> for Shiva). The kings' titles such as Veeranarayana showed their Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had {{the sign of the}} Ganges and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas. The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing. Their family deity was a goddess by name Latana (also known as Rashtrashyena, Manasa Vindyavasini) who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom. They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi was meant for {{followers of}} Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri was meant for worshipers of Shiva, Vishnu and Bhaskara (Surya, the sun god).|$|E
5|$|The mobile {{version of}} the game, {{entitled}} Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ, shares multiple gameplay features with its browser counterpart: the main exception is that this version is tailored for a touch screen. The ability to travel freely between different Disney worlds is also replaced with a stage system. These stages, called quests, are confined to specific areas of specific worlds. Instead of spending AP on individual actions, AP is paid to start a quest, and the player can attack as many enemies, collect as many materials, and open as many chests {{as he or she}} can find before defeating a target Heartless. If the player's HP is fully depleted, a choice is offered between forfeiting all progress in the quest or continuing to fight by spending Jewels, a new general-purpose in-game currency. Lux is considered <b>another</b> <b>name</b> for character-leveling experience points. Clothing, hair, and accessories are obtained through Avatar Boards, which each contain an array of nodes on branching pathways. These nodes are unlocked, in set sequences, with Avatar Coins, and may also yield such benefits as increased limits for AP and HP. Cards from the browser version are here replaced by Medals, which are no longer drawn randomly in battle. Instead, each equipped Medal is presented one at a time, and the player is given the choice of attacking one enemy, attacking all enemies (dealing less damage), or using the special attack granted by the Medal (provided the Keyblade's special attack gauges are sufficiently filled). Medals can be combined with matching Medals to improve their special attacks.|$|E
