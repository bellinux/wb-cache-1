2500|$|On 3 September 1849 the diarist of the Washington {{expedition}} said of {{the western}} entrance to the park, [...] "I noticed towering pines and firs, also the oak, the aspen, and the willow; and bordering the stream {{there was a great}} variety of shrubbery, the hop vine, loaded with its fruit, being intertwined among them. [...] Flowers of rich profusion and of every hue and delicacy, were also constantly before the eye–upwards of ninety varieties having been picked up since we entered the gorge [...] yesterday. [...] Indeed, we are all in hopes that, yesterday <b>and</b> <b>today,</b> <b>we</b> have been having an earnest of what we may yet behold {{in this part of the}} world–a rich, well-timbered and sufficiently well-watered country." ...|$|E

60|$|Who will {{wonder that}} Barbara had a headache, or that Barbara's mother was {{disposed}} to be cross, {{or that she}} slightly underrated Astley's, and thought the clown was older than they had taken him to be last night? Kit was not surprised to hear her say so--not he. He had already had a misgiving that the inconstant actors in that dazzling vision had been {{doing the same thing}} the night before last, and would do it again that night, and the next, and for weeks and months to come, though he would not be there.

First was the word ballot, then came the different types of paper ballots, <b>and</b> <b>today</b> <b>we</b> have the electronic balloting systems.|$|E

Šušak stated after the war that [...] "the US policy in 1991 <b>and</b> <b>today</b> is like heaven <b>and</b> earth. <b>Today</b> <b>we</b> are partners, <b>and</b> at the beginning we were someone who shook the order that somehow suited them".|$|R
