5000|$|School Bus Parallel Park: In this {{particular}} {{incarnation of the}} parallel parking challenge featured every year on the show, the drivers have ten attempts (of no more than thirty seconds each) to reverse a school bus (technically a skoolie) into a tight space between two cars, while not hitting anything and being no more than 30 cm <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> Michael, Dale, Sly and Kevin fail all their attempts due to constantly hitting the curb and the other vehicles, {{and none of them}} ever come close to parking the bus in the right position. Shelby fares the best, eventually getting the bus parked up correctly on his final attempt, but still backs into the car behind the bus, albeit at a relatively low speed. Shelby points out to Andrew that this type of parallel parking would be legal in Europe, which gave him a [...] "European Pass".|$|E

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} {{of a road}} verge is that the right-of-way must be wider, increasing {{the cost of the}} road.

50|$|Parallel Parking - The annual {{tradition}} of a parallel parking challenge returns here. Contestants must park between two vehicles {{in front of}} the patio of the Albion Hotel in downtown Guelph full of onlookers (the other contestants and their nominators included). The contestants will have one minute in each attempt, and each failure will cause the driver to take one lap around the block. Lindsay gets it on her first try (claiming that it is her strong suit, even though she did not use her mirrors once during the challenge), while Curt gets it in two (the first being too far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb).</b> None of the other contestants finish, and Donna even gets out of her car during her first attempt to berate a passing car waiting for her to park. That one move alone violated five simultaneous traffic laws (no signal, no seatbelt, jaywalking, abandoned car and dangerous driving), enough that if a police officer were to see it, she could've gotten $595 in fines and had her license suspended on the spot.|$|E
5000|$|Ice-Cream Truck Parallel Park: In {{a new and}} {{deceptive}} challenge, {{the candidates}} are placed {{at the wheel of}} an ice-cream truck and told to drive it along a short course in an apparent test of their ability to handle a heavy vehicle. Only at the halfway point do they discover the true purpose of the challenge; a Ford Econoline van ambulance will drive directly toward the ice-cream truck, which is then required toparallel park in order to let the ambulance past. If the ice-cream truck hits the curb or one of the adjacent vehicles, the driver is required to start over. Azim is the first to take the challenge, and while he initially gets flustered after making numerous mistakes, this time, he manages to get his stress problems under control and eventually passes the challenge. Diane is next and executes the challenge in a virtually flawless manner, parking the truck on her first go without hitting anything. Kevin keeps forgetting to use his driver's side mirror, meaning that he can't see the car behind him and repeatedly hits the car and the curb. Even after Andrew reminds him of the lesson, Kevin only uses the passenger side mirror and also drives too fast; he ultimately fails the challenge after running out of time. Flora's run begins with her being badgered yet again by Frank, whose inconsistent directions cause her to repeatedly hit things. After she tells him to be quiet, Flora does better and seems to park okay, but fails because she's almost a metre <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> Margherita has the final run, and keeps backing in at odd angles and fails to sufficiently use her mirrors, ultimately failing the challenge after repeatedly running into the curb and the car behind her.|$|E
40|$|Operating {{a mobile}} {{telephone}} while riding a bicycle is fairly {{common practice in}} the Netherlands, yet it is unknown if this use is stable or increasing. As such, whether the prevalence of mobile phone use while cycling {{has changed over the}} past five years was studied via on-road observation. In addition the impact of mobile phone use on lateral position, i. e. distance from the front wheel to the curb, was also examined to see if it compared to the results seen in previous experimental studies. Bicyclists were observed at six different locations and their behaviour was scored. It was found that compared to five years ago the use of mobile phones while cycling has changed, not in frequency, but in how cyclists were operating their phones. As found in 2008, three percent of the bicyclists were observed to be operating a phone, but a shift from calling (0. 7 % of cyclists observed) to operating (typing, texting, 2. 3 % of cyclists) was found. In 2008 nearly the complete opposite usage was observed: 2. 2 % of the cyclists were calling and 0. 6 % was texting. Another finding was that effects on lateral position were similar to those seen in experimental studies in that cyclists using a phone maintained a cycling position which was further <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> It was also found that when at an intersection, cyclist's operating their phone made less head movements to the right than cyclists who were just cycling. This shift from calling to screen operation, when combined with the finding related to reduced head movements at intersections, is worrying and potentially dangerous...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to find out the characteristics of bicycle-related crashes and improve safety and comfort for bicyclists around signalized intersections in Louisville, KY. At first, the benefits of bicycling for accessibility, health, environment and traffic were discussed. Plans made by a number of states, regions and local governments for encouraging people to use bicycles as an alternative to motor-vehicles were introduced. Emphases were put on the introduction of the Louisville Metro Bike Master Plan, which aimed to increase bicycling activity throughout all parts of Louisville by making it a fun, comfortable and accessible mode of travel, and to simultaneously reduce the number of cyclists killed and injured in crashes with motor vehicles. Second, an elaborative literature interview was made to look for the reasons which caused crashes between bicyclists and drivers. The conclusion was that a large percentage of bicyclists-related crashes happened at intersections. The most important reason for bicyclists-related crashes was drivers’ failing to yield when they were entering turning movements. Third, research for possible solutions which were used to improve safety for bicyclists was made. Studies which evaluated the effectiveness of those solutions were discussed. Fourth, {{in order to determine the}} characteristics of bicyclists-related crashes in Louisville, crash data of 10 years (from 2003 to 2012) was collected from the Kentucky Collision Analysis for the Public. Bicycle-related crashes in Louisville were most prevalent in the summer months, on weekdays and in the afternoon peak period in clear weather conditions. Turning-right was one of three highest possible pre-crash maneuvers in all bicycle-related crashes in Louisville The most important factor causing bicyclists-related crashes was motorists’ inattentiveness, or failing to yield the right-of-way to bicyclists. Bicyclists’ inattentiveness or failing to yield the right-of-way was also important for bicyclists-related crashes. Fifth, surveys were made four times to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly-developed countermeasure for bicyclists’ safety. The conclusion was that this countermeasure for bicyclists’ safety couldn 2 ̆ 7 t influence the distance from the curb where motor-vehicle crossed the stop bar. Most drivers preferred 4 - 6 feet <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> when they crossed the stop bar. This countermeasure for bicyclists’ safety could attract about 40...|$|E
