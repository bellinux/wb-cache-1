40|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of river waters in Kyushu island is high content of SiO 2. The author has investigated the variation of the chemical composition of the river waters with the difference of geological feature. The results are as follows. In the Ono river system, the SiO 2, content of the drainage from Aso welded tuff area is 53. 6 ppm (43. 4 % to the salinity), in tributaries which start from other igneous rocks and flow through Aso tuff it is 42. 0 ppm (39. 8 % to the salinity), and in tributaries which start from argillaceous sedimentary rocks and flow through Aso welded tuff it is 24. 8 ppm (26. 6 % to the salinity). In the Banjo river system, the whole of which basin is covered with argillaceous sedimentary rocks, the Si 02 content is 12. 9 ppm (25. 7 % to the sallinity). This fact indicates that the SiO 2, content in the water of the rivers varies with the geological feature of their reaches. The SiO 2, content in the drainage of Aso welded tuff is in direct proportion to HCO 3 content. Therefore the dissolution of rocks is cuased by the water charged with carbon dioxide. In Aso welded tuff area the Na content in river waters is out of proportion to Cl content. On the other hand, the quantity of (Na + K) - Cl is in direct proportion to SiO 2, content. Accordingly, almost all the quantity of alkali metals in river waters comes from resolution of rocks at Aso welded tuff area. It is concluded that the alkali quantity which comes from rocks is 82 % to the total quantity of alkali metals in river waters of Aso welded tuff, and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> area that percentage is 40...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1970 ies, isotope {{fingerprinting}} on CO 2 and gaseous alkanes {{proved to}} be a powerful tool in hydrocarbon exploitation [1]. In particular, isotope fingerprinting allows distinguishing between methane of biogenic or thermogenic origin [2]. Recently, alkanes confined in low permeability rocks (shales) have drawn economical attention as non-conventional energy resource. The same rocks are equally of interest as targets for CO 2 sequestration (as caprocks), and for solid waste disposal (as host rocks), since they form natural barriers for fluid and gas migration. Characterisation of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen isotopes on CO 2 and alkanes can reveal information on the origin and mobility of gases in the pore space of <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> series thus providing additional constraints on their aptitude to act as barriers for the confinement of fluids and gases. Earlier work in the frame of research on radioactive waste disposal had allowed the prototyping of degassing cells for gas characterisation of shale rock drilling cores [3, 4, 5]. Here we present a method making use of steel degassing cells specifically designed for large core samples and of CF-IRMS to determine C, H and O isotope ratios on the extracted gases [7]. After placing the core sample in the cell, atmospheric contamination is eliminated by several flushing cycles with an inert gas. The cell is then sealed to allow degassing over several months until the gas composition is stabilised. This process is monitored for gas pressure, temperature and relative humidity; regular measurements of bulk chemical gas composition are performed using gas chromatography. Once stabilised, the gas is recovered from the cell and transferred into He-conditioned vials. Carbon and oxygen of CO 2 are measured by Gasbench-IRMS on a Thermo Finnigan Delta plus XP continuous flow mass spectrometer. delta 13 C and delta 2 H of alkanes are determined after manual injection by GC-IRMS combining a Thermo Electron Trace GC Ultra and a Delta plus XP GC-IRMS. Standard deviations are less than 0. 5 ‰ for delta 13 C, and 5 ‰ for delta 2 H, respectively. Required concentrations for determinations of the different alkanes vary between 300 and 900 ppmv. The influence of sample volume and time lapse before analysis was investigated. For concentrations < 500 ppmv (1 to 10 ml injection volume) a N 2 -cooled PTV system including a Carbosieve liner was tested for different trapping-and desorption temperatures. The method was tested on a synthetic gas mixture and on natural samples obtained from cores from different depths (780 to 974 m) in the Opalinus Clay (Middle Jurassic) of the Mont Terri underground rock laboratory (Jura, Switzerland) ...|$|E

This process is called isotopic homogenization in the depositional environment. Some special care must be taken with respect to sampling, sample grain size, depositional setting, and mineralogical composition. Nevertheless, questions still remain when concerning this methodology, particularly on the real occurrence and extent of the isotopic homogenization in the sedimentary environments.

50|$|Illite is a non-expanding clay {{crystalline}} mineral. Illite is {{a secondary}} mineral precipitate phyllosilicate or layered alumino-silicate. Its structure is a 2:1 clay of silica tetrahedron - alumina octahedron - silica tetrahedron layers. The space between individual clay crystals {{is occupied by}} poorly hydrated potassium cations {{which is responsible for}} the absence of swelling. Structurally, illite is quite similar to muscovite with slightly more silicon, magnesium, iron, and water and slightly less tetrahedral aluminium and interlayer potassium. The chemical formula is given as (K,H3O)(Al,Mg,Fe)2(Si,Al)4O10(OH)2,(H2O), but there is considerable ion (isomorphic) substitution. It occurs as aggregates of small monoclinic grey to white crystals. Due to the small size, positive identification usually requires x-ray diffraction or SEM-EDS (automated mineralogy) analysis. Illite occurs as an altered product of muscovite and feldspar in weathering and hydrothermal environments; it may be a component of sericite. It is common in sediments, soils, and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> as well as in some low grade metamorphic rocks. The iron rich member of the illite group, glauconite, in sediments can be differentiated by x-ray analysis.|$|R
40|$|Mudrocks are {{a diverse}} group of very {{fine-grained}} <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> that are frequently encountered in most types of engineering projects. Upon excavation, the release of overburden stress and changes in the moisture content may cause certain apparently well indurated mudrocks to slake, producing a soil-like material. Because many mudrocks are nondurable, they have gained a reputation as problematic soft rocks. Geologists and engineers are confronted with the problem of selecting adequate parameters for accurately evaluating engineering behavior of mudrocks. The use of a single parameter (e. g. grain-size) is never considered to be enough and a combination of several parameters are normally preferred for the classification of mudrocks. Compressive strength, slake durability index, plasticity characteristics, swelling potential, absorption and density are some of the parameters that had been used by several investigators in the past. In order to overcome this problem, considerable research attention has recently been devoted to the use of geological properties (grain size, clay content and clay composition, texture, fracture frequency, degree of lamination, etc.) in conjunction with the engineering characteristics for classification purposes.

40|$|The Tyrone Igneous Complex of Northern Ireland {{forms an}} {{integral}} part of the Grampian-Taconic orogen, linking the well documented sectors of Scotland, western Ireland and Newfoundland. The orogen records the accretion of a series of peri-Laurentian affinity arcs, ophiolites and microcontinental blocks to the Laurentian margin between the Late Cambrian and Middle Ordovician. The Tyrone Igneous Complex is broadly divisible into two distinct units: the c. 484 - 480 Ma ophiolitic Tyrone Plutonic Group and the structurally overlying c. 475 - 469 Ma arc-related Tyrone Volcanic Group. Both were intruded by a synvolcanogenic and syncollisional, to postcollisional high-level ensialic intrusive suite between c. 470 and 464 Ma associated with their coeval obduction to an outboard peri-Laurentian microcontinental block, the Tyrone Central Inlier, at c. 470 Ma. The Tyrone Plutonic Group is principally composed of amphibolite-facies layered and isotropic gabbros, sheeted dolerite dykes and rare pillow lavas. Tholeiitic suprasubduction affinity geochemical characteristics, Nd- isotope constraints, zircon inheritance, and the presence of late Fe-Ti enriched post-obduction dykes suggest the Tyrone Plutonic Group formed above a N-dipping subduction zone by the propagation of a spreading centre into a microcontinental block. The Tyrone Volcanic Group is characterized by mafic to intermediate lavas, tuffs, rhyolite, banded chert, ironstone and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> cut by numerous high-level synvolcanogenic intrusive rocks. Geochemical signatures are consistent with formation in an evolving peri-Laurentian island-arc which underwent several episodes of rifting. High LILE and LREE enrichment, calc- alkaline geochemical signatures and strongly negative ?Nd t values suggest the Tyrone arc was at least partially founded on a fragment of microcontinental crust, which may have rifted off the Tyrone Central Inlier during the formation of the Tyrone Plutonic Group. Stong temporal, stratigraphic, and geochemical correlations with elements within the Annieopsquotch Accretionary Tract of Newfoundland suggest the Tyrone Igneous Complex represents a third phase of arc-ophiolite obuction in the Irish Caledonides during the Grampian-Taconic orogeny and may potentially host significant VMS mineralization. Through a combination of field mapping and petrochemistry several stratigraphic horizons have been identified in the Tyrone Igneous Complex, favourable for the formation and preservation of VMS deposits. Each is closely associated with hydrothermal alteration, synvolcanogenic faults and high-level synvolcanogenic intrusions of dolerite, gabbro, diorite and tonalite. Episodic rifting is recorded by the eruption of: abundant non-arc type Fe-Ti enriched eMORB (‘icelandite’), island-arc tholeiite, OIB-like alkali basalt, high-temperature tholeiitic rhyolites with flat to U-shaped REE profiles, and high-Zr rhyolites, within the calc-alkaline dominated sequence. Rift related mafic lavas occur in the hangingwall to VMS-style mineralization and are closely associated with ironstones (often Au-bearing) and/or <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> representing volcanic quiescence. Extensive hydrothermal alteration, characterized by Na-depletion, high Ba/Sr, Bi, Sb, Ni, CCPI, AI and variable MgO and CaO, allows specific target areas to be identified. In the lower bimodal-mafic Tyrone arc and backarc, hydrothermal alteration is associated with Zn-Cu mineralized float. Pb-Zn-Cu-Au mineralization occurs in silicified auriferous rhyolite domes/flows and/or volcaniclastic rocks of the syncollisional bimodal-felsic upper Tyrone arc.

40|$|Diagenesis {{refers to}} the process, and the changes (usually {{excluding}} cation exchange) {{that take place in}} sediments after deposition, but definitions of the process vary widely over which changes, and what part (or all) of the time between the transportation of the sediment and the time that the <b>sediment(ary</b> <b>rock)</b> is studied, should be included in diagenesis. Furthermore, Weaver, Griffin, and others, have favored alternative xplana-tions to account for many clay mineral distributions that previously have been interpreted as representing changes in clay minerals in both recent and ancient sediments, and which were referred to diagenesis. Although agreeing that such alternative xplanations account best for many distribu-tions of clay minerals, additional evidence that presumably is convincing of diagenesis is presented herein to account for the formation of certain other occurrences ofglauconitic mica, glauconite, illite, eorrensite, kaolinite, and vanadlferous micaceous clay. A two-stage mechanism isproposed for a possible process by which illite and probably corrcnsitc are formed: (1) cation sorption driven by energy (activities) of the ions in solution, and binding energy of the clay minerals, and (2) subsequent rearrangement of ions in the clay mineral to produce illitc. It is finally proposed that diagenesis of clay minerals is character-ized by the addition to and incorporation i to them of Me ions, such as Mg, K, Ca, Na, A 1, Fc, V, SlOe, and others, driven mainly by chemical energy and aided by mechanical and thermal energy, but as the latter two become more effective the process is designated metamorphism (anamorphism).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the progressive growth of continental margins and the evolution of continental crust, we must first understand the formation of allochthonous ophiolitic and island-arc terranes within ancient orogens and the nature of their accretion. During the early Paleozoic closure of the Iapetus Ocean, diverse sets of arc terranes, oceanic tracts, and ribbon-shaped microcontinental blocks were accreted to the passive continental margin of Laurentia during the Grampian-Taconic orogeny. In the northern Appalachians in central Newfoundland, Canada, three distinct phases of arc-ophiolite accretion have been recognized. New field mapping, high-resolution airborne geophysics, whole-rock and Nd-isotope geochemistry, and U-Pb zircon geochronology within the Tyrone Volcanic Group of Northern Ireland have allowed all three episodes to now be correlated into the British and Irish Caledonides. The Tyrone Volcanic Group (ca. 475 – 469 Ma) is characterized by mafic to intermediate lavas, tuffs, rhyolite, banded chert, ferruginous jasperoid, and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> cut by numerous high-level intrusive rocks. Geochemical signatures are consistent with formation within an evolving peri-Laurentian island-arc/backarc, which underwent several episodes of intra-arc rifting prior to its accretion at ca. 470 Ma to an outboard peri-Laurentian microcontinental block. Outriding microcontinental blocks played a fundamental role within the orogen, explaining the range of ages for Iapetan ophiolites and the timing of their accretion, as well as discrepancies between the timing of ophiolite emplacement and the termination of the Laurentian Cambrian–Ordovician shelf sequences. Accretion of the Tyrone arc and its associated suprasubduction-zone ophiolite represents the third stage of arc-ophiolite emplacement to the Laurentian margin during the Grampian-Taconic orogeny in the British and Irish Caledonides. ...|$|R
40|$|Although volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) {{deposits}} {{can form}} within {{a wide variety}} of rift-related tectonic environments, most are preserved within suprasubduction affinity crust related to ocean closure. In stark contrast to the VMS-rich Appalachian sector of the Grampian-Taconic orogeny, VMS mineralization is rare in the peri-Laurentian British and Irish Caledonides. Economic peri-Gondwanan affinity deposits are limited to Avoca and Parys Mountain. The Tyrone Igneous Complex of Northern Ireland represents a ca. 484 – 464 Ma peri-Laurentian affinity arc–ophiolite complex and a possible broad correlative of the Buchans-Robert’s Arm belt of Newfoundland, host {{to some of the most}} metal-rich VMS deposits globally. Stratigraphic horizons prospective for VMS mineralization in the Tyrone Igneous Complex are associated with rift-related magmatism, hydrothermal alteration, synvolcanic faults, and high-level subvolcanic intrusions (gabbro, diorite, and/or tonalite). Locally intense hydrothermal alteration is characterized by Na-depletion, elevated SiO 2, MgO, Ba/Sr, Bi, Sb, chlorite–carbonate–pyrite alteration index (CCPI) and Hashimoto alteration index (AI) values. Rift-related mafic lavas typically occur in the hanging wall sequences to base and precious metal mineralization, closely associated with ironstones and/or <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> representing low temperature hydrothermal venting and volcanic quiescence. In the ca. 475 Ma pre-collisional, calc-alkaline lower Tyrone Volcanic Group rift-related magmatism is characterized by abundant non-arc type Fe-Ti-rich eMORB, island-arc tholeiite, and low-Zr tholeiitic rhyolite breccias. These petrochemical characteristics are typical of units associated with VMS mineralization in bimodal mafic, primitive post-Archean arc terranes. Following arc-accretion at ca. 470 Ma, late rifting in the ensialic upper Tyrone Volcanic Group is dominated by OIB-like, subalkaline to alkali basalt and A-type, high-Zr rhyolites. These units are petrochemically favorable for Kuroko-type VMS mineralization in bimodal-felsic evolved arc terranes. The scarcity of discovered peri-Laurentian VMS mineralization in the British and Irish Caledonides is due to a combination of minimal exploration, poor-preservation of upper ophiolite sequences, and limited rifting in the Lough Nafooey arc of western Ireland. The geological and geochemical characteristics of the Tyrone Volcanic Group of Northern Ireland and peri-Gondwanan affinity arc/backarc sequences of Ireland and northwest Wales represent the most prospective sequences in the British and Irish Caledonides for VMS mineralization...|$|R
40|$|The {{geochemistry}} of the REE (rare earth elements) in oceanic sediments is discussed, based {{mainly on}} samples from DSDP Holes 530 A and 530 B, Leg 75, and Hole 525 A, Leg 74.

The Ce anomaly of marine carbonate {{was used as an}} indicator of paleo-ocean water redox conditions: the bottom water of the Angola Basin was in a reducing condition in the Cretaceous. At ca. 54 My, the South Atlantic water condition became oxidizing, similar to the present seawater redox condition. This change was related to the improvement of circulation due to the widening of South Atlantic and the subsidence of water circulation barriers such as the Walvis Ridge and perhaps the Romanche Fracture Zone. The younger (Eocene-Recent) and older (Albian-Santonian) <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> from 530 A (denoted as YSAB and OSAB respectively) show different degrees of Eu depletion with a transition period in between. The REE patterns of OSAB suggest a basaltic origin. The possible sources are Kaoko basalt in Southwest Africa or Namibia and the basaltic Walvis Ridge itself. The decrease in the area covered by Kaoko basalt due to erosion, the subsidence of the Walvis Ridge, and the improvement of water circulation led to changes in the Eu anomaly from Campanian to Paleocene, and resulted in the YSAB REE pattern. Changes in the Sm/Eu, La/Th, Th/Yb, Ti/Al 2 O 3, FeO/Al 2 O 3, and Hf/Al 2 O 3 ratios suggest changes of average source rock composition from and esite to granodiorite. The REE abundances and patterns of younger sediments in the Angola Basin (YSAB) are very similar to those observed in NASC, PAAS, and ES sediments. The YSAB REE abundances and patterns may represent the average REE distribution of the exposed African continental crust. The strong resemblance of REE distributions of YSAB, NASC, PAAS and ES suggests thorough REE mixing from different sources and the uniformity of the average crustal compositions of different continents: Africa, North America, Australia, and Europe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDraa Sfar is a siliciclastic–felsic, volcanogenic massive {{sulphide}} (VMS) Zn–Pb–Cu deposit located 15 km {{north of}} Marrakesh within the Jebilet massif {{of the western}} Moroccan Meseta. The Draa Sfar deposit occurs within the Sarhlef series, a volcano-sedimentary succession that hosts other massive sulphide deposits (e. g., Hajar, Kettara) within the dominantly siliciclastic sedimentary succession of the lower Central Jebilet. At Draa Sfar, the footwall lithofacies are dominated by grey to black argillite, carbonaceous argillite and intercalated siltstone with localized rhyodacitic flows and domes, associated in situ and transported autoclastic deposits, and lesser dykes of aphanitic basalt and gabbro. Thin- to thick-bedded, black carbonaceous argillite, minor intercalated siltstone, and a large gabbro sill dominate the hanging wall lithofacies. The main lithologies strike NNE–SSW, parallel to a pronounced S 1 foliation, and have a low-grade, chlorite–muscovite–quartz–albite–oligoclase metamorphic assemblage. The Draa Sfar deposit consists of two stratabound sulphide orebodies, Tazakourt {{to the south and}} Sidi M'Barek to the north. Both orebodies are hosted by argillite in {{the upper part of the}} lower volcano-sedimentary unit. The Tazakourt and Sidi M'Barek orebodies are highly deformed, sheet-like bodies of massive pyrrhotite (up to 95 % pyrrhotite) with lesser sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and pyrite. The Draa Sfar deposit formed within a restricted, sediment-starved, fault-controlled, anoxic, volcano-sedimentary rift basin. The deposit formed at and below the seafloor within anoxic, pelagic muds. The <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> that surround the Draa Sfar orebodies are characterized by a pronounced zonation of alteration assemblages and geochemical patterns. In the more proximal volcanic area to the south, the abundance of medium to dark green chlorite progressively increases within the argillite toward the base of the Tazakourt orebody. Chlorite alteration is manifested by the replacement of feldspar and a decrease in muscovite abundance related to a net addition of Fe and Mg and a loss of K and Na. In the volcanically distal and northern Sidi M'Barek orebody alteration within the footwall argillite is characterized by a modal increase of sericite relative to chlorite. A calcite–quartz–muscovite assemblage and a pronounced decrease in chlorite characterize argillite within the immediate hanging wall to the entire Draa Sfar deposit. The sympathetic lateral change from predominantly sericite to chlorite alteration within the footwall argillite with increasing volcanic proximity suggests that the higher temperature part of the hydrothermal system is coincident with a volcanic vent defined by localized rhyodacitic flow/domes within the footwall succession...|$|R
40|$|In many cases, {{when dealing}} with <b>argillaceous</b> {{fine-grained}} <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks,</b> the isotopic ages obtained from Rb–Sr whole-rock isochron calculations are of geological significance, {{despite the fact that}} the initial conditions of Sr isotopic homogenization are not fulfilled. To explain this, a mechanical mixing during deposition has been suggested, leading to an aggregate of mixed material with fairly uniform 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values, whatever Rb/Sr ratio is found in the analysed samples. This investigation of the behaviour of Rb and Sr during sedimentation and early diagenesis, involves study of more than 60 samples of fine-grained recent sediments from selected coastal localities of Brazil. The results indicate that pelitic samples from some recent to present-day transitional or shallow marine environments, such as the Jacarepagu´a tidal flat and the Amazonas River mouth, where halmirolysis could have occurred, may produce nearly horizontal best-fit lines in a Rb–Sr isochron diagram. Moreover, the initial isotopic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios appear to be well above 0. 710. In open marine environments, such as the Campos Basin, where sampling was spread over more than 100 metres, exchanges between the argillaceous sediments and seawater potentially happen at low temperature, inducing a reduction of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic composition of the sediments to nearly 0. 710. An almost horizontal best-fit line is produced for the entire stratigraphic section, independent of the sedimentation age. We believe that in similar environments such ‘zero age isochrons’ are maintained for some time, testifying to exchanges between the sediment and the interstitial fluids, before the onset of burial diagenesis. The above described studies on fine-grained and recent argillaceous sediments seem to confirm the production of horizontal best-fit lines in isochron diagrams, justifying the application of the Rb–Sr whole-rock method to pelitic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> The nature of the material is critical.

25|$|Chemical <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> forms when mineral {{constituents}} in solution become supersaturated and inorganically precipitate. Common chemical <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> include oolitic limestone and rocks composed of evaporite minerals, such as halite (rock salt), sylvite, barite and gypsum.|$|R
25|$|The first {{recognition}} of widespread <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> on Mars {{came from the}} Mars Orbiter Camera which found that several areas of the planet - including Valles Marineris and Terra Arabia - have horizontally layered, light-toned rocks. Follow-up observations of those rocks' mineralogy by OMEGA found that some are rich in sulfate minerals, and that other layered rocks around Mawrth Vallis are rich in phyllosilicates. Both class of minerals are signatures of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> CRISM has used its improved spatial resolution to look for other deposits of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> on Mars' surface, and for layers of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> buried between layers of volcanic rock in Mars' crust.|$|R

The palynological content and preservation is similar to palynofloras described from the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> that crop out at the Fossilryggen nunatak to the south-east, therefore, {{it seems likely that}} the Fossilryggen area represents the source of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> samples in the Basen till. This is further supported by known ice flow directions obtained from striations and clast fabric measurements in the area...|$|R

50|$|The Newport Formation (NSW) are <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> {{occurring}} in the Sydney Basin in eastern Australia. This stratum is up to 49 metres thick. Formed in the mid-Triassic, {{it is part of}} the Narrabeen Group of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Sedimentary breccia {{is a type}} of clastic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> {{which is}} made of angular to subangular, {{randomly}} oriented clasts of other <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> A conglomerate, by contrast, is a <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> composed of rounded fragments or clasts of pre-existing rocks. Both breccia and conglomerate are composed of fragments averaging greater than [...] in size. The angular shape of the fragments indicates that the material has not been transported far from its source.|$|R
