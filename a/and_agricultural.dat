5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1920s, {{the role of the}} Catholic Church grew. This was {{encouraged}} by the Belgian government, since the priests knew the country well and facilitated its administration. Many Rwandans (including elite Tutsi) converted, since Catholicism was an increasing prerequisite for social advancement. King Musinga refused to convert, and in 1931 he was deposed by the Belgian administration; his eldest son, Mutara III Rudahigwa, succeeded him and eventually became Rwanda's first Christian king. During the 1930s the Belgians introduced large-scale projects in education, health, public works <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> supervision, including new crops <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> techniques to improve food supply. Though Rwanda was modernised the Tutsis remained in power, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised and subject to large-scale forced labour. In 1935 Belgium introduced identity cards, labelling an individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. Although wealthy Hutu had previously been able to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards ended further social mobility.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} globalization {{patterns in}} the Slovenian <b>agricultural</b> <b>and</b> food trade. It examines prevailing trade structures and trade types to study differences and similarities in trade specialization patterns between primary <b>and</b> processed <b>agricultural</b> <b>and</b> food products across product groups, over time and in comparison with some other European Union countries. We distinguish <b>agricultural</b> <b>and</b> food trade flows by the degree of processing on primary, processed <b>and</b> other <b>agricultural</b> <b>and</b> food products separately for direct household consumption and for industry. With this, we add to the existent literature for Slovenia and for other new European Union members this product classification. Most of Slovenian <b>agricultural</b> <b>and</b> food trade is in the processed products. One-way or inter-industry trade dominates Slovenian <b>agricultural</b> <b>and</b> food trade structures. Within the matched two-way or intra-industry trade the significance in specialization is on low-quality vertical intra-industry trade. This kind of trade types in <b>agricultural</b> <b>and</b> food trade structures is {{not consistent with the}} findings for countries with developed food processing, suggesting that restructuring of the Slovenian food-processing sector has not yet been completed. agri-food, trade-structures, trade-types, intra-industry trade...|$|R
