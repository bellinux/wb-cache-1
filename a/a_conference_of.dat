5|$|The ECSC {{was founded}} by the Treaty of Paris in 1951; however, there was no {{decision}} on where to base {{the institutions of the}} new community. The treaties allowed for the seat(s) to be decided by common accord of governments, and at <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> the ECSC members on 23 July 1952 no permanent seat was decided.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Kentucky's citizens believed {{the state should}} be a mediator between the North and South. On December 9, 1860, Kentucky Governor Beriah Magoffin {{sent a letter to}} the other slave state governors, suggesting that they come to an agreement with the North that would include strict enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, a division of common territories at the 37th parallel, a guarantee of free use of the Mississippi River, and a Southern veto over slave legislation. Magoffin proposed <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> slave states, followed by <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> all the states to secure the concessions. Because of the escalating pace of events, neither conference was held.|$|E
5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty. This {{would have the}} advantage that as few as 20 or 30 economically and geographically diverse countries could establish a UNPA, and it could expand as more countries ratified the treaty. Strauss notes {{that this is the}} method by which most international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and International Criminal Court, were founded. The way to get started presumably would be to hold <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E

5|$|After Congress adjourned on August 6, 1861, Burnett {{returned}} home to Cadiz and spoke {{at a number of}} pro-Southern rallies. On September 4, 1861, Confederate Major General Leonidas Polk violated Kentucky's neutrality by ordering Brigadier General Gideon Johnson Pillow to occupy Columbus. In response, Ulysses S. Grant captured Paducah on September 6, 1861. With neutrality no longer a tenable option, Burnett presided over <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky's Southern sympathizers that occurred at Russellville between October 29 and October 31, 1861. The self-appointed delegates to this conference called for a sovereignty convention on November 18, 1861 for the purpose of establishing a Confederate government for the state.|$|E
5|$|As the {{economic}} situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuro≈Ñ and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the (still) ruling party {{of some of its}} burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, the eight-hour day {{had become}} common in American industry. One {{exception}} was in steel mills, where workers labored through a twelve-hour workday, {{seven days a}} week. Hoover considered this practice barbaric, and got Harding to convene <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> steel manufacturers {{with a view to}} ending it. The conference established a committee under the leadership of U. S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed in the press, and public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.|$|E

Both Harding and Hoover realized something more than an agreement was needed, but Congress was slow to act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927.|$|E

On {{the day that}} Higginbotham entered Antioch, one other black student was also admitted, Coretta Scott, who would later become Coretta Scott King after marrying Martin Luther King Jr.. At Antioch, Higginbotham served {{as the head of}} the college chapter of the NAACP. During <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> Ohio State collegiate NAACP chapters, Higginbotham successfully advocated for legislation to lower the voting age to 18.

5|$|Public {{perception}} in Germany was that Britain dictated Hanoverian policy. This {{was not the}} case. In 1832, Metternich introduced laws that curbed fledgling liberal movements in Germany. Britain's Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston opposed this, and sought William's influence to cause the Hanoverian government to take the same position. The Hanoverian government instead agreed with Metternich, much to Palmerston's dismay, and William declined to intervene. The conflict between William and Palmerston over Hanover was renewed the following year when Metternich called <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> the German states, {{to be held in}} Vienna, and Palmerston wanted Hanover to decline the invitation. Instead, the Viceroy accepted, backed fully by William.|$|E

5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E
5|$|By July 1923, The Advertiser {{newspaper}} was reporting that Leane's approach over his {{three years at}} the helm had made {{a significant difference in}} the administration of the South Australia Police, explaining that Leane had dispensed with seniority as the basis for promotion, by substituting merit and efficiency, as well as selecting candidates who displayed qualities of sympathy and tact in dealing with the public. In February 1925, Leane hosted <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> commissioners of police from around Australia held in Adelaide. Leane actively supported commemorative activities such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, and attended unveilings of memorials. In April 1926, Leane relinquished command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, and was placed on the unattached list. For his military service since 1905, he had also been awarded the Volunteer Officers' Decoration.|$|E
5|$|Currie {{regarded}} {{control of}} either Hill 70 or Sallaumines Hill as tactically {{more important than}} control {{of the city of}} Lens. Merely to occupy the city while the Germans held the high ground, would place the attackers in an unfavourably lower and more exposed position than the ones they occupied. At <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> corps commanders, Currie persuaded the First Army commander General Henry Horne to make Hill 70, not Lens, the main objective of the limited offensive. Controlling Hill 70 would provide excellent observation over the German lines, in preparation for more offensives. Currie believed the Germans would attempt to counter-attack if Hill 70 were captured, largely because of its observational importance. Nevertheless, Currie believed that the advantageous observational position of Hill 70 would permit well directed artillery to effectively deal with any counter-attacks. The plan was therefore to occupy the high ground quickly, establish defensive positions and utilize combined small arms and artillery fire to repel expected counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible.|$|E

5|$|Dannatt went on {{to chair}} <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> welfare {{providers}} to military personnel {{in order to show}} that the Army understood the issues affecting its soldiers and to organise a series of smaller conferences, hosted by himself and Sir Freddie Viggers‚Äîthen Adjutant-General to the Forces‚Äîto discuss welfare issues with commanding officers across the UK. In 2007, Dannatt and his wife, Pippa, visited Headley Court, an MoD rehabilitation centre for wounded personnel, where the commanding officer informed the Dannatts of his desire for a swimming pool, but accepted that it was unlikely to receive government funding. Some time later, the Dannatts were introduced to Bryn and Emma Parry by Sarah-Jane Shirreff‚Äîthe wife of Sir Richard Shirreff‚Äîand the Dannatts assisted the Parrys with the formation of Help for Heroes, set up with the specific aim of funding the swimming pool at Headley Court. Dannatt initially worried that the charity's ‚Ç§2 million goal might be unattainable, but it eventually raised enough money to build both the pool and a gymnasium, which were opened in 2010. He and Pippa later assisted both Help For Heroes and SSAFA Forces Help in efforts to build houses to accommodate the families of wounded servicemen at Headley Court and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham, inspired by the difficulties faced by the family of George Cross recipient Peter Norton.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Gore {{spoke out}} {{on a number of}} issues. In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice {{attempted}} to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations. In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and nerve gas attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day on}} June 29, the KPAF {{returned}} to attack Suwon, and six sorties of North Korean aircraft strafed the airfield during the morning, but each time were driven off by American F-80s, {{and in the course}} of these attacks Lieutenant William T. Norris and Lieutenant Roy W. Marsh each shot down a North Korean aircraft. The North Koreans were able to destroy a single C-54 Skymaster parked at the airfield. The sorties culminated in a battle above Suwon in the midst of <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>of</b> US military leaders in the town. Leaders including US Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur personally witnessed the final sortie of the day, in which four North Korean aircraft attacked four F-51 Mustang aircraft over the town. The four F-51s succeeded in shooting down all four of the North Korean aircraft, with Lieutenant Orrin R. Fox scoring two kills and Lieutenants Richard J. Burns, and Harry T. Sandlin scoring one each. Ground forces also downed a North Korean aircraft during a subsequent attack. MacArthur subsequently authorized Stratemeyer to launch strikes into North Korea to destroy North Korean airfields and establish air superiority for the US forces.|$|E
