40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the curves of adsorption of Cu and Zn (surface horizons) was carried out on 13 <b>andosoil</b> profiles of the Canary Islands. The adsorption of Cu and Zn, {{as a function of}} the depth of the profile, was studied; the maximum capacity of adsorption of each horizon being calculated in two ways: one by blocking previously with KCL 1 N, and the other without using the KCL 1 N splutioon. The different factors which could affect these adsorptions were also studied. It was found that the shape of the curves, and the values of maximum adsorption were very similar within cach of the different groups of andosoils in the study. When the different groups of andosoils are compared great differences appcar, especially in the younger soils (vitrandepts) as against the rest of the groups, there being observed, in general, a decreased in the maximum values of adsortion, on passing from yhe younger to the older soils. We found that, in general, the adsorption of Cu and Zn decreases with the depth of the profile. The values of adsorption of Cu and Zn are always higher in the case of the samples not treated with KCl 1 N. We found from the statistical study, carried out on relating the adsorption of Cu and Zn with other properties of the soil (...|$|E
40|$|The total {{phosphorus}} in eight different <b>andosoil</b> profiles of Canary Islands, was determined using seven methods. SDome are specific such as; the attack by a mixture HF/HNO 2 (Ximenez Herrais, 1975) in a pressure reactor, and digestion with HCIO 4 (Jackson, 1964); and others non specific for {{total phosphorus}}, but nevertheless {{used for the}} study of phosphorus in soils; such as, the methods of Mehta (1954), Harrap (1963), Steward-Oades (1972), Saunders-Williams (1955) and Krivonosova (1972). The results obtained by the attack HF/HNO 2 give the highest values of all the methods used, white the HCIO 4 digestion largely used to determine total P in soils, gives even lower values than those obtained by the methods of Mehta and Krivonosova, used respectively for organic phosphorus and organic phosphate fractions. The procedures of Mehta and Krivonosova give acceptable values in the determination of total phosphorus in Canary Andosoils, white the other methods give values which are too low. Study of the regression lines of the total phosphorus values obtained by the various methods as against the attack by HF/HNO 3 shown in Graph nº 1, give us an overall idea of the effectiveness, trends, similarities and differences between all methods. It can also be that all methods should be good if the soils contain up to 1. 000 ppm of total phosphorus, white for higher values great differences are shown by the various methods. The content of phosphorus decreases according to the sequence : Vitrandepts, Evolved Vitrandepts, Dystrandepts and Integrades Andosoils-Brown Earths oligotrophic. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{principal}} {{methods for}} studying clay minerals in <b>andosoils</b> differ especially by {{the succession of}} the pretreatments, i. e. differential dissolution of amorphous mineral cements before (first method) or after (second method) the dispersion and recovery of granulometric fractions. The first method permits a rapid total quantitative estimation of amorphous components and an accurate identification of crystallized clay minerals by means of X-ray diffraction. The second method only proves the presence of allophane and imogolite. The two methods were applied in two different laboratories on the same soils from the Massif Central. The comparison of the results emphasizes the profit of using the two methods, especially if hypotheses on the mechanisms of clay genesis are to be proposed. These results, if placed {{in the context of}} a more comprehensive study, suggest the exist-ence of two principal phases of clay genesis, strongly connected to the evolution of organic matter in <b>andosoils,</b> as follows: (i) an early, prepedologic phase during which halloysites and smectites would form; (ii) a late phase giving rise especially to some kaolinite and gibbsite...|$|R

40|$|The Islet of Vila Franca do Campo, (S. Miguel Island, Azores) with 6, 2 ha, {{is located}} 500 m {{from the south}} coast. The geology, ecology, and {{cultural}} character, makes it a place with high landscape quality, very attractive for recreation, originating a highly sensitive landscape to recreation impacts. Landscape sensitivity assessment becomes therefore a crucial step {{in the development of}} a landscape and management plan, aiming to reconcile conservation with public recreation. The main objective of this work is to show the importance of geomorphology-pedology, together with other parameters (topographic features, plant communities and cultural resources) in assessing Islet landscape sensitivity. The methodology used was based in a parametric approach. Relative values were given to the different classes of geomorphology-pedology, vegetation and topography based on natural value and resistance to recreation use. The overlaying of these values enabled de assessment of the landscape sensitivity. The Islet is a volcanic cone of stratified palagonitic tuffs from the Holocene age. Besides, in the Northwest and South-Southwest summit zones pumiceous deposits with a trachyte composition occur. The exterior hillsides of the volcanic cone (mainly NW and W cliffs) are under intensive wind and marine erosion. The geomorphic dynamics evaluated by means of the morphogenesis/pedogenesis rate allowed to consider the following areas: (a) area on Morphogenesis processes (M). This area is submitted to relative intense ablation processes by creeping and rill erosion. The area correspond mainly to outcrops of palagonitic tuffs or pumice with different weathering stages and a zone with incipient soils; (b) area on Intergrade processes to Morphogenesis (IM) which is associated to steep slopes (> 25 %) incipient soils or <b>Andosoils</b> where mass movements are observed; (c) area on Intergrade processes to Pedogenesis (IP), located on the summit zone, correspond to <b>Andosoils</b> which can attain 200 cm depth. The Islet’s vegetation was classified according to its structure, dominant plants and natural significance, with special attention given to the communities holding endemic plants. In general, the Islet reveals an high landscape sensitivity, given by its biological, geomorphic, pedological and topographic significant features...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustained}} and uninterrupted plume degassing at Mount Etna volcano, Southern Italy, represents the troposphere’s most prominent natural source of fluorine. Of the ~ 200 Mg of fluorine (as HFg) emitted daily by the volcano, 1. 6 ± 2. 7 Mg are deposited by {{wet and dry}} deposition. Fluorine-deposition via volcanic ash, here characterised for the first time, can be quite significant during volcanic eruptions (i. e. 60 Mg of fluorine were deposited during the 2001 eruption through volcanic ash, corresponding to ~ 85 % of the total fluorine deposition). Despite {{the fact that these}} depositions are huge, the fate of the deposited fluorine {{and its impact on the}} environment are poorly understood. We herein present original data on fluorine abundance in vegetation (Castanea Sativa and Pinus Nigra) and <b>andosoils</b> from the volcano’s flank, in the attempt to reveal the potential impact of volcanogenic fluorine emissions. Fluorine contents in chestnut leaves and pine needles are in the range 1. 8 - 35 µg/g and 2. 1 - 74 µg/g respectively; they exceed the typical background concentrations in plants growing in rural areas, but fall within the lower range of typical concentrations in plants growing near high fluorine anthropogenic emission sources. The rare plume fumigations on the lower flanks of Mt Etna (distance > 4 km from summit craters) are probably the cause of the “undisturbed” nature of Etnean vegetation: climatic conditions, which limit the growth of vegetation on the upper regione deserta, are a natural limit to the development of more severe impacts. High fluorine contents, associated with visible symptoms, were only measured in pine needles at three sites, located near recently-active (2001 to 2003) lateral eruptive fractures. Total fluorine contents (FTOT) in the Etnean soils have a range of 112 - 341 µg/g, and fall within the typical range of undisturbed soils; fluorine extracted with distilled water (FH 2 O) have a range of 5. 1 to 61 µg/g and accounts for 2 - 40 % of FTOT. FH 2 O is higher in topsoils from the eastern flank (downwind), while it decreases with depth in soil profiles and on increasing soil grain size (thereby testifying to its association with clay-mineral-rich, fine soil fractions). The fluorine adsorption capacity of the <b>andosoils</b> acts as a natural barrier that protects the groundwater system...|$|R
40|$|Thirteen {{profiles}} of <b>andosoils</b> of the Canary Islands were studied. The object {{of this work}} was to study the distribution and dynamics of Cu and Zn in these profiles. The Cu does not accumulate in the surface horizons, which indicates {{to us that the}} organic material has not contributed to the enrichment of Cu in these horizons. The Zn accumulated in the surface in the surface horizons, the organic material not being the cause of this accumulation. The Cu contributed by the biological cycle to the surface horizons undergoes migration in depth as soluble and pseudosoluble complexes with the organic material. The loss of Cu in the surface horizons by this process of migration is higher than the Cu that reaches these horizons through the vegetative cycle. As a consequence the content of Cu increases with the depth of the profile. The Zn contributed by the biological cycle in the surface horizons, undergoes the same process of migration, but with less intesity. So the loss of Zn in the surface horizons due to this process is less than Zn which reaches these horizons through the vegetative cycle. Consequently the content of Zn decreases with the depth of the profile. Peer reviewe...|$|R
