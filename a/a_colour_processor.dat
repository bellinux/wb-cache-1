50|$|Value is {{the degree}} of {{lightness}} and darkness in <b>a</b> <b>colour.</b> The difference in values is called contrast. Value can relate to shades, where <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> gets darker by adding black to it, or tints, where <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> gets lighter by adding white to it.|$|R
5000|$|Straw [...] is <b>a</b> <b>colour,</b> <b>a</b> tone of pale yellow, {{the colour}} of straw. The first {{recorded}} use of straw as <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> name in English was in 1589.|$|R
50|$|Note that, as {{a natural}} {{corollary}} of the rules, the free ball is always <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> ball. If the ball on is a red, then by definition it cannot be snookered via another red, as it merely provides an alternative clean shot with another ball on. If the ball on is a red, and is snookered by <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> after <b>a</b> foul, then logically the red is either the final one or all reds are snookered by <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> ball, meaning the free ball has to be <b>a</b> <b>colour.</b> If the ball on is <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> ball that is snookered by a red, a previous red must have been successfully potted; the snooker therefore must be self-inflicted and cannot have occurred {{as the result of}} a foul. If the ball on is <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> that is snookered by another <b>colour</b> after <b>a</b> foul, all reds must have been already potted; thus the free ball still has to be <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> ball.|$|R
60|$|To which I answer, {{that there}} is a great {{difference}} between diluting <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> and whitening of it; for diluting <b>a</b> <b>colour,</b> is to make the colour'd parts more thin, so that the ting'd light, which is made by trajecting those ting'd bodies, does not receive so deep a tincture; but whitening <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> is onely <b>an</b> intermixing of many clear reflections of light among the same ting'd parts; deepning also, and darkning or blacking <b>a</b> <b>colour,</b> are very different; for deepning <b>a</b> <b>colour,</b> is to make the light pass through a greater quantity of the same tinging body; and darkning or blacking <b>a</b> <b>colour,</b> is onely interposing a multitude of dark or black spots among the same ting'd parts, or placing the <b>colour</b> in <b>a</b> more faint light.|$|R

Furthermore, Ck is finite as [...] It follows that the {{intersection}} {{of all of these}} sets is non-empty, and let [...] Then every colouring in D'k is the restriction of <b>a</b> <b>colouring</b> in D'k+1. Therefore, by unrestricting <b>a</b> <b>colouring</b> in D'k to <b>a</b> <b>colouring</b> in D'k+1, and continuing doing so, one constructs <b>a</b> <b>colouring</b> of [...] without any monochromatic set of size T.

5000|$|Rufous [...] is <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> {{that may}} be {{described}} as reddish-brown or brownish-red, as of rust or oxidised iron. The first recorded use of rufous as <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> name in English was in 1782. However, the colour is also recorded earlier in 1527 as <b>a</b> diagnostic urine <b>colour.</b>|$|R
25|$|On the HSV colour wheel, the {{complement}} of blue is yellow; that is, <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> corresponding to <b>an</b> equal mixture {{of red and}} green light.

30|$|Frequently {{the data}} to be {{displayed}} can assume {{both positive and negative}} values (e.g., for changes in precipitation, sunshine duration, wind speed, or humidity). In such a case, (i) the scale should indeed start at <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> <b>A,</b> then pass a mid-point for zero values with white <b>colour</b> (avoiding <b>a</b> signal <b>colour,</b> such as yellow) and continue to reach <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> B; (ii) the colour scale should be organized symmetrically, i.e., with zero in its centre, as given in the centre panel of Figure 2. The example in the left-hand panel of Figure 2 shows a selection to avoid, since it uses <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> scale that is applicable for properties that do not change sign.|$|R
