5|$|The {{earthquakes}} of Iran {{are a large}} {{concern to}} the populace and are an impediment to economic development. Twelve earthquakes with a Richter magnitude of over seven have occurred within the last century. Three-quarters of the major cities of Iran are in areas prone to major earthquakes. The 1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake, with at least 42,000 fatalities, cost Iran roughly 7.2 percent of its Gross National Product (GNP) for that year <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> out two years of economic growth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|Reshef sent another tank {{company to}} rescue the infantrymen. The tanks {{advanced}} towards the Chinese Farm from the south. As they neared the farm and the village, a downpour of anti-tank and artillery fire forced the company to retreat. Nathan kept pleading with Rehsef to send additional support, unaware he was facing superior Egyptian forces after entering the administrative bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. With no help coming, the unit commander had his men carry the wounded and attempted to leave the battlefield, tasking two sections of heavy machine guns with providing cover to the force. As the Israelis slowly made {{their way back to}} their lines, a group of Egyptian tanks intercepted <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> out the Israeli force.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to de-tect camera cuts <b>and</b> <b>wipes.</b> The approach projects a video into two images representing the spatio-tempoml continuity of a video life. Visually, these images are composed by regions of diferent patterns, each region represents the temporal location of a shot. The shape of a region boundary inherently classifies cut <b>and</b> <b>wipe,</b> <b>and</b> most importantly, marks the start and end of a wipe sequence. We hence formulate algorithms to lo-cate the color and texture discontinuities occurring at the boundaries of image regions. Keywords spatio-temporal image segmentation, camera cut <b>and</b> <b>wipe</b> detection. ...|$|R

5|$|After the Norman Conquest in 1066, feudal {{rule was}} {{established}} in Dorset and {{the bulk of the}} land was divided between the Crown and ecclesiastical institutions. The Normans consolidated their control over the area by constructing castles at Corfe, Wareham and Dorchester {{in the early part of}} the 12th century. Over the next 200 years Dorset's population grew substantially and additional land was enclosed for farming to provide the extra food required. The wool trade, the quarrying of Purbeck Marble and the busy ports of Weymouth, Melcombe Regis, Lyme Regis and Bridport brought prosperity to the county. However, Dorset was devastated by the bubonic plague in 1348 which arrived in Melcombe Regis on a ship from Gascony. The disease, more commonly known as the Black Death, created an epidemic that spread rapidly <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> out a third of the population of the country.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 18 April 1945, he led his company through the shell-battered, sniper-infested {{wreckage}} of Nuremberg, Germany. When blistering machinegun fire caught his unit in an exposed position, he ordered his men to take cover, dashed forward alone, and, as bullets whined about him, shot the 3-man guncrew with his carbine. Continuing the advance at the head of his company, he located an enemy patrol armed with rocket launchers which threatened friendly armor. He again went forward alone, secured a vantage point and opened fire on the Germans. Immediately he became the target for concentrated machine pistol and rocket fire, which blasted the rubble about him. Calmly, he continued to shoot at the patrol until he had killed all 6 enemy infantrymen. Continuing boldly far in front of his company, he entered a park, where as his men advanced, a German machinegun opened up on them without warning. With his carbine, he killed the gunner; and then, from a completely exposed position, he directed machinegun fire on the remainder of the crew until all were dead. In a final duel, he wiped out a third machinegun emplacement with rifle fire at a range of 10 yards. By fearlessly engaging in 4 single-handed fire fights with a desperate, powerfully armed enemy, Lt. DALY, voluntarily taking all major risks himself and protecting his men at every opportunity, killed 15 Germans, silenced 3 enemy machineguns <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> out an entire enemy patrol. His heroism during the lone bitter struggle with fanatical enemy forces was an inspiration to the valiant Americans who took Nuremberg.|$|E

25|$|The worst fire in Fall River's history {{occurred}} {{on the evening of}} February 2, 1928. It began when workers were dismantling the recently vacated Pocasset Mill. During the night the fire spread quickly <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> out a large portion of downtown. City Hall was spared but was badly damaged. Today, many of the structures near the corner of North Main and Bedford Street date from the early 1930s, as they were rebuilt soon after the fire.|$|E

With the pacification of any rebel elements in the east and the surrender of Nahavand in the west, the Abbasids were the undisputed rulers of Khorosan.|$|E

25|$|A {{distinction}} {{is to be}} made between the ninja from these areas, and commoners or samurai hired as spies or mercenaries.

These professional ninja were actively hired by daimyōs between 1485 and 1581, until Oda Nobunaga invaded Iga province <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> out the organized clans. Survivors were forced to flee, some to the mountains of Kii, but others arrived before Tokugawa Ieyasu, where they were well treated. Some former Iga clan members, including Hattori Hanzō, would later serve as Tokugawa's bodyguards.|$|E
25|$|Anti-military protest {{took place}} in {{dramatic}} form at Colorado State from 1968–70. On March 5, 1968, several hundred students and faculty with anti-war sentiments marched to Fort Collins' downtown War Memorial <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> blood on a placard tied to the memorial. Hecklers and blockaders created such a disturbance that police had to disperse the non-marchers. In May, 1970, as campus peace activists held {{the second day of}} a student strike in the gymnasium in response to the U.S. invasion of Cambodia and the student deaths at Kent State University, one or more arsonists set Old Main ablaze, destroying the 92-year-old cornerstone of Colorado State.|$|E
25|$|The Hanthawaddy command {{nevertheless}} {{was confident}} that they could pacify the entire Upper Burma countryside. At first the strategy seemed to work.

The Hanthawaddy officer stationed at Singu, about 30 miles north of Ava, sent a detachment of 50 men to secure allegiance of the Mu valley. Alaungpaya personally led forty of his best men to meet the detachment at Halin, south of Shwebo, <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> them out. It was 20 April 1752 (Thursday, 4th waxing of Kason 1114 ME).|$|E
