In particular, we extensively survey the features that can be efficiently extracted from compressed video <b>and</b> <b>audio,</b> which include visual, motion, coding, <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> features. We also discuss typical applications of these compressed-domain features in video <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> indexing <b>and</b> analysis. Finally, we give a summary of important visual <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> descriptors in the current MPEG- 7 standard draft, and discuss the possibility of extracting these descriptors directly from compressed video <b>and</b> <b>audio...</b>|$|R
