5|$|To silence Luna, Aguinaldo {{appointed}} him as Chief of War Operations on 26 September 1898, and assigned {{the rank of}} brigadier general. In quick succession, he was made the Director or Assistant Secretary of War and Supreme Chief of the Republican Army on 28 September, arousing {{the envy of the}} other generals who were fighting since {{the first phase of the}} Revolution. Meanwhile, Luna felt that bureaucratic placebos were being thrown his way, when <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> was to organize and discipline the enthusiastic but ill-fed and ill-trained troops into a real army.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May the Dutch {{commander}} General Winkelman {{was faced}} with two priorities. First of <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to eliminate the German airborne troops. Though the strategic assault had failed, he feared a further enemy build-up via Waalhaven and saw the German possession of the Moerdijk bridges as a serious impediment to the movement of allied reinforcements to the Fortress Holland. The second priority was {{closely related to the}} first: enabling the French army to build up a strong defensive line in North Brabant, to connect the Fortress Holland with the Allied main force in Belgium. As he had withdrawn most of his troops from the area, Winkelman had only limited means available to influence this process, largely leaving the task to local commanders.|$|E
5|$|During {{the court}} case, Huseby {{stated that he}} wanted help from society and {{attention}} drawn to his cause. However, he stated that he regretted doing this by hijacking. He stated that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> was {{to send a message}} to the minister of justice and prime minister that he needed help, and that he did not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of preventive supervision.|$|E

5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, he felt as if his own life was fake and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> was to be acknowledged for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E
25|$|Rizal sent many {{specimens}} of animals, insects, and plants for identification to the (Anthropological and Ethnographical Museum of Dresden), Dresden Museum of Ethnology. It {{was not in}} his interest to receive any monetary payment; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> were scientific books, magazines and surgical instruments which he needed and used in Dapitan.|$|E
25|$|When war {{appeared}} inevitable {{he resigned}} his Royal commission and volunteered his {{services to the}} colonies. He expected to be named Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, as {{he was the most}} experienced candidate in terms of military service. On the other hand, he was born in Britain, somewhat eccentric, slovenly in appearance, coarse in language, and perhaps most of <b>all,</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to be paid: by joining the rebellion, he forfeited all his properties in England, and wanted to be compensated.|$|E

25|$|Louis Coulon de Villiers, who did {{not know}} when British {{reinforcements}} might arrive, sent an officer under a white flag to negotiate. Washington did not allow the Canadian officer into or near the fort, but sent two of his own men, including his translator Jacob Van Braam, to negotiate. As negotiations began, the Virginians, against Washington's orders, broke into the fort's liquor supply and got drunk. Coulon told Van Braam that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> was the surrender of the garrison, and the Virginians could go back to Virginia. He warned, however, that if they did not surrender now, the Indians might storm the fort and scalp the entire garrison.|$|E
25|$|Rabi {{felt that}} {{to compete with}} the University of Chicago, Columbia needed to have access to a {{research}} reactor too; but the cost was greater than Columbia could afford without collaborating with other institutions, government assistance, or both. On January 16, 1946, Pegram convened a meeting of representatives of 16 different colleges, universities, hospitals and research institutions like the Bell Telephone Laboratories. The meeting drafted a request to the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., asking him to establish a regional research laboratory near New York City. In response, Groves sent Colonel Kenneth Nichols to meet with Pegram and Rabi and their opposite numbers from Princeton University, Hugh S. Taylor and Henry D. Smyth on February 8. They found Nichols amenable to their idea; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to know was where it would be built, and who would run it.|$|E
25|$|Greg Madden {{is found}} dead weeks later. In {{the months that}} follow, Zach and Kendall enjoy their time with the newborn child. Problems arise here and there, but none {{like that of the}} Satin Slayer, a serial killer murdering the women of Fusion, a {{cosmetics}} company run by Kendall and her friends who helped to define it. The Satin Slayer takes Kendall hostage, and when it is revealed that the Satin Slayer is actually Zach's estranged father, Alexander Cambias, Sr., thought to be dead, but obviously still very much alive and that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> is for Zach to have followed in his footsteps, Zach does everything in his power to save Kendall, as it all culminates on a balcony outside of a hotel room. Zach's father sets a contraption around Kendall's neck, which will kill her if its detonator goes off. Zach and Alexander struggle as Zach gets a hold of the detonator and will not let it go, even as he is shot in the arm by Alexander. Zach is able to sneak a spare knife from the sheath at his ankle and throw it hard enough at Alexander so that Alexander drops his gun. Zach rescues Kendall. He is determined to kill his father, but help soon arrives, and Alexander is sent to jail.|$|E

Dean Dull shouted into the camera, [...] "I'm Dean of Students Jim Dull and I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech. Good Morning, America!" [...] Dull {{was on the}} show because he had won a make-a-wish contest. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> was for the Ramblin' Wreck, gold-clad students, and himself {{to be on the}} ABC morning show and ABC granted the wish.|$|E
500|$|Knowing that Liz {{will not}} break off with Danny, Jack tells Danny {{he knows about}} the two.

After Sue returns from a night of partying, Tracy tells her that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to do was to}} be a father figure to her. Liz enters Tracy's {{dressing}} room—with the mustache intact—to take Sue back to the writers' room, as Liz had been looking for her. At the end, Tracy wonders if he can go through his experience with Sue if he has a daughter, to which Kenneth says he thinks he can.|$|E
500|$|Late in his life, Alf wrote a {{manuscript}} detailing {{his life story}} which he bequeathed to John. It was Alf's attempt {{to fill in the}} lost years when he had not been in contact with his son, and to explain that it was Julia, and not Alf, who had broken up their marriage. John later commented: [...] "You know, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> was for me to hear his side of the story, which I hadn't heard." [...] By 1976, Alfred was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer and Pauline contacted John via Apple Corps {{to make sure that he}} was aware that his father was dying. John sent a large bouquet of flowers to the hospital and phoned Alf on his deathbed, apologising for his (John's) past behaviour. On 1 April 1976, Alf Lennon died in Brighton.|$|E

500|$|Trials and Tribulations {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Shu Takumi, with art by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. After development of the original Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was finished, Takumi's boss, Shinji Mikami, told him that they should make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided making a lot of changes: art for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused from the first game, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for Justice for <b>All.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> the series to end with Trials and Tribulations, as he had explored Phoenix's character fully and wanted to avoid the series becoming [...] "a shadow of its former self", saying that he thinks {{it is important to know}} when to end a story.|$|E

He was frightened, but he said that most of <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to help others, especially sick children. [...] He decided he would like to be a missionary.|$|E

2500|$|In the [...] "painful {{situation}} in which I feel myself placed", Fitzwilliam appealed to Burke's memory. However Milton assured his father that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> was permission to give reform his general support, to which Fitzwilliam acquiesced. When in summer 1822 Yorkshire reformers wanted a county meeting to push for reform, Milton said of his father: [...] "I do feel very great difficulty upon one which agitates him to a degree which cannot be conceived {{by those who have}} not been in the habit of conversing with him upon it. It is indeed the only subject I know which deprives him of his usual calmness".|$|E
2500|$|Demonstrating {{early on}} a {{creative}} and quirky bent, in his junior year at Princeton, Kelley submitted a paper for a political science class about John F. Kennedy's plot to kill Fidel Castro, written as a poem. For his senior thesis, he turned the Bill of Rights into a play. [...] "I made each amendment into a character", he said. [...] "The First Amendment is a loudmouth guy who won't shut up. The Second Amendment guy, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to talk about was his gun collection. Then the 10th Amendment, the one where they say leave the rest for the states to decide, {{he was a guy}} with no self-esteem."
