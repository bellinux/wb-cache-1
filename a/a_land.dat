5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate.

5|$|During his 1904campaign to {{be elected}} governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised to drain the Everglades, and his later {{projects}} were more effective than Disston's.
