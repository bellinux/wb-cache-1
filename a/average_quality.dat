5|$|Under the {{influence}} of the collapsing of the Eastern Bloc, on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the freshly renamed Communist Party). A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. A 1997 reform package restored economic growth, but living standards continued to suffer. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status. It became a member of NATO in 2004 and participated in the War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms it joined the European Union in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption.|$|E

40|$|A {{concept of}} a mean or dose <b>averaged</b> <b>quality</b> factor was defined in ICRP Publication 26 using {{relationships}} for quality factor {{as a function of}} LET. The concept of radiation weighting factors, wR, was introduced in ICRP Publication 60 in 1990. These are meant to be generalized factors that modify absorbed dose to reflect the risk of stochastic effects {{as a function of the}} quality of the radiation incident on the body or emitted by radioactivity within the body. The values of wr are equal to 20 for all alpha particles externally or internally emitted. This note compares the dose <b>averaged</b> <b>quality</b> factor for alpha particles originating in tissue using the old and revised recommendations for quality factor as a function of LET.

25|$|With over 20,000 extant pieces, Attic black-figure vases {{comprise}} {{the largest and}} at the same time most significant vase collection, second only to Attic red-figure vases. Attic potters benefitted from the excellent, iron-rich clay found in Attica. High quality Attic black-figure vases have a uniform, glossy, pitch-black coating and the color-intensive terra cotta clay foundation has been meticulously smoothened. Women’s skin is always indicated with a white opaque color, which is also frequently used for details such as individual horses, clothing or ornaments. The most outstanding Attic artists elevated vase painting to a graphic art, but a large number of <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> and mass-market products were also produced. The outstanding significance of Attic pottery comes from their almost endless repertoire of scenes covering a wide range of themes. These provide rich testimonials especially in regard to mythology, but also to daily life. On the other hand, there are virtually no images referring to contemporary events. Such references are only occasionally evident in the form of annotations, for example when kalos inscriptions are painted on a vase. Vases were produced for the domestic market on the one hand, and were important for celebrations or in connection with ritual acts. On the other hand, they were also an important export product sold throughout the Mediterranean area. For this reason most of the surviving vases come from Etruscan necropolises.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{positive}} reactions, reviewers {{brought up}} several {{issues with the}} game. The British video game publication PC Gamer UK was unhappy with the game, claiming that Electronic Arts chose to release a formulaic game {{because it was a}} safer choice than taking The Battle for Middle-earth II in another direction. PC Zone agreed with this view, claiming that although the game looked impressive, it took a by-the-numbers approach towards the real-time strategy genre in a [...] "mindless sort of way", concluding that [...] "in no way is it anywhere near the game we hoped for." [...] The game's multiplayer portion disappointed GameSpy, which found it too unbalanced compared to the heroes, whom they considered to be too strong. Eurogamer considered the game to be of <b>average</b> <b>quality,</b> noting that there were no truly redeeming qualities.|$|E

[...] Three reviewers from Electronic Gaming Monthly shared these sentiments regarding the game's <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> and cute design. A fourth reviewer gave a more rave review, calling the game a sleeper hit and stating the game becomes very challenging at the later levels and requires great technique to master. The most favorable review at the time came from Nintendo Magazine System, where the critics called {{it one of the}} best NES games they had played in a while. The reviewers highly praised the visuals, sound and difficulty of the game, with one reviewer saying that the desire to complete the game trumps over any such problems it has.|$|E

Around the same time he began work as a fire prevention engineer (an inspector) for the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. He was particularly good at the job and was highly commended by his employers. His job required him to travel to production facilities throughout New England to be inspected. One anecdote describes him arriving at a chemical plant in which he was denied access by the director because he would not allow anyone to see the production procedure which was a trade secret. Having been told what the plant produced, Whorf wrote a chemical formula on a piece of paper, saying to the director: [...] "I think this is what you're doing". The surprised director asked Whorf how he knew about the secret procedure, and he simply answered: [...] "You couldn't do it in any other way." ...|$|E
500|$|A few {{critics were}} {{negative}} about Metroid Prime Pinball. The reviewer from the Electronic Gaming Monthly video game magazine {{found it hard}} to see the pinball while playing the game, especially when it was in the area between the top and bottom Nintendo DS screens. With a limited selection of game modes, GamePros Rice Burner was disappointed with the game, and concluded that because every game mode features the same tabletops, Metroid Prime Pinball lacked variety, which Game Informers reviewer agreed with, noting that he would have had more fun with the game if he [...] "had access to a little more content". The minigames were criticized by Game Revolution, which claimed that there were too many minigames that were only of <b>average</b> <b>quality.</b> Furthermore, it asked the game's developer, Fuse Games, to spend more time making a great pinball game rather than several minor minigames, requesting [...] "a character-based game that's great at pinball rather than a fence-riding jack of all trades that is master of none". Eurogamer had a different experience, finding that the minigames provided more entertainment than the main game, which they remarked was a [...] "cardinal sin in pinball". They also criticized the tilt feature for being unintuitive and difficult to use. The reviewer for GamesMaster felt that Metroid Prime Pinball was directed more towards Metroid fans than pinball aficionados, calling it a [...] "flashy but insipid" [...] game.|$|E
500|$|After five issues, {{the title}} was changed to Marvel Tales; at the same time, the number of stories advertised as [...] "passionate" [...] or {{containing}} [...] "sin-lost" [...] or [...] "lust-crazed" [...] characters sharply increased. Though some stories contained little to match the titillating blurbs, others did, with [...] "women entrapped, burned and otherwise maltreated, and whips cracking into use with uninventive frequency", according to sf historian Joseph Marchesani. The magazine ceased publication with the April 1941 issue, but in 1950 the Goodmans saw an opportunity to revive it when a new boom in science fiction magazines got under way. Erisman was still working for the Goodmans, and was listed as editorial {{director of the new}} version of the magazine, but much of the editorial work was done by Daniel Keyes, who was credited as [...] "Editorial Associate" [...] on the 1951 issues. The first issue of the new incarnation of Marvel Science Stories was dated November 1950. After two issues Erisman switched the magazine to a digest format, but the final issue, dated May 1952, was once again a pulp. The post-war issues contained stories by well-known writers, including Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Richard Matheson, William Tenn, Jack Vance, and Lester del Rey, but the stories were of only <b>average</b> <b>quality.</b> In Marchesani's opinion, Erisman and Keyes were able to improve on the material published in the pre-war Marvel Tales, but the field had grown more sophisticated since those days, and the writers who sold to Marvel Tales were now publishing their best work elsewhere.|$|E

2500|$|H. L. Mencken (1880–1956) was the state's iconoclastic {{writer and}} {{intellectual}} trendsetter. In 1922 the [...] "Sage of Baltimore" [...] praised {{the state for}} its [...] "singular and various beauty from the stately estuaries of the Chesapeake to the peaks of the Blue Ridge."

Everywhere he looked he found Maryland in the middle. In national politics it worked sometimes with the northern Republicans, other times with southern Democrats.

2500|$|However, many of {{the aspects}} of the social-democratic welfare state {{continued}} to function at a high level, due {{in no small part}} to the high rate of unionization in Sweden, the independence of unions in wage-setting, and the exemplary competency of the feminized public sector workforce, as well as widespread public support. The Social Democrats initiated studies on the effects of the neoliberal changes, and the picture that emerged from those findings allowed the party to reduce many tax expenditures, slightly increase taxes on high income-earners, and significantly reduce taxes on food. The Social Democratic Finance Minister increased spending on child support and continued to pay down the public debt. By 1998 the Swedish macro-economy recovered from the 1980s industrial restructuring and the currency policy excesses. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Sweden has a well-regarded, generally robust economy, and the <b>average</b> <b>quality</b> of life, after government transfers, is very high, inequality is low (the Gini coefficient is [...]28), and social mobility is high (compared to the affluent Anglo-American and Central European countries).|$|E
2500|$|O'Reilly was {{remembered as}} witty, kindly, generously tolerant, and sensitive.

Not long before his death he wrote of himself: [...] "I am a failure; I have attempted many things, writing, teaching, politics, drifted along, done just enough to live." [...] This feeling of frustration and failure was characteristic. His early verse was seldom of more than <b>average</b> <b>quality,</b> but the little selection published in 1924 with Tears and Triumph and Five Corners, under the title of The Prose and Verse of Dowell O'Reilly, shows him to be a poet, however limited in output and scope. Five Corners contains some of the best Australian short stories ever written. [...] "His Photo on the wall" [...] is considered a masterpiece for its mingling of humour and tragedy, and his beautiful little sketch, [...] "Twilight" [...] is a triumph in economy of means. O'Reilly wrote so little perhaps because of his tendency towards self-criticism. He was known as a perfectionist.|$|E
