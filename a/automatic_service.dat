This paper presents a step-by-step cost-benefit analysis of the ATM <b>automatic</b> deposit <b>service.</b> The {{first step is to}} determine user attitudes towards using ATM <b>automatic</b> deposit <b>service</b> by using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The second step is to determine location priorities for ATMs that provide <b>automatic</b> deposit <b>services</b> using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model. The results of the previous steps enable a highly efficient application of cost-benefit analysis for evaluating costs and benefits of <b>automatic</b> deposit <b>services.</b> To understand fully the proposed procedure outside of theoretical terms, a real-world application of a case study is conducted...|$|R

50|$|The primary form of {{telecommunications}} in the 1980s was local and long-distance telephone service administered by six regional bureaus: Beijing (north region), Shanghai (east region), Xi'an (northwest region), Chengdu (southwest region), Wuhan (centralsouth region), and Shenyang (northeast region). These regional headquarters served as switching centers for provincial-level subsystems. By 1986 China had nearly 3 million telephone exchange lines, including 34,000 long-distance exchange lines with direct, <b>automatic</b> <b>service</b> to 24 cities. By late 1986 fiber optic communications technology was being employed {{to relieve the}} strain on existing telephone circuits. International service was routed through overseas exchanges located in Beijing and Shanghai. Guangdong Province had coaxial cable and microwave lines linking it to Hong Kong and Macau.|$|E

A small mom and pop company might have had the husband doing the outside lines work and the wife operating a manual switchboard.

PP went online in 1992 at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory; since 1999 it has operated from Columbia University and in 2009 it moved to the Technische Universität München.

5000|$|In {{many high}} {{elevation}} or heavy snow accumulating areas, companies with snow removal equipment offer {{to provide services}} to remove the snow. [...] Contractors may work on a per-time basis, full season contract, or will-call status. Per-time service (or per-push) is usually invoiced monthly and customers will be charged for each time services are provided. Some companies will charge per-time and per-inch where {{the depth of the}} snow is even taken into account. A full season contract is quoted and paid upfront {{at the start of the}} season and services will be provided automatically according to the contracted terms. Terms may sometimes differ between companies. For example, some full season contracts will expire after a certain amount of trips where others are unlimited. And finally, will-call service is where the client makes contact with the snow removal company to initiate a single clearing. This is not an <b>automatic</b> <b>service</b> and charges are usually higher for will-call jobs.|$|E

[...] Kempton and Officer William Sherrill began to disarm the Buffalo Soldiers, informing them that they could retrieve their weapons from the police station once they had left town.

When Kempton informed the cavalry officer that he did mind, the man allegedly then gave orders that none of the Tenth's troopers would be allowed to leave camp armed, an order that was apparently ignored by some of the soldiers.|$|E
50|$|In 1984 Carfax {{was founded}} in Columbia, Missouri, by a {{computer}} professional named Ewin Barnett III working with Robert Daniel Clark, an accountant from Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. The company is now headquartered in Centreville, Virginia, with a data center operation in Columbia. Barnett was initially trying to combat odometer fraud. By {{working closely with the}} Missouri Automobile Dealers Association, in 1986 he offered the early version Carfax vehicle history report to the dealer market. These reports were developed with a database of just 10,000 records and were distributed via fax machine. By the end of 1993, Carfax obtained title information from nearly all fifty states. In December 1996, the company's website was launched to offer consumers the same vehicle history reports already available to businesses. In the fall of 1999, Carfax became a wholly owned subsidiary of R.L. Polk & Company. In 2013, IHS acquired Polk and Carfax, which added to its Automotive offerings. In 2013 Carfax introduced a free service to help vehicle owners keep their cars well maintained - myCARFAX.
