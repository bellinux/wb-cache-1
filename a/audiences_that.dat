5|$|The <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> {{we built}} for those campaigns {{are having a}} {{different}} experience. They’re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip about them. They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn’t really have an analog that I’ve been able to think of in the arts.|$|E
5|$|Biden became ranking {{minority}} {{member of}} the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1981. In 1984, he was Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act; civil libertarians praised him for modifying some of the Act's provisions, {{and it was his}} most important legislative accomplishment at that point in time. He first considered running for president in that year, after he gained notice for giving speeches to party <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> simultaneously scolded and encouraged Democrats.|$|E

5|$|In the {{wilderness}} {{of the dance}} floor, Gaga recognizes the wolf-woman she has become and refuses to misrepresent herself any longer. She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E
5|$|While Arbour {{was pleased}} with her profile, MacKenzie was not. Reviewers noted Off's {{critical}} portrayal of MacKenzie as being excessive and MacKenzie considered suing Off for libel. Instead MacKenzie wrote a response in The Globe and Mail presenting {{his point of view}} concerning the mission and events. In 2008 he wrote an autobiography with a chapter dedicated to addressing the criticism he received as a result of Off's book. While Off condemns MacKenzie for not learning the conflict's history and telling American <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> both sides were to blame for the conflict, MacKenzie defends himself by stating it was international decision-making, not his opinions, that led the UN to not intervene.|$|E
5|$|While {{developing}} Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately {{departed from}} the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.|$|E

5|$|Winnipeg's three largest {{performing}} arts venues, the Centennial Concert Hall, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (MTC) and the Pantages Playhouse Theatre, are located downtown. MTC is Canada's oldest English-language regional theatre, with over 250 performances yearly. The Pantages Playhouse Theatre opened as a vaudeville house in 1913. Other city theatres include the Burton Cummings Theatre (a National Historic Site of Canada built in 1906) and Prairie Theatre Exchange. Le Cercle Molière, based in St Boniface, {{is the oldest}} theatre company in Canada; {{it was founded in}} 1925. Rainbow Stage is a musical theatre production company based in Kildonan Park that produces professional, live Broadway musical shows and is Canada's longest-surviving outdoor theatre. The Manitoba Theatre for Young People at The Forks is one of only two Theatres for Young Audiences in Canada with a permanent residence, and is the only Theatre for Young <b>Audiences</b> <b>that</b> offers a full season of plays for teenagers. The Winnipeg Jewish Theatre is the only professional theatre in Canada dedicated to Jewish themes. Shakespeare in the Ruins (SIR) presents adaptations of Shakespeare plays.|$|E
25|$|It {{was with}} the Acuff band that Kirby became {{introduced}} as Bashful Brother Oswald, with Kirby posing as {{the brother of the}} band's banjoist, Rachel Veach ("Queen of the Hills"), so that it would appear to <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> the unmarried Veach was being chaperoned by a family member. To fit his new persona, Kirby created the clownish Oswald character, wearing a floppy, wide-brimmed hat, tattered bib overalls, oversized work shoes and adopting a braying laugh.|$|E
25|$|Up to 60% of the Republic of Ireland {{could receive}} UK {{channels}} via spillover or via cable. Cable {{in the republic}} was only permitted in areas of spillover up to the mid-1980s, to provide viewers with better reception of channels they could already receive over the air. Hence RTÉ 2 was aimed at those {{that did not have}} the UK channels. To this end one of their main remits was the re-broadcasting of UK programming to Irish <b>audiences,</b> <b>that</b> would not otherwise be seen on RTÉ 1.|$|E

He pushed psychologists to adapt better writing habits which ultimately benefited the <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> would later read these works. Instead of focusing on gaining success through his student’s work, Boring led a professional life full of integrity, and was willing to sacrifice his own needs for those of his students.|$|E
25|$|On 5 October, a {{military}} propaganda campaign linking the coup attempt with the PKI masterminded by Suharto {{and the military}} began to sweep the country. Graphic images and descriptions of the murdered, tortured, and even castrated generals began to circulate the country. Despite falsified information, the campaign was successful, convincing both Indonesian and international <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> the murders were a PKI attempt to undermine the Indonesian government under President Sukarno. Though the PKI denied involvement, pent-up tensions and hatreds that had built up over years were released.|$|E
25|$|In March 1966 the Arkestra {{secured a}} regular Monday night gig at Slug's Saloon. This was a {{breakthrough}} to new audiences and recognition. Sun Ra's popularity reached an early peak during this period, as the beat generation and early followers of psychedelia embraced him. Regularly {{for the next}} year and a half (and intermittently for another half-decade afterwards), Sun Ra and company performed at Slug's for <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> eventually came to include music critics and notable jazz musicians. Opinions of Sun Ra's music were divided (and hecklers were not uncommon).|$|E

25|$|Plunkett's {{task was}} frustrating. He {{was a pioneer}} {{of the concept of}} {{systematic}} rural development, who, in spite of his role in Irish affairs being often overlooked, influenced many international reformers, and can be credited {{as one of the few}} who had a long-term vision for the development of rural Ireland. He was apt to remind <b>audiences</b> <b>that,</b> even if full peasant proprietorship was achieved and Home Rule was implemented, rural underdevelopment would still have to be faced. But class conflict between farmers and shopkeepers intervened to frustrate much of what he aimed to do.|$|E
25|$|The Philadelphia Orchestra under Ormandy's {{direction}} frequently performed {{outside of}} Philadelphia, in New York and other American cities, and undertook {{a number of}} foreign tours. During a 1955 tour of Finland, Ormandy {{and many of the}} Orchestra's members visited the elderly composer Jean Sibelius at his country estate; Ormandy was photographed with Sibelius and the picture later appeared on the cover of his 1962 stereo recording of the composer's first symphony. During a 1973 tour of the People's Republic of China, the Orchestra performed to enthusiastic <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> had been isolated from Western classical music for many decades.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} {{featured}} a gay character named Coco (played by Charles Levin), {{who worked as}} a cook for the women, but the role was dropped before the second episode. The writers observed that in many of the proposed scripts, the main interaction between the women occurred in the kitchen while preparing and eating food, and decided that a separate cook would distract from that friendship. In addition, the character of Sophia had originally been planned as an occasional guest star, but Getty had tested so strongly with preview <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> the producers decided to make her a regular character.|$|E

25|$|In Australia's media world, {{there was}} a subtle {{cultural}} war underway between the pull of American popular culture on the one hand, with its widespread popularity and the risk according to its critics, of degrading the public taste. Critics favoured the supposedly superior traditional culture of the mother country, which appealed to upscale <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> were representative of the nation's elite. Richard Boyer, (1891–1961), chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, fought against commercialism because he feared {{it would lead to}} American dominance. He held that the BBC model of a publicly owned and operated television would sustain Australia's British heritage.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{working on his}} ill-fated film project, It's All True, Welles was responsible for radio programs, lectures, interviews and informal talks {{as part of his}} OCIAA-sponsored cultural mission, which was regarded as a success. He spoke on topics ranging from Shakespeare to visual art at gatherings of Brazil's elite, and his two intercontinental radio broadcasts in April 1942 were particularly intended to tell U.S. <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> President Vargas was a partner with the Allies. Welles's ambassadorial mission was extended to permit his travel to other nations including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Welles worked {{for more than half a}} year with no compensation.|$|E
25|$|In {{trying to}} {{determine}} the impact of new media on political campaigning and electioneering, the existing research has tried to examine whether new media supplants conventional media. Television is still the dominant news source, but new media's reach is growing. What is known is that new media has {{had a significant impact}} on elections and what began in the 2008 presidential campaign established new standards for how campaigns would be run. Since then, campaigns also have their outreach methods by developing targeted messages for specific <b>audiences</b> <b>that</b> can be reached via different social media platforms. Both parties have specific digital media strategies designed for voter outreach.|$|E
