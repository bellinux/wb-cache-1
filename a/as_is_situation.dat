40|$|Information Resources Management (IRM) means planning, budgeting, organizing, directing, {{training}} and controlling information. It encompasses both information itself and related {{resources such as}} personnel, equipment, funds and technology. For many organizations, information and the technology that supports it represent their most valuable, but often least understood assets. The Romanian Ministry of National Defense (MoND) has to face this fragile issue, too. Hence {{an analysis of the}} <b>AS</b> <b>IS</b> <b>situation</b> is more than necessary if future endeavors in the field are to succeed.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{petroleum}} {{demand is}} increasing {{and the line}} between success and failure is marginal. Thus, the drilling industry moves further into deeper waters, stretching the limits of engineering, economics and new technology to the maximum. A natural consequence of increasing water depths is the decreasing operational window. This {{is due to the}} fact that rock is being replaced by seawater, and the resulting overburden gradient is reduced. If the pore pressure is held equal to the hydrostatic gradient of water, the decreasing operational window is evident. The consequences of this in deepwater operations are generally a more complex casing design and increased risk for well control incidents. This thesis takes an in-depth analysis of the <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>situation</b> in deepwater drilling today, with an especial focus on the low clearances between the casings and liners. Five wells from Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and Egypt deepwater environments are reviewed. The 13 5 / 8 ” section of each section is especially evaluated in terms of running and cementing casing. A pre and post study technique is used to evaluate plan against what actually happened. Simultaneously throughout the thesis, a fictive well, Well 1, is built and used. Well 1 is based on a GoM well and is used to perform simulations in comparison to the five deepwater wells. Well 1 is further analysed in terms of potential solutions and mitigating technologies. Several potential solutions or mitigating technologies are found. These are: •	Dual gradient drilling •	Managed pressure drilling, MPD •	Casing drilling •	Liner drilling •	Low ECD fluids Furthermore, combined potential solutions were found: •	Combined MPD and dual gradient drilling •	Liner drilling combined with expandable liners These are currently under development...|$|E
40|$|Especially {{in global}} enterprises, key data is {{fragmented}} in multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Thus {{the data is}} inconsistent, fragmented and redundant across the various systems. Master Data Management (MDM) is a concept, which creates cross-references between customers, suppliers and business units, and enables corporate hierarchies and structures. The overall goal for MDM {{is the ability to}} create an enterprise-wide consistent data model, which enables analyzing and reporting customer and supplier data. The goal of the study was defining the properties and success factors of a master data system. The theoretical background was based on literature and the case consisted of enterprise specific needs and demands. The theoretical part presents the concept, background, and principles of MDM and then the phases of system planning and implementation project. Case consists of background, definition of <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>situation,</b> definition of project, evaluation criterions and concludes the key results of the thesis. In the end chapter Conclusions combines common principles with the results of the case. The case part ended up dividing important factors of the system in success factors, technical requirements and business benefits. To clarify the project and find funding for the project, business benefits have to be defined and the realization has to be monitored. The thesis found out six success factors for the MDM system: Well defined business case, data management and monitoring, data models and structures defined and maintained, customer and supplier data governance, delivery and quality, commitment, and continuous communication with business. Technical requirements emerged several times during the thesis and therefore those can’t be ignored in the project. Conclusions chapter goes through these factors on a general level. The success factors and technical requirements are related to the essentials of MDM: Governance, Action and Quality. This chapter could be used as guidance in a master data management project. Maailmanlaajuisesti toimivissa yrityksissä keskeinen tieto on jakautunut useisiin toiminnanohjausjärjestelmiin. Tästä johtuen tieto on jakautunut useaan eri järjestelmään, eikä yhtenäistä työkalua tiedon analysointiin ja raportointiin ole olemassa. Master-tiedon hallinta on konsepti, jolla luodaan linkitykset asiakkaiden, toimittajien ja liiketoimintayksiköiden välille sekä luodaan yrityshierarkioita ja konsernirakenteita. Lopputuloksena saadaan yhtenäinen datamalli, jonka avulla yritys voi analysoida ja raportoida asiakas- ja toimittajatietoa. Työn tarkoituksena oli tarkastella master-tiedon hallintajärjestelmää ja siltä vaadittavia ominaisuuksia sekä menestystekijöitä. Työssä käytettiin kirjallisuutta teoriapohjana sekä yrityksen sisäisiä tarpeita ja vaatimuksia käytännön osion pohjana. Työn teoriaosiossa käsitellään master-tiedon hallinnan konseptia, taustaa sekä keskeisiä periaatteita. Osiossa esitellään vaiheet, jotka tulee huomioida järjestelmän valinnassa ja käyttöönottoprojektissa. Case-osiossa käsitellään taustaa, nykytilan määrittelyä, projektin kuvailua ja arviointikriteerien sekä tavoitetilan määrittelyyn. Case-osion johtopäätökset esittelevät työn keskeiset tulokset. Työn lopussa oleva johtopäätökset otsikko yhdistelee master-tiedon hallinnan yleiset periaatteet case-osiossa löydettyihin menestystekijöihin...|$|E

30|$|Demographic {{analyses}} of multistate populations <b>are</b> commonplace, <b>as</b> <b>are</b> <b>situations</b> where population stocks are known but population flows are not. Still, demographic models for multistate populations with changing rates remain {{at an early}} stage of development, limiting dynamic analyses and analytical projections. Here, a new approach, the Intrinsic Linkage-Rate Ratio (IL-RR) model, is presented and explored. The key IL parameter, w, is a simple weight for projecting populations. Using the ultimate state composition implied by the prevailing rates, the IL-RR model provides new relationships that connect multistate populations over time and allow analytical population projections. Parameter w reflects population metabolism and scales the level of the transfer rates. Compositional change is driven by the sequence of implicit stable population compositions. The IL-RR approach also provides a new method for estimating transfer rates within an interval from population numbers {{at the beginning and end}} of the interval. The new relationships developed advance the ability of demographers to model multistate populations with changing rates and to relate population stocks and flows.|$|R
