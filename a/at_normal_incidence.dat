25|$|Using a thin slab of that {{material}} <b>at</b> <b>normal</b> <b>incidence,</b> one would implement a waveplate. In this case there is essentially no spatial {{separation between the}} polarizations, however the phase of the wave in the parallel polarization (the slow ray) will be retarded {{with respect to the}} perpendicular polarization.

25|$|Extreme UV (EUV or {{sometimes}} XUV) {{is characterized by}} a transition in the physics of interaction with matter. Wavelengths longer than about 30nm interact mainly with the outer valence electrons of atoms, while wavelengths shorter than that interact mainly with inner-shell electrons and nuclei. The long end of the EUV spectrum is set by a prominent He+ spectral line at 30.4nm. EUV is strongly absorbed by most known materials, but it is possible to synthesize multilayer optics that reflect up to about 50% of EUV radiation <b>at</b> <b>normal</b> <b>incidence.</b> This technology was pioneered by the NIXT and MSSTA sounding rockets in the 1990s, and has been used to make telescopes for solar imaging.|$|E

25|$|The {{propagation}} (as well as reflection coefficient) of {{the ordinary}} ray is simply described by no {{as if there were}} no birefringence involved. However the extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne). However it is in fact an inhomogeneous wave whose power flow (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched <b>at</b> <b>normal</b> <b>incidence,</b> as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that of the extraordinary ray, to rotate slightly around that {{of the ordinary}} ray, which remains fixed.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that this}} {{principle}} only holds strictly for light reflected <b>at</b> <b>normal</b> <b>incidence.</b> For instance, right circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at grazing incidence (an angle beyond the Brewster angle) will still emerge as right handed, but elliptically, polarized. Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its ellipticity changed as well. Such situations may {{be solved by}} decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, commonly denoted p and s respectively. The reflected components in the p and s linear polarizations are found by applying the Fresnel coefficients of reflection, which are generally different for those two linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, {{where there is no}} distinction between p and s, are the Fresnel coefficients for the two components identical, leading to the above property.|$|E

It {{is important to note}} that the observed spectral reflectance can be expressed in a linear combination of the reflectance function <b>at</b> the <b>normal</b> <b>incidence</b> and a constant reflectance. This type of surface reflection is called the extended dichromatic reflection model.|$|R
2500|$|According to Fresnel equations, the {{reflectivity}} of a {{sheet of}} glass is about 4% per surface (<b>at</b> <b>normal</b> <b>incidence</b> in air), and the transmissivity of one element (two surfaces) is about 90%.

2500|$|In a {{uniaxial}} material, one ray behaves {{according to}} the normal law of refraction (corresponding to the ordinary refractive index), so an incoming ray <b>at</b> <b>normal</b> <b>incidence</b> remains normal to the refracting surface. However, as explained above, the other polarization can be deviated from normal incidence, which cannot be described using the law of refraction. This thus {{became known as the}} extraordinary ray. The terms [...] "ordinary" [...] and [...] "extraordinary" [...] are still applied to the polarization components perpendicular to and not perpendicular to the optic axis respectively, even in cases where no double refraction is involved.|$|E
2500|$|The {{handedness}} of {{polarized light}} is also reversed {{when it is}} reflected off of a surface <b>at</b> <b>normal</b> <b>incidence.</b> Upon such reflection, {{the rotation of the}} plane of polarization of the reflected light is identical to that of the incident field. However, with propagation now in the opposite direction, the same rotation direction that would be described as [...] "right handed" [...] for the incident beam, is [...] "left-handed" [...] for propagation in the reverse direction, and vice versa. Aside from the reversal of handedness, the ellipticity of polarization is also preserved (except in cases of reflection by a birefringent surface).|$|E

2500|$|In the {{important}} special case of reflection <b>at</b> <b>normal</b> <b>incidence</b> (not involving anisotropic materials) {{there is no}} particular s or p polarization. Both the x and y polarization components are reflected identically, and therefore the polarization of the reflected wave is identical {{to that of the}} incident wave. However, in the case of circular (or elliptical) polarization, the handedness of the polarization state is thereby reversed, since by convention this is specified relative to the direction of propagation. The circular rotation of the electric field around the x-y axes called [...] "right-handed" [...] for a wave in the +z direction is [...] "left-handed" [...] for a wave in the -z direction. But in the general case of reflection at a nonzero angle of incidence, no such generalization can be made. For instance, right-circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at a grazing angle, will still be right-handed (but elliptically) polarized. Linear polarized light reflected from a metal at non-normal incidence will generally become elliptically polarized. These cases are handled using Jones vectors acted upon by the different Fresnel coefficients for the s and p polarization components.|$|E
