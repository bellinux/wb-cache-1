This class of heat exchangers is commonly called <b>air</b> <b>coils,</b> or just coils {{due to their}} often-serpentine internal tubing.

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} an air coil freeze stat {{is to keep the}} refrigerant-to-air heat {{exchanger}} (commonly called <b>air</b> <b>coils)</b> from freezing. This kind of freeze stat is typically used for heating coils which are exposed to outside air and is usually installed on the supply air side of the coil. [...] To accomplish this, they typically shut down the flow of outside air to a mixing box when the temperature reaches a predetermined setpoint. The setpoint for air coil freeze stats is typically about 38 degrees Fahrenheit which is approximately when the dew point temperature of the air starts to drop below freezing point.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{run-around}} coil system comprises {{two or more}} multi-row {{finned tube}} coils connected to each other by a pumped pipework circuit. The pipework is charged with a heat exchange fluid, normally water, which picks up heat from the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> and gives up heat to the supply <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> before returning again. Thus heat from the exhaust air stream is transferred through the pipework coil to the circulating fluid, and then from the fluid through the pipework coil to the supply air stream.|$|R
40|$|Among {{palm oil}} millers, the {{ripeness}} of oil palm Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) is determined through visual inspection. To increase {{the productivity of}} the millers, many researchers have proposed with a new detection method to replace the conventional one. The sensitivity of such a sensor {{plays a crucial role}} in determining the effectiveness of the method. In our preliminary study a novel oil palm fruit sensor to detect the maturity of oil palm fruit bunches is proposed. The design of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> sensor based on an inductive sensor is further investigated to improve its sensitivity. This paper investigates the results pertaining to the effects of the <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> structure of an oil palm fruit sensor, taking consideration of the used copper wire diameter ranging from 0. 10 mm to 0. 18 mm with 60 turns. The flat-type shape of <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> was used on twenty samples of fruitlets from two categories, namely ripe and unripe. Samples are tested with frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 120 MHz. The sensitivity of the sensor between air to fruitlet samples increases as the coil diameter increases. As for the sensitivity differences between ripe and unripe samples, the 5 mm <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> length with the 0. 12 mm coil diameter provides the highest percentage difference between samples and it is amongst the highest deviation value between samples. The result from this study is important to improve the sensitivity of the inductive oil palm fruit sensor mainly with regards to the design of the <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> structure. The efficiency of the sensor to determine the maturity of the oil palm FFB and the ripening process of the fruitlet could further be enhanced...|$|R
5000|$|In {{practical}} situations, when an <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> freeze stat is not used, bypassed, or defeated, the <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> can freeze, {{and this}} causes a lack of air flow to the facility. [...] By contrast, when a water coil freeze stat is not used, the water coil can get so cold that it can freeze the cooling liquid in the exchanger and burst the exchanger. [...] A ruptured heat exchanger mixes contaminants such as freon and oil into the coolant. The intrusion of coolant into the delicately balanced refrigeration system can cause expensive damage to components such as the freon compressor, and the reversing valve.|$|R

Air-core smoothing coils resemble, but are considerably larger than, carrier frequency choke coils in high voltage transmission lines and are supported by insulators. <b>Air</b> <b>coils</b> {{have the advantage of}} generating less acoustical noise than iron-core coils, they eliminate the potential environmental hazard of spilled oil, and they do not saturate under transient high current fault conditions.

A preliminary study of a novel oil palm fruit sensor to detect the maturity of oil palm fruit bunches is presented.

40|$|Liquid-to-air coils used as {{air heating}} system coils and air system cooling coils for air-conditioning, {{refrigeration}} etc. rarely use their design capacity. The capacity must therefore be reduced accordingly, traditionally by means of on-off operation or by means of control valves. Draw-backs of traditional control are excessive pressure drop and drive power to pumps due to high flows {{as well as the}} need for balancing valves and control valves with authority. There are, however, possibilities to substantially reduce the drive energy of pumps and fans for <b>air</b> <b>coils,</b> e. g. by replacing valve and damper control by direct control of decentralized pumps and fans. This may achieve better control at a lower cost while using substantially less drive energy. This paper includes basic analysis of heat transfer and control methods to study how coil design affects the transfer function of an air coil on capacity turn-down. The analysis indicates that direct flow control, using variable-speed pumps, may require {{only a fraction of the}} drive power needed by traditional valve control. Furthermore, system designs for low flow rate and pressure drop also provide opportunities for new types of laminar-flow coil designs. Results show that the transfer functions of alternative control methods for the capacity and outlet temperatures of <b>air</b> <b>coils</b> can be written as simple functions of the controlling variable (supply temperature, inlet temperature or coil liquid flow rate).
