500|$|The {{book has}} been derided for its lack of suspense. [...] Carol Memmott of USA Today says that Grisham's latest attempt to capture {{the spirit of the}} legal David and Goliath story is missing [...] "the ratcheting-up of suspense" [...] that he has {{employed}} successfully in recent adult and youth novels. Harshaw claims that the book is lacking in the suspense that made The Firm so successful. Arthur finds elements of the plot implausible and the story unsuspenseful as well as unsatisfying. Although the book is somewhat predictable, Bayard notes that [...] "Grisham swerves clear of the usual melodramatic devices. Corporations aren’t intrinsically venal; plaintiffs aren’t lambent with goodness. <b>And</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> no one is murdered for stumbling Too Close to the Truth." ...|$|E

500|$|While Saw {{received}} mixed reviews, {{a general}} consensus among reviewers was that {{fans of the}} film series would enjoy it. Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only one thing the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, well thought out <b>and</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> difficult enough that you may not get it on your first attempt."

It also takes itself seriously, which came as {{a breath of fresh}} air following the trend of wimpy tongue-in-cheek horror that had dominated the multiplexes post-Scream.

500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V.

[...] He also bemoaned the fact that only [...] "Everything Stays" [...] features flashbacks, arguing that [...] "rushing through those past events is a missed opportunity to offer a more comprehensive look at where Marceline comes from and how those circumstances have shaped her". With that being said, Sava was highly complimentary towards the voice acting, with praise being directed towards Olson and the actors who voice the villains; Sava wrote, [...] "The new characters' personalities are quickly solidified by the guest stars' expressive performances." [...] Eric Thurm of Pitchfork Media opined that Stakes [...] "includes all sorts of cool action sequences <b>and,</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> it focuses on the backstory of the show's most musical character: Marceline [...] But Stakes, as fun as it is, ultimately fails to fully deliver, mostly because of a lack of, um, stakes." ...|$|E

This episode is nearly everything a Fringe fan could have asked for... Besides the awesomeness with the Bishops, Olivia finally returns to taking an active role in an episode... But {{the most important thing is}} that the overarching Fringe plot finally progressed, and it's going in a pretty damn good direction". Jane Boursaw from TV Squad enjoyed the episode because it had a [...] "few reveals and a nice cliffhanger." [...] She liked the interactions between Walter and Peter, and also praised the scene between Olivia and Newton.
