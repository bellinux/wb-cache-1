40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} the national unemployment rate and class differences in the relation between health and employment during the period 1973 - 93. DESIGN: Data from general household surveys, 1973 - 93. Comparison of rates of employment, unemployment, and economic inactivity among those with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>limiting</b> longstanding illness in different socioeconomic groups and how these varied over 20 years. SUBJECTS: All men aged 20 - 59 years in each survey between 1973 and 1993. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change over time in class specific rates of employment, unemployment, and economic inactivity in those with <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>limiting</b> longstanding illness. RESULTS: Men in socioeconomic groups 1 and 2 with no longstanding illness experienced little decrease in their chances of being in paid employment as the general unemployment rate rose. Those most affected were men in manual groups with limiting longstanding illness. The likelihood of paid employment was affected far less by such illness in non-manual than in manual groups. In group 1 about 85 % of men with such illness were in paid employment in 1979 and 75 % by 1993; in group 4 the equivalent proportions were 70 % and 40 %. In men in manual groups with limiting longstanding illness {{there was no sign}} of employment rates rising again as the economy recovered. CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic status makes a large difference to the impact of illness on the ability to remain in paid employment, and this impact increases as unemployment rises. Men with chronic illness in manual occupations were not drawn back into the labour force during the economic recovery of the late 1980 s...|$|E

The efficient implementation of such networks requires the appropriate tuning of their compo-nents to the characteristics of the FPGA’s logic and mem-ory resources. In this paper, we present a distributed switch architecture that exploits in the best way the structure of the FPGA and achieves significant area/delay savings when compared to baseline switch architectures; more than 50 % increase in operating frequency is achieved for similar area. The proposed switch operates as an elastic pipeline and can be spread throughout the FPGA chip irrespective the topol-ogy of the network <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>limiting</b> the placement op-tions of the corresponding EDA tools. 1...|$|E

In order to enable a flexible and reliable relaying support, the currently adopted architectural structure of LTE networks has to be modified. In this paper, we extend the LTE architecture to enable dynamic relaying, while maintaining backward compatibility with LTE Release 8 user equipments, <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>limiting</b> the flexibility and reliability expected from relaying. With dynamic relaying, relays can be associated with base stations on a need basis rather than in a fixed manner which is based only on initial radio planning. Proposals are also given on how to further improve a relay enhanced LTE network by enabling multiple interfaces between the relay nodes and their controlling base stations, which can possibly be based on technologies different from LTE, so that load balancing can be realized. This load balancing can be either between different base stations or even between different networks.|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{dialogue}} systems {{offer the}} potential to reduce costs by learning policies automatically on-line, but are not designed to scale to large open-domains. This paper proposes a hierarchical distributed dialogue architecture in which policies are organised in a class hierarchy aligned to an underlying knowledge graph. This allows a system to be deployed using a modest amount of data to train a small set of generic policies. As further data is collected, generic policies {{can be adapted to}} give in-domain performance. Us-ing Gaussian process-based reinforcement learning, it is shown that within this framework generic policies can be constructed which provide acceptable user performance, and better performance than can be obtained using under-trained domain specific policies. It is also shown that as sufficient in-domain data becomes available, it is possible to seamlessly improve performance, without subjecting users to unacceptable behaviour during the adaptation period <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>limiting</b> the final performance compared to policies trained from scratch. 1 Index Terms — open-domain, multi-domain, dialogue systems, POMDP, Gaussian proces...|$|E

Abundant permineralized conifer woods along with some dicot and palm leaf compressions {{were found in the}} Ameghino Petrified Forest, and provide evidence of this type of flora. All the permineralized wood and large trunks recovered were assigned to the species Podocarpoxylon mazzonii. An estimated tree height of 17 - 29 m was calculated on the basis of diameter measurements. Based on 14 ring sequences, with a total of 169 rings, the mean ring width and Mean Sensitivity (MS) were 1. 23 and 0. 19 mm respectively. The growth rings are moderately wide, extremely uniform and complacent, indicating that the environment was favourable and constant, and lacked significant stress factors limiting tree growth. Following the quantitative analysis for conifers outlined by Falcon-Lang, the growth ring anatomy of the Podocarpoxylon mazzonii suggests that these trees had an evergreen habit. The combination of the fossil flora, growth ring, and sedimentological analyses suggest that this mostly evergreen coniferous forest developed under warm-temperate conditions <b>and</b> <b>without</b> <b>limiting</b> factors...|$|E
