5|$|Both clubs {{went into}} the match having lost their {{previous}} matches. Liverpool lost 1–0 to Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on 23 March 1996, where the winning goal was scored by midfielder Steve Stone. The defeat was Liverpool's first in 21 matches in all competitions. On the same day, Newcastle were beaten 2–0 by Arsenal—their third defeat in five league matches. Newcastle's loss allowed Manchester United to move three points <b>ahead</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the league the following day after striker Eric Cantona scored the winning goal against Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E

Near the northern end, it crosses the Essex County line. Two miles later, it reaches the first settlement along its length within the Adirondack Park, Ticonderoga. The highway skirts the northeastern edge of the village, the site of key battles in both the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars, as NY74 comes in from the ferry to the east. This overlap lasts for almost two miles (3km) until NY74 goes straight <b>ahead</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intersection with NY9N, while NY22 turns right to join NY9N, the longest suffixed route in the state, and return to its northbound orientation.|$|E

5|$|Just before half time, a try by Newport's Jack Wetter was {{disallowed}} for {{a forward}} pass. The ball was then worked back to Fred Birt, standing within range {{in front of}} the posts, and he kicked a drop-goal, putting the home side 4–0 <b>ahead</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> break. In the second half, the Springboks repeatedly attacked but the Newport defence kept them from crossing the line, although a break from Dick Luyt, the South African centre, left Douglas Morkel to score under the posts. Luyt failed to convert and Newport remained a point ahead. Newport scored again through a cross-kick from Wetter, which Birt jumped on over the line for a try, which he then converted.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, play resumed in poor visibility, with {{frequent}} interruptions due to rain and bad light. England's batsmen progressed steadily as Australia struggled in Lindwall's absence, which forced his fellow bowlers {{to bear a}} greater workload. Hutton made 74 and Compton batted through the entire day to be unbeaten on 154, with England one run <b>ahead</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> close of play, on 345/6. Compton's innings in the difficult conditions was highly praised and his team still had a chance of hanging on for a draw if the lower order could bat for {{a large part of}} the final day. The next day, Australia prised out the remaining wickets and England were dismissed for 441, with Compton out for 184 after falling on his stumps. Miller and Johnston had both taken four wickets. Australia then made the 98 runs required for victory with the loss of two wickets; opener Sid Barnes made his second half-century for the match in the pursuit.|$|E

It became Madonna's first studio album to miss the top spot since Bedtime Stories, which also debuted at number two in 1994. The album sold 37,245 copies including 416 from streaming, the lowest first week sales for a studio album by Madonna. However, she extended her lead as the biggest selling female artist of the 21st century in UK, with cumulative sales of 7.65million copies. The following week, the album dropped to number 7, with sales declining by 67.46% to 11,983 copies.

25|$|Race six {{followed}} a familiar refrain, with Oracle <b>ahead</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start and holding {{that lead to}} the bottom of the downwind leg. After rounding the mark 12 seconds behind, Team New Zealand once again took over sailing into the wind. The highest number of tacks seen thus far was unable to prevent the Kiwis from gaining 55 seconds during the third leg, and the 44 second lead at the top mark was extended to 47 seconds at the finish.|$|E

25|$|Two contestants {{selected}} from the studio audience competed in various games to earn points as well as cash and prizes. Each {{of the first two}} games awarded 10 points to the winner and the winner of the third game scored 20 points. Whoever was <b>ahead</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the third game was the day's winner and played the Golden Medley for a chance at more prizes. If the score was tied after three games, one sudden death tune was played to determine the winner; if both players were incorrect, the procedure was repeated.|$|E
25|$|In race {{eighteen}} the Kiwis led at {{the start}} {{and up to the}} first mark. They set the speed record of the series, reaching 47.57 knots (55mph, 88 kph) as they rounded the mark, to lead by 5 seconds. They kept the lead during the first downwind run, but Oracle got <b>ahead</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first crossing on the upwind leg after the Kiwis made a poor tack. Team New Zealand had starboard tack advantage and the lead at the time, but did not properly cover Oracle. The American boat was up on the foils, and powered past the Kiwis. Oracle went on to lead by 57 seconds at the windward gate and kept the lead for the rest of race, winning by 54 seconds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} lap, Masai made her move {{and began to}} forge a lead over the other two runners. However, Chebet began to chase Masai, leaving Melkamu behind her. Masai was <b>ahead</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> final {{straight}} towards the finish but Chebet's sprint quickly reduced {{the gap between the}} two. The little-known Chebet won at the line, defeating the pre-race favourite Masai, who had to content herself with another silver having lost another sprint finish at the competition. Melkamu took third uncontested while Dibaba was fourth some twelve seconds behind the bronze medallist. Kenyans Lineth Chepkurui and Margaret Wangari Muriuki took fifth and sixth to confirm their team gold and the Ethiopian women took the team silver. American runner Shalane Flanagan was twelfth and top-20 finishes from Molly Huddle and Magdalena Lewy-Boulet helped the United States to a team bronze.|$|E

25|$|On 8 February, the Italian Government {{announced}} that San Siro Stadium in Milan was unsafe for spectators {{in light of}} riots that took place during and following an Italian Serie A match in Sicily. As a result, the venues of {{the first leg of}} the Inter-Valencia tie scheduled for 21 February and the second leg of the Celtic-Milan tie scheduled for 7 March were thrown into doubt. Various proposals and offers of the use of stadia outside Italy were made, but it was finally agreed that the Inter-Valencia tie would be played at the San Siro with a reduced capacity of 36,000. After further work at the San Siro, Italian authorities and UEFA {{announced that}} the second leg of Celtic-Milan would go <b>ahead</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stadium, at its full capacity of 85,700. 4,500 seats were reserved for Celtic supporters.|$|E
25|$|Later that spring, Scott {{returned}} to her beginnings as a comedian when she began work on her first comedy noir, Scared Stiff, with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Scott played an heiress who inherits a haunted castle on Lost Island {{off the coast of}} Cuba. Though Scott had fond memories of working on the set in the years <b>ahead,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of filming, she found it trying. Scott found Lewis' impersonations of her offensive, while a jealous Hal Wallis instructed the director, George Marshall, not to let the romantic scenes between Scott and Martin get too steamy. Despite Scott's best efforts, including making excuses for Lewis' behavior to the press, most of her scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor. Shooting took place late May to mid-July 1952. The film premiered the week of 28 May 1953 in Los Angeles. Despite the negative experience and reviews, Scared Stiff remains Scott's third favorite film.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} San Francisco 49ers, an old rival from the AAFC, {{at home in}} the ninth game of the season. The 49ers scored first after {{blocking}} a Gillom punt and recovering at Cleveland's one-yard line in the first quarter. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Frankie Albert ran for a touchdown on the following play. The Browns' Chubby Grigg recovered a fumble by San Francisco's Sam Cathcart at the 49ers' seven-yard line near end of the first quarter, setting up a short touchdown pass from Graham to Jones. A 22-yard rushing touchdown by Motley put the Browns ahead midway through the second quarter, but San Francisco tied the game {{at the end of the}} half with a pass from Albert to Alyn Beals. A fumble by Joe Perry, one of five he made in the game, led to a Groza field goal 10 minutes into the third quarter. Groza added to the lead with another field goal in the fourth quarter, and the Browns surged <b>ahead</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the game by capitalizing on San Francisco interceptions and fumbles. Both Jones and Bumgardner scored rushing touchdowns, securing a 34–14 win.|$|E

50|$|Much of the LR parser's {{efficiency}} is from being deterministic.
