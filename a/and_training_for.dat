5|$|In 1919, Morgan {{volunteered for}} a six-year tour of India {{and joined the}} 118th Field Battery, 26th Field Brigade, at Deepcut, where it was forming <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> service in the subcontinent. Later that year the brigade moved to its new station at Jhansi. After three years Morgan was posted to Attock, where he {{commanded}} the Divisional Ammunition Column. In 1924 he accepted a temporary staff posting as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (DAAG) of Major-General Herbert Uniacke's 1st (Peshawar) Division at Murree. This was followed in 1925 by a year's secondment to the headquarters of Lieutenant-General Sir Claud Jacob's Northern Command, where Morgan helped plan and direct large-scale manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, Mayor Daley {{nominated}} Chico {{as chairman}} of the board of trustees of the City Colleges of Chicago and the board elected Chico chairman. Along with Chancellor Cheryl Hyman, Chico reformed the City Colleges budget by laying off 225 employees, removing unfilled jobs, and reducing executive spending to increase spending on technology <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> students. Furthermore, Chico and Hyman reduced taxation on property for two straight years, and cancelled nursing programs. He resigned 8 months later to run for Mayor of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages {{the area was}} a farm, growing to a wealthy estate that fell into {{disrepair}} towards 1900. It was bought in 1919 by Scout Commissioner William de Bois Maclaren and given to The Scout Association of the United Kingdom to provide camping to London Scouts, <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> Scouters. As Scout Leaders from all {{countries of the world}} have come to Gilwell Park for their Wood Badge training, {{it is one of the}} landmarks of the world Scouting movement.|$|E

5|$|Pathlight School {{is run by}} the Autism Resource Centre, a {{non-profit}} organisation that also offers early intervention, therapy <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> persons with autism in Singapore. The school employs 81 staff, including teachers, therapists and autism consultants, and the school board is headed by founder, ARC president and Member of Parliament Denise Phua. Operating costs of the school are paid by the Ministry of Education and National Council of Social Service, while other costs, estimated at S$5 million per year, are funded through fees, donations, merchandise sales and fundraising events. Under the partnership between Pathlight School and Eden School, the two schools have a centralised admission system and share various resources; together, they form the national provision of education for children across the autism spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the deployment, South African {{authorities}} {{threatened to}} veto the involvement of Australian peacekeeping troops because of doubts about their impartiality. This followed the establishment by the Australian Government of a Special Assistance Program for South Africans and Namibians (SAPSAN) in 1986 to assist South Africans and Namibians disadvantaged by apartheid. The focus of SAPSAN was on education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> the people of South Africa and Namibia, and some humanitarian assistance had also been provided. A total of $11.9million was spent under SAPSAN from 1986 to 1990.|$|E
5|$|The Axis had {{air superiority}} as Soviet Karelian was {{protected}} by the 1st and 55th Mixed Air Divisions, totaling 273 aircraft, many outclassed by their enemy. This situation was partly alleviated by the reinforcement of No. 151 Wing RAF on September 7, 1941 at Vaenga airfield. The Wing was tasked with providing Hawker Hurricane aircraft <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> the Russians, but also flew 365 sorties over the Murmansk area, accounting for 14 German aircraft kills.|$|E

Headquartered in Beers Hall at the Connecticut Valley Hospital campus in Middletown, Connecticut, the Connecticut Wing (CTWG) has 14 primary {{subordinate}} units located throughout the state to help it carry out its missions. The missions include providing aerospace education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> all of its members, teaching leadership skills to Connecticut youth, and performing various domestic emergency services for the United States of America in a noncombatant capacity.|$|E
5|$|She {{was a part}} of the Neutrality Patrol {{following}} the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, and spent the beginning of the war escorting convoys between New York and Iceland. She saw action supporting Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, where she targeted shore batteries threatening the landings in November 1942. She remained in convoy patrol <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> several years, until she was moved to the Pacific Fleet late in the war and supported landings on Iwo Jima in February 1945, and later the invasion of Okinawa in April 1945. She was lightly damaged by a kamikaze attack in this battle. Following the war, she was used as a target ship during Operation Crossroads and subsequently studied for its effects, before being sunk as a target in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians {{had taken}} {{measures}} to reconstruct their defences {{along the border}} with the German state upon Adolf Hitler's rise to power in January 1933. The Belgian government had watched with increasing alarm the German withdrawal from the League of Nations, its repudiation of the Treaty of Versailles and its violation of the Locarno Treaties. The government increased expenditure on modernising the fortifications at Namur and Liège. New lines of defence were established along the Maastricht–Bois-le-Duc canal, joining the Meuse, Scheldt and the Albert Canal. The protection of the eastern frontier, based mainly on the destruction of a number of roads, was entrusted to new formations (frontier cyclist units and the newly formed Chasseurs Ardennais). By 1935, the Belgian defences had been completed. Even so, it was felt that the defences were no longer adequate. A significant mobile reserve was needed to guard the rear areas, and as a result it was considered that the protection against a sudden assault by German forces was not sufficient. Significant manpower reserves were also needed, but a bill made for the provision of longer military service <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> the army was rejected by the public on the basis that it would increase Belgium's military commitments as well as the request of the Allies to engage in conflicts far from home.|$|E

5|$|The prison's {{workshops}} provided activities <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> the prisoners. They also {{reduced the}} cost of maintenance, repairs, and construction by providing an in-house service. The original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, {{one of the first}} buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop. The West Workshops were built {{at the start of the}} twentieth century, providing more work for prisoners through a paint shop, mat maker, shoe maker, book binder and tailor shop. The five western workshops are a single storey squared limestone rubble building with openings dressed in brick, with an open saw-tooth roof with southern skylights, concealed behind a parapet wall. In 1993 the western workshops were adapted for use as TAFE art workshops.|$|E
5|$|While {{opportunities}} <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>for</b> painters {{had made}} advances {{by the beginning}} of the nineteenth century, a Scottish tradition of sculpture was slower to emerge. In the early decades of the century commissions continued to be given to English artists, including Samuel Joseph (1791–1850), who was working in Edinburgh in 1821–29 and was a founding member of the Scottish Academy. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790–1858) studied in London and settled in Rome, where he received commissions from visiting British subjects before returning to London in 1830. His works in Scotland included the Hopetoun Memorial (1824–34) in Edinburgh. Lawrence Macdonald (1799–1878) was able to study at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and then Rome. He returned to Edinburgh from 1827, but moved back to Rome in 1832, where he worked for the rest of his life. His most significant works included his busts of General David Baird and of the phrenologist George Combe (c. 1830).|$|E
