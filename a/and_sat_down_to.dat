25|$|Using his {{friendly}} {{relations with}} the British, Kâmil Pasha also sat down to end the ongoing First Balkan War diplomatically. However, the heavy Ottoman military upsets during the war continued to sap morale, as rumors that the capital {{would have to be}} moved from Istanbul to inland Anatolia spread. The Bulgarian Army had soon advanced as far as Çatalca, a western district of modern Istanbul. At this point, Kâmil Pasha's government signed an armistice with Bulgaria in December 1912 <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> draw up a treaty {{for the end of the}} war at the London Peace Conference.|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} to New York, Adams met with Maurice Daly, then the [...] "dean of billiards". Daly listened to Adams' story, {{and said that he}} was not aware that any startling shots could be accomplished using only the hands. Daly offered Adams a set of four balls, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> watch Adams. After 12 shots, Daly became greatly interested, often asking Adams to repeat shots. At the end of the performance, Daly told Adams that if he ever entertained any idea of entering the billiards field he would give Adams an engagement at his room.|$|E
500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would have imagined that any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. Not so with Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, McDonald's {{sponsored}} {{a show in}} Detroit. [...] To promote the restaurant's new coffee, Nik Wallenda and his older sister Lijana did an act where they met {{in the middle of}} a high-wire <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> have some coffee, after starting on opposite ends. [...] After exchanging several toasts, Nik stood up and stepped over his sister. [...] As the siblings headed back to their platforms, a crane winch malfunctioned, preventing Lijana from exiting the wire. [...] After Nik descended to the ground, a crane was moved to reduce the tension on the wire and he rode a hook up to rescue his sister.|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Taizong died in 649 and was {{succeeded by}} his son and crown prince Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong). [...] Around the new year 667, Emperor Gaozong {{commissioned}} the chancellor Li Ji to command a major attack on Goguryeo, and Hao Chujun was made an assistant to Li Ji, a campaign during which Hao served with distinction. [...] In one particular incident, Hao, who {{was said to be}} obese, was approachinging a Goguryeo city when Goguryeo forces launched a surprise counterattack, causing much alarm for Hao's soldiers. [...] Hao, who was said to be obese, did not panick, and instead pulled out a chair <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> eat his rations, while secretly ordering his elite troops to attack Goguryeo forces, defeating them. [...] His calmness impressed his troops.|$|E
