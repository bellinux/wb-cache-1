5|$|Women at Los Alamos were {{encouraged}} to work, due to the shortage of labor and security concerns over bringing in local workers. About 60 wives of scientists were at work in Technical Area by September 1943. About 200 of the 670 workers in the laboratory, hospital and school were women in October 1944. Most worked in administration, but many women such as Lilli Hornig, Jane Hamilton Hall, <b>and</b> <b>Peggy</b> Titterton worked as scientists and technicians. Charlotte Serber headed the A-5 (Library) Group. A large group of women worked on numerical calculations in the T-5 (Computations) Group. Dorothy McKibbin ran the Santa Fe office, which opened at 109 East Palace Avenue on 27 March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Women in Washington social circles led by Floride Calhoun, {{the wife}} of Vice President John C.

Rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute. Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. They refused to attend social events at which she would be present.

Most of Don <b>and</b> <b>Peggys</b> interactions during this season comprises their fighting over the fact that Don constantly puts her in the middle of arguments between him and Ted, which makes her uncomfortable. Don confronts Peggy after she refuses to pick a side, telling her that its her job to pick the best idea. Peggy argues that he only gets angry when she refuses to pick a side or when she sides with Ted. She tells him that both he and Ted are similar, except that Ted never hurts her like Don does.

5|$|Cal Poly Pomona {{financial}} endowment was valued at $85.6 million as of June 30, 2016. In fall 2010, Cal Poly embarked {{on its first}} comprehensive fundraising campaign. Early major donors helped raise {{more than half of}} the campaign's goal of $150 million before its formal launch. They included an anonymous benefactor who pledged $12 million, and $2 million from 1980 alumni Mickey and Lee Segal. Just before the campaign launch, on July 26, 2010, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation awarded a $42 million challenge grant to the university to increase educational access to underrepresented communities, making it the largest cash gift in the history of the CSU system. On February 28, 2011, Panda Express founders Andrew <b>and</b> <b>Peggy</b> Cherng announced a $2.5 million pledge to Cal Poly's Collins College of Hospitality Management. The university expects that its permanent endowment at the conclusion of its first comprehensive campaign will top $100 million.|$|E
5|$|Stafford {{moved from}} New York to California in November 1946, {{continuing}} to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances {{on the show}} to Tuesdays, <b>and</b> <b>Peggy</b> Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested {{using some of the}} folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of $250 awarded in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The {{heyday of}} the Free State was over by the 1940s. Because of {{conflicts}} with the United States Treasury, the Hollywood Dinner Club was shut down in the late 1930s. The local clubs found {{it increasingly difficult to}} attract major entertainment figures. Gambling had been legalized in Nevada in 1931 and this distinct advantage over Galveston, and other illegal gambling centers, gradually lured mob figures such as New York City's Bugsy Siegel to Las Vegas. The competition created by the up-and-coming entertainment center in the desert substantially challenged the island on the Gulf over the next several years. Still, even during its later years, the Balinese Room was able to attract the likes of Tony Bennett <b>and</b> <b>Peggy</b> Lee, among others. And as late as 1950 the annual income of the Maceo empire was reportedly $3.84 million ($ in today's terms).|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with TV Buzz, Barbara Windsor commented on Pat <b>and</b> <b>Peggy's</b> relationship: [...] "I really loved Pat <b>and</b> <b>Peggy's</b> friendship, but my most memorable scenes involve us slapping each other; and we both really went for it! The fan mail we received would always go up a notch {{when they had a}} fight. We'd call each other everything under the sun too. Well, as far as we could go - obviously we couldn't swear. I'd love to have done a late-night episode - you'd have heard proper language then!" [...] She added: [...] "My favourite storyline was where <b>Peggy</b> whacked Pat <b>and</b> Frank in The Vic. I stood on my little box - because I'm so tiny - and bang! Pat's earring went flying, then I fell off the box! I did a Norman Wisdom trip. It was very funny.|$|R

When Babette retired in 1958, a cousin, Olgita DeCastro Marino (1931-2000) replaced her <b>and</b> when <b>Peggy</b> later left the group to go solo, Babette re-joined Cherie <b>and</b> Olgita. <b>Peggy</b> eventually returned <b>and</b> Babette once more retired.|$|R
5|$|Vissi's music rival Despina Vandi {{also became}} less prominent. While the {{supposed}} rivalry {{between the two}} was once a grand topic in the media, with speculation as to who would come out on top, the possible overexposure {{of the story and}} their subsequent absences allowed fellow laïko-pop singer Elena Paparizou, fresh off of the momentum of her 2005 Eurovision win, to ultimately overshadow the two {{during the second half of}} the decade. While reviewing Apagorevmeno, Haris Simvoulidis of Avopolis felt that Vissi appeared to be attempting to catch up to her contemporaries, Paparizou <b>and</b> <b>Peggy</b> Zina. Vissi continued to make music and soon managed to fly back to the top as her follow-up album Apagorevmeno becaume the biggest selling album by a female artist for 2009 and her shows continue to be sold out even today. She was also placed 15th in Forbes list of the most powerful and influential Greece celebrities in 2010. Her time on hiatus in the late 2000s was filmed and used for a reality show called Oso Eho Foni in 2011.|$|E
5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp <b>and</b> <b>Peggy</b> Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E
5|$|After {{attending}} drama school, Olivier {{began his}} professional career with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. In 1926 {{he joined the}} Birmingham Repertory Company, where {{he was given the}} chance to play a wide range of key roles.

In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the avant garde English Stage Company in 1957 to play the title role in The Entertainer. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's National Theatre, running a resident company that fostered many future stars.

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Peggy's {{day and a}} heated {{argument}} with her boyfriend Abe, over her preoccupation with work and the effect this has on their sex life. The argument ends with Abe's leaving in a huff. After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu trip to a Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept.

Don hangs up on her, <b>and</b> <b>Peggy</b> returns to her office. When Peggy asks about Ginsberg's life, Ginsberg initially claims to be a Martian, stating that Morris Ginsberg is not his father. Michael was born in a Nazi concentration camp and, after its liberation, Morris claimed him from a Swedish orphanage when Michael was 5 years old. Peggy returns home, affected by this story, and calls Abe. She tells him about Ginsberg and asks him to come over to be with her.|$|E
