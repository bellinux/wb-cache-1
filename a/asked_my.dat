25|$|At the Supreme War Council at the Trianon Palace Hotel, near Versailles (29 January - 2 February) Haig and Petain (French Commander-in-Chief) {{complained of}} {{shortage}} of troops. The BEF {{was facing a}} 100,000 manpower shortage by June 1918, whilst Petain talked of losing 25 divisions to natural wastage, but Haig’s political credibility was so low that Hankey wrote that they “made asses of themselves”. Haig argued against a common command, claiming {{that it would be}} “unconstitutional” for him to take orders from a foreign general. It was agreed that an Allied General Reserve be set up, under Foch with Henry Wilson as his deputy, but Haig argued {{that he did not have}} divisions to spare for this (worrying that they would be shipped off to fight the Turks but thinking the proposal would take time to be become operational) and suggested to the French Prime Minister Clemenceau (who was suspicious of Foch’s ambition to become generalissimo, and whom Haig thought “the soundest and pluckiest of the lot … a grand old man, full of go and determination”) that he might resign. Lord Milner thought Haig’s stance “desperately stupid”, although in Sheffield's view Haig had a point that control of reserves by a committee was not necessarily sensible. Clemenceau attacked Lloyd George’s wish to make offensives against Turkey top priority, and got Lloyd George to agree to delay offensives against the Turks for two months. Robertson openly opposed the Prime Minister; Haig did not speak in his defence, later writing that “LG never <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> opinion”. On the last day the conference discussed the General Reserve and extension of line. Again, Haig did not openly oppose the government’s plans, nor did he – at this stage – threaten to resign.|$|E

Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, [...] "We <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised...

500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films. [...] "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> permission to do the movie. [...] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget." ...|$|E
500|$|Padukone has {{admitted}} to being socially awkward {{as a child}} and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, [...] "I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep." [...] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, [...] "I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all." [...] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.|$|E
500|$|Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999novel Battle Royale {{have been}} noted. Collins stated that she [...] "had {{never heard of}} that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was {{mentioned}} to me, and I <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'." [...] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" [...] of Battle Royale but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] Stephen King noted that the reality TV [...] "badlands" [...] were similar to Battle Royale, {{as well as his}} own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. Eric Eisenberg wrote that The Hunger Games was [...] "not a rip off of Battle Royale, but simply a different usage of a similar idea", pointing out various differences in both story and themes.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{critical}} and commercial success {{of her two}} previous albums, Jackson continued to receive numerous comparisons to her brother Michael, often with doubts that she held staying power in the music industry. When Edna Gundersen of USA Today questioned her about the subject, she responded: [...] "Certain people feel I'm just riding on my last name... That's why I just put my first name on janet. and why I never <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> brothers to write or produce music for me." [...] Virgin Records expressed the album title [...] "punctuates the declaration of strength the singer, songwriter and producer boldly expresses on this moving collection of songs which explore love, sensuality, the power of sisterhood and her own evolving self-identity." [...] Thomas Harrison, author of Music of the 1990s (2011) wrote that [...] "he conscious decision was made, by the company and/or Jackson, to put her into the same league as other one-named artists, such as Madonna, Bono, and Prince, {{or at least to}} put her on the same standing as others in the industry who are often called by one name, such as Whitney, Mariah, Diana, Dolly, and Garth among others. Jackson could now, in a sense, stand on her own and not be seen as a product of the family entertainment machine." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant magazine recounted the title of the album ultimately [...] "announced the singer as completely independent of her male-dominated family [...] it positioned her as the person in charge of her sound." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Desperately Xeeking Xena" [...] {{was written}} by staff writer Long. At the {{beginning}} of the segment, Milhouse is seen wearing a plastic smock with a picture of Radioactive Man on it. The scene was based on an experience in Long's childhood; [...] "I <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> mom for a Batman costume. And I got a smock that had Batman on it and said 'Batman'. It was very dispiriting" [...] he said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "Stretch Dude & Clobber Girl"'s theme song {{was written by}} Long and composed by Alf Clausen. During the sequence, Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl are seen assaulting Saddam Hussein, the fifth President of Iraq and being thanked for their help by President Bill Clinton afterwards. According to Long, the writing staff had a [...] "passionate" [...] discussion about whether the duo would be attacking Hussein or Iranian religious leader and politician Ruhollah Khomeini during the sequence. Scully quipped that Hussein was chosen because [...] "he was always asking to be on the show." [...] The segment features New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless as herself. According to Long, Lawless was very happy with the segment's script. She was especially fond of the speech she gives to The Collector, in which she mentions that she was very tall as an adolescent. Lawless was directed by Scully, who commented that she was [...] "terrific". In an interview with the Hungarian online newspaper Origo, Lawless said that her part in the episode was the best experience she had guest-starring for a show. [...] "It was really funny when the Comic Book Guy kidnapped me", she said.|$|E

2500|$|The day after, I <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> pilot, {{a cheerful}} young New Zealander, {{if he thought}} we really needed an escort. He said that, unless we had bad luck, he could {{probably}} get away from anything except a very up-to-date fighter. [...] I {{asked him if he}} would get into trouble if we went without an escort. He replied cheerfully that, if we came back safely, no one would say anything, and if we didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing our arrival, and set off on our own.|$|E

Islam simply requires me to honour the dignity of ladies or young girls who are not closely related to me, and avoid physical intimacy, however innocent it may be." [...] He added, [...] "My four daughters all follow the basic wearing of clothes which modestly cover their God-given beauty. They're extremely well educated; they do not cover their faces and interact perfectly well with friends and society." ...|$|E
2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset.

I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E

2500|$|According to Nathalie Babel Brown, [...] "Babel came to Paris in {{the summer}} of 1935, as part of the {{delegation}} of Soviet writers to the International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture and Peace. He probably knew this would have been his last chance to remain in Europe. As he had done numerous times during the last ten years, he <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> mother to return with him to Moscow. Although he knew the general situation was bad, he nevertheless described to her the comfortable life that the family could have there together. It was the last opportunity my mother had to give a negative answer, and she never forgot it. Perhaps it helped her later on to be proven completely right in her fears and her total lack of confidence in the Soviet Union. My mother described to me these last conversations with my father many times." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cheung {{distinguished}} {{himself as}} a Canto-pop singer through embodying the politics, sexual and gender identity of a queer subject position. He announced his gay relationship with Daffy Tong during a concert in 1997, earning him prestige in LGBT communities in China, Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In a 2001 interview with Time magazine, Cheung said: [...] "It's more appropriate to say I'm bisexual. I've had girlfriends. When I was 22 or so, I <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> girlfriend Teresa Mo (...) to marry me.", but was unsuccessful. In two interviews in 1992 and 2002, Cheung also stated that [...] "My mind is bisexual. It's {{easy for me to}} love a woman. It's also easy for me to love a man too" [...] and [...] "I believe that a good actor would be androgynous, and ever changing," [...] referencing his performance of intersexuality, androgynous dressing, and gay femininity in his music videos and films.|$|E
2500|$|The papal nuncio, the Most Rev.

Let no one have any doubts about it: we are celebrating a religious occasion; we are reflecting on a religious assassination, not a political one. Fr. Kaiser has been murdered because he was, and in the eternity of God still is, a Catholic priest who preached the Gospel. Those who killed him, those who planned his killing, wanted to silence the voice of the Gospel.... Only two days before his death, I met Fr. Kaiser for a long conversation. At the end, he <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> blessing, which I reluctantly gave him. At that moment, I thought {{it would have been better}} if he, an old and worthy missionary, had blessed me. How much more I am convinced of that now that we look at him as a martyr of the faith?". Also present at the altar was Maurice Cardinal Otunga, Archbishop Emeritus of Nairobi.|$|E
