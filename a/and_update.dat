5|$|Discussions {{about the}} need to upgrade and {{renovate}} City Hall began anew in 1988. In 1994, proposals were made to remodel <b>and</b> <b>update</b> the structure to meet modern building codes, with an estimated cost of $16million. Work was to include replacing the concrete floors, structural upgrades, and restoring the original light corridors that penetrated all four floors of the building. In March 1995, plans were made to renovate the then-100-year-old structure. The estimated $22-million project was proposed due to the building failing to comply with the city codes for earthquakes and fires.|$|E

Taking these stores, he and his partners created a new company called Core Value Partners to renovate <b>and</b> <b>update</b> the locations which had deteriorated during Ameriking's decline. During this time, the company was renamed Heartland Food Corp. and it purchased 120 additional stores from other financially distressed owners and completely revamped them as well. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra Burger King's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKC's top franchisee groups at the time. By 2006, the company was valued at over $150million, and was sold to New York-based GSO Capital Partners.|$|E

The company has played an important, though controversial, role in the modernization of the sport. It has worked with NASCAR to create new tracks <b>and</b> <b>update</b> older ones in an effort to improve the racing and the experience for spectators (though because both companies have several members of the France family in top positions, ISC's competitors have filed multiple lawsuits on antitrust grounds) and has constructed popular new tracks in regions previously thought uninterested in NASCAR.|$|E
