5|$|A poorly {{organized}} tropical wave {{moved into}} the eastern Pacific on August29 <b>and</b> <b>quickly</b> developed into a tropical depression by 0600UTC the following day. Within an environment of low wind shear, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, acquiring the name Henriette, at 1200UTC on August31. Moving west-northwest around a ridge positioned over inland Mexico, the center passed narrowly offshore after producing squally weather along the coastline. The system moved westward while continuing to intensify, becoming a Category1 hurricane at 0600UTC on September4 and subsequently attaining its peak intensity with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 972mb (hPa; 28.71inHg) six hours later. An approaching upper-level trough caused Henriette to turn northwest later that day, moving it ashore near San Jose del Cabo, Mexico at 2100UTC as a minimal hurricane. After crossing Baja California Sur, Henriette weakened to a tropical storm and made a second landfall near Guaymas, Mexico. The system moved inland <b>and</b> <b>quickly</b> weakened, dissipating by 1200UTC on September6.|$|E
