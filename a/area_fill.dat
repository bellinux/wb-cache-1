New styled steel wheels with center caps were offered {{and the previous}} wheel and hubcap design was discontinued. Domestic models received a new computer command control feedback system on gasoline engines. The HO option was discontinued. Electronic spark timing was used on 1981 models in place of manual timing advance. A new engine cylinder head design (swirl-port) was introduced to improve low-end torque and fuel economy. The Pontiac T1000 was introduced, which shared all body stampings with the Chevette, featuring a chrome center with black trimmed grille and headlight buckets as well as standard chrome window trim with black <b>area</b> <b>fill.</b> Power steering was a new option {{as well as a}} 3.36 axle ratio (standard on T-1000 models).

50|$|There {{was also}} a refuse deposit for the central chamber. It was found in front and {{to the side of}} the main {{entrance}} of the temple.

Also found here were many administrative seals.To the east of the temple, between the temple and the town, a production field was found. An <b>area</b> <b>fill</b> of pottery sherds was found covering almost 6000 square meters. Pottery linked to the production of bread and beer were found in abundance in the area. A building has been found not very far from the eastern entrance of the temple, which seemed to be linked to the storage in the galleries of the east block. About 50 meters east of the temple there seem to be another cluster of buildings that may have been used as supply and storage rooms for the production area. This production area seems to have been used by the cult for the temple activities.|$|E

40|$|Control of {{variability}} {{and performance in}} {{the back end of}} the VLSI manufacturing line has become extremely difficult with the introduction of new materials such as copper and low-k dielectrics. To improve manufacturability, and in particular to enable more uniform chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP), it is necessary to insert <b>area</b> <b>fill</b> features into low-density layout regions. Because <b>area</b> <b>fill</b> feature sizes are very small compared to the large empty layout areas that need to be filled, the filling process can increase the size of the resulting layout data file by an order of magnitude or more. To reduce file transfer times, and to accommodate future maskless lithography regimes, data compression becomes a significant requirement for fill synthesis. In this paper, we make the following contributions. First, we define two complementary strategies for fill data volume reduction corresponding to two different points in the design-to-manufacturing flow: compressible filling and post-fill compression. Second, we compare compressible filling methods in the fixed-dissection regime when two different sets of compression operators are used: the tradi-tional GDSII array reference (AREF) construct, and the new Open Artwork System Interchange Standard (OASIS) repetitions. We apply greedy techniques to find practical compressible filling solutions and compare them with opti-mal integer linear programming solutions. Third, for the post-fill data compression problem, we propose two greedy heuristics, an exhaustive search-based method, and a smart spatial regularity search technique. We utilize an optima...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} high-frequency 1 -D CMUT arrays {{designed and}} fabricated {{for use in}} electronically scanned high-resolution ultrasonic imaging systems. Two different designs of 64 -element linear CMUT arrays are presented in this paper. A single element in each array is connected to a single-channel custom front-end integrated circuit for pulse-echo operation. The first design has a resonant frequency of 43 MHz in air, and operates at 30 MHz in immersion. The second design exhibits a resonant frequency of 60 MHz in air, and operates at 45 MHz in immersion. The experimental results are compared to simulation results obtained from the equivalent circuit model and nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis; a good agreement is observed between these results. This paper also briefly discusses {{the effects of the}} <b>area</b> <b>fill</b> factor on the frequency characteristics of CMUTs, which reveals that the transducer active area should be maximized to obtain a wideband response at high frequencies.

In this letter, forest aboveground biomass is estimated from bistatic TanDEM-X data, a Lidar digital elevation model (DEM), and the interferometric water cloud model, without using training samples to calibrate the model. The forest was characterized by allometric relations for <b>area</b> <b>fill</b> (vegetation fraction) and height versus stem volume, and stem volume versus biomass. Biomass was estimated for 202 forest stands at least 1 ha large at the forest test site of Remningstorp, Sweden, from 18 bistatic TanDEM-X acquisitions with a relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 16 %- 32 %. TanDEM-X acquisitions with a height of ambiguity around 80 m resulted in the best results. A multitemporal combination resulted in a relative RMSE of 17 %. This result is comparable with the retrieval error obtained in a previous study when training the model using a set of known forest stands...|$|E

30|$|Subsequently, dynamic super-resolution (DSR) [16] {{is applied}} to the aligned images. DSR is a {{proprietary}} algorithm which estimates the true scene image that minimizes the difference between the camera images and the warped and backprojected true scene image. The backprojection employs a PSF model consisting of a Gaussian with a width parameter σ[*]=[*] 0.3 low-resolution pixels and rectangular camera response with 81 % <b>area</b> <b>fill</b> factor per pixel. The DSR step effectively temporally averages small-scale turbulence-induced shifts of the scene over ten frames, which results in blurring of the output of the DSR step compared to the input. In the DSR step, moving objects are detected using the per-frame differences between camera images and backprojected true scene image mentioned above. All pixels are classified as either background or moving object pixels. Pixels corresponding to moving objects are not temporally averaged, but instead the pixel values from the input frame are used for the DSR output. For a given frame, the image points in the output of the DSR step are aligned with the corresponding points in the raw input frame. For example, a window in the output of the DSR step is located in the same location as in the same window in the corresponding input image, albeit on a higher resolution pixel grid.|$|E
