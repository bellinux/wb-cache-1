He often carried a hip flask in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Level Navigations are {{a network}} of {{waterways}} in England, primarily used for land drainage, which lie in The Fens between the Rivers Nene and Great Ouse, and between the cities of Peterborough and Cambridge. Most of the area through which they run is at or below sea level, and attempts {{to protect it from}} inundation have been carried out since 1480. The Middle Level was given its name by the Dutch Engineer Cornelius Vermuyden in 1642, who subsequently constructed several drainage channels to make the area suitable for agriculture. Water levels were <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> to allow navigation, and Commissioners were established in 1754 to maintain the waterways and collect tolls from commercial traffic.|$|E

Until the general election in 2006, the PAP had <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> to return to power on nomination day, even before the elections commenced since the amendment to the Parliamentary Elections Act. The opposition accuses that the group representation constituency is an intentional hindrance, as between 1991 and 2001 did not manage to put forward enough qualified candidates to even contest the PAP's mandate.|$|E
25|$|The Olaf was {{attacked}} and damaged by German aircraft several times, but it <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> {{to get back}} to Shetland. The worst damage occurred on 12 May 1942. Three crew from the wrecked Frøya, along with some others, went out with the Olaf to search for a raft with four of the Frøya crew. They were attacked five times by a German Dornier bomber. The vessel was severely damaged, and some of the crew wounded. One of the three men from the Frøya, Hans Johansen, later died of his wounds. The Olaf made no more journeys and after the war it was returned to the owners who sold it in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the onset}} of Operation Reinhard which marked the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in Poland many Jews were transported by road to killing sites such as the Chełmno {{extermination}} camp, equipped with gas vans. In 1942, stationary gas chambers were built at Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, Majdanek and Auschwitz. After the Nazi takeover of prewar Polish railway company PKP, the train movements, originating inside and outside occupied Poland and terminating at death camps, were tracked by Dehomag using IBM-supplied card-reading machines and traditional waybills produced by the Reichsbahn. The Holocaust trains were <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> and directed by native German SS men posted with that express' role throughout the system.|$|E

25|$|Public opinion {{pressured}} the U.S. government to bring Villa to {{justice for the}} raid on Columbus, New Mexico; U.S. President Wilson sent Gen. John J. Pershing and some 5,000 troops into Mexico in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Villa. It {{was known as the}} Punitive Expedition. After nearly a year of pursuing Villa, American forces returned to the United States. The American intervention had been limited to the western sierras of Chihuahua. Villa had the advantage of intimately knowing the inhospitable terrain of the Sonoran Desert and the almost impassable Sierra Madre mountains and <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> to stay one step ahead of his pursuers. In 1923 Villa was assassinated by a group of seven gunmen who ambushed him while he was sitting {{in the back seat of}} his car in Parral.|$|E

[...] TV Line ranked the episode 2nd on a similar list, only below [...] "Pilot".

[...] While Naomi home-nursed Paul, her mother became suspicious, worrying that it might impact on Naomi's relationship with Brennan. This forced Paul to defend their connection. When Paul was later informed that his body was no longer responding to the chemotherapy, he started putting his affairs in order and showed a vulnerable side to Naomi. While comforting him, Naomi was [...] "overcome with emotion" [...] and she kissed Paul. Despite trying to make their relationship more professional, Naomi realised that she had developed feelings for Paul and she decided to break up with Brennan.|$|E

That winter, after demonstrating that Phelps was a hard worker he was made Master-Mate of the Main Gun Deck. His {{promotion}} was the cause of resentment to a couple of Phelps's shipmates, who sometimes would resort to measures aimed at getting him into trouble, but which never succeeded. Writing to his father, Phelps maintained that there were times were they would attempt to provoke him to a duel, but reassuring his father, he said he abhorred the practice and <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> to avert the situation.|$|E
2500|$|Facing a {{coalition}} which included Austria, France, Russia, Saxony and Sweden, and having only Great Britain, Hesse, Brunswick, and Hanover as his allies, Frederick narrowly kept Prussia {{in the war}} despite having his territories repeatedly invaded. He suffered some severe defeats himself and was frequently at the last gasp, but <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> to recover. Prussia's position became even more desperate when Britain (having made gains in India and the Americas) ended their financial support for Prussia {{after the death of}} King George II, Frederick's uncle. On 6 January 1762, he wrote to Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, [...] "We ought now to think of preserving for my nephew, by way of negotiation, whatever fragments of my territory we can save from the avidity of my enemies". [...] With the Russians slowly advancing towards Berlin, it looked as though Prussia was about to collapse.|$|E

2500|$|A.E.B. de Chancourtois plotted {{the atomic}} weights {{on the surface}} of a {{cylinder}} with a circumference of 16 units, the approximate atomic weight of oxygen. The resulting helical curve, which de Chancourtois called a square circle triangle, brought similar elements onto corresponding points above or below one another on the cylinder. Thus, he suggested that [...] "the properties of the elements are the properties of numbers." [...] He was the first scientist to see the periodicity of elements when they were arranged in order of their atomic weights. He saw that the similar elements occurred at regular atomic weight intervals. Despite de Chancourtois' work, his publication attracted little attention from chemists around the world. He presented the paper to the French Academy of Sciences which published it in Comptes Rendus, the academy's journal. De Chancourtois's original diagram was left out of the publication, making the paper hard to comprehend. However, the diagram did appear in a less widely read geological pamphlet. The paper also dealt mainly with geological concepts, and did not suit the interests of many chemistry experts. It was not until 1869 that Dmitri Mendeleyev's periodic table attracted attention and gained widespread scientific acceptance. He <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> to put the names of his four children into his work by writing their names on a corner of his work. [...] Landon, Lynelle, Steve and Berdine were on all his work.|$|E
2500|$|After the United States {{abolished}} slavery, Garrison {{announced in}} May 1865 {{that he would}} resign {{the presidency of the}} American Anti-Slavery Society and offered a resolution declaring victory in the struggle against slavery and dissolving the society. The resolution prompted sharp debate, however, led by his long-time friend Wendell Phillips, who argued that the mission of the AAS was not fully completed until black Southerners gained full political and civil equality. Garrison maintained that while complete civil equality was vitally important, the special task of the AAS was at an end, and that the new task would best be handled by new organizations and new leadership. With his long-time allies deeply divided, however, he was unable to muster the support he needed to carry the resolution, and it was defeated 118–48. Declaring that his [...] "vocation as an Abolitionist, thank God, has ended," [...] Garrison resigned the presidency and declined an appeal to continue. Returning home to Boston, he withdrew completely from the AAS and ended publication of The Liberator at the end of 1865. With Wendell Phillips at its head, the AAS continued to operate for five more years, until ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution granted voting rights to black men. (According to Henry Mayer, Garrison was hurt by the rejection, and remained peeved for years; [...] "as the cycle came around, <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> to tell someone {{that he was not going}} to the next set of [...] meetings" [...]) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Liberals {{lost the}} federal {{election}} of May 1979 to a minority Conservative government led by Joe Clark. When Pierre Trudeau regained power in February 1980, he appointed Chrétien Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. In this role, he was {{a major force in}} the 1980 Quebec referendum, being one of the main federal representatives [...] "on the ground" [...] during the campaign. His fiery and emotional speeches would enthrall federalist crowds with his blunt warnings of the consequences of separation. During the 1980 referendum, Chrétien fiercely fought behind the scenes with the leader of the Quebec Liberals, Claude Ryan, who served as the chairman of the non committee about the best course to follow, with Ryan favoring a more Quebec nationalist message as opposed to Chrétien's unabashed Canadian nationalist message. In his speeches, Chrétien boosted the first white men to see the Prairies and the Rocky mountains had been the French-Canadian voyaguers and Coureur des bois in the 17th and 18th centuries, saying the Rockies and the Great Plains were part of French Canada's heritage, and asked how could the Québécois ever give up their heritage. Chrétien praised the great French fur traders like Pierre-Esprit Radisson, Médard des Groseilliers, and La Vérendrye who ventured west, saying what they had found belonged to all of French Canada, and often ended his speeches with the remark [...] "I want them [...] for my children and grandchildren!", which frequently brought his audiences to tears. Chrétien delivered an average of 6 or 7 speeches a day during the 1980 referendum all across Quebec and <b>always</b> <b>managed</b> to work in a local reference in every speech.|$|E
