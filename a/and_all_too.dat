2500|$|Charles Lock is {{well known}} for his hatred of Lord Nelson's mistress, Emma Hamilton, the wife of the British {{ambassador}} in Naples William Hamilton. Strains between Lady Hamilton and Lock and his wife led to poisonous relations in the court at Palermo. Biographer Flora Fraser, in her book Emma, Lady Hamilton, describes Charles Lock as [...] "a difficult young man, quick to take offence <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> eager to put himself forward." [...] She points out that his [...] "violent dislike" [...] of Lady Hamilton seems to have reciprocated. Lady Hamilton is known to have spread rumours about Charles Lock's wife Cecilia being a Jacobin, possibly because she was jealous of Cecilia's good looks and youthful figure.|$|E

(5) Jews must [...] "rise {{above the}} heavy burden of {{historical}} memories which {{have made it}} difficult for them to achieve any real understanding, let alone an appreciation, of Christianity. It is not easy to wipe out the memories of centuries of persecution <b>and</b> , <b>all</b> <b>too</b> often dedicated to the advancement of the cause of the ..... no easy task for Jews to divest themselves of the heavy burden of group memories from the past, which are unfortunately reinforced all too often by personal experiences in the present. Nevertheless, the effort must be made, if men are to emerge from the dark heritage of religious hatred which has embittered their mutual relationships for twenty centuries. There is need for Jews to surrender the stereotype of Christianity as being monolithic and unchanging and to recognize the ramifications of viewpoint and emphasis that constitute the multicolored spectrum of contemporary Christianity." ...|$|E

2500|$|CNN's Paul Clinton {{said that}} the miniseries [...] "is a {{remarkable}} testament to that generation of citizen soldiers, who responded when called upon {{to save the world}} for democracy and then quietly returned to build the nation that we now all enjoy, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> often take for granted." [...] Caryn James of The New York Times called it [...] "an extraordinary 10-part series that masters its greatest challenge: it balances the ideal of heroism with the violence and terror of battle, reflecting what is both civilized and savage about war." [...] James also remarked on the generation gap between most viewers and characters, suggesting this was a significant hurdle. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that the series was [...] "significantly flawed and yet absolutely extraordinary—just like the men it portrays," [...] rating the series four out of four stars. He noted however that it was hard to identify with individual characters during crowded battle scenes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994 I was a {{relatively}} new and young bishop when the now famous Conference of Bishops was convened at the Antiochian Village, and so together with another young bishop, His Grace Seraphim of Ottawa and Canada, I {{was appointed to the}} Conference's secretariat. Ligonier '94 was without doubt one of the brightest momentsif not THE brightest momentin the history of Holy Orthodoxy in the New World. Dozens of bishops met and prayed and deliberated on that Pennsylvania mountain-top, while hundreds of thousands of our young people across the continent prayed and fasted that we might accomplish a good for Holy Orthodoxy. And, by God's grace, a great good was indeed accomplished! The common hope and vision expressed by my brother bishops during those several days and reflected in the two historic documents produced by the Conference caused a refreshing and invigorating breeze to blow across this continent, opening the doors of our Orthodox congregations with hope and joyful anticipation. But sadly <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> quickly, dark storm clouds blew in from the East, causing those doors to be slammed shut once more. Some of those doors were and remained locked to this very day, while others stand ajar, awaiting another refreshing and invigorating breeze to open them once again. May that breeze come quickly! ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his profile}} of Sanielevici, Eugen Lovinescu {{mentions}} a [...] "lampoonist's deformation and stylistic violence", [...] "lucidity in expression" [...] {{and many other}} talents, {{as well as a}} [...] "noble", but misguided and distorted, passion for turning [...] "crude material" [...] into science. He adds: [...] "H. Sanielevici's style, much like his entire personality, suffers from a twofold shift in balance: firstly in the verbal violence and then in the morbid self-awareness." [...] In his own retrospective work, Călinescu also proposed that Sanielevici was an essayist more than an actual critic, praising his texts as evidences of [...] "great literary skill" [...] ("gracious" [...] works, with charmingly [...] "voluptuous poetry", but also [...] "bizarre" [...] in content). He remarked that, while Sanielevici could prove himself [...] "a talented polemicist", the assessments he made displayed such [...] "enormity" [...] as to become [...] "inoffensive". Similarly, Z. Ornea discusses Sanielevici and his traditionalist rival Ilarie Chendi as [...] "tested polemicists", [...] "excellent at organizing and mapping out campaigns"; he notes however that Sanielevici was [...] "haughty beyond measure", <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> imaginative. In later overviews, Jicu found that Sanielevici was [...] "narcissistic" [...] and self-promoting, but not an ignorant, while Patraş, who concedes that Sanielevici came up with some new ideas of importance in literary analysis, judges him as one who alternated scientific endeavors with mere journalism.|$|E
