5|$|Within an {{environment}} characterized by low wind shear, high <b>atmospheric</b> <b>humidity,</b> and warm sea surface temperatures, Earl intensified, reaching a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) by 0600UTC on August15.

Despite an impressive satellite presentation associated with Earl as it passed through the southern Leeward Islands, a hurricane hunter flight reported that the system {{no longer had a}} low-level circulation late on August15. As a result, the NHC discontinued advisories on the system and declared it an open tropical wave. While not entirely sure, it is suspected that the fast motion of the cyclone attributed to its dissipation.

40|$|Surface {{turbulent}} fluxes are key pathways {{through which}} the atmosphere is coupled with the ocean. They provide mechanisms through which momentum, energy, moisture, and materials such as CO 2 are transferred between the ocean and atmosphere. Surface fluxes are also important players in vertical and horizontal transport in the atmosphere and the ocean.

2500|$|Because the dry {{powdered}} ingredients must {{be mixed}} and bonded together for extrusion and cutting into grains {{to maintain the}} blend, size reduction and mixing is done while the ingredients are damp, usually with water.

The pressing took varying amounts of time, depending on conditions such as <b>atmospheric</b> <b>humidity.</b> [...] The hard, dense product was broken again into tiny pieces, which were separated with sieves to produce a uniform product for each purpose: coarse powders for cannons, finer grained powders for muskets, and the finest for small hand guns and priming. Inappropriately fine-grained powder often caused cannons to burst before the projectile could move down the barrel, due to the high initial spike in pressure.
