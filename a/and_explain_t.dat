As a part of t he development of t he space-time conservation element and solution element (CE/SE) method, sets of NRBCs for 1 D Euler problems are developed without using any characteristics- based techniques. These conditions are much simpler than those commonly reported in the literature, yet so robust that they are applicable to subsonic, transonic and supersonic flows even in the presence of discontinuities. In addition, the straightforward multidimensional extensions of the present 1 D NRBCs have been shown numerically to be equally simple and robust. The paper details the theoretical underpinning of these NRBCs, <b>and</b> <b>explains</b> <b>t</b> heir unique robustness and accuracy in terms of t he conservation of space-time fluxes. Some numerical results for an extended Sod's shock-tube problem, illustrating the effectiveness of the present NRBCs are included, together with an associated simple Fortran computer program.

50|$|The {{control of}} {{antibody}} response by the Mhc raised many question. The {{one on the}} top of immunologists’ agenda was: Why were some individuals carrying a certain H2 haplotype high responders to a given antigen, while others, carrying certain other haplotype were low responders or nonresponders? The phenomenon could be reproduced in vitro by the exposure to the antigen. Lymphocytes isolated from the high responder proliferated to a much higher degree than those isolated from a low responder individual. The assay required, in addition to the thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes, also “macrophages” or antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from the same individual. In this set-up the question reduced itself to: Are the T lymphocytes or the APCs responsible for the difference in responsiveness? Many immunologists were inclined to put the blame on the APCs, but the Klein-Nagy group, in a series of elegant experiments, falsified this hypothesis <b>and</b> <b>explained</b> why <b>T</b> lymphocytes bearing different Mhc haplotypes might differ in their response to specific antigens. The receptors of the T lymphocytes recognize an antigen in association with their own Mhc molecules. The different specificities of the Tcrs born by the individual T cells are generated by a special mechanism during the lymphocyte development from precursor cells in the thymus. The generation is entirely random, so that receptors arise against all possible antigens, including those borne by the individual in which the differentiation takes place (the self-molecules). The cells with receptors for self-molecules must be eliminated to prevent an immune reaction against the individual’s own components. The eliminated Tcrs might, however, by chance have had the capability of recognizing certain foreign antigens (nonself) in association with the nonresponder’ ownMhc molecules. The T-cell repertoire thus has “blind spots”, making an individual nonresponsive not only to self but also against certain foreign antigens.|$|R

40|$|Background: Published {{influenza}} vaccination coverage {{in health care}} workers (HCW) are calculated using two sources: self-report and vaccination records. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether self-report is a good proxy for recorded vaccination in HCW, as the degree of the relationship is not known, and whether vaccine behaviour influences self-reporting. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered survey during September 2010. Considering the vaccination record as the gold standard of vaccination, the properties of self-report as a proxy of the record (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) were calculated. Concordance between the vaccination campaigns studied (2007 – 2010) was made using the Kappa index, and discordance was analyzed using McNemar’s test. Results: 248 HCW responded. The 95 % confidence intervals of coverage according to the vaccination record and to self-report overlapped, except for 2007, and the Kappa index showed a substantial concordance, except for 2007. McNemar’s test suggested that differences between discordant cases were not due to chance and it was found that the proportion of unvaccinated discordant cases was higher than that of vaccinated discordant cases. Conclusions: In our study population, self-reported {{influenza vaccination}} coverage in HCW in the previous two years is a good proxy of the vaccination record.

40|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the study was to replicate Moore & Benbasat's model of information technology adoption (I 990 a, b,; 1991 ab,) which fused two established theories, the Diffusion of Innovations (Rogers, 1962) and the Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbcin & Ajzcn, 1975), an attitude-behaviour theory. Flaws were found in the construction and application of the model, most notably in relation to the origin of belief statements used on their instrument. Nevertheless, the overall aims of their study were thought to be worthwhile. A literature survey provided an understanding of the study context, the historical background of the Theory of Reasoned Action and the manner in which the Theory has been applied and adapted. Evidently, volitional control is a pertinent factor in organisational studies yet existing extensions of the Theory of Reasoned Action which attend to volitional control were found to be imperfect for applications in organisations. A new model was developed by the author for the purpose of predicting <b>and</b> <b>explaining</b> I. <b>T.</b> innovation behaviours in organisations. The model was tested on employees of the University of Central Lancashire, first by qualitatively eliciting and grouping salient beliefs and secondly through a quantitative survey of randomly selected individuals. Findings from the survey data were variable. The act-specific part of the model had predictive power, and this improved with the addition and substitution of determinants. On the other hand, problems were found with the general organisational constructs; factors contributing to the predictive weakness here have been identified. An examination of underlying belief structures provides information for implementers. Recommendations arc made for intervention communications relating to I. T. implementations. The development of organisational and control belief structures is proposed to provide a diagnostic tool for supplementary use where organisations wish to qualitatively judge the 'temperature', or alternatively to administer a quantitative study of employee satisfaction - these, without prejudice to the claims for the extended model. The author stands by the theory and recommends a course whereby the model is expected to hold...|$|R

Comparison of kinetic {{proofreading}} schemes of TCR signaling Kinetic proofreading [KP], {{the standard}} scheme proposed to <b>explain</b> <b>T</b> cell specificity, {{is not sufficient}} to understand the speed and sensitivity of ligand-induced signaling All the non-allosteric models proposed to <b>explain</b> <b>T</b> cell ligand discrimination are based on translating modest kinetic variations in pMHC-TCR interaction into large downstream signaling output differences. McKeithan [1] was the first to propose in detail that successive phosphorylations of the TCR-associated chains in combination with additional downstream signaling events provide a lag time between the initial binding of a pMHC to the TCR and the full activation of the lymphocyte. Dissociation of the pMHC from the TCR was presumed to prevent completion of any signaling steps in the cascade that had not yet occurred, providing a temporal filter that limits the ability of ligands that bind poorly to the TCR to induce functional responses. Because of the dominant influence of KP models in TCR signaling simulations, we re-examined KP schemes to test whether they could achieve the required speed and sensitivity as well as specificity.

40|$|The Fourth Amendment {{special needs}} {{exception}} {{may be one}} of the Court’s most puzzling doctrines. Since its origin, the Court has struggled to define its limits and its place in the Court’s suspicionless search and seizure jurisprudence. At times the Court has suggested that the exception is the only route to upholding a search or seizure in the absence of individualized suspicion, while at other times it has stated that it is just one of a limited number of exceptions to the requirement of individualized suspicion. Historically, while the application of the special needs exception has been unpredictable, one thing was clear: once the Court found a “special need,” the search in question was upheld. More recently, the Court has struck down several suspicionless search schemes because, in the Court’s view, they were implemented with the primary purpose of ordinary crime control. However, just as some limits have appeared to rein in suspicionless and/or special needs searches, the Court seems ready to jettison the exception in favor of what it refers to as “a general Fourth Amendment analysis. ” This Article, written as part of the National Center for Justice and the Rule of Law annual Fourth Amendment symposium on Children and the Fourth Amendment, analyzes the current state of the special needs exception created in New Jersey v. T. L. O. The Article begins with a detailed discussion of the Court’s suspicionless search jurisprudence <b>and</b> <b>explains</b> how <b>T.</b> L. O., and specifically Justice Blackmun’s concurrence, shaped the Court’s jurisprudence. The Article then reviews two recent parolee/probationer cases as well as the Court’s most recent school search case, Safford Unified School District No. 1 v. Redding, and argues that these cases suggest that after decades of ambiguity, confusion, and even explicit contradiction, the Court appears to have given up in its attempts to define the special needs exception and instead has turned to the even less well defined “general Fourth Amendment analysis” to analyze suspicionless searches and seizures. Most troubling, the Court may have done so as a means to avoid the few limits, particularly the “primary purpose” test, recently imposed on special needs searches. The Article warns that while civil libertarians used to, and still do, lament the “standardlessness” and permissiveness of the special needs exception, they may be wishing for the good old days once they see where the “general Fourth Amendment analysis” path leads...|$|R
