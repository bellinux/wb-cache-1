40|$|THESIS 7277. 1 THESIS 7277. 2 On the {{background}} of increasing phosphorus (P) concentrations in Irish rivers and lakes, this project set out to investigate several aspects of the potential of agricultural grassland to lose P to water. All study sites were located at Johnstown Castle Research and Development Centre, Wexford, Ireland. Water samples were collected from field sites, from an <b>artificial</b> subsurface <b>drainage</b> network (at the Beef Unit), and from a small stream (at the Dairy Farm). To {{study the effects of}} soil P levels on P exports in overland flow from grassland, {{the quantity and quality of}} overland flow from a low soil P (4 mg P/ 1 Morgan 2 ̆ 7 s) and a high soil P (17 mg P/ 1 Morgan 2 ̆ 7 s) field were measured for 16 consecutive months. Additionally, a medium soil P (8 mg P/ 1 Morgan 2 ̆ 7 s) site was monitored for 5 of the 16 months. A combination of open trenches and berms were used to hydrologically isolate the surface of the overland flow monitoring sites. To investigate the possibility of P losses along subsurface flow pathways, the <b>artificial</b> subsurface <b>drainage</b> network at the Beef Unit was monitored as an example of an existing subsurface drainage system. The measurements of flow and composition of the discharge from the <b>artificial</b> subsurface <b>drainage</b> network were complemented by a soil water sampling programme of limited extent. To study the combined effects of fields of different site and management characteristics on stream water quality, the stream naming through the Dairy Farm was monitored continuously at the upstream and the downstream boundary of the Dairy Farm sub-catchment. Additionally, a grab sampling programme provided information on changes of the stream water quality along the channel. Measurements of flow and quality of water in the <b>artificial</b> subsurface <b>drainage</b> network at the Beef Unit and in the Dairy Farm stream were carried out for 5 and 6 months, respectively, in consecutive years. Dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total dissolved P (TDP) were determined in most water samples from the overland flow and the subsurfece flow monitoring sites. Total P (TP) was measured in a subset of samples. DRP was the main P fraction analysed in water from the Daily Farm stream but some TDP and TP determinations were also carried out...|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, gypsum (calcium sulfate, CaSO4. 2H2O) {{can also}} be applied {{as a source of}} Ca++ ions to replace the sodium at the {{exchange}} complex. Gypsum also reacts with sodium carbonate to convert into sodium sulphate which is a neutral salt and does not contribute to high pH. There must be enough natural drainage to the underground, or else an <b>artificial</b> subsurface <b>drainage</b> system must be present, to permit leaching of the excess sodium by percolation of rain and/or irrigation water through the soil profile.|$|R

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are approximately 3. 6 million ha of land with <b>artificial</b> subsurface <b>drainage</b> in Iowa, with 2. 4 million ha of that within the 3000 organized drainage districts (total land area {{of the state is}} 14. 6 million ha). This drainage has made otherwise wet soils very productive. Much of this drainage was installed early last century and is reaching the end of its service life. One challenge will be the repair/replacement of these drainage systems. Because subsurface drainage 2 ̆ 2 short circuits 2 ̆ 2 some infiltrating water back to surface water resources, there is also a water quality challenge. Research has shown that during rainfall-runoff events, the presence of <b>artificial</b> subsurface <b>drainage</b> generally delays and reduces the volume of surface runoff. Therefore, total losses of sediment, phosphorus, ammonium-nitrogen, pesticides, and micro-organisms are decreased with subsurface drainage. However, nitrate-nitrogen leaching is increased with subsurface drainage water, and has been implicated as a major factor relative to hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Research has identified several factors relative to soils, weather, and management (cropping, tillage, chemical application practices, and drainage parameters) that influence the nitrate-nitrogen leaching problem. This will be discussed along with implications for possible changes in the drainage systems and land management that may be needed to sustain production while reducing nitrate-nitrogen losses...|$|R

50|$|Drainage is {{the natural}} or {{artificial}} removal of a surface's water and sub-surface water from an area.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the relation between mega-gully (> 5 m width) distribution and urbanization in Kinshasa (D. R. Congo), to establish what governs mega-gully location and plan form and to illustrate the concepts behind mega-gully treatment. For this purpose, the diachronic distribution of mega-gullies has been mapped in Kinshasa. All mega-gullies {{have been reported in}} ArcGis 9. 3 on the orthorectified SPOT 2007 image. A newly elaborated DEM enables the mega-gullies to be placed in their natural topographical context. The GIS inventory on the SPOT 2006 / 2007 anaglyph indicates the mega-gully situation in the high town of Kinshasa 5 years ago: 308 mega-gullies with a cumulated length of 94. 7 km, a mean drainage density of 0. 4 km km− 2 and an average width and depth of 17 m and 6 m respectively. On the WorldView 1 (WV 1) coverage, the number of mega-gullies has more than doubled between 2007 and 2010 from 160 to 334. The study shows that mega-gullies only develop within the urbanized perimeter of the high town of Kinshasa and only 5 to 10 years after incipient urbanization. The study also indicates that neither the location, the plan form or the downslope course of mega-gullies in Kinshasa are controlled by the natural topography. Forty-three point eight percent of the mega-gullies in Kinshasa are ‘axial’, occupying urban structures which function as <b>artificial</b> runoff <b>drainage</b> lines: roads, tarred or not, with or without side-road trenches, gutters in all forms and materials from concrete to sand, also foot paths and further all <b>artificial</b> runoff <b>drainage</b> lines. The study reveals that every mega-gully is directly or indirectly induced by human activities, but that every gully also finally ends to grow after an initial phase of sudden development. Mega-gully treatment follows two principles, often combined. The first is to stop the alimentation of the mega-gully head with water. The second includes a complete stabilization of the channel and walls inside the mega-gully. This study emphasizes that gully prevention can basically be achieved by control of the runoff discharges in the artificial stream network, as well as beside the roads. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the intraocular pressure (IOP) control of an <b>artificial</b> trabeculum <b>drainage</b> system (ATDS), a newly designed glaucoma drainage device, and postoperative complications in normal rabbit eyes. METHODS: Pressure drops in air and fluid of 30 ATDS were measured after being {{connected to a}} closed manometric system. Twenty of them were then chosen and implanted randomly {{into the eyes of}} 20 rabbits. Postoperative slit-lamp, gonioscopic examination and IOP measurements were recorded periodically. Ultrasound biomicroscopy and B-scan ultrasonography were also used to observe the complications. Eyes were enucleated on day 60. RESULTS: Pressure drops of 4. 6 - 9. 4 mm Hg were obtained at physiological aqueous flow rates in the tests in vitro. The average postoperative IOP of the experimental eyes (11. 6 - 12. 8 mm Hg) was lower than the controls significantly (P< 0. 05) at each time point. Complications of hemorrhage (n= 1), cellulosic exudation (two cases) and local iris congestion (two cases) were observed. The lumina of the devices were devoid of obstructions in all specimens examined and a thin fibrous capsule was found around the endplate. CONCLUSION: ATDS reduce IOP effectively. However, further studies on the structure are needed to reduce complications...|$|R
