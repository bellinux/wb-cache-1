50|$|Reaction of 2-bromo tribenzoyl ribose with diaminomaleonitrile {{results in}} the {{displacement}} of the anomeric halogen {{by one of the}} amino groups and the formation of the <b>aminosugar</b> largely as the β-anomer. Treatment of this product with methyl orthoformate {{in the presence of a}} base leads to the replacement of the alkoxy groups in orthoformate by the adjacent amines, resulting in the formation of the imidazole ring. Reaction with alkoxide then interestingly converts the nitrile nearest the sugar to an iminoester; the benzoyl groups are cleaved in the process. Hofmann rearrangement in the presence of a bromine and a base converts the iminoester to the corresponding primary amine. Basic hydrolysis then converts the remaining nitrile to an amide, affording acadesine.|$|E
50|$|Aminoglycoside is a {{medicinal}} and bacteriologic {{category of}} traditional Gram-negative antibacterial therapeutic agents that inhibit protein synthesis and contain as {{a portion of}} the molecule an amino-modified glycoside (sugar);the term can also refer more generally to any organic molecule that contains <b>aminosugar</b> substructures. Aminoglycoside antibiotics display bactericidal activity against gram-negative aerobes and some anaerobic bacilli where resistance has not yet arisen, but generally not against Gram-positive and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. They include the first-in-class aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin (images at right) derived from Streptomyces griseus, the earliest modern agent used against tuberculosis, and an example that lacks the common 2-deoxystreptamine moiety (image right, below) present in many other class members.

40|$|SummaryThe biosynthetic {{gene cluster}} for the enediyne {{antitumor}} antibiotic neocarzinostatin (NCS) was localized to 130 kb continuous DNA from Streptomyces carzinostaticus ATCC 15944 and confirmed by gene inactivation.

Sequence analysis of the genes within the NCS cluster suggested dNDP-D-mannose as a precursor for the deoxy <b>aminosugar,</b> revealed two distinct type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), and supported a convergent model for NCS chromophore biosynthesis from the deoxy <b>aminosugar,</b> naphthoic acid, and enediyne core building blocks.

40|$|Recent {{data suggest}} that <b>aminosugar</b> {{derivatives}} which inhibit glycoprotein processing have potential anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity. These inhibitory effects {{may be due to}} disruption of cell fusion and subsequent cell-cell transmission of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus. Free virus particles able to bind CD 4 -positive cells are still produced in the presence of these compounds with only partial reduction of infectivity. We now report a method to score in parallel both the degree of antiviral activity and the effect on cell division of <b>aminosugar</b> derivatives. We find that (i) the compounds 1, 4 -dideoxy- 1, 4 -imino-L-arabinitol and N-(5 -carboxymethyl- 1 -pentyl) - 1, 5 -imino-L-fucitol partially inhibit the cytopathic effect (giant cell formation, etc.) of HIV and yield of infectious virus; (ii) the compounds N-methyldeoxynojirimycin and N-ethyldeoxynojirimycin reduce the yield of infectious HIV by an order of four and three logarithms, respectively; and (iii) one compound, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, of the 47 compounds previously screened reduces infectious viral particles by a logarithmic order greater than five at noncytotoxic concentrations. In addition, long-term growth of infected cells in the presence of N-butyldeoxynojirimycin gradually decreases the proportion of infected cells, leading to eventual elimination of HIV from culture.

40|$|Wall chart: The {{predominant}} {{component of}} the bacterial cell wall, peptidoglycan, consists of long alternating stretches of <b>aminosugar</b> subunits interlinked in a large three-dimensional network and is formed from precursors through several cytosolic and membrane-bound steps. The high tolerance of the cell wall synthesis machinery allows {{for the use of}} labeled precursor derivatives to study diverse aspects of bacterial cell wall synthesis and interaction with antibiotics. Because of its importance for bacterial cell survival, the bacterial cell wall is an attractive target for new antibiotics in a time of great demand for new antibiotic compounds. Therefore, more knowledge about the diverse processes related to bacterial cell wall synthesis is needed. The cell wall is located on the exterior of the cell and consists mainly of peptidoglycan, a large macromolecule built up from a three-dimensional network of <b>aminosugar</b> strands interlinked with peptide bridges. The subunits of peptidoglycan are synthesized inside the cell before they are transported to the exterior in order to be incorporated into the growing peptidoglycan. The high flexibility of the cell wall synthesis machinery towards unnatural derivatives of these subunits enables research on the bacterial cell wall using labeled compounds. This review highlights the high potential of labeled cell wall precursors in various areas of cell wall research. Labeled precursors can be used in investigating direct cell wall-antibiotic interactions and in cell wall synthesis and localization studies. Moreover, these compounds can provide a powerful tool in the elucidation of the cell wall proteome, the wallosome, and thus, might provide new targets for antibiotic...|$|E
