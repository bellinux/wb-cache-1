Governor Futon directed Brigadier General Hill to place organize his brigade <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> readiness to take the field at once. On June 28, 1836, General Edmund P.

During a urologic operation, the anaesthetist announced that the patient's heart had stopped. To the amazement of Beck, the surgical resident removed his gloves {{and went to a}} telephone {{in a corner of the}} room and called the fire department. Beck remained in total bewilderment as the fire department rescue squad rushed into the operating room 15minutes later and applied oxygen-powered respirators to the patient's face. The patient died, but the episode left an indelible impression on him. Beck would go on to develop techniques to take back the management of cardiac arrest from the fire department <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the hands of surgeons.|$|E

25|$|The {{permanent}} John F. Kennedy {{grave site}} opened with little announcement or fanfare on March 15, 1967. A few days before, the eternal flame {{had been moved}} from its temporary location to the new site. The reburial of the bodies occurred {{on the evening of}} March 14, after Arlington National Cemetery had closed. Earth over the existing grave was removed, and a small crane was used to lift the burial vault (which remained unopened) from the old grave <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the new one. The event was unannounced. The transfer was witnessed by Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston. Exhumation began at 6:19 PM and was complete at 9:00 PM. Consecration of the new burial site occurred at 7:00 AM on March 15, 1967, in a driving rain. The ceremony, which took 20 minutes, was attended by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Mrs. Kennedy, and members of the Kennedy family. Cardinal Cushing presided over the consecration. The final cost of the entire project was $2.2 million.|$|E
500|$|Backers of the {{initiative}} say 90% of the proceeds from the state's sale of marijuana {{would have gone to}} Oregon's general fund (as much as $300 million), lowering the state tax burden, while 10% of the revenue would have been used to fund drug abuse education and treatment programs. Advocates claim the marijuana market would be removed from the underground economy, where young people and drug abusers often take control, <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> liquor stores regulated by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) so that the minimum age of 21 can be enforced.

500|$|Astatine {{was first}} {{produced}} by bombarding bismuth-209 with energetic alpha particles, {{and this is}} still the major route used to create the relatively long-lived isotopes astatine-209 through astatine-211. Astatine is only produced in minuscule quantities, with modern techniques allowing production runs of up to 6.6gigabecquerels (about 86nanograms or 2.47 × 1014 atoms). Synthesis of greater quantities of astatine using this method is constrained by the limited availability of suitable cyclotrons {{and the prospect of}} melting the target. who encapsulate the bismuth target in a thin aluminium foil <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a niobium holder capable of holding molten bismuth.}} Solvent radiolysis due to the cumulative effect of astatine decay is a related problem. With cryogenic technology, microgram quantities of astatine might be able to be generated via proton irradiation of thorium or uranium to yield radon-211, in turn decaying to astatine-211. Contamination with astatine-210 {{is expected to be a}} drawback of this method.At-Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals | journal = The Journal of Nuclear Medicine [...] | volume = 42 [...] | issue = 10 [...] | pages = 1516–1518 | url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/42/10/1516|pmid=11585866}} ...|$|E

500|$|Despite its inaccuracies, the Beviss account had {{a strong}} {{influence}} over the story. For many years, both John Chipp Hamp and Geharty figured prominently in retellings of the massacre. According to several accounts, Hamp's son was also involved in spreading {{the story of his}} father's death, including the story of the head in the camp oven, and that {{he was the one who}} discovered the body. Geharty was also mentioned by a number of those that told the story, but again, there are serious questions about the accuracy of his statements. In 1932, a version of the story was told in The Advertiser in which a party of 200 bushmen drove a group of Aboriginal people to the cliffs, but there was possibly only one victim. The writer claimed he had been told this by Geharty. However, from 1926 onwards, most accounts of the massacre usually referred to the archival and newspaper record and noted that there was no evidence for a massacre on the scale of that claimed by Congreve, Beviss or John Chipp Hamp. In 1936, the historian James Dugald Somerville wrote a series of articles in the Port Lincoln Times regarding early settler life on the Eyre Peninsula, in which he concluded that [...] "it is a certainty that the Waterloo Bay 'massacre', as pictured by H.J.C. ,.. A. Beviss and others did not occur, and that the natives did not cut the head off Hamps' body <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the camp oven".|$|E
500|$|At trial, {{it emerged}} that Capper had been kidnapped for [...] "insubstantial, even trivial" [...] reasons: Jean Powell claimed that Capper {{had tried to}} persuade her to sleep with a man for money; McNeilly and Dudson had {{contracted}} pubic lice which they believed were from a bed that Capper had also used; and McNeilly believed that she had taken a pink duffle coat that belonged to her. In November 1992, when Dudson had contracted pubic lice and had his pubic hair shaved, McNeilly told him she {{thought that he had}} caught them from Capper. Dudson believed otherwise, and said later: [...] "I told Jean [...] I thought I got them from Bernie [...]" [...] On 7 December 1992, Capper was lured to Jean Powell's home, where Glyn Powell and Dudson were already waiting. She was grabbed as soon as she arrived and held down while Glyn Powell shaved her head and her eyebrows and then made her clean up the hair <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a bin. Then he placed a plastic bag over her head and walked round her while hitting her on the head. She was then kicked by Jean Powell and McNeilly as she lay curled up on the floor and both women took turns beating her with a three-foot-long (1 m) wooden instrument and a belt. She was then taken to the bathroom and forced to shave off her own pubic hair as [...] "ritual humiliation in revenge for having caused, as they claimed, Dudson and McNeilly themselves to be shaved." [...] Afterwards Jean Powell locked her in a cupboard overnight. The following morning she was taken upstairs and locked in another cupboard. On 8 December she was transferred to McNeilly's house because of concern that Powell and McNeilly's six children were disturbed by Capper's crying. There she was tied spreadeagle to an upturned bed with electrical flex in a downstairs back room.|$|E
500|$|The Mk 12 Gun Assembly (pictured) was a semi-automatic, power rammed, {{vertical}} sliding-wedge {{breech block}} type gun. Since this gun assembly fired semi-fixed ammunition, (pictured) each round {{was delivered to}} the guns in two pieces. Each gun, in this twin mount, had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from the upper handling room. The electric-hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to the projectile man with the nose down and waist high. The electric-hydraulic powder case hoist poked the case through a powder scuttle in the gun room's deck just next to the powder man's feet. [...] At the load command, the powder man would slip a primer protector {{off the end of}} the powder case, extract the case from the scuttle, and lift it into the gun's rammer tray. Meanwhile, the projectile man would pull a projectile out of the hoist, <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the rammer tray in front of the powder case. Then, as he turned to get the next projectile out of the hoist, the projectile man would pull down on the rammer lever. This caused the power rammer to ram the projectile and powder case into the chamber. As the powder case cleared the top of the breechblock, the block would rise to seal the chamber. The gun was ready to fire. The case combination primer in the base of the powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion. Electrical firing was the preferred method because the firing circuit could be energized by firing keys down in the plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets, or up in the director when firing at air targets. Percussion firing could be executed by the Pointer (man controlling elevation) by pushing a foot treadle. When the gun fired, the recoil's rearward motion returned the rammer lever to the up position, and the rammer would drive back {{to the rear of the}} rammer tray. During counter-recoil, the breechblock was automatically lowered and the spent powder case was ejected from the chamber. When the gun returned to battery, a blast of compressed air was sent down the bore to clean it out. The gun was ready to be reloaded.|$|E

However, in the fall of 1253 Michael was accused before the Emperor John III Vatatzes of plotting against the throne. The only way Michael was allowed to prove his innocence was through trial by ordeal, holding a red-hot iron. When the Emperor ordered him to take hold of the red-hot metal, the young Michael answered (to use Geanakoplos' words) [...] "with the astuteness that was to characterize his later career as Emperor": if the Metropolitan Phokas of Philadelphia, who evidently supported this proposal, could take the iron from the altar with his own hands <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Michael's, he would gladly receive it in faith that the truth would be revealed.|$|E

Buell quotes Spruance speaking with Morison: [...] "As a matter of tactics I think that going out after the Japanese and knocking their carriers out would have been much better and more satisfactory than waiting for them to attack us, but we were at the start of a very important and large amphibious operation and we could not afford to gamble <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> jeopardy." ...|$|E
