5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> so, a dark {{plume of}} smoke was {{observed}} {{rising from the}} wreckage. The fire was traced to a ruptured oil tank above the right engine. The leaking oil fell onto the hot engine and ignited. The fire was not fed by jet fuel.|$|E
25|$|Reductions {{employing}} {{an excess}} of alkali metals in ammonia or amines are extremely rapid and should be quenched <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> so of reaction timeâ€”longer reaction times promote side reactions. When lithium or sodium in ammonia is used, the persistence of a deep blue color in the solution (due to solvated electrons) {{is a sign that}} the reaction is complete. Reductions employing alkali metal arene radical anion complexes similarly require a large excess of the reducing agent, very low temperatures and short reaction times. Reductive desulfonylations and reductive eliminations employing alkali or alkaline earth metals in ammonia present a high fire hazard and should be conducted in a properly functioning chemical fume hood away from flammable solvents. Ammonia is a corrosive gas with a pungent odor. Alkali metals react violently with water or even moist air to generate hydrogen, which can then be ignited by the heat of the reaction.|$|E
60|$|The ex-steward agreed, and <b>after</b> {{standing}} <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two {{in silence}} made a preliminary motion of withdrawal.|$|R
5000|$|Some other {{techniques}} were deliberately put in by exchange staff, {{the most popular}} being {{the use of an}} unused number. When the number was dialed the [...] "number unobtainable" [...] tone would be returned, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> two it would clear and give STD access.Other techniques were used but the technicians involved always had to be wary of the Post Office Special Investigation Branch.|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>an</b> {{exciting}} <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two Sadie {{forced the}} horses {{to pass the}} fluttering paper, and then pulled them up.|$|R
2500|$|In {{one of the}} {{artificial}} streams flowing through the Englischer Garten, there is a standing wave produced by the water pumping mechanism. Surfers line up along the bank taking turns entering the water with their boards. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> so, successful surfers will voluntarily drop out returning {{to the end of}} the line allowing the next person in line an opportunity. The signage states that surfing should only be done by expert or skilled surfers. A short video of the swimming and surfing can be found [...]|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> more of {{hesitation}} Mr. Vanstone {{opened the}} letter.|$|E
60|$|They listened, but all was silent. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> so they {{resumed their}} occupations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall we {{fill the}} main-topsail, sir?" [...] demanded Mr. Leach, <b>after</b> waiting <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two in {{deference}} to his commander's feelings; [...] "or shall we hook on the yard-tackles, and stow the launch?" ...|$|R
60|$|Appearing {{not to get}} it, <b>after</b> waiting <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two to see if {{it would}} come, Mr Toots took a hasty leave, and went below to seek the Captain, whom he found in the shop.|$|R
60|$|Deering {{shouted and}} fixed his glance {{on the slope}} behind the group. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> two <b>or</b> three indistinct objects loomed in the mist.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Tempe {{looked at}} his watch, a little impatiently. Ralph, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, again {{approached}} him.|$|E
6000|$|Lingard's eyes {{followed}} her look, and remained gazing expectantly at the house. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> so he muttered, glancing at her suspiciously-- ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two {{she exclaimed}} [...] "Why, {{here is a}} poem by Charlie Longman! How strange--I never {{suspected}} him of being a poet!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pull {{yourself}} together, Patsey!" [...] Leigh exclaimed. [...] "We {{may have}} their cavalry <b>after</b> us, in <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two. Remember, Jean trusts you {{to carry out}} his instructions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'An't it?' {{returned}} Pancks. <b>After</b> smoking for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> so, more drily than comported {{with his}} recent oiling, he added: 'Because {{you see these}} people don't understand the subject.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Maggie, on {{her side}} as well, waited as if to bring it out with effect; but she <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> either renounced <b>or</b> {{encountered}} an obstacle. [...] "I'm afraid I'm not sure." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, I heard {{footsteps}} coming along the road. My heart gave one great leap in me. I {{thought it was}} Nugent.|$|E
60|$|He calmly went on {{with his}} task, and sitting down she took out a silver cigarette-case. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two {{she looked up at}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our club cigars are dear and good, but {{the best}} is nothing like this," [...] Gerald {{declared}} <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two. [...] "Where did they come from?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sophy, {{with a great}} effort, {{controlled}} herself, and sat very quiet. The colour {{had faded}} from her cheeks now, and the marks of care seemed to come back again very plain and deep; then, <b>after</b> waiting <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, until she felt herself quite quiet, she laid {{one hand on the}} cheek of her sleeping baby, and looked up appealingly into Dr. Ashleigh's face.|$|R
60|$|For some {{minutes the}} wild {{laughter}} rang through the house. Hesba had at once taken {{the girl in}} her arms, and seated her in the chair again, and <b>after</b> trying for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two vainly to soothe her, turned to Hiram.|$|R
6000|$|<b>After</b> rowing for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two {{they stopped}} and again listened. [...] "There it is again," [...] Godfrey said; [...] "right ahead. Paddle gently, Luka; we sha'n't see the shore {{until we are}} on it, and we must not risk running head on to a rock." [...] Presently {{something}} dark appeared {{just in front of}} the canoe.|$|R
60|$|I {{gazed at}} them long and earnestly. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two of thought, I made {{out the last}} two words. The {{inscription}} must surely be Something-or-other Athletic Club.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Carter <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, [...] "we mustn't sag at the knees, I suppose. I'm {{glad to know}} definitely. We must do what we can." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two Paul {{went down}} {{and stood in the}} door of the glass office. The old clerk in the smoking-cap looked down over the rim of his spectacles.|$|E
50|$|Agents {{classified}} as nonpersistent lose effectiveness <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> hours or even {{only a few}} seconds. Purely gaseous agents such as chlorine are nonpersistent, as are highly volatile agents such as sarin. Tactically, nonpersistent agents are very useful against targets {{that are to be}} taken over and controlled very quickly.|$|R
6000|$|Amid this stately {{and busy}} scene Wayland halted his horse, and looked upon the lady, {{as if waiting}} her {{commands}} what was next to be done, since they had safely reached the place of destination. As she remained silent, Wayland, <b>after</b> waiting <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, ventured to ask her, in direct terms, what were her next commands. She raised {{her hand to her}} forehead, as if in the act of collecting her thoughts and resolution, while she answered him in a low and suppressed voice, like the murmurs of one who speaks in a dream--"Commands? I may indeed claim right to command, but who is there will obey me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was looking}} about for {{some way of}} escape, and {{wondering}} whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, <b>after</b> watching it <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, she made {{it out to be}} a grin, and she said to herself 'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, {{when nothing}} was heard but {{the rattle of}} water upon the glass, there was a {{perceptible}} slackening of the sound, and then the atmosphere became lighter.|$|E
6000|$|... "There go the others!" [...] Percy exclaimed <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, {{as three}} columns of smoke arose {{simultaneously}} {{from the other}} junks, and the sailors were seen dropping into their boats alongside.|$|E
6000|$|His voice died wistfully, and his glance, {{sweeping}} her face, {{rested on}} her hands, which held and twisted Greta's letter. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two of silence he boomed out again with sudden energy: ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{blood had}} {{rushed into the}} girl's face as she saw the ring. Then she turned very pale. [...] "Sir Archibald Forbes," [...] she said in <b>a</b> low tone, <b>after</b> walking for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two in silence, [...] "I feel disgraced in your eyes. How forward and unmaidenly must you have thought me thus to take {{advantage}} of a vow made from the impulse of sudden gratitude." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{recovered}} in a moment, and seizing a billiard cue brought the thick end down on Festing's head. Festing swayed, half-dazed, but grasped the cue, and they struggled for its possession, until it broke in the middle, and Wilkinson flung his {{end in the}} other's face. <b>After</b> this, for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, the fight was close and confused, and both {{made the most of}} any advantage that offered.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very little,' Ned replied, <b>after</b> {{sitting for}} <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two--trying {{to recall the}} past. 'I {{remember}} {{there was a great}} talk about it. She died a week or two after Miss Hawtrey was born. I remember there was a shock, or a loss, or something of that sort, but I do not remember more than that. Oh, yes, I do; I remember there was another baby, and that somehow she and her nurse were drowned.' ...|$|R
