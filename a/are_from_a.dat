5|$|He also {{experienced}} stomach disease, having a low production of gastric acids. This was worsened by harsh military conditions, including long periods with little food. The first {{references to the}} disease {{that would lead to}} his death, a case of edema, <b>are</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> year before, in a letter directed to Álvarez Thomas. He declared having problems in the chest, a lung, and his right leg. A later letter to Sarratea confirmed his situation, and specified that it started on 23 April 1819. The gravity of his condition led the doctor Francisco de Paula Rivero to diagnose an advanced dropsy. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires, where he died. He was embalmed by Joseph Redhead and Juan Sullivan. Sullivan performed the autopsy; it revealed high levels of fluid in multiple edemas and a tumor in the right epigastrium. The liver and spleen had grown beyond normal levels, there were hamartomas in the kidneys, and problems with the lungs and heart.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath {{attributed}} {{the invention of}} the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb {{the invention of the}} whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour <b>are</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E

5|$|The first {{forms of}} art {{recognised}} on the Altiplano are petrographs and petroglyphs in various locations on the Altiplano, mainly {{at the rock}} shelters of the Bogotá savanna.
