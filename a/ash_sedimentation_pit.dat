Based on the Selective Catalystic Reduction (SCR) DeNOx {{project for}} 2 × 330 MW-unit in a coal power plant, the gas flow field in SCR {{system has been}} {{optimized}} by numerical simulation. The optimized simulation results were compared with the physical model experiment, and the fly <b>ash</b> <b>sedimentation</b> in the duct was also investigated. Correlation analysis of the results shows that, the flow field predicted by numerical simulation matches very well with that of physical model experiment. Numerical simulation can not only predict but also improve the flow field in SCR system. The combination of simulation and physical model experiment provides a reliable basis for flow field optimization design in SCR system...|$|R

40|$|Volcanic ash is a {{significant}} hazard for areas close to volcanoes and for aviation. Gravitational instabilities forming {{at the bottom of}} spreading volcanic clouds have been observed in many explosive eruptions. Here we present the first quantitative description of the dynamics of such instabilities, and correlate this with the characteristics of the fall deposit from observations of the 4 May 2010 Eyjafjallajökull (Iceland) eruption. Gravitational instabilities initially took the form of downward-propagating fingers that formed continuously {{at the base of the}} cloud, and appeared to be advected passively at the crosswind speed. Measurements of finger propagation are consistent with initial conditions inferred from previous studies of ash cloud dynamics. Dedicated laboratory analogue experiments confirmed that finger downward propagation significantly exceeded the settling speed of individual particles, demonstrating that gravitational instabilities provide a possible mechanism for enhanced <b>sedimentation</b> of fine <b>ash.</b> Our observations challenge the view that aggregation is the primary explanation of proximal fine <b>ash</b> <b>sedimentation,</b> and give direct support for the role of gravitational instabilities in providing regions of high particle concentration that can promote aggregation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRepeated {{ash fall}} events have {{occurred}} during the 1999 -ongoing eruption of Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador, notably during the late 1999 and August 2001 eruptive phases. While the eruptive styles were similar, these two phases had different impacts on nearby rural and urban Andean populations: ash falls in late 1999 had limited effects on human health and farming, whereas the 2001 phase resulted in medical problems, death of animals in livestock, and damages to houses and crops. Here we investigate {{the origin of this}} difference by estimating the size of the August 2001 event (VEI, magnitude, intensity), and by comparing monitoring information of the 1999 and 2001 phases (duration, explosion rate, column height, SO 2 output rate). The results show that both phases ranked at VEI 3, although the longer 1999 phase was likely larger than the 2001 phase. Mass magnitude (M) and intensity (I) indexes calculated for the 2001 phase reach M ≈ 2. 7 and I ≈ 6. 5 when based on ash fall layer data, but increase to M ≈ 3. 2 and I ≈ 7. 0 when ballistic products are included. We investigated the influence of rain fall and wind flow regimes on <b>ash</b> dispersion, <b>sedimentation</b> and remobilization. The analysis indicates that the harmful effect of the 2001 phase resulted from unfavorable conditions that combined volcanological and seasonal origins, including: a) a low elevation of the ash plume above rural regions owed to a usually bent-over column, b) <b>ash</b> <b>sedimentation</b> in a narrow area west of the volcano under sub-steady wind directions, c) anticipated ash settling by frequent rain flushing of low intensity, and d) formation of a wet cohesive ash coating on buildings and harvests. Conversely, the stronger 1999 phase injected a large amount of ash at higher elevation in the dry season; the ash was widely disseminated across the whole Ecuadorian territory and beyond, and was frequently removed by rain and winds. In summary, our study illustrates the influences of eruption size and weather conditions on the impact of volcanic activity in a tropical setting and puts emphasis on the necessity to merge volcanological and meteorological monitoring duties for hazard assessment and alert level definition, in order to mitigate the effect of ash falls in the Andes and elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} using three impaired waters - secondary treated municipal wastewater, passively treated abandoned mine drainage (AMD), and effluent from <b>ash</b> <b>sedimentation</b> ponds at power plants - for use as makeup water in recirculating cooling water systems at thermoelectric power plants. The evaluation included assessment of water availability based on proximity and relevant regulations as well as feasibility of managing cooling water quality with traditional chemical management schemes. Options for chemical treatment to prevent corrosion, scaling, and biofouling were identified through review of current practices, and were tested at bench and pilot-scale. Secondary treated wastewater is the most widely available impaired water that {{can serve as a}} reliable source of cooling water makeup. There are no federal regulations specifically related to impaired water reuse but a number of states have introduced regulations with primary focus on water aerosol 'drift' emitted from cooling towers, which has the potential to contain elevated concentrations of chemicals and microorganisms and may pose health risk to the public. It was determined that corrosion, scaling, and biofouling can be controlled adequately in cooling systems using secondary treated municipal wastewater at 4 - 6 cycles of concentration. The high concentration of dissolved solids in treated AMD rendered difficulties in scaling inhibition and requires more comprehensive pretreatment and scaling controls. Addition of appropriate chemicals can adequately control corrosion, scaling and biological growth in ash transport water, which typically has the best water quality among the three waters evaluated in this study. The high TDS in the blowdown from pilot-scale testing units with both passively treated mine drainage and secondary treated municipal wastewater and the high sulfate concentration in the mine drainage blowdown water were identified as the main challenges for blowdown disposal. Membrane treatment (nanofiltration or reverse osmosis) can be employed to reduce TDS and sulfate concentrations to acceptable levels for reuse of the blowdown in the cooling systems as makeup water...|$|R

40|$|Lake Chapala, located 120 km {{northeast}} of Colima Volcano, {{lies at the}} north and {{northeast of}} the Citala rift in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. It belongs to the watershed of the Lerma River, which originates from the Mexico City area, 450 km to the east. Sediment cores, 0. 5 - 2 m long, were collected from the lake. Magnetic susceptibility of the lake sediments generally ranges from 400 to 800 x 10 (- 9) m(3) kg(- 1); but in some layers it exceeds 1000 or 1500 x 10 (- 9) m(3) kg(- 1). The magnetic susceptibility vertical profiles display a thin peak (2 - 5 cm) or a double peak with magnetic susceptibility > 2000 x 10 (- 9) m(3) kg(- 1). Scanning electron microscope analysis shows that the main mineral responsible for the magnetic susceptibility is titano-magnetite, which is relatively abundant in the magnetic layers. In most of the cores, the layer with magnetic susceptibility > 2000 x 10 (- 9) m(3) kg(- 1) is coarser grained than the directly under and overlying sediments, which are composed of fine silt. But not all coarser levels are magnetic nor are all magnetic levels bound to coarser layers. The high titano-magnetic concentration probably originates from volcanic <b>ash</b> falls. <b>Sedimentation</b> rates, evaluated for several sites {{by means of the}} Pb- 210 and Cs- 137 methods, allow a date approximation (between 1535 and 1670) for the strong magnetic layer deposition. Since important eruptions of Colima Volcano, with ash fall, were reported from 1576 to 1623, the main peak of magnetic susceptibility in the sediment profiles is assumed to be related to these events. The main magnetic layer extends to greater depth in the profiles of {{the eastern part of the}} lake plain than at the west. It can, therefore, be suggested that a relative subsidence occurs in the eastern part of the lake; the axis of the eastern plain overlaps the area displaying the maximum subsidence rate and seems therefore to correspond to the prolongation of Citala rift...|$|R
40|$|The {{eruption}} column height estimation is {{an essential}} parameter to evaluate the total mass eruption rate, the gas and aerosol plume dispersal and retrievals. The column height may be estimated using different systems (e. g. satellite, aircraft and ground observations) which may present marked differences. In this work we use the calibrated images collected by the video-surveillance system of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Osservatorio Etneo, from the visible camera located in Catania, 27 km from the vent. The analysis is carried out on twenty lava fountains from the New South East Crater during the recent Etna explosive activity. Firstly, we calibrated the camera to estimate its intrinsic parameters and the full camera model. Furthermore, we selected the images which recorded the maximum phase of the eruptive activity. Hence, we applied an appropriate correction {{to take into account}} the wind effect. The column height was also evaluated using SEVIRI and MODIS satellite images collected at the same time of the video camera measurements. The satellite column height retrievals is realized by comparing the 11 m brightness temperature of the most opaque plume pixels with the atmospheric temperature profile measured at Trapani WMO Meteo station (the nearest WMO station to the Etnean area). The comparison between satellite and ground data show a good agreement and the column altitudes ranges between 7. 5 and 9 km (upper limit of the camera system). For nine events we evaluated also the thickness of the volcanic plumes in the umbrella region (near the vent) which ranges between 2 and 3 km. The proposed approach help to quantitatively evaluate the column height that may be used by volcanic <b>ash</b> dispersal and <b>sedimentation</b> models for improving forecasts and reducing risks to aviation during volcanic crisis...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is {{producing}} the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) of filler, cement and fly <b>ash</b> using X-ray <b>sedimentation</b> technique. The Micromeritics SediGraph III Plus (5125) applies the sedimentation theory to determine the particle size and directly measures the particle mass through X-ray absorption. Particle size is measured in equivalent spherical diameter, the diameter of a sphere of the same material with the same falling rate. By using Stokes law to calculate the particle falling rate, the SediGraph is able to determine {{the size of the}} particle that has fallen beyond a specific analysis point of the analysis cell. Concrete performance can be optimized through concrete Micro-proportioning by adjusting the grading of fines to control the matrix rheology. The Specific Surface Area (SSA) is however a better parameter in describing the fineness and is easier to apply in practice. The SSA can be calculated from the size distribution. An accurate analysis of particles with particle size below 5 µm is therefore significant as most of the SSA comes from the smallest particles. The SediGraph was used to determine the distribution of Velde Fine filler, Industrisement and Fly Ash (FA) with a particle size range of 1 125 µm. The precision of the SediGraph analysis is mainly dependent on how well dispersed the particles are in the liquid. Studies of suitable dispersing liquids concluded that the SediSperse A- 12 is the most promising liquid. The liquid density and liquid viscosity are temperature dependent, meaning that the temperature during the analysis must be kept stable for accurate analysis. The procedure for determining PSD including sampling, rinsing and agitation seems to be well-developed and provides reproducible results. In addition, the PSD of the same material shows good repeatability. The SSA calculated from the PSD indicates that 90 % of the SSA is concentrated in the particle size below 20 µm, where more than 50 % of the SSA is generated from the particles with particle size below 5 µm...|$|R

As known that coal ash waste is included hazardous and toxic waste, therefore managing it carefully is a necessity. Sediment or heap of coal <b>ash</b> in the <b>sedimentation</b> pond that is flowing with water is called Pond Ash. This study is conducted by utilizing the pond ash as a replacement material in the concrete mix. The effect of the use of pond ash as partial replacement of sand, fine aggregate in the concrete mix, is studied using cylindrical specimen with a diameter of 100 mm and a height of 200 mm. Specimens were made by taking the ratio of the percentage of pond ash of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % of the mixture of concrete with the constant water cement ratio 0. 49 which is {{based on the results of}} normal concrete mix design. The compressive strength test of concrete was conducted at ages 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 90 days. The test results of compressive strength of concrete obtained showed an increase in compressive strength in accordance with the addition of pond ash in the mix. The adding of pond ash in the mix affected the increasing in the compressive strength of concrete, and the optimum strength is obtained in the ratio of 17 % pond ash, which increased to 26. 08 MPa from 25. 05 MPa for concrete with and without pond ash mixes respectively, or increased by 4. 12 %. This increase is not significant and cannot be used as a reference, however, by the results of this study it can be concluded that the pond ash waste can be utilized for the manufacture of concrete as a partial replacement of sand...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a high resolution record of aridity in eastern Australia {{for the past}} 25 000 (ka) calendar (cal) years developed from aeolian dust archives to determine the position and strength of the Australian south east dust transport pathway through this period. Aeolian dust archives were extracted from a lake sediment core collected from the exposed lake bed of Native Companion Lagoon in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Native Companion Lagoon is rain fed and all mineral sedimentation was believed to result from aeolian processes alone. The sediment core was sampled at 5 mm intervals, then dried and ashed. Sixteen AMS radiocarbon dates revealed a sedimentation rate of approximately 1 m 10 ka- 1, resulting in a temporal resolution of circa 50 years. Aeolian <b>sedimentation</b> (<b>ash</b> record) and moisture content showed an inverse relationship, with periods of high aeolian deposition corresponding to low moisture content, and vice versa, {{for the majority of}} the 25 ka record. Phases of increased aeolian sedimentation are considered to represent periods of increased aridity and drought in central and eastern Australia, and disturbance of the local sand dunes which impound Native Companion Lagoon. The highly coherent nature of both the aeolian sedimentation and moisture content records suggests that both proxies are sensitive indicators of climate variability. Key palaeoclimate events shown in the record include the Last Glacial Maximum, Heinrich I, the Antarctic Cold Reversal, an early Holocene climatic optimum and the Neoglacial. Seventy three of the ashed samples underwent ICP-MS geochemical analysis using 44 trace elements. The results of the geochemical analysis were used for two purposes: a) to separate local and continental fractions of the aeolian sedimentation record, and then b) to provenance the far traveled dust content to source areas in eastern and central Australia. This was achieved by developing a model for separating local and continental dust fractions using five trace elements as proxies for continental dust. This five-element average approach is a unique technique for accurately defining the fartraveled component of the dust record. Once determined, the continental component of the aeolian sedimentation record was provenanced to source areas using a ternary mixing model. Fifteen trace elements were selected as suitable for use in the ternary mixing model, which mixed a south east Queensland sediment sample and two potential continental dusts. Variations in dominance of various central and east Australian dust source areas through time revealed significant variability in the position and strength of the south east dust transport corridor. Changes in the dominance of continental source areas were directly related to changes in local palaeoclimatic and environmental conditions in response to large scale global forcings of climate, and in turn changes in regional synoptic scale circulation patterns. Importantly, the Australian landscape is shown to respond quickly to changes in climate. This insight is essential for understanding both past and future impacts of a changing climate on the most arid inhabited continent other than Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The Mio-Pliocene diatomaceous Pisco Formation, Peru, was {{deposited}} under upwelling {{conditions in}} the Pisco Basin, {{one of the many}} forearc basins scattered along the Peruvian coast. This formation is particularly popular among vertebrate palaeontologists due to its fossil content. Indeed, because of the high spatial concentration and continuous temporal distribution of perfectly preserved fossil marine vertebrate specimens, the Pisco Fm. is classified as a Konservat-Lagerstätte; this term identifies a place or a quarry characterised by exceptional preservation of fossils. Focusing on the sites of Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos, Ica Desert, Peru, this Thesis aims to understand which mechanisms brought to the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte and whether the deposition of diatoms contributed to it in any way. Taking into consideration the geology of the area, three hypotheses on the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte are advanced and investigated in this Thesis: 1) high sedimentation rates: rapid burial is listed in all the paleontology books as the main process that lead to the preservation of fossils. This hypothesis has been already taken into consideration by previous authors as the cause of the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte. In particular, sedimentation rates of diatom frustules were advocated as responsible for the burial of whale carcasses by these authors. In this Thesis also the hypothesis that volcanic <b>ashes</b> could increase <b>sedimentation</b> rates by enhancing primary production is advanced. 2) anoxic/disossic environment: along the modern eastern Pacific continental margin, high amounts of organic matter produced during upwelling lead to a great consumption of oxygen. In the intermediate waters dissolved oxygen is < 1 ml/L. This same condition may have persisted during the deposition of the Pisco Fm., therefore inhibiting the aerobic decomposition of carcasses on the sea floor. 3) Harmful algal blooms (HABs) : HABs are phenomena known to kill large amounts of marine species. Those blooms are related to different planktonic groups and are known to kill marine organisms either by: a) the production of a large amount of toxins; b) the lowering of dissolved O 2 in the water column (anoxia of the water column). To verify the high sedimentation rates hypothesis, a detailed stratigraphic framework of the sites of Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos has been carried out, both by means of diatom biostratigraphy and by means of 39 Ar/ 40 Ar ages. Sedimentation rates have been subsequently calculated and discussed. Moreover, because diatomites are often laminated, a lamina-scale study has been carried out on the sediments underlying fossil whales to unravel the seasonality of diatom species deposition and consequently of the water column. This study also provided additional information on yearly sedimentation rates of the Pisco Fm. During the development of both biostratigraphic and lamina-scale studies, particular attention was paid to the identification of potential HABs. Field observations highlighted that most of the fossils at Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos are wrapped up in carbonatic concretions; analyses revealed that all of them are dolomite nodules. Therefore, a specific investigation on dolomite nodules was undertaken in order to understand whether they {{played a role in the}} formation of the Lagerstätte. Beside the study on the formation of the Lagerstätte, this Thesis aimed to study the role of volcanic ashes deposition on the fertilisation of the ocean surface. Indeed, scientists have recently become aware of the fertilizer role played by volcanic ash: following major volcanic eruptions, airborne volcanic ash may fall onto the ocean surface, where it releases nutrients (NH+ 4, NO- 3, NO- 2, PO 3 - 4, Si) and Fe. The Pisco Fm. is characterized by a great number of ash layers, making the Pisco Fm. a natural laboratory to study this phenomenon in the Neogene. This Thesis aimed to contribute to the development of an investigation method relevant to fossil contexts. Therefore, observations were made both on the field and in the laboratories. The importance of volcanic ashes in increasing primary production takes much more relevance in the general context of this Thesis if this capability is interpreted as the role of <b>ashes</b> in increasing <b>sedimentation</b> rates (therefore further favouring rapid burial of carcasses). Results Results obtained by diatom stratigraphy and tephrochronology converged in stating that the sites of Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos are late Miocene in age. Results highlight that sedimentation rates in the Pisco Fm. spanned between 19 cm/ka ± 1 to ca. 33 cm/ka (0. 2 mm/a to 0. 3 mm/a). These sedimentation rates are calculated for compacted sediment and can be transformed into ‘real sedimentation rates’ (sedimentation rates for non compacted sediment) applying a compaction factor equal to 60 %; applying this factor, sedimentation rates equal to 32 cm/ka and 55 cm/ka, respectively, are obtained. Taking into account only the yearly sequence of diatom laminae, sedimentation rates reach a peak of 150 cm/ka (1. 5 mm/a) for compacted sediments, equal to a ‘real’ sedimentation rate of 250 cm/ka (2. 50 mm/a). All the listed sedimentation rates are in line with those calculated for Quaternary sediments in high-productivity basins, confirming that sedimentation rates during the deposition of the Pisco Fm. were high but not exceptional. Investigations conducted on laminae were also used to interpret the seasonal stratification that characterised the water column during the deposition of the Pisco Fm. The sequence of terrigenous lamina – Coscinodiscus ooze – mixed lamina (Chaetoceros RS/Thalassionema plus terrigenous material) has been interpreted as the yearly turnover of diatom species in an upwelling environment. The terrigenous lamina represents the austral summer sediment input. Coscinodiscus oozes are the product of the summer flourishing of this genus at the thermo/nutricline and of its subsequent late summer/early autumn sedimentation (the so-called ‘fall dump’) which follows the breakage of the summer water column stratification. The mixed lamina represents the spring bloom. Many clues suggest that sediments of the Pisco were not completely anoxic: 1) the presence of mollusc; 2) the pervasive bioturbations recognised both in the diatom laminae and at the top of tephra; 3) the coupling of fossil vertebrates with dolomite nodules surrounding the fossils themselves. Indeed, if the sediments of the Pisco had been anoxic, due to the high amounts of organic material (diatom cells) exported to the sea floor, dolomite would have precipitated also far from the vertebrate carcasses. On the contrary, dolomite nodules are always coupled to fossils. This means that only in correspondence of the carcasses, oxygen levels were reduced to a point that lead to sulphate-reduction and methanogenesis with consequent precipitation of dolomite. Dolomite nodules have had a pivotal role in preserving the marine vertebrates in the fossils record: rapid dolomitisation prevented the skeletons from being disarticulated and protected bones from chemical and mechanical erosive agents. Therefore fast dolomitisation processes played a pivotal role in the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte. However, although not exceptional, also high sedimentation rates favoured the complete burial of carcasses under the sea bottom surface, where sulphate reduction, methanogenesis and, consequently complete dolomitisation, were favoured. Sediment porosity, may have favoured rapid burial and dolomitisation of carcasses as well. Indeed, sediment structures underlying some carcasses suggest that carcasses ‘sank’ into the sediment as they arrived at the sea bottom. Finally, I cannot exclude that the high concentration of carcasses in the Pisco Fm. is due to high density of the marine mammal populations in the Pisco Basin during the late Miocene; to answer this question a dedicated study with a more biological approach should be developed. For what the HABs hypothesis is concerned, no evidence harmful diatoms has been found during the development of this Thesis; similarly, the study concerning the enhancing of primary production due to volcanic ashes needs to be further developed and no conclusions can be drawn on at the moment for this hypothesis. As a final statement, I can affirm that the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte was caused by the concurrence of many diverse ecological factors; however, the geochemical conditions of the sea bottom and high sedimentation rates were certainly two of the most important ones. Dolomite nodules frequently cemented siliciclastic sediments, not only diatomaceous ones, confirming that sedimentation of diatom frustules to the sea floor is to be considered just one of the many factors concurring in the formation of the Pisco Lagersätte, not its principal cause. Obiettivi La Formazione diatomica Mio-Pliocenica di Pisco, in Perù, si è depositata nel bacino del Pisco, uno dei tanti bacini forearc che caratterizzano la costa peruviana, in condizioni di upwelling. Questa formazione è particolarmente popolare tra i paleontologi dei vertebrati grazie al suo contenuto in fossili. Infatti, a causa dell’elevata concentrazione spaziale di esemplari fossili perfettamente conservati e del loro record temporale continuo, la Pisco Fm. è classificata come un Konservat-Lagerstätte; questo termine identifica un luogo o una formazione caratterizzati da un’eccezionale conservazione dei fossili. Ponendo il fuoco sui siti di Cerro Colorado e Cerro Los Quesos (deserto di Ica, Perù), questa Tesi si propone di capire quali meccanismi hanno portato alla formazione del Pisco Lagerstätte e se la deposizione delle diatomee ne abbia in qualche modo favorito la formazione.
