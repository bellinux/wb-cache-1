5|$|Archaea {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from bacteria and eukaryotes, {{with up to}} 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of {{the remainder of the}} unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in methanogenesis. The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related function—such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> synthetases.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E

5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
25|$|By mutating <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> synthetases, chemists have {{expanded}} the genetic codes of various organisms to include lab-synthesized amino acids {{with all kinds}} of useful properties: photoreactive, metal-chelating, xenon-chelating, crosslinking, spin-resonant, fluorescent, biotinylated, and redox-active amino acids. Another use is introducing amino acids bearing reactive functional groups for chemically modifying the target protein.|$|E
25|$|An <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> {{synthetase}} (aaRS) is {{an enzyme}} that attaches the appropriate amino acid onto its tRNA.

500|$|The {{process of}} synthesizing a protein from an mRNA {{template}} {{is known as}} translation. The mRNA is loaded onto the ribosome and is read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon to its base pairing anticodon located on a transfer RNA molecule, which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes. The enzyme <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> synthetase [...] "charges" [...] the tRNA molecules with the correct amino acids. The growing polypeptide is often termed the nascent chain. Proteins are always biosynthesized from N-terminus to C-terminus.|$|E
500|$|Some of the enzymes {{showing the}} highest {{specificity}} and accuracy {{are involved in}} the copying and expression of the genome. Some of these enzymes have [...] "proof-reading" [...] mechanisms. Here, an enzyme such as DNA polymerase catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step. This two-step process results in average error rates of less than 1 error in 100 million reactions in high-fidelity mammalian polymerases. Similar proofreading mechanisms are also found in RNA polymerase, <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> synthetases and ribosomes.|$|E
500|$|The chief {{characteristic}} of proteins that also allows their diverse {{set of functions}} is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly. The region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule {{is known as the}} binding site and is often a depression or [...] "pocket" [...] on the molecular surface. This binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein, which defines the binding site pocket, and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids' side chains. Protein binding can be extraordinarily tight and specific; for example, the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human angiogenin with a sub-femtomolar dissociation constant (<10−15 M) but does not bind at all to its amphibian homolog onconase (>1 M). Extremely minor chemical changes such as the addition of a single methyl group to a binding partner can sometimes suffice to nearly eliminate binding; for example, the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNA</b> synthetase specific to the amino acid valine discriminates against the very similar side chain of the amino acid isoleucine.|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of misreading by streptomycin in vitro, previously {{observed with}} synthetic messengers, is now demonstrated with natural (endogenous or viral) messenger {{by the use}} of extracts of temperature sensitive mutants lacking Glu [...] tRNA or Val [...] tRNA synthetase.

With ribosomes initiating in the presence of streptomycin stimulation is also observed but it is restricted, just like phenotypic suppression in cells, to very low streptomycin concentrattions which evidently allow some ribosomes to initiate and later encounter them in the course of chain elongation. The stimulation is accompanied by an increase {{in the size of the}} products; hence, it is evidently due to substitution of an incorrect <b>aminoacyl</b> [...] <b>tRNA</b> for a missing one.

The misacylated product is shown here to be hydrolyzed by highly purified phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase from E. coli, with release of isoleucine and active tRNAPhe. Thus, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase possesses a previously unrecognized activity, which deacylates a mistakenly acylated tRNAPhe; the enzyme is inactive toward correctly matched <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNAs.</b> Such a mechanism could serve to verify aminoacyl-tRNAs, deacylating those that are misacylated. Thus, a common generalization needs to be modified: an amino acid is not necessarily committed to a given (incorrect) anticodon when it is incorporated into aminoacyl-tRNA. It may be possible to correct it thereafter...|$|R

40|$|The {{elongation}} {{phase of}} protein synthesis is promoted by two G proteins, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), which delivers <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>tRNAs</b> to the ribosome, and elongation factor G (EF-G), which catalyzes translocation.

However, its significance is uncertain because the affinity of EF-G'GDP for the ribosome is much lower than that of the ternary complex it resembles and because EF-Tu'GDP, the form of EF-Tu that has low ribosome affinity, has a conformation radically different from that of EF-Tu'GTP or EF-Tu in the ternary complex. The smallangle X-ray scattering study described here was undertaken to ascertain if the form of EF-G that has high ribosome affinity, EF-G'GTP, the structure of which is unknown, could be a mimic of EF-Tu'GDP. The data show that nucleotide-free EF-G, EF-G'GDP, EF-G'GTP, and EF-G'GMPPCP cannot be distinguished by solution scattering and that it is likely they all resemble crystalline EF-G'GDP.

The MS analysis suggested that all eEF 1 A molecules are modified by this glutaminylation and that this posttranslational modification occurs at all stages of yeast growth. The mutational studies revealed that this glutaminylation is not essential for the normal functions of eEF 1 A in S. cerevisiae. However, eEF 1 A glutaminylation slightly reduced growth under antibiotic-induced translational stress conditions. Moreover, we identified the same posttranslational modification in eEF 1 A from Schizosaccharomyces pombe but not in various other eukaryotic organisms tested despite strict conservation of the Glu 45 residue among these organisms.

Although {{our understanding of}} what constitutes the correct or cognate aa-tRNA:mRNA interaction is well defined, a functional distinction between near-cognate or single mismatched, and unpaired or non-cognate interactions is lacking. Methodology/ Principal Findings. Misreading of several synonymous codon substitutions at the catalytic site of firefly luciferase was assayed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of the results {{in the context of}} current kinetic and biophysical models of aatRNA selection suggests that the defining feature of near-cognate aa-tRNAs is their potential to form mini-helical structures with A-site codons, enabling stimulation of GTPase activity of eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1 A (eEF 1 A). Paromomycin specifically stimulated misreading of near-cognate but not of non-cognate aa-tRNAs, providing a functional probe to distinguish between these two classes. Deletion of the accessory elongation factor eEF 1 Bc promoted increased misreading of near-cognate, but hyperaccurate reading of non-cognate codons, suggesting that this factor also has a role in tRNA discrimination. A mutant of eEF 1 Ba, the nucleotide exchange factor for eEF 1 A, promoted a general increase in fidelity, suggesting that the decreased rates of elongation may provide more time for discrimination between aa-tRNAs.
