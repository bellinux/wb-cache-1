50|$|Corymbia calophylla, {{also known}} as Eucalyptus calophylla, is a bloodwood native to Western Australia. Common names include marri and Port Gregory gum, and a long-standing usage has been <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> due to the <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> effusions often found on trunks.|$|R
50|$|Infrequent {{flooding}} due {{to water}} regulation provides inadequate water to recharge the floodplain subsoils that river <b>red</b> <b>gums</b> depend on. This {{will result in}} stunted tree growth, death of existing trees, and poor conditions for seed germination. Lack of flooding in floodplain areas will change the suitability of river <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> habitat as a breeding ground and food source for other species. Indeed, extinctions of some species have already occurred in river <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> habitats in the Murray-Darling catchment.|$|R
50|$|Eucalyptus robusta often hybridises with forest <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> (E. tereticornis), the {{resulting}} plants having {{been given the}} name E. patentinervis.

50|$|River <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> seeds {{germinate}} readily after {{floods and}} require regular spring floods throughout their life to survive. In the Murray-Darling Basin, such floods are now rare due to river regulation for irrigation, {{and as a}} result, 75% of River <b>red</b> <b>gums</b> in the lower Murray are stressed, dead or dying.|$|R

50|$|The {{species can}} be found {{along the banks of}} watercourses, as well as the {{floodplains}} of those watercourses. Due to the proximity to these watercourses, river <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> is subject to regular flooding in its natural habitat. River <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> prefers soils with clay content. The trees not only rely on rainfall but also on regular flooding, since flooding recharges the sub-soil with water.|$|R

5000|$|The {{association}} of the river <b>red</b> <b>gum</b> with water makes the tree a natural habitat choice, indeed sometimes the only choice in drier areas, for other species. The trees provide a breeding habitat for fish during the flooding season, which also benefits aquatic bird life that depend on fish as a food source during their own breeding season. Wilson, who examined the management of river <b>red</b> <b>gums</b> in NSW, suggests shelter is provided for fish in rivers and streams by fallen branches from the river <b>red</b> <b>gum.</b> The [...] "snags" [...] formed when river <b>red</b> <b>gums</b> fall into rivers such as the Glenelg, {{are an important part}} of river ecosystems, and vital habitat and breeding sites for native fish like river blackfish. Unfortunately most snags have been removed from these rivers, beginning in the 1850s, due to river-improvement strategies designed to prevent hazards to navigation, reduce damage to in-stream structures, rejuvenate or scour channels, and increase hydraulic capacity to reduce flooding. However, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission has recognised the importance of snags as aquatic habitat, and a moratorium on their removal from the Murray River has been recommended.|$|R
