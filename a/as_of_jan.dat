2500|$|Flumazenil is {{the only}} GABAA {{receptor}} antagonist on the market <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jan</b> 2013, and it is currently manufactured only as an intravenous formulation. Given its pharmacology, researchers consider {{it to be a}} promising medication in the treatment of primary hypersomnias. [...] Results of a small, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial were published in November 2012. [...] This research showed that flumazenil provides relief for most patients whose CSF contains the unknown [...] "somnogen" [...] that enhances the function of GABAA receptors, making them more susceptible to the sleep-inducing effect of GABA. For one patient, daily administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has proven effective for several years. A 2014 case report also showed improvement in primary hypersomnia symptoms after treatment with a continuous subcutaneous flumazenil infusion. The supply of generic flumazenil was initially thought to be too low to meet the potential demand for treatment of primary hypersomnias. However, this scarcity has eased, and dozens of patients are now being treated with flumazenil off-label.|$|E

2500|$|For the stadium's $321 million {{renovation}} {{and a new}} $153 million Student-Athlete High Performance Center, {{the university}} incurred a controversial $445 million of debt which it planned to finance with the sale of special stadium seats in the Endowment Seating Program. [...] Before {{the start of the}} stadium reconstruction, Professor Brian Barsky showed that the financial plan was unrealistic and calculated that although $215 million had been claimed to have been raised <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jan.</b> 15, 2010, the true figure was closer to only about $20 million as of Dec. 2010, and that the total financial obligation including interest would exceed a billion dollars. [...] His calculations were subsequently corroborated by the Wall Street Journal [...] which reported in April 2012 that only $31 million had been received as of the end of Dec. 2011; this was followed by further reporting of poor seat sales in the Endowment Seating Program. [...] As of June 30, 2016, the fund balance was $60.98 million, far short of the $215 million that had been claimed five years earlier. [...] The roughly $18 million interest-only annual payments on the debt consumes 20% of Cal's athletics' budget and 15% of the campus structural deficit; principal repayment begins in 2032 when the annual debt payment will rise to about $26 million per year, about $28 million in 2033, about $30 million per year for 2034-2038, and about $37 million per year for 2039-2044. [...] The debt payments are scheduled to continue for one hundred years from its 2013 inception, concluding in 2113. On November 3 2017, Chancellor Carol Christ announced that the university would overtake the earthquake retrofitting expenses part of the renovation. This amount is estimated to be approximately 60 percent of the total expenses or $200 million with the remaining expenses still being retained by the athletic department. Exactly where in the budget the funds would be taken was not announced, although the chancellor did state {{that they would not be}} taken out of student tuition or tax-payer funds for the university. It was not ruled out that the money could be taken out of funds for academic departments.|$|E
