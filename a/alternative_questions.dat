5000|$|The {{second part}} of the {{assessment}} consists of the actual scale. It consists of twenty questions regarding the short story - fifteen questions being suggestive and five being neutral. The fifteen suggestive questions can be separated into three types of suggestibility: leading questions, affirmative questions, and false <b>alternative</b> <b>questions.</b> Their purpose is to measure how much a participant [...] "yields" [...] to suggestive questions. Leading questions contained some [...] "salient precedence" [...] and are worded {{in such a way that}} they seem plausible and lend themselves to an affirmative answer. A leading question on the GSS would ask, [...] "Did the woman's glasses break in the struggle?" [...] Affirmative questions were those that presented facts not present in the story, but that contain an affirmative response bias. An example of an affirmative question would be [...] ""Were the assailants convicted six weeks after their arrest?" [...] Like the affirmative questions, false <b>alternative</b> <b>questions</b> contain information not present in the story; however, these questions focus specifically on objects, people, and events not found in the story. One of these questions would be [...] "Did the woman hit one of the assailants with her fist or handbag?" [...] The five neutral questions contain a correct answer that is affirmative-the correct answer is yes. After 1987, the GSS was altered so that these five questions were included in the shift score as well. This version is referred to as the Gudjonsson suggestibility scale 2, or GSS2. The twenty questions are dispersed among the assessment to conceal its aim. The person under interrogation is told in a [...] "forceful manner" [...] that there are errors in their story and must answer the questions a second time. After the initial questionnaire, the subjects are told that they made a certain number of errors and are instructed to go over the assessment again and correct any errors they detect. Any changes made in the suggestive questions are recorded.|$|E

Likewise, there are a few questions considered so important that a low score on them yields a penalty on the total score sum for their respective categories, namely: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} {{of fear of}} crime is acknowledged as a hot methodological issue. Many {{studies have focused on}} the cognitive and behavioural components of fear. The emotional affective component of fear of crime has been studied rather less, however. Traditional measures of fear of crime fail to address the complexity of this concept. Knowledge of prevalence, frequency and intensity of fear are largely absent in a quantitative design. Following an <b>alternative</b> <b>question</b> structure, previous research has shown that ‘old’-style questions overestimate the everyday experience of fear (see Farrall, 2004; Farrall and Gadd, 2004; Gray, Jackson and Farrall, 2008). Furthermore, gender differences in fear of crime seem to be influenced by socially desirable answers by men (Sutton and Farrall, 2005). In this paper, we study differences in outcomes when measuring fear of crime using ‘old’-style questions (’avoidance behaviour’) and an <b>alternative</b> <b>question</b> structure introduced by Stephen Farrall (three-part questions treating prevalence, frequency and intensity of fear). We conducted a survey (2008) in eighteen postal code areas and interviewed 750 key informants. Descriptive analyses by gender were conducted for both the traditional avoidance behaviour scale and the <b>alternative</b> <b>question</b> structure that measures the emotional affective component of fear of crime. Subsequently some correlational analyses were conducted to examine how different these fear of crime measures are from supposed covariates such as perceived sense of community, perceived disorder and previous victimisation. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of social desirability on measures of fear of crime components and on the gender-fear relationship in particular. In short, measuring the emotional affective component of fear with an <b>alternative</b> <b>question</b> structure presents a totally different picture than can be found by measuring the behavioural component of fear of crime with a traditional scale such as avoidance behaviour. Second, different measures of fear of crime are especially differentially related to previous victimisation. Third, we found rather surprising effects of social desirability on gender differences in fear of crime...|$|R

40|$|Depending on {{the logical}} structure, {{two types of}} <b>alternative</b> <b>questions</b> are usually described: (i) A-or-B and (ii) A-or-not-A. Remarkably, in Tungusic {{languages}} Udihe [1] and Oroqen [2], there is one more, typologically rare, type (iii) A-or-DO-WHAT?, where the second disjunct is expressed by an interrogative pro-verb. We will call them open <b>alternative</b> <b>questions.</b> The pro-verb copies the inflectional markers of the finite predicate, used as the first disjunct, like in (1), both verbs are in focused (stressed) position, and may optionally attach identical word-final clitics-nu [...] . -nu or-(A) s [...] . -(A) s, so the questions of this kind sound like a rhyme. The talk will discuss how this type of <b>alternative</b> <b>questions</b> might have emerged and how it functions.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundA new self-administered {{questionnaire}} as {{an outcome}} measure {{for patients with}} cervical myelopathy was drawn up in Part 1 (Japanese Orthopaedic Association Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire, JOACMEQ). Because a question with regard to driving a car (C- 41) was not suitable for this patient group, the authors composed an <b>alternative</b> <b>question</b> related to neck motion (C- 41 - 2). The purposes {{of the present study}} were to perform a secondary survey on patients with cervical myelopathy and to statistically analyze the responses to validate the JOACMEQ, and also to determine if it was possible to convert item C- 41 to the <b>alternative</b> <b>question.</b> MethodsA member of the Subcommittee on Low Back Pain and Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation from each hospital administered the questionnaire to more than 50 patients with cervical myelopathy in each hospital. The questionnaire consisted of 25 questions, 24 of which were extracted in the primary survey. The authors statistically examined whether it was possible to convert question C- 41 to C- 41 - 2. ResultsThree hundred and sixty-eight patients with cervical myelopathy were enrolled in the present study. No questions elicited no answer or “I am not sure” in more than 5 % of patients except question C- 41. There were no questions that the patients answered with difficulty. There was no tendency that was concentrated on one option as an answer to questions. There was a high correlation between questions C- 41 and C- 41 - 2. Spearman’s correlation coefficient and κ value showed that there was high coincidence between the two questions C- 41 and C- 41 - 2. It is possible to convert the question C- 41 to the <b>alternative</b> <b>question</b> C 41 - 2. ConclusionThe questionnaire has sufficient reliability for clinical use. It is possible that the JOACMEQ will prevail and become a global standard to evaluate outcomes in patients with cervical myelopathy...|$|R

40|$|We {{observe that}} {{intervention}} effects {{as they have}} been observed for wh-constructions also exist in <b>alternative</b> <b>questions.</b> All fundamental characteristics of the effect seem to be parallel, and we propose to apply one and the same analysis to both kinds of intervention effects. To this effect we combine Romero and Han's (2003) analysis of <b>alternative</b> <b>questions</b> with the assumption that a certain kind of variable may not be bound across an intervener. A particular type of data considered by Romero and Han now also falls out as an intervention effect. Wh-intervention effects are illustrated by the data in (1) -(3) (see e. g. Beck (1996), Pesetsky (2000)). Kim (2002) offers the generalization that a quantificational or focusing element may not intervene between a wh-phrase and its licensing complementizer. The effect exists in many languages, including English, German and Korean. Example (4) has an interpretation as an alternative question (in addition to one as a Yes/No-question). On this reading, there is a focus on both disjuncts. Appopriate answers are that Sally taught Semantics I and that Sally taught Syntax I. In (5) -(7), we construct <b>alternative</b> <b>questions</b> that are analogous to the wh-questions in (1) -(3). Observe that an intervention effect arises that is parallel in all respects: The harmful intervener may not occur between the disjunction and the interrogative complementizer. The same questions without the intervener are fine. And once th...|$|E

40|$|We {{know more}} about the meaning of intonational melodies than is {{sometimes}} realized. Why do yes/no-questions across languages often show a final rise (Is it raining? [/]) and wh-questions less so (who has arrived? [/] or [) while <b>alternative</b> <b>questions</b> show an obligatory final fall (Is it raining [/] or snowing [) ? Clearly it is not the speech-act of a question that is indicated by rising intonation (it is the same in all these cases). An idea that has been proposed for German is that the final rise only codes continuation, and that yes/no-questions are clipped <b>alternative</b> <b>questions</b> (Is it raining [/] or isn't it raining [). This cannot be upheld since many languages differentiate between yes/no-questions and continuation in the intonation. (English is in fact such a language, a property not visible in the simplified illustrations of this abstract.)

The important core is reviewed and put on a more principled footing {{in the first part of}} this talk. A central element of the account is a separation of intonational meanings and sentence grammar: intonational meanings operate on salient propositions, not on the output of compositional semantics, i. e. not on literal sentence meanings...|$|E
