5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while <b>alligators</b> <b>and</b> <b>caimans</b> have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws {{are much more}} massive and powerful than the ones that open them, and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws are extremely difficult to pry open. The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of <b>alligators</b> <b>and</b> <b>caimans</b> when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|Some scutes {{contain a}} single pore {{known as an}} {{integumentary}} sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while <b>alligators</b> <b>and</b> <b>caimans</b> only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, {{but it has been}} suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs. Another possibility is that they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from adhering to the skin. There are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.|$|E

5|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million {{years ago in the}} Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the <b>alligators</b> <b>and</b> <b>caimans</b> (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E
5|$|Members of this {{superfamily}} first {{arose in}} the late Cretaceous. Leidyosuchus of Alberta is the earliest known genus. Fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout Eurasia as land bridges across both the North Atlantic and the Bering Strait have connected North America to Eurasia during the Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene periods. <b>Alligators</b> <b>and</b> <b>caimans</b> split in North America during the late Cretaceous and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene, before {{the closure of the}} Isthmus of Panama during the Neogene period. The Chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene. The alligator's full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold-blooded vertebrates. However, the full genome, published in 2014, suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds.|$|E
25|$|Post-Caudal: While <b>alligators</b> <b>and</b> <b>caimans</b> have DPRs only {{on their}} jaws, {{crocodiles}} have similar organs {{on almost every}} scale on their bodies. The function of the DPRs on the jaws is clear; to catch prey, {{but it is still}} not clear what the function is of the organs {{on the rest of the}} body. The receptors flatten when exposed to increased osmotic pressure, such as that experienced when swimming in sea water hyperosmotic to the body fluids. When contact between the integument and the surrounding sea water solution is blocked, crocodiles are found to lose their ability to discriminate salinities. It has been proposed that the flattening of the sensory organ in hyperosmotic sea water is sensed by the animal as “touch”, but interpreted as chemical information about its surroundings. This might be why in alligators they are absent on the rest of the body.|$|E
40|$|The 16746 -neucleotide (nt) {{sequence}} of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Chinese alligator, Alligator sinensis, was determined using the Long-PCR and primer walking methods. As is typical in vertebrates, the mtDNA encodes 13 proteins, 2 rRNA, 22 tRNA genes, and a noncoding control region. The composition of bases is respectively 29. 43 % A, 24. 59 % T, 14. 86 % G, 31. 12 % C. The gene arrangement {{differs from the}} common vertebrate gene arrangement, but {{is similar to that}} of other crocodiles. DNA sequence data from 12 S rRNA, 16 S rRNA, protein-coding genes and combined sequence data were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of reptiles with the MP and ML, methods. With this large data set and an appropriate range of outgroup taxa, the authors demonstrate that Chinese alligator is most closely related to American alligator among three crocodilian species, which suppors the traditional viewpoint. According to the branch lengths of ML tree from the combined data set, the primary divergence between <b>Alligator</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caiman</b> genus was dated at about 74. 9 Ma, the split between Chinese <b>alligator</b> <b>and</b> American <b>alligator</b> was dated at 50. 9 Ma...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{microsatellite}} markers, {{developed for}} <b>Alligator</b> mississipiensis <b>and</b> <b>Caiman</b> latirostris, {{were used to}} assess parentage among individuals from the captive colony of Caiman latirostris at the University of São Paulo, in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil. Many of the females in the colony were full siblings, which made maternal identification difficult due to genotypic similarity. Even so, the most likely mother could be identified unambiguously among offspring in most of the clutches studied. Two non-parental females displayed maternal behavior which would have misled managers in assigning maternity based on behavior alone. This set of variable loci demonstrates the utility of parentage testing in captive propagation programs...|$|R
25|$|Although {{they appear}} to be similar to the untrained eye, crocodiles, {{alligators}} and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial, with its narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head, with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to <b>alligators</b> <b>and</b> <b>caimans.</b> Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the species' family. Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.|$|E

500|$|Crocodilians {{are largely}} carnivorous, and the diets of {{different}} species can vary with snout shape and tooth sharpness. Species with sharp teeth and long slender snouts, like the Indian gharial and Australian freshwater crocodile, are specialised for feeding on fish, insects, and crustaceans, while extremely broad-snouted species with blunt teeth, like the Chinese <b>alligator</b> <b>and</b> broad-snouted <b>caiman,</b> specialise in eating hard-shelled molluscs. Species whose snouts and teeth are intermediate {{between these two}} forms, such as the saltwater crocodile <b>and</b> American <b>alligator,</b> have generalised diets and opportunistically feed on invertebrates, fish, [...] amphibians, other reptiles, birds, and mammals.

40|$|Summary. 1.

Both secretory rates (6 - 20 [μmol/ 100 g-h) and concentrations (450 - 600 mM Na) of glandular se-cretions are essentially identical in the marine/estuarine C. acutus and C. porosus and significantly {{higher than in the}} freshwater C. johnstoni (1 - 2 μmol/ 100 g-h; 320 - 420 mM Na). 3. Lingual glands in Alligator secrete isosmotic Na/K at low rates (1 - 2 μmol/ 100 g-h) while those of Caiman show no response to methacholine. 4. The physiological contrast between alligatorids and crocodylids is reflected in distinct differences in the superficial appearance of the tongue and lingual pores. 5. It is postulated that the alligatorid condition of low secretory capacity and isosmotic secretion reflects the primitive salivary function of lingual glands from which the salt-secreting capability in crocodylids was derived...|$|R

Many of the species that are most closely related to species of Asiatosuchus were originally classified in the genus Crocodilus because they superficially resemble modern crocodiles.

5000|$|Pristichampsidae is an extinct {{family of}} {{crocodilians}} known from Europe during the Paleogene. Only one genus of pristichampsid are currently recognized, Pristichampsus. Pristichampsids were highly specialized crocodilians that were adapted to living on land. They have extensive body armor, long legs, and blunt claws resembling hooves, and are sometimes informally called [...] "hoofed crocodiles". Most phylogenetic analyses (analyses of evolutionary relationships) place pristichampsids in a basal position within Crocodylia. Some of these analyses find that pristichampsids lie just outside Brevirostres, {{the group of}} crocodilians that includes <b>alligators,</b> <b>caimans,</b> <b>and</b> crocodiles but not gharials. Pristichampsids are inferred to have {{first appeared in the}} Late Cretaceous, several tens of millions of years before they actually occur in the fossil record.

In East Africa, they are found mostly in rivers, lakes, marshes, and dams, favoring open, broad bodies of water over smaller ones. In Madagascar, the remnant population of Nile crocodiles has adapted to living within caves. Although not a regular sea-going species as is the American crocodile and, especially, the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile possesses salt glands like all true crocodiles (but not <b>alligators</b> <b>and</b> <b>caimans)</b> and does on occasion enter coastal and even marine waters.
