Liquidity measured using raw trading volume ratio, relative trading volume ratio and liquidity ratio suggest that raw trading volume and relative trading volume have decreased around bonus <b>and</b> <b>rights</b> announcements. Market depth, as measured by the liquidity ratio, has significantly decreased after the bonus <b>and</b> <b>rights</b> issue announcement in the Indian stock market. There is evidence of negative and significant decrease in stock price liquidity for bonus <b>and</b> <b>rights</b> issue announcements similar to other issue announcements in US, UK and other emerging economies. The results support cash substitution hypothesis and signaling theory but rejects liquidity hypothesis with respect to bonus <b>and</b> <b>rights</b> issue announcements. ...|$|R
40|$|Faculty advisers: Dr. Gyula Csurgai and Dr. Alexandre LambertIn 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development {{established}} the Cairo Programme of Action to embrace women's empowerment {{as one of}} the fundamental components of development, including the recognition that sexual and reproductive health <b>and</b> <b>rights</b> {{are an important part of}} the development agenda. However, twenty years after the ICPD sexual and reproductive health <b>and</b> <b>rights</b> remain largely neglected in development initiatives. There are vast inconsistencies between knowledge, policy and practice in ensuring sexual and reproductive health <b>and</b> <b>rights,</b> which is primarily due to a lack of understanding of the social and structural contexts that inhibit sexual and reproductive health <b>and</b> <b>rights.</b> There are three broad examples of these contexts that can provide insight into why it is remarkably difficult to ensure sexual and reproductive health <b>and</b> <b>rights</b> in developing countries: cultural and religious factors, political will, and program capacity. Realizing how these contexts impact sexual and reproductive health <b>and</b> <b>rights</b> can help illuminate comprehensive strategies for the international community to consider in the effort to address sexual and reproductive health <b>and</b> <b>rights</b> in the post- 2015 development agenda.

5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, {{the heart}} is divided into four chambers: upper left <b>and</b> <b>right</b> atria; and lower left <b>and</b> <b>right</b> {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid.
