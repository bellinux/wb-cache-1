25|$|Ranaghat {{town has}} existed since the British invaded India.

25|$|With a placid personality, Infante Francisco de Paula {{was more}} {{interested}} in art than in politics. The Infante, who in his childhood had received drawing lessons from the court painter and miniaturist Antonio Carnicero, was himself an amateur painter. Some of his works, including an oil painting of Saint Jerome, have survived. The Infante's main passion was music. Until he was forced to leave Spain for exile in 1808, he received music lessons from Pedro Anselmo Marchal and violin lessons from Francesco Vaccari. The Infante was a skillful singer with a good bass singing voice. His rooms at the Royal Palace were a gathering place for musicians and singers <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sing with them. The Infante also sang during musical evenings at the royal palace in the company of professional singers. From his youth until the end of his life, Francisco de Paula gathered an extensive sheet music collection that included almost 700 scores. This collection, acquired by the Biblioteca Nacional de España, has been preserved to this day. When Ferdinand VII created the Madrid Royal Conservatory in 1830, the infante was made an honorary member.|$|E

500|$|Drummer Mick Avory {{has offered}} an {{alternate}} {{explanation for the}} song's lyrics, claiming that [...] "Lola" [...] was partially inspired by Avory's frequenting of trans bars in west London. Avory said, [...] "We used to know this character called Michael McGrath. He used to hound the group a bit, because being called The Kinks did attract these sorts of people.

500|$|In a 2000 interview, William Asher {{described}} Temperatures Rising {{as being}} about: [...] "a young black surgeon {{who was always}} into mischief and things, {{but he was a}} very competent surgeon. James Whitmore was the head surgeon <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> drive Whitmore crazy". The pilot episode of Temperatures Rising was written by Sheldon Keller, who turned to his This is a Hospital? script for inspiration. It features Noland broadcasting a bingo game in code over the hospital's public-address system. Jack Albertson guest starred as a United States Senator. Subsequent episodes feature Noland performing a secret operation on a young baseball player while Campanelli deals with a hospital inspector (Ed Platt), and John Astin as a gangster wanting Noland to be his personal physician. In another episode, Noland hypnotizes a patient (Alice Ghostley) and, accidentally, Nurse Turner as well. This nearly costs the hospital a large donation from a potential benefactor (Charles Lane). In later episodes, Campanelli is seen having a brief romance with Nurse Turner's aunt (Beverly Garland), Noland helps out a new intern (Bernie Kopell) who has a reputation for being a jinx, and also performs a witchcraft ritual on a patient (Alan Oppenheimer) who thinks he has been cursed.|$|E

2500|$|Periazhwar (originally called Vishnuchittar) was {{an ardent}} devotee of Sri Vishnu <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> string garland to Sri Vishnu every day. He was childless and he prayed to Sri Vishnu {{to save him}} from the longing. One day, he found a girl child under a Tulasi plant in a garden inside the temple. The child was goddess Sri Mahalakshmi [...] itself incarnated to test the devotion of alvars. He and his wife named the child as Kothai, who grew up as a devotee of Sri Krishna, an avatar of Mahavishnu. She is {{believed}} to have worn the garland before dedicating it to the presiding deity of the temple. Periazhwar, who later found it, was highly upset and remonstrated her. Sri Vishnudeva appeared in his dream and asked him to dedicate only the garland worn by Andal to him. The girl Kothai was thus named Andal and was referred as Chudikodutha Sudarkodi (lady who gave her garland to Vishnu). The practise is followed during modern times when the garland of Andal from Srivilliputhur Andal Temple is sent to [...] on Garudostavam during the Tamil month of Purattaasi (September - October) and [...] during Chitra Pournami.|$|E

The regime was annoyed with him because he was a popular and outstanding medical doctor that had [...] "deserted" [...] them to the Church, he had been a charismatic bishop and he had chosen the most militantly anti-Sergiite faction (M.

He had brought many parishes over from Sergii's faction to his and he had also introduced a prayer that would be introduced in many churches that called on Jesus to keep His word that the gates of hell would not overcome the church and He [...] "grant those in power wisdom and fear of God, so that their hearts become merciful and peaceful towards the Church".

2500|$|Snow {{was born}} in Peopleton, Worcestershire, {{the son of a}} Scottish vicar who soon after took up a living in the Diocese of Worcester at the village of Elmley Castle. When he was born his grandfather, a cricket coach, rang his father in Scotland to {{announce}} that [...] "It's a young cricketer!" [...] and he was given a cricket bat to chew when he was a baby. He learned how to play in the three-acre grounds of the vicarage with his father, mother, grandfather and three sisters and later in village matches. Snow's rural childhood was completely unaffected by the war or rationing <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> chop down trees for firewood, excellent exercise for the muscles needed for fast bowling (Frank Tyson was once a tree-feller). First educated at Christ's Hospital, he moved to Chichester High School for Boys the year before his father became vicar at nearby Bognor Regis, where he was trained by the Warwickshire batsman Len Bates. Living in Sussex he joined the Bognor Colts, as had Peter May and David Sheppard before him, and had the great honour of being bowled by Frank Worrell when they played Antilles. He also began playing games for the Sussex Young Amateurs and Junior Marletts. As a teenager he had been a better batsman than a bowler, but as more boys wanted to bat than bowl he concentrated on the latter. [...] He also played rugby throughout his teens, but gave up the game in 1961 to concentrate on his cricket career. He attended Culham Teachers Training College near Abingdon, and from 1963-65 as part of his training taught at Woodingdean Primary School in what is now East Sussex, but his studies suffered as he played more First Class Cricket.|$|E

Stacey tells the doctor she has been hearing God's voice since Arthur's birth at Christmas, so the doctor suspects she is suffering from postpartum psychosis.

Martin finds a mother and baby unit for Stacey in Essex, and takes her and Arthur there. Stacey writes Martin a letter revealing that Arthur is Kush's son, but decides not to send it, however a nurse finds it and gives it to Martin; Martin is heartbroken. Stacey begs for his forgiveness, but he goes to America, returning a few weeks later and they reunite. Stacey is allowed a home visit, where she meets Kyle again.
