2500|$|The Hawker Fury was an {{evolutionary}} {{successor to the}} successful Hawker Typhoon and Tempest fighters and fighter-bombers of the Second World War. The Fury's design process was initiated in September 1942 by Sydney Camm, one of Hawker's foremost aircraft designers, to meet the Royal Air Force’s requirement for a lightweight Tempest Mk.II replacement; the Tempest, while a successful aircraft, had been viewed as being heavy and oversized for typical fighter duties. Developed as the [...] "Tempest Light Fighter", the semi-elliptical wing of the Tempest was incorporated, but was shortened in span by attaching the two wings at the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centreline,</b> eliminating the centre-section. The fuselage itself was broadly similar in form {{to that of the}} Tempest, but was a fully monocoque structure, while the cockpit level was higher, affording the pilot better all round visibility.|$|E
50|$|The Bullfinch monoplane, or Type 52 Bullfinch Mk I, was a {{cantilever}} {{parasol monoplane}} with a welded steel tube fuselage. The wing was in two halves, {{joined at the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>centreline,</b> with each half tapering from maximum thickness at half span to both the wing root and tips. The wing was wooden on the prototypes, but was planned to be of metal construction for any subsequent production aircraft. To produce the two-seat fighter-reconnaissance version, the Type 53 Bullfinch Mk II, an extra fuselage bay was added aft of the pilot containing a cockpit for the observer, and a cantilever bottom wing attached which compensated for the shift in centre of gravity resulting from {{the weight of the}} observer and the lengthened fuselage.|$|E

50|$|While pure pushers {{decreased}} in popularity during the First World War, the push-pull configuration {{has continued to}} be used. The advantage it provides {{is the ability to}} mount two propellers on the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centreline,</b> thereby avoiding the increased drag that comes with twin wing-mounted engines. It is also easier to fly if one of the two engines fails, as the thrust provided by the remaining engine stays in the centerline. In contrast, a conventional twin-engine aircraft will yaw {{in the direction of the}} failed engine and become uncontrollable below a certain airspeed, known as VMC.|$|R
50|$|After {{the first}} series of flights the {{aircraft}} {{was returned to}} the workshop and the wing was swept 4.25° to the rear, thereby moving the centre of pressure into a more reasonable position {{in relation to the}} new centre of gravity. This left the engines and wing floats canted out from the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centreline.</b> Although the wing loading was much higher than that of any previous Royal Air Force flying boat, a new flap system kept the takeoff run to a reasonable length and the aircraft first flew with the new wing sweep and the uprated Pegasus XXII engines on 7 March 1938.|$|R
50|$|The G.V was {{generally}} {{similar to the}} G.IVs, and featured a similar box-like tail unit. It differed, however, in having an even shorter forward fuselage, so that {{the nose of the}} aircraft was now behind the propeller discs. This allowed the engines to be moved closer to the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centreline,</b> making asymmetrical thrust less of a problem {{in the case of the}} failure of one of its engines. A single prototype flew on 9 May 1918, but it was not put into production. The FF.62 did not fly until 20 November, and {{was generally}} similar except for reverting to Mercedes D.IVa in place of the new Maybach Mb IVa engines used on the G.V.|$|R
30|$|The {{pitch axis}} is the y axis, {{perpendicular}} to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centreline</b> and lies in {{the plane of the}} wings. Pitch motion is an up or down rotation around the centre of gravity.|$|E
30|$|In flight, any {{aircraft}} will rotate {{about its}} center of gravity. The roll axis lies along the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centreline.</b> The deflection of the ailerons {{of the aircraft}} causes the rolling motion. The aileron is a hinged section {{at the rear of}} each wing. The ailerons work in opposition; when the right aileron goes up, the left aileron goes down.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of systematic studies in which the effects of turbulence and how it impacts the aerodynamic performance of a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) are described. Flow visualization experiments mapping the dynamic nature of the flow over the MAV’s wing lead into the study of pressures on a MAV wing and how this can be used as an input to an autopilot system to mitigate the effects of turbulence. A MAV was tested under two different turbulence conditions (Ti = 1. 2 % &amp; 7 % Lxx = 0. 23 m) in the RMIT Industrial Wind Tunnel at a Reynolds number of 120, 000. Force balance measurements revealed insignificant change in aerodynamic coefficients and derivatives when tested in the two difference turbulence conditions, a result not found in similar low Reynolds number tests involving flat plate airfoils. Force balance data also revealed increased wing performance offering greater lift production at angles of attack where separated flow would normally occur. Unsteady pressures were measured on a pressure tapped 3 D NACA 2313 wing in the two turbulence flow conditions. The introduction of freestream turbulence improved the time-averaged wing performance by delaying stall for the high turbulence flow condition, a result also found in the force balance data. Smoke flow visualization revealed unsteady flow mechanics at angles of attack greater than 15 degrees with the shear layer undergoing unsteady attachment and detachment at random time intervals. The shear layer was also seen to roll up and form a vortical core, which formed and burst at random intervals. Vortical core formations correlated to time varying pressure data with broad suction peaks formed near the wing leading edge before traversing across the wings chord. The vortical core flow mechanics was assumed to be a result of the oncoming flow vector relative to the wings angle of attack. Despite the unsteady nature of the pressure field, it was discovered that a single chord-wise pressure tap held high correlation (r &gt; 95 %) to the chord-wise integration of Pressure Coefficient (Cp) suggesting a linear relationship for angles of attack below stall for frequencies up to 25 Hz. Thus a single chord-wise pressure tap can be used to approximate the integrated chord-wise Cp at various span-wise locations. The relationship between local and integrated Cp, per span-wise segment, could also be defined through a low-turbulence flow condition, as differences in the linear equations linking local and integrated pressure were insignificant and fell within the margin of error. With pressure taps placed at various locations across the span, measured pressure can be used to approximate span-wise sectional lift and furthermore be resolved around the <b>aircraft</b> <b>centreline</b> to produce a Turbulence Induced Rolling moment (TIR). TIR signal can be implemented into a control loop feedback system working in tandem with an IMU to form the basis of a MAV roll stabilization system, primarily for MAV flight in turbulent flow conditions...|$|E
50|$|The Ellehammer Semi-biplane was a {{pioneering}} aircraft flown in Denmark in 1906. Jacob Ellehammer built the aircraft {{based on his}} monoplane design of the previous year. Like that aircraft, it featured a large, triangular wing, with a motor (of Ellehammer's own design and construction) mounted beneath it. The pilot sat on a seat that was suspended like a pendulum, allowing him to shift his weight to control the aircraft, similar in concept (if not execution) to the control of a modern hang-glider. Unlike his monoplane, however, the semi-biplane's main wing formed a constant, unbroken span. Additionally, it was fitted with an upper wing of the same triangular shape, which connected to the main wing at its three corners and to an arch above the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centreline.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Gotha G.VII. a.k.a.GL.VII, was a bomber {{aircraft}} {{produced in}} Germany {{during the final}} months of World War I. With the strategic bombing campaign effectively over, {{it was intended to}} be a high-speed tactical bomber with a secondary reconnaissance capability. It was a conventional two-bay biplane design with tractor-mounted engines, and a conventional empennage with twin fins and rudders. The bombardier's position in the nose of the aircraft that had featured on earlier Gotha designs was removed, and the nose of the aircraft severely truncated and fitted with a streamlined nose-cone. This allowed the engines to be located further inboard than on previous designs, bringing them closer to the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centreline</b> and therefore minimising the effects of asymmetric thrust {{in the event of an}} engine failure. The engine nacelles also featured careful streamlining.|$|R
5|$|In August 1947, Chadwick {{was killed}} in the crash of the Avro Tudor 2 {{prototype}} and was succeeded by Sir William Farren. Reductions in wing thickness made it impossible to incorporate the split bomb bays and stacked engines, thus the engines were placed side-by-side in pairs either side of a single bomb-bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centreline.</b> Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged HP.80 B.35/46 tender in November 1947. Though considered the best option, contract placement for Avro's design was delayed whilst its technical strength was established. Instructions to proceed with the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes was received in January 1948. As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, Short Brothers received a contract for the prototype SA.4 to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46; the SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, Vickers also received authority to proceed with their Type 660 which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, being of a more conventional design would be available sooner; this plane entered service as the Valiant.|$|R
2500|$|The [...]303 {{machine guns}} {{mounted in the}} outer wings were no longer fitted, because {{standard}} rifle calibre bullets were ineffective against increasingly heavily armoured enemy aircraft. (These outer guns {{had always been the}} less effective part of a Spitfire's armament: their distance from the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>centreline</b> made them hard to harmonise accurately, and during turning combat the flexing of the wings meant that the rounds were even more widely scattered). The 20mm Hispano cannon were moved outboard and heavy machine guns, the [...]50 calibre Browning M2/AN, with 250 rpg were added to the inner gun-bays. The first trial installation (modification 1029) was made in BS118 in November 1943; by mid-March 1944 the first service Spitfires to be modified were from 485(NZ), 222 and 349 Squadrons.
