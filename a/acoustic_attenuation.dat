Fish density accurate estimation made via acoustic echo integration is problematic in bad weather conditions due to <b>acoustic</b> signal <b>attenuation</b> by waterborne air bubbles and vessel movement, which result in an underestimation of fish abundance. Correction factors have as yet not been established experimentally to account for <b>acoustic</b> signal <b>attenuation</b> in bad weather conditions. In this study, the nautical area backscattering coefficients (NASCs) of corrugated and flat sea beds were measured by three 38 kHz split beam Simrad EK 60 echosounders during different weather conditions (calm, moderate, and bad). The ratios of integrated sea bed NASCs under these different weather conditions were evaluated in order to estimate correction factors for <b>acoustic</b> signal <b>attenuation.</b> Vessel roll and pitch were also used as an index of <b>acoustic</b> signal <b>attenuation</b> at a given wind speed, wave size, and vessel-encounter angle. Results show that stable sea bed NASC ratios are found during periods of low (0 - 10 ms- 1) wind speed, whereas at high wind speeds of around 30 ms- 1 a multiplicative correction factor of 2. 3 must be applied. The results also suggest that <b>acoustic</b> signal <b>attenuation</b> is vessel specific, and that transducer mounting position and vessel hull shape influence such attenuation. Therefore, the established correction factors for surveys conducted in bad weather should improve the data quality for sustainable fisheries management...|$|R

40|$|The {{relatively}} high sonochemical {{activity in the}} frequency range 200 – 600 kHz, makes these high frequencies attractive for contaminant remediation. However, high frequency ultrasound also suffers from higher <b>acoustic</b> energy <b>attenuation</b> and inherent low intensity which limits the volume coverage and hence practical application. In this study, in order to clearly {{understand the relationship between}} the sonochemical activity and <b>acoustic</b> energy <b>attenuation,</b> calorimetric and degradation studies using methyl orange (MO) as a contaminant surrogate were investigated with indirect sonication at 200 kHz (transducer diameter: 65 mm) with various cylindrical glass reactors of different diameter (20, 48, 65, 95 and 117 mm) and liquid height (21, 58, 81 and 118 mm). It was clear that both reactor diameter and liquid height significantly influenced degradation efficiency. In addition to the inherent acoustic pressure distribution within the reactor due to the transducer acoustic pressure profile, the diameter of the reactor affected mainly attenuation of ultrasound in the radial direction, while attenuation in the axial direction was principally influenced by reactor height. A 95 mm diameter reactor with a ratio (reactor diameter/transducer diameter) of 1. 45, exhibited the highest sonochemical efficiency and acoustic energy transfer efficiency across a range of liquid heights. ...|$|R

The <b>acoustic</b> properties (<b>attenuation</b> coefficient, speed of sound and cavitation threshold) and thermal response of the material were {{compared with those of}} fresh degassed liver tissue over a range of acoustic pressures and frequencies. A luminescence intensity assay was used to evaluate viability of HuH- 7 cells in the material. The efficacy of ultrasound-mediated chemotherapeutic treatment in the material was tested by localised activation of low temperature thermally sensitive liposomes. Drug activation was measured by fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Similar <b>acoustic</b> properties (<b>attenuation</b> coefficient, speed of sound) to liver tissue were achieved over the therapeutically relevant frequency range of 1 - 4 [*]MHz and similar thermal response was achieved for acoustic pressures up to 4. 8 [*]MPa peak to peak (ppk) at 1. 1 [*]MHz.
