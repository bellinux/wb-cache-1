5|$|In 2002, AC/DC {{signed a}} long-term, multi-album deal with Sony Music, {{who went on}} to release a series of remastered albums as part of their AC/DC remasters series. Each release {{contained}} an expanded booklet featuring rare photographs, memorabilia, and notes. In 2003, the entire back-catalogue (except Ballbreaker <b>and</b> <b>Stiff</b> Upper Lip) was remastered and re-released. Ballbreaker was eventually re-released in October 2005; Stiff Upper Lip was later re-released in April 2007. Also in 2003, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|After the iguanodontian Lurdusaurus, Nigersaurus was {{the most}} {{numerous}} megaherbivore. Other herbivores from the same formation include Ouranosaurus, Elrhazosaurus, and an unnamed titanosaur. It also lived alongside the theropods Kryptops, Suchomimus, and Eocarcharia, and a yet-unnamed noasaurid. Crocodylomorphs like Sarcosuchus, Anatosuchus, Araripesuchus, and Stolokrosuchus also lived there. In addition, remains of a pterosaur, chelonians, fish, a hybodont shark, and freshwater bivalves have been found. Grass did not evolve until the late Cretaceous, making ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms (which had evolved by the middle Cretaceous) potential food for Nigersaurus. It is unlikely the dinosaur fed on conifers, cycads, or aquatic vegetation, due respectively to their height, hard <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> structure, and lack of appropriate habitat.|$|E
5|$|Now {{beginning}} to compose independently, Rachmaninoff's next project {{was a group}} he titled Three Nocturnes, and is regarded as his first serious attempt at writing for the piano. The first nocturne, in F-sharp minor, was written 14-21 November 1887, and has three parts: a beginning and an end in andante cantabile and a central section in allegro. The slower andantes are gentle sections, influenced by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, while the allegro is unnatural <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> and unusually fast for a nocturne. The second piece, in F major, followed on 22-25 November, also contains a slower portion coupled with a quick section. No. 3, in C minor, {{took more than a}} month to compose, dated from 3 December 1886 to 12 January 1887. With a chordal texture spread over the entire keyboard, it is reminiscent of the music of Robert Schumann. The nocturnes were published posthumously in Moscow in 1949, but were not assigned an opus number.|$|E

5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> control cables.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{it was not}} as {{successful}} as her previous records in Japan. It debuted at number five on the Oricon Albums Chart and sold 39,295 units, making it Hamasaki's lowest first week sales in her career at the time and was her first album to miss the top three position. Its low first week sales were attributed to the lack of promotion of the album <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> competition by other artists at the time, as described by Japanese publications. It dropped to number 16 the following week, her first album not to stay inside the top ten for at least two weeks, with sales of 6,122 units. The following week, it slipped to number 31 with 2,922 units sold, and fell outside the top 50 the following week. It sold 53,406 units by the end of 2014, and was ranked number 98 on Oricon's Annual Chart. Despite its much lower success, it became her 47th record to chart within the top ten on the Oricon Albums Chart; Hamasaki became the second artist in Japanese music history to achieve this after Yumi Matsutoya. Elsewhere, the album reached number 75 and 16 on the South Korean Gaon Albums Chart and Gaon International Chart.|$|E
5|$|Here the Japanese {{held the}} high ground in well-concealed {{positions}} that had clear fields of fire into the narrow gorge below. With no other options, the 16th Brigade was forced to assault the Japanese defences frontally, advancing straight up the gorge. Amidst torrential rain <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> defence, progress was slow as each defensive position had {{to be dealt with}} individually. As the water level in the creek rose steadily, the troops came under heavy mortar fire and were attacked with grenades lobbed from the heights above. The supply situation grew desperate too, but by 28 October the 2/3rd Battalion had managed to work its way around the Japanese right flank in preparation for an attack. In the afternoon, the battalion launched its attack, breaking through the Japanese outposts and into the main position. The defenders were overwhelmed and many of them abandoned their weapons as they fled. That night, the remaining Japanese withdrew from the position. The 16th Brigade lost 72 killed and 154 wounded in this action.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of , which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather.|$|E

25|$|On both fronts, {{the rugged}} terrain <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> Republican {{resistance}} halted the advance. It was then {{clear that the}} mountains of the Sierra de Cuera were vital to the defence of Asturias, {{and the key to}} the Sierra de Cuera was the pass of El Mazuco.|$|E

25|$|Other {{physical}} characteristics of Caucasoids include hair texture that varies from straight to curly. Wavy (cymotrichous) hair is most typical on average according to Coon (1962), {{in contrast to}} the typical hair of Negroids (kinky) and Mongoloids (straight <b>and</b> <b>stiff).</b> Individual hairs are also rarely as sparsely distributed and coarse as found in Mongoloids.|$|E
25|$|The {{setting up}} of the Canara bank seemed to stimulate {{co-operative}} banking elsewhere in the district. Between 1909 and 1917, six co-operative banks came into being, and during the decade immediately after the First World War (1914–18), South Canara gave birth {{to as many as}} eight banks. Despite two world wars, economic depression, <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> competition, the Canara bank not only survived, but made satisfactory progress.|$|E
25|$|Men's {{clothing}} {{is seen as}} formal <b>and</b> <b>stiff,</b> women's as elaborate and over-done. Clothing covered the entire body, we are told, and even the glimpse of an ankle was scandalous. Critics contend that corsets constricted women's bodies and women's lives. Homes are described as gloomy, dark, cluttered with massive and over-ornate furniture and proliferating bric-a-brac. Myth has it that even piano legs were scandalous, and covered with tiny pantalettes.|$|E

25|$|Rubber was {{introduced}} to Europe and America and created a shift in shoes from the pattens and clogs to the galosh. The galosh was soft and gummy in warm weather and hard <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> in the cold. The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy looking, {{as though they were}} held on by suction cups, for the leather barely covered the toes and hardly gripped the heel.|$|E
25|$|A film by Julien Temple {{about the}} early days of the band, Oil City Confidential, premiered at the London Film Festival on 22 October 2009, and {{received}} a standing ovation. Guest of honour was Lee Brilleaux's mother Joan Collinson, along with his widow Shirley and children Kelly and Nick. All the surviving members of the original band were present along with manager Chris Fenwick, former tour manager <b>and</b> <b>Stiff</b> Records boss Jake Riviera and other friends and colleagues of the band. The film has its own Facebook page.|$|E
25|$|Gifford Senior and his then thirteen-year-old son co-wrote a {{scientific}} travel-adventure book, entitled Giff <b>and</b> <b>Stiff</b> in the South Seas, copyright 1933, by the John C. Winston Co. of Philadelphia. Junior Gifford narrates the adventure, relating {{in a young}} boy's language the scientific studies, observations, and adventures encountered by a family sailing on the Mary Pinchot—from New York City to Key West {{and on to the}} Galapagos, Marquesas and Society Islands. Photos also document the Darwin-like odyssey. Although the book is currently out of print, it can be found.|$|E

25|$|The short-toed {{treecreeper}} {{is one of}} a group of four very similar Holarctic treecreepers, including the closely related North American brown creepers, and has five subspecies differing in appearance and song. Like other treecreepers, the short-toed is inconspicuously plumaged brown above and whitish below, and has a curved bill <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> tail feathers. It is a resident in woodlands throughout its range, and nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, laying about six eggs. This common, unwary, but inconspicuous species feeds mainly on insects which are picked from the tree trunk as the treecreeper ascends with short hops.|$|E
25|$|Over time, people {{experience}} increasing difficulty moving, swallowing (dysphagia), and speaking or forming words (dysarthria). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight <b>and</b> <b>stiff</b> muscles (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called Babinski's sign also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles {{that can be}} seen under the skin (fasciculations) although twitching is not a diagnostic symptom and more of a side effect so twitching would either occur after or accompany weakness and atrophy.|$|E
25|$|RA {{typically}} manifests {{with signs}} of inflammation, with the affected joints being swollen, warm, painful <b>and</b> <b>stiff,</b> particularly {{early in the}} morning on waking or following prolonged inactivity. Increased stiffness {{early in the morning}} is often a prominent feature of the disease and typically lasts for more than an hour. Gentle movements may relieve symptoms in early stages of the disease. These signs help distinguish rheumatoid from non-inflammatory problems of the joints, such as osteoarthritis. In arthritis of non-inflammatory causes, signs of inflammation and early morning stiffness are less prominent with stiffness typically less than one hour, and movements induce pain caused by mechanical arthritis.|$|E
