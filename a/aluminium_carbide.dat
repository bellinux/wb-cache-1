40|$|Cathode wear is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} key factors for limiting the lifetime of aluminium electrolysis cells. This phenomenon has become more important as aluminium smelters have steadily increased the amperage of the cells and shifted towards graphitized cathode materials with higher electrical conductivity. The present work has focused on the fundamentals of the formation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> at the carbon-aluminium interface. The objective was to investigate the mechanism(s) of the formation of Al 4 C 3 and the influence of reaction parameters such as temperature, presence of cryolite and electrical current. The reaction between aluminium and carbon was first examined by diffusion couples experiments. Formation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> was observed at the interface after annealing at 1100 °C or higher temperatures. Two distinct layers of <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> could be observed at the interface by optical and electron microscopy. The composition of the two layers was confirmed by EDS element mapping, and the analysis revealed a relative high oxygen content in the layer towards Al and a lower oxygen content in the layer towards C. Based on a thermodynamic analysis it was suggested that the reaction may proceed by transport through the gas phase due to volatile species, which is also important for the removal of the oxide scale on the surface of molten aluminium. The influence of cryolite on the reaction of Al and C was examined also by introduction of a thin film at the Al/C interface. The presence of a catalytic amount of cryolite changed dramatically the reaction, and an <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> layer was found at the carbon surface already after 3 hours at 1030 °C. Needle-like crystals of <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> were found towards aluminium, while cryolite was not found due to the significant vapour pressure of NaAlF 4 (g). When a higher volume of molten cryolite was present in the crucible, the formation of Al 4 C 3 was slowed down. The influence of applying an electric current through the diffusion couple was also investigated, and the carbon material was cathodically polarized. Formation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> could not be confirmed in these experiments without cryolite present at the interface. The cell voltage was however oscillating during the experiment, which could be explained by a periodically formation and fracture of <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> at the interface contact points. When catalytic amount of cryolite was introduced at the Al/C interface, the observations were similar to experiments without polarization, but the amount of <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> formed was higher, which suggests that the current passing through the diffusion couple enhances the formation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide.</b> Finally, electrolysis experiments were performed in electrochemical cells with various setups of the electrodes. First a conventional cell analogue to industrial cells was used. Second, an inverted cell with opposite polarization was applied, where the cathode was exposed directly to the bath. Finally, an inverted cell was applied without Al metal present initially. These electrolysis experiments demonstrated quite similar results, where an <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> layer was found along the entire cathode surface already after 30 minutes of electrolysis. In case of the inverted cell without aluminium, the carbide layer was thinner compared to other cells, which was explained by higher amount of bath {{in the vicinity of the}} cathode leading to faster dissolution of the carbide layer. Analysis of the interior of the cathodically polarized carbon materials revealed that the molten bath infiltrated the cathode and that <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> was formed on the walls of the pores, while no Al metal was found. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> was suggested to be deposited electrochemically directly from the bath without involvement of the aluminium pad. The present work has demonstrated that the formation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> by an electrochemical reaction is significantly faster than a purely chemical reaction between the two elements. The role of cryolite for the carbide formation is twofold. Cryolite is involved as a reactant in the electrochemical formation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> and it also works as a solvent of the carbide. Finally, it is proposed that the exchange rate of the molten bath between the carbon cathode and the aluminium pad is the rate determining step for the cathode wear rate.

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{technologies for}} aluminium production include production of alumina from bauxite and smelting of alumina to produce aluminium. The current technology is energy intensive, {{a major source}} of greenhouse gas emissions and harmful fluoride emissions. Carbothermal reduction of bauxite is a promising alternative technology for aluminium and aluminoalloy production. Western Australia and Queensland bauxite ores were carbothermally reduced in steps in argon.

Effect of CO in the gas atmosphere Oil the reduction behaviour of alumina was also studied, temperature-programmed and isothermal reduction experiments were conducted in a laboratory fixed bed reactor in the high temperature furnace in the temperature range 1500 - 1700 °C. The off-gas composition in the reduction process was monitored by a CO/CO 2 /CH 4 infrared analyser. The extent of reduction was calculated using data on the gas composition and LECO oxygen analysis. Phase composition of reduced samples was studied using XRD. The major findings of this project are as follows : -The reduction of alumina to <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> occurred through gaseous Al 2 O and Al. The reduction started with reduction of alumina by carbon to Al(g) and Al 2 O(g); alumina was further reduced to Al 2 O vapour by gaseous aluminium. Al 2 O reacted with graphite producing Al vapour and carbide Al 4 C 3. -Rate and extent of reduction of alumina increased with increasing temperature. -Reduction rate of alumina was faster in hydrogen and helium than in argon. The difference in the reduction rate in hydrogen and helium was insignificant. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> produced by reduction in helium was more stable than that in hydrogen. The carbon of Al 4 C 3 reacted with hydrogen to form methane. -High rate of reduction of alumina in hydrogen and helium was attributed to high diffusion coefficient of the gaseous species. -Addition of CO retarded the carbothermal reduction of alumina. -Increasing gas flow rate or decreasing gas pressure increased the reduction rate what was attributed to a faster mass transfer of gas species at high gas flow rate and low gas pressure. - Increasing the pellet porosity increased the reduction rate.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the rapid microwave synthesis and subsequent structural characterisation {{of the group}} 13 carbides; specifically <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide,</b> Al 4 C 3 and boron carbide, typically B 4 C or B 13 C 2. Due to practical considerations, which will be described in Chapters Three and Four, syntheses were conducted using elemental precursors. Using a multi-mode microwave cavity (MMC) with an operating frequency of 2. 45 GHz {{it was necessary to}} make use of a sealed and inert environment for the synthesis of oxide-free products. This was rationalised by the high stability of the oxides of aluminium (for example, Al 2 O 3 ΔH= - 1675. 69 kJ mol- 1, Al 4 C 3 ΔH= - 206. 9 kJ mol- 1). For boron carbide, this observation was explained by the tendency for the oxides of boron to volatilise (for example as B 2 O 3). The use of sealed, evacuated tubes facilitated the synthesis of high-purity carbide products in 30 minute timescales. This represents the first report of successful Al 4 C 3 synthesis in a microwave cavity. In addition, the synthesis of boron carbide was achieved in air in just 90 seconds using a 2. 45 GHz single-mode microwave cavity (SMC) for the first time. Following synthesis, products were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (PXD), powder neutron diffraction (PND), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). PXD was used for phase identification and preliminary structure refinement. Raman spectroscopy offered supporting information to PXD to confirm phase identity. SEM-EDX offered an insight into product morphology, for example, as a function of time, microwave power and cavity type, along with quantitative purity information. There was no PXD or EDX evidence for oxygen contamination across carbide samples. PND was used to probe defect structure and structural stability at elevated temperature. Microwave synthesised Al 4 C 3 was structurally stable up to 1000 °C and boron carbide up to 400 °C (the maximum temperatures of the respective experiments). <b>Aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> is reported elsewhere to interact with water. Some initial experiments surrounding the nature of this interaction have been conducted. The preliminary results have indicated potential for intercalation of water into the <b>aluminium</b> <b>carbide</b> structure. Obtaining a definitive structural model for boron carbide is complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing between boron and carbon experimentally. Boron and carbon are neighbours in the periodic table and near-isoelectronic. This complicates characterising the boron-carbon system by PXD, since PXD is mediated by electrons.
