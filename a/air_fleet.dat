5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, the ship was anchored at Ariake Bay, Kyushu beginning in September 1941 while its aircraft were based at Kagoshima to train with the other 1st <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet</b> air units for the Pearl Harbor operation. Once preparations and training were completed, Akagi assembled {{with the rest of}} the First <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet</b> at Hitokappu Bay in the Kuril Islands on 22 November 1941. The ships departed on 26 November 1941 for Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the American strikes on Formosa beginning 12 October, newly formed carrier units like the Japanese 634th Naval Air Group (NAG) were detached from their ships in the IJN's Fourth Carrier Division. Posted to the land-based 2nd <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet,</b> the 634th NAG experienced rapid attrition throughout {{the remainder of the}} month. By January 1945 this group had no personnel capable of maintaining flight operations. At the same time, older carrier units like the 653rd Naval Air Group, which had just finished rebuilding after losses suffered during the First Battle of the Philippine Sea, were detached and similarly integrated into the 2nd <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet.</b> Over the course of the Formosa Air Battle alone the 653rd NAG lost almost half of its available aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Shōhō was {{commissioned}} on 30 November 1941 and Captain Izawa Ishinosuke became her commanding officer.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1914 credits were voted {{for the creation of}} a naval aerodrome in Eleusina, Attica. Meanwhile, despite limited funds Aristeidis Moraitinis managed to establish the first naval aviation school and corps. In spring 1915 the establishment of an independent Naval Aviation Department within the Ministry of Naval Affairs and the incorporation of the Greek naval <b>air</b> <b>fleet</b> into the Greek Navy ensured the foundation of the Naval Air Service (NAY).|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, Adolf Hitler {{resolved}} to recover Germany′s deteriorating fortunes by launching an offensive in the West. On 16 September, Hitler directed Generalleutnant Werner Kreipe—Chief of the General Staff—to prepare the necessary aircraft for the offensive. On 21 October, Kreipe ordered the <b>air</b> <b>fleet</b> defending the Greater German Reich (Luftflotte Reich) {{to hand over}} seven Jagdgeschwader and Schlachtgeschwader to Air Command West (Luftwaffenkommando West) for a future offensive.|$|E
5|$|The Formosa Air Battle {{also proved}} {{a turning point}} for Japanese {{military}} tactics. Organized kamikaze attacks had been proposed after the First Battle of the Philippine Sea but were rejected by Imperial Japanese Navy leaders through September 1944. Only in the immediate wake of the Formosa Air Battle, when Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi replaced Vice Admiral Kimpei Teraoka as leader of the IJN's 1st <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet,</b> were units specifically deployed with the intent to crash-dive enemy vessels.|$|E
5|$|Akagis {{aircraft}} {{served in}} the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s. Upon {{the formation of the}} First <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet</b> or Kido Butai (Striking Force) in early 1941, she became its flagship, and remained so for the duration of her service. With other fleet carriers, she took part in the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month, her aircraft bombed Darwin, Australia, and assisted in the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. In March and April 1942, Akagi aircraft helped sink a British heavy cruiser and an Australian destroyer in the Indian Ocean Raid.|$|E

5|$|Kagas {{aircraft}} first supported Japanese {{troops in}} China during the Shanghai Incident of 1932 {{and participated in}} the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s. With five other fleet carriers, she {{took part in the}} Pearl Harbor raid in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin, Australia, helping secure the conquest of the Dutch East Indies by Japanese forces. She missed the Indian Ocean raid in April as she had to return to Japan for repairs after hitting a reef in February. Following repairs, Kaga rejoined the 1st <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet</b> for the attack on Midway Atoll in June 1942.|$|E
5|$|October 4 also {{provided}} another worrying incident to Egyptian commanders, who {{became aware that}} evening that EgyptAir, the country's national airline, had canceled all its flights and was arranging the protection of its civil <b>air</b> <b>fleet</b> by dispersing its aircraft to refuges outside Egypt. The orders came from the Minister of Aviation, Ahmed Nuh. General Headquarters quickly intervened to reverse the dispersal orders, and by October 5 flights were back to their normal schedule. It was believed the incident was a breach of security and a leak on Egyptian plans for war. It was not clear to Egyptian commanders however, whether the Israelis {{were aware of the}} incident.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February, the Red Army {{launched}} Operation Star, {{threatening to}} recapture the cities of Belgorod, Kharkov and Kursk. A Soviet drive, spearheaded by four tank corps organized under Lieutenant-General Markian Popov, pierced the German front by crossing the Donets River and pressing into the German rear. On 15 February, two fresh Soviet tank corps threatened the city of Zaporizhia on the Dnieper River, which controlled the last major road to Rostov and housed the headquarters of Army Group South and Luftflotte 4 (<b>Air</b> <b>Fleet</b> Four). Despite Hitler's orders to hold the city, Kharkov was abandoned by German forces and the city was recaptured by the Red Army on 16 February.|$|E

5|$|While the Soviet {{offensive}} continued, Field Marshal von Manstein {{was able}} to put the SS Panzer Corps—now reinforced by the 3rd SS Panzer Division—under the command of the Fourth Panzer Army, while Hitler agreed to release seven understrength panzer and motorized divisions for the impending counteroffensive. The Fourth <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet,</b> under the command of Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen, {{was able to}} regroup and increase the number of daily sorties from an average of 350 in January to 1,000 in February, providing German forces strategic air superiority. On 20 February, the Red Army was perilously close to Zaporizhia, signaling the beginning of the German counterattack, known to the German forces as the Donets Campaign.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet,</b> then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.|$|E
5|$|After the {{disastrous}} losses of Operation Bodenplatte, {{and failing to}} maintain air superiority over the Ardennes area, a severely weakened II./JG 1 transferred to Insterburg in East Prussia (modern Chernyakhovsk in Russia). I./JG 1 faced British fighters over Hengelo-Twente on 14 January 1945. JG 1 lost 12 pilots with 7 being killed, 3 wounded and 2 missing. Spitfires shot down the entire 1. and 2. staffels of JG 1 at Twente airport as they took off (for the loss of two). Ihlefeld threatened to court martial Major G. Capito, the new leader of I./JG 1, for such a disastrous loss {{but was unable to}} during the transferring to the Eastern Front. In Poland JG 1 were briefly assigned to Luftflotte Reich (the <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet</b> assigned to defend what was left of Germany from the final Allied offensives).|$|E

5|$|By 3 July 1940, the {{majority}} of the Bf109s had returned to Grandvilliers from maintenance overhaul. At the time, Lützow had 45 pilots and 33 Bf109Es for disposition, 28 of the aircraft being operational. I. Gruppe flew its first missions over the Channel Coast on the evening of 5 July 1940. In the following days flight operations were impeded by a period of bad weather. On 1 August 1940, I. Gruppe was moved to Colembert, the Geschwaderstab (headquarters unit) and the other two Gruppen were moved to airfields in the vicinity of Boulogne. In preparations for actions against Great Britain, JG3 was put under the control of Luftflotte 2 (2nd <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet),</b> thus placing it under the command of Jagdfliegerführer 2 Oberst (Colonel) Osterkamp.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the failure}} of Adlertag and {{considerable}} loss rates on 15, 16 and 17 August, Kesselring convinced Göring that the only sound strategy was to continue to send heavily escorted bombers to destroy British airfields. Kesselring also advocated the use of Jagdgeschwader (fighter wings) in free-chase tactics. Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engine fighters were to be sent out {{in advance of the}} main raids to force the British fighters into large-scale air battles which, in theory, would destroy RAF aircraft in combat and deplete the British defences. However, this time, Kesselring changed his operational methods. In consultation with Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3 (<b>Air</b> <b>Fleet</b> 3), he chose not to scatter his effort against a large number of targets. Instead, he narrowed down the targets to a short list in order to concentrate his strength and striking power. Sector stations RAF Kenley, North Weald, Hornchurch and Biggin Hill were chosen as the prime targets.|$|E
5|$|In April and May 1941, Fusō and Yamashiro were {{attached}} to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet, but the two ships {{spent most of the}} war around Japan, mostly at the anchorage at Hashirajima in Hiroshima Bay. When the war started for Japan on 8 December, the division sortied from Hashirajima to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the 1st <b>Air</b> <b>Fleet</b> attacking Pearl Harbor, and returned six days later. On 18 April 1942, they pursued but did not catch the American carrier force that had launched the Doolittle Raid. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time that}} most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E
