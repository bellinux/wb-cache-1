40|$|A way {{to avoid}} many of the {{difficulties}} encountered with conventional methods in D/A converters {{is to use a}} well-established technique called delta-sigma noise shaping steven. This technique will increase the resolution, however it will lead to increased complexity and thereby increased power consumption. The complexity of the global feedback loops might limit the clock speed of these converters. A new technique for Delta-Sigma A/D modulation is described. It describes a modulator with no global feedback loops and this method can be used in D/A conversion with some modifications. The emphases for this thesis is to design, simulate, implement and measure the new pipelined first order Δ-Σ digital to <b>analogue</b> <b>modulator.</b> Since this new modulator is mathematical equivalent with the conventional one there are no differences when simulating them. The difference is the higher oversampling ratios for the new pipelined modulator when the system is implemented. This difference is more evident when the modulator has a higher order...|$|E
40|$|The test of Sigma-Delta Analogue-to-Digital Converters (?? ADCs) is a {{difficult}} task due to the high resolution and {{the large number of}} samples required. By integrating an additional test circuitry in the chip and by taking advantage of the resources already existing in a ?? ADC, it is possible to perform a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) technique to make the converter auto-testable. In this paper we present an approach for both the on-chip test signal generation and the on-chip output response analysis. The method, mostly digital, is based on the application of a binary stream which encodes a sinusoidal signal. This stimulus is chosen to have a very high quality in the bandwidth of interest of the converter with the quantization error laying out of the <b>analogue</b> <b>modulator</b> bandwidth. In order to analyse the output response, we need a very precise sinusoidal signal. This reference signal can be also obtained from the same input stimulus, by passing it directly to the digital filter existing in the converter.

40|$|International audienceSigma–Delta (ΣΔ) {{modulators}} {{have made}} possible the design of high-resolution Analogue-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) with relaxed analogue circuitry precision by moving most of the design complexity to the digital domain. However, testing these ΣΔ ADCs is becoming a costly task due to trends towards high-resolution implementations and associated increase in samples required to extract key specifications. In this paper, we propose a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) technique for high-resolution ΣΔ ADCs. The technique, mostly digital, moves most of the test complexity to the digital domain, that is in-line with the philosophy of ΣΔ modulation. Both the test signal generation and the output response analysis are performed on-chip. The stimulus, a sinusoid encoded in a binary bit stream, is chosen to have very high quality in the bandwidth of the converter with the quantization error laying outside of the <b>analogue</b> <b>modulator's</b> bandwidth. For the output response analysis, a sine-wave fitting algorithm is implemented on chip. For this, a digital sinusoidal stimulus of a very high precision is needed as a reference signal. In this paper, we generate this reference signal from the same input stimulus, by passing it through the digital filter already existing in the converter. Simulations results show the capability of this technique to obtain measurements of the SNDR (Signal-to-Noise-plus-Distortion Ratio) for a 16 -bit audio ΣΔ ADC...|$|R

30|$|Bryostatins are marine natural {{products}} with chemical structure of macrolide lactones, {{one of a}} series of cyclic macrolides, isolated from Bryozoan Bugula neritina (Pettit, Herald, Doubek, Herald, Arnold, et al., 1982). The most frequently investigated substance is bryostatin- 1, which is a highly oxygenated macrolide with a polyacetate backbone (Davidson, Allen, Lim, Anderson, & Haygood, 2001). In vitro studies indicated that bryostatin- 1 and its synthetic <b>analogues</b> as <b>modulators</b> of protein kinase C (PKC) thus may play a crucial event in tumor promotion and as a potential drug for treatment of many diseases including cancer (Kollar et al., 2014). However, its use as a potential anthelmintic drug is still a matter of controversy and has not been extensively investigated. The present study was undertaken to demonstrate the direct effect of intravenously injected bryostatin- 1 on cuticular structure of Syphacia muris in experimentally infected rats. To the best of our knowledge, there is no available literature dealing with the assessment of the impact of bryostatins on Syphacia muris using scanning electron microscopy which could support our postulation.|$|R
40|$|Biodevice {{implants}} for telemetry {{are increasingly}} applied today in various areas applications. There are many examples such as; telemedicine, biotelemetry, health care, treatments for chronic diseases, epilepsy and blindness, {{all of which}} are using a wireless infrastructure environment. They use microelectronics technology for diagnostics or monitoring signals such as Electroencephalography or Electromyography. Conceptually the biodevices are defined as one of these technologies combined with transcutaneous wireless implant telemetry (TWIT). A wireless inductive coupling link is a common way for transferring the RF power and data, to communicate between a reader and a battery-less implant. Demand for higher data rate for the acquisition data returned from the body is increasing, and requires an efficient modulator to achieve high transfer rate and low power consumption. In such applications, Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation has advantages over other schemes, and double the symbol rate with respect to Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) over the same spectrum band. In contrast to <b>analogue</b> <b>modulators</b> for generating QPSK signals, where the circuit complexity and power dissipation are unsuitable for medical purposes, a digital approach has advantages. Eventually a simple design can be achieved by mixing the hardware and software to minimize size and power consumption for implantable telemetry applications. This work proposes a new approach to digital modulator techniques, applied to transcutaneous implantable telemetry applications; inherently increasing the data rate and simplifying the hardware design. A novel design for a QPSK VHDL modulator to convey a high data rate is demonstrated. Essentially, CPLD/FPGA technology is used to generate hardware from VHDL code, and implement the device which performs the modulation. This improves the data transmission rate between the reader and biodevice. This type of modulator provides digital synthesis and the flexibility to reconfigure and upgrade with the two most often languages used being VHDL and Verilog (IEEE Standard) being used as hardware structure description languages. The second objective of this thesis is to improve the wireless coupling power (WCP). An efficient power amplifier was developed and a new algorithm developed for auto-power control design at the reader unit, which monitors the implant device and keeps the device working within the safety regulation power limits (SAR). The proposed system design has also been modeled and simulated with MATLAB/Simulink to validate the modulator and examine the performance of the proposed modulator in relation to its specifications.

40|$|Wireless {{high-speed}} digital {{communications systems}} {{are becoming increasingly}} commonplace for both commercial and military applications. One {{of the most effective}} techniques for combating multipath interference is the multicarrier OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) scheme. However, the high PAPR (Peak-to-Average Power Ratio) of OFDM signals constitutes a problem when non-linear amplifiers are used. In this thesis the PAPR problem is introduced and the LINC (Linear Amplification with Nonlinear Components) technique is considered as a possible solution to counteract the PA (Power Amplifier) nonlinearity distortion. The proposed LINC technique can be implemented using DSP (Digital Signal Processing) techniques, has the potential of high IMD (Inter-modulation Distortion) suppression and it is unconditionally stable, which is a key advantage in broadband applications. It's well known that the unwanted imperfections like the I/Q (In-phase/Quadrature) imbalances present in the <b>analogue</b> IQ <b>modulators</b> in a direct conversion OFDM system contribute to a loss of orthogonality and create ICI (Inter-carrier Interference). These impairments can also severely reduce the efficiency of the LINC technique itself. This thesis investigates a digital compensation mechanism to reduce the IQ imbalance errors in the direct conversion OFDM LINC transmitter. The LINC technique is considered {{in the first part of}} this thesis as a possible linearisation technique to counteract the non-linear distortion caused by both the mixer and power amplifier in a single-carrier QPSK (Quaternary Phase Shift Keying) transmitter. Prototype systems for single-carrier QPSK transmitter and multi-carrier OFDM transmitter have been constructed to demonstrate the proposed method's capability...|$|R
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of kinesin Eg 5 by small molecules such as monastrol is currently evaluated as {{an approach to}} develop a novel class of antiproliferative drugs {{for the treatment of}} malignant tumours. Therefore, we studied the effects of the new monastrol analogues enastron, dimethylenastron and vasastrol VS- 83 on the proliferation of human glioblastoma cells in the kinetic crystal violet assay. Compared to monastrol, the new cell cycle specific compounds showed an at least one order of magnitude higher anti proliferative activity against U- 87 MG, U- 118 MG, and U- 373 MG glioblastoma cells. The compounds were neither inactivated by hydrolysis nor by binding to serum proteins. Moreover, we demonstrated the characteristic monoaster formation after incubation of cells with the new compounds by confocal laser scanning microscopy. We also showed that the arrangement of beta-actin and tubulin, vital components of the cyto-skeleton of mitotic and quiescent cells, were not affected by the new compounds. Due to the necessity of overcoming the blood-brain barrier in the treatment of brain tumours, we investigated if the new monastrol <b>analogues</b> are <b>modulators</b> or substrates of the p-glycoprotein (p-gp) 170 by a flow cytometric calcein-AM efflux assay.

40|$|No {{effective}} chemotherapy for {{the treatment}} of malignant brain tumors, especially glioblastoma, exists so far. Despite the progress in surgical techniques and advances in the irradiation treatment, the concomitant chemotherapy is essential for the prevention of relapse and of major importance for patient outcome. The introduction of temozolomide combined with radiation in clinical practice led to slightly improved long-term survival, but malignant gliomas remain resistant to cancer chemotherapy. Thus, new strategies {{for the treatment}} of brain tumors are still needed. Objectives of this work were the evaluation of the TmHU protein as siRNA transfection reagent (Chapter 2), investigations on new kinesin Eg 5 inhibitors, which specifically inhibit cell division during mitosis (Chapter 3), and the exploration of new tariquidar analogs as ABCB 1 and ABCG 2 inhibitors (Chapter 4). Due to the selective down-regulation of oncogene expression by small interfering RNA, siRNAs are considered as promising anticancer agents allowing the selective killing of tumor cells. The suitability of the non-toxic TmHU protein as siRNA transfection reagent was explored in vitro and in vivo in order to investigate the down-regulation of gene expression in human glioblastoma cells. The efficient transfection of the cancer cells is a prerequisite for this new concept, and, therefore, reliable in vitro and in vivo models were developed for the proof of principle. A suitable and convenient in vitro method was established for the quick detection of siRNA effects on the EGFP or DsRed 2 expression, respectively, with respect to total cell number by using a fluorescence plate reader. In order to study siRNA effects in vivo subcutaneous tumor models were established in nude mice and two fluorescence detection methods were evaluated. The fluorescence intensity was quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy of paraffin embedded tumor sections and by in vivo imaging. In preliminary tests with micro-osmotic pumps the continuous release of a suspension and the practicability of subcutaneous implantation were assured. Unfortunately, the established in vivo methods could not be used for the intended investigations on TmHU because this protein was not suitable for siRNA transfection. Nevertheless, these methods are recommendable for the investigation of promising in vivo transfection reagents. The inhibition of kinesin Eg 5 by small molecules such as monastrol is currently evaluated as an approach to develop a novel class of antiproliferative drugs {{for the treatment of}} malignant tumors. Therefore, the effects of new monastrol analogs on the proliferation of human U- 87 MG, U- 118 MG, and U- 373 MG glioblastoma cells were investigated. Compared to monastrol, the new cell cycle specific compounds showed an at least one order of magnitude higher antiproliferative activity. The compounds were neither inactivated by hydrolysis nor by binding to serum proteins. Due to the necessity of overcoming the blood�brain barrier (BBB) in the treatment of brain tumors, it was investigated if the new monastrol <b>analogues</b> are <b>modulators</b> or substrates of the ABCB 1 transporter by a flow cytometric calcein-AM efflux assay. The tested compounds showed no modulating effects on the ABCB 1 function. With respect to the treatment of primary and secondary CNS tumors, the results suggest that the new monastrol analogs represent an interesting class of potential anticancer drugs, predicted to be less neurotoxic in comparison to classical tubulin inhibitors. The efflux of cytostatics due to expression of ABC transporters such as ABCB 1 and ABCG 2 at the BBB leads to extremely low drug concentrations in the brain and is therefore a major limitation in cancer chemotherapy. A strategy to overcome the BBB is the administration of an efflux inhibitor in combination with a cytostatic. The 3 rd generation inhibitor tariquidar led to better brain/plasma ratios of paclitaxel but could not increase the paclitaxel brain levels compared to co-administration of the 2 nd generation inhibitor valspodar. The very high tariquidar brain levels indicate that the very lipophilic tariquidar is trapped in the lipid compartment of the brain. Aiming at tariquidar analogs with improved solubility and pharmacokinetics, more hydrophilic analogs were synthesized. The compounds were investigated on ABCB 1 overexpressing Kb-V 1 and ABCG 2 overexpressing MCF- 7 /Topo cells for inhibitory activity and for cytotoxicity, alone and in combination with cytostatics. Surprisingly, slight structural modifications resulted in ABCG 2 selective inhibitors. Three analogs have IC 50 values of 55, 100, and 154 nM, comparable with the most potent reported ABCG 2 inhibitor Ko 143. Some ABCG 2 inhibitors showed specific toxicity which could be advantageous regarding the treatment of brain tumors. These very potent and selective ABCG 2 inhibitors should be useful pharmacological tools for in vitro and in vivo investigations...|$|R
