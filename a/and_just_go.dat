However, when asked about it in an interview with Scuzz TV, Anselmo said that [...] "It would be too pretentious, we try not to think as far ahead as that, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> with what we feel at the time."

500|$|The team {{wanted to}} avoid {{punishing}} the player for applying everyday logic in Maniac Mansion. Fox noted that one Sierra game features {{a scene in which}} the player, without prior warning, may encounter a game over screen simply by picking up a shard of glass. He characterized such game design as [...] "sadistic", and he commented, [...] "I know that in the real world I can successfully pick up a broken piece of mirror without dying". Because of the project's nonlinear puzzle design, the team struggled to prevent no-win scenarios, in which the player unexpectedly became unable to complete the game. As a result of this problem, Gilbert later explained, [...] "We were constantly fighting against the desire just to rip out all the endings <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> with three characters, or even sometimes just one character". Lucasfilm Games had only one playtester, and many dead-ends went undetected as a result. Further playtesting was provided by Gilbert's uncle, to whom Gilbert mailed a floppy disk of the game's latest version each week.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with British radio station XFM, Björk explained its recording process, saying work on [...] "Oceania" [...] was kept being delayed {{because she wanted to}} do it especially for the Olympics. During the last day of mixing, she thought she needed [...] "sirenes", like in Greek mythology. She called up an English choir to record these sounds. The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play, and she got them to sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as [...] "the new bright hope of the hip hop scene". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, [...] "That was the most fun part, in the end. Sometimes it's good for you to work with a gun against your head <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> for it, because you can sometimes sit too long with ideas. Sometimes adrenaline is a good thing." ...|$|E
500|$|A few modern video gaming {{websites}} reviewed Ninja GaidenIII {{upon its}} release to the Virtual Console in 2008. Nintendo Life's Damien McFerran gave lackluster ratings, {{saying that the}} game [...] "passed under the radar of many a videogame enthusiast". He added that while the presentation was great, he pointed out flaws in the [...] "silly" [...] plot, the inconsistently laid-out level designs, and frustrating difficulty {{in addition to the}} five-continue limit. He said that many gamers would prefer the previous two Ninja Gaiden titles over this one. IGN's Lucas Thomas appreciated the improvement in Ryu's ability to scale and climb on top of walls, his ability to hang overhead, good storyline, and the new items such as the Dragon Sword power-up and the Vacuum Wave. His chief criticism was the game's difficulty, saying that it's not the [...] "rewarding kind of difficult" [...] but instead [...] "the cheap, annoying kind of difficult that makes you want to throw your controller at the TV screen <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> read a book". As with the Nintendo Life review, Thomas similarly criticized the inconsistent level design as well as a storyline which becomes progressively more bizarre, including [...] "weird science-fiction themes about bionics and clones".|$|E

500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later {{to wake up to}} the emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Marceline is {{voiced by}} Olivia Olson. Olivia's father Martin Olson was an {{acquaintance}} of Ward, and Olivia was encouraged to audition for Adventure Time after Ward told her father that he wanted [...] "her as a voice" [...] on his show. She had originally auditioned {{for the role of}} Princess Bubblegum. After her initial audition, she was asked to read for the role of Marceline, and was [...] "definitely impressed by the character" [...] after seeing design drawings. Martin Olson later noted that Olivia's audition was a [...] "sham" [...] to please the network executives because Ward had already wanted her to be a voice on the show. In order to get into character, Olson often dresses {{in a manner similar to}} Marceline when she records her lines; she explained, [...] "I always find ... that on the days that I go in to record Marceline, I’ll dress like her, in a weird way ... I’ll throw on some rock n’ roll boots, maybe some red lipstick, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> in there." [...] Olson also is the character's singing voice. According to storyboard artist Cole Sanchez, composers Casey James Basichis and Tim Kiefer produce the bass music that the character performs in the series. Many of the songs written for Marceline were uploaded onto the internet by the writers as well as the production company. For instance, Rob Sugar—the father of former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar—often uploaded demos of songs written for Marceline by Rebecca. Furthermore, Frederator also posted demos, as well as a full version of the popular [...] "Fry Song", sung by Marceline in the episode [...] "It Came from the Nightosphere", on its official blog. In flashback sequences, younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres. In the fifth season episodes [...] "Finn the Human" [...] / [...] "Jake the Dog", an older, alternate universe version of the character is voiced by Cloris Leachman. Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline's demonic father Hunson Abadeer. Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was [...] "pretty cool”.|$|E
500|$|Steve DeBerg won the {{starting}} quarterback job over Steve Young in the preseason, but lost it after throwing seven interceptions in the season opener against the San Francisco 49ers, and another two the next week against the Minnesota Vikings. Nose tackle Dave Logan summed up the team's condition after the 49ers game by saying, [...] "the teams we play do not respect us". [...] Players coming from winning teams to the Buccaneers, such as Marvin Powell and Tyrone Keys, found themselves shocked by the constant losing and discouraged by the team's easy acceptance of losses. Keys in particular thought that the Buccaneers were too used to losing, and not bothered by it. Young later criticized the team's will to win, saying that [...] "if they could hide for four quarters <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> home, they would be happy". Powell, one of the highest-paid offensive linemen in the league, was placed on injured reserve {{with a knee injury}} after only a few games. An embarrassing loss to the New Orleans Saints was followed by the release of Jimmie Giles and Kevin House, the top two receivers in Buccaneer history at the time, and former starting fullback Ron Springs. This upset several club veterans, and weakened an offense that already had to compensate for a defense that had allowed over 1,000 rushing yards in the previous four games. League perception was that the Buccaneers were replacing older veterans with younger players who were incapable of taking their places. Said an executive from another team of Giles' replacement, [...] "Calvin Magee runs a 5.2 40...We wouldn't even bring him into camp". Rumors, denied by Culverhouse, began to circulate that secret meetings were being held to arrange replacing Bennett with Steve Spurrier. Nathan Wonsley, the rookie free-agent running back whose play {{was one of the few}} bright spots in the season, was lost to the team after suffering dislocated neck vertebrae during a week 10 loss to the Chicago Bears. After the abnormally large number of injuries suffered during the Bears game, the Buccaneers ended their pattern of suffering fourth-quarter collapses in close games, instead losing their last seven games by an average of over 21 points. With Jerry Bell, a tight end who played a [...] "U-back" [...] position that was crucial to Tampa Bay's running game, suffering a broken ankle in the same game, the Buccaneers were forced to re-sign Ron Springs just to have enough runners in their backfield. Culverhouse, saying that he had made the decision only minutes prior, fired Bennett at a press conference on Dec. 29. Bennett, who had spoken to Culverhouse earlier the same morning, was unaware that he was to be let go. Culverhouse met with Ray Perkins and offered him the Tampa Bay coaching job only hours after firing Bennett. The firing was criticized by some, who felt that no steps were being taken to address the front-office problems that were the real root of the Buccaneers' woes. This criticism was echoed by safety David Greenwood, by then with the Packers, who pointed out the team's cheapness by recounting a 1985 incident in which he wanted to keep a football as a game ball after catching it for an interception. Executive Phil Krueger demanded that Greenwood pay $35 for the football.|$|E
