5|$|A {{combination}} of Federal and State funding was obtained, {{and despite the}} controversy over the number of stops and route, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 27, 1972 at Second Avenue and 103rd Street. Construction began shortly thereafter on what was to be the 99th–105th Streets segment, which was projected to cost $17.48 million (worth about $ today). However, the city soon experienced its most dire fiscal crisis yet, due to the stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs, and in September 1975 construction on the line stopped, and the tunnels were sealed. Over the next few decades, the MTA regularly inspected and maintained the tunnel segments (spending $20,000 a year by the early 1990s), to maintain the structural integrity of the streets above, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>case</b> construction would ever resume. Trespassers would often camp in the tunnels until the MTA increased security.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Constitutional Remedies {{empowers}} {{citizens to}} approach the Supreme Court of India to seek enforcement, or protection against infringement, of their Fundamental Rights. Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy, {{in the form of}} a Fundamental Right itself, for enforcement of all the other Fundamental Rights, and the Supreme Court is designated as the protector of these rights by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has been empowered to issue writs, namely habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto, for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights, while the High Courts have been empowered under Article 226 – which is not a Fundamental Right in itself – to issue these prerogative writs even in cases not involving the violation of Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to enforce the Fundamental Rights even against private bodies, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>case</b> of any violation, award compensation as well to the affected individual. Exercise of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court can also be suo motu or on the basis of a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that adjudicator identity is a key determinant of outcomes in refugee claims. This article examines the impact of adjudicator gender. Using data on over 65, 000 Canadian refugee determinations from 2004 to 2008, the article reveals that male adjudicators have slightly higher grant rates than female adjudicators. Moreover, this difference in grant rates is more pronounced <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> involving female principal applicants <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> involving gender-based persecution. Despite the overall trend, however, female adjudicators with prior experience in women’s rights had higher average grant rates overall, <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> involving female claimants, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> involving gender-based persecution.

25|$|The Presidency armies were {{abolished}} with {{effect from}} 1 April 1895 by a notification of the Government of India through Army Department Order Number 981 dated 26 October 1894, unifying the three Presidency armies into a single Indian Army. The armies were amalgamated into four commands, Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western. The Indian Army, like the Presidency armies, continued to provide armed support to the civil authorities, both in combating banditry <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>case</b> of riots and rebellion. One of the first external operations the new unified army faced was the Boxer Rebellion in China from 1899 to 1901.|$|E

Conditions at the facility were occasionally insufficient and the hospital failed an initial inspection before opening on January 13, 1915.

25|$|Those {{who wish}} to do this {{therefore}} separate themselves from the world and live as monastics: monks and nuns. As ascetics par excellence, using the allegorical weapons of prayer and fasting in spiritual warfare against their passions, monastics hold a very special and important place in the Church. This kind of life is often seen as incompatible {{with any kind of}} worldly activity including that which is normally regarded as virtuous. Social work, school teaching, and other such work is therefore usually left to laypeople. Ascetics of the Orthodox Church are recognized by their long hair, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>case</b> of male monks, long beards.|$|E

However, consensus was sought in joint committees, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>case</b> of disagreements, a committee was set to reconcile the differences between the versions passed by different chambers. Any bill affecting the privileges of an estate could be passed only with the consent of that estate. All four chambers had to agree in order to modify constitutional laws.|$|E
