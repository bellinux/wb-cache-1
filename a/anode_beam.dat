40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} from a theoretical {{point of view}} the impact of varying bath temperature, excess AlF 3 and alumina concentration on cell resistance and cell control. The results are interpreted using knowledge {{of the behavior of}} general resistance and <b>anode</b> <b>beam</b> controllers to study the influence on the anode cathode distance. This again leads to the proposal of a new control strategy for bath temperature and excess AlF 3. The theoretical results obtained are supported using real data...|$|E
40|$|The {{injector}} for {{the second}} axis of the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrotest Facility (DARHT) is being designed and constructed at LBNL. The injector consists of a single gap diode extracting 2 {micro}s, 2 kA, 3. 2 MeV electron beam from a 6. 5 inches diameter thermionic dispenser cathode. The injector is powered through a ceramic column by a Marx generator. We also investigated the possibility of extracting a beam current of 4 kA. The focusing system for the electron beam consists of a Pierce electrostatic focusing electrode at the cathode and three solenoidal focusing magnets positioned between the anode and induction accelerator input. The off-energy components (beam-head) during the 400 ns energy rise time are overfocused, leading to beam envelope mismatch and growth resulting {{in the possibility of}} beam hitting the accelerator tube walls. The anode focusing magnets can be tuned to avoid the beam spill in the 2 kA case. To allow beam-head control for the 4 kA case we are considering the introduction of time-varying magnetic focusing field along the accelerator axis generated by a single-loop solenoid magnet positioned in the <b>anode</b> <b>beam</b> tube. We will present the beam-head dynamics calculations as well as the solenoid design and preliminary feasibility test results...|$|E

40|$|A new {{cascaded}} arc containing {{three separate}} discharge channels at 15 mm distance {{from each other}} was constructed to produce intense and wide hydrogen plasma beams and first tests were carried out at Pilot-PSI. Current and voltage measurements as well as calorimetry on the cooling water of the source demonstrated that these channels operated independently. Thomson scattering measurements showed that, depending on the nozzle geometry, the three outputs merge to one beam if the source is operated at argon in magnetic fields up to 1. 6 T densities. In hydrogen operation, the individual outputs did not merge or interact. Also a first test was performed in argon {{on the use of}} a remote ring <b>anode</b> to induce <b>beam</b> mixing due to rotation driven by cross-B currents. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

The LAPD is a linear device, which produces a highly magnetized quiescent plasma, capable of supporting Alfvén waves. A schematic of the machine {{is shown in the}} figure below. The plasma is formed by a pulsed discharge (Id ≃ 3. 5 kA) between cathode and <b>anode.</b> The electron <b>beam</b> thus formed collisionally ionizes the fill gas (Helium).

40|$|In the article, {{results of}} {{numerical}} simulation {{of the gun}} with the cusp of magnetic field are presented. Short pulse version of the gun with explosion emission is investigated. Some preliminary analytical estimation of the beam and gun parameters are performed. Then, numerical optimization of the electrodes shape as well as magnetic field distribution is carried out. For preliminary separation of electrons and formation of the rectilinear <b>beam,</b> <b>anode</b> diaphragm is installed. After then, additional selection of electrons for decreasing the ripple is performed. For this purpose, channel walls are used for interception of {{some part of the}} electron beam. Reverse of the magnetic field in the diode part of the gun is formed. So, the formation of the rectilinear beam is combined with the region, where electrons obtain initial gyration energy. To prevent the disperse action of the own beam space charge forces, the system with big gradient of magnetic field (about 0. 5 - 1 kGs/mm) is needed. According to results of the simulation, helical electron beam can be performed even at total compression ratio about 1000 and current density more than 50 kA/cm 2. The designed electron gun provides acceptable performance for the large orbit gyrotron, such as operating current close to 300 A, the pitch-factor value about 1. 5 - 1. 7, deviation of the guiding centers from the axis (the ripple) / 10 and / 6 for operation on 3 -rd and 5 -th cyclotron harmonic correspondingly (wavelength = 0. 5 and 0. 3 mm) and velocity spread within the range 10 - 15 %...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in cold cathode field emitters have produced improvements in emission efficiency and thus enhanced {{the applicability of}} such devices. This article considers heat-ing due to electron field emission from a polycrystalline diamond cathode. Temperature measurements from infrared thermography reveal highly localized heating due to nonuni-form emission from the cathode. Power dissipation of 0. 36 W produces a peak temperature increase of 12. 5 K on the back surface of the water-cooled anode. Parameter estimation techniques are employed to predict the effective size of the heat source and the fraction of total power that is dissipated near hot spots. The estimates indicate effective heated radii of order 1 mm and power fractions {{in the range of}} 25 % to 50 %. Keywords electron field emission, <b>anode</b> heating, electron <b>beam</b> Significant progress has been achieved in recent years in the creation of electron field emission devices with reduced turn-on voltages and increased current density. Much of this progress is a consequence of novel materials and synthesis techniques that en-able the fabrication of nanometer-scale features to produce extremely large electric-field enhancement. Applications for these new devices include electron sources for flat-panel displays, power diodes, and microwave circuit components. The large local current den-sities and (still) relatively large operating voltages of these devices cause substantial local heating of the anode. In the present work, anode heating due to electron emission from a polycrystalline diamond cathode is studied experimentally to determine the magnitude and localization of heating in a practical configuration. Electron field emission has been studied for nearly the past one hundred years. Fowler and Nordheim [1] first developed a theory for the electron tunnelling mechanis...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{changing}} the separation grid bias in a double plasma device from - 50 V to the same bias as the anode in the source chamber, 115 V on the plasma and beam parameters downstream in the target chamber. Two different probes were {{used to analyze the}} downstream plasma. We used an RFEA-probe to obtain information about the ions, such as the ion energy distribution and we constructed a Langmuir-probe in order to measure the temperatures, densities and plasma potentials in the new configuration. We performed measurements with the RFEA-probe for both configurations and found that the beam density is reduced by 80 % at the higher pressures and that the induced background plasma potentials increases from 42 V to 104 V with a corresponding reduction of beam energy. We also found that the background plasma density increased twofold {{as a result of the}} change. The Langmuir plasma potentials closely matched the beam potentials detected with the RFEA probe, rather than the detected plasma potentials, and this discrepancy indicates that the Langmuir plasma potentials are not accurate for the new configuration. Further the Langmuir probe measurements provided electron temperature measurements in the range of 2 - 5 eV at radial positions within the grid aperture, and densities ranging from 5 e+ 15 /m^ 3 at the lowest pressure to 9 e+ 15 /m^ 3 highest pressure at the 0 cm radial position. It was also found that it is possible to detect an electron beam when the separation grid was biased at the <b>anode</b> potential. This <b>beam</b> has a peak energy that approaches the anode-cathode potential difference as the pressure decreases and can possibly represent a means of detecting how effective the discharge current from the filaments in the source is at ionizing the neutral argon atoms in the source. These electron beams were only visible at the far edge of the grid aperture. Uneven structures in the radial density distributions of the ions beams were detected, with the largest ion beam densities being found at the far edge of the aperture. These increased densities are thought to be caused by an uneven distribution of filaments in the source. This uneven distribution also serves as a possible explanation as to why we only found the electron beam on the far side of the grid...|$|R
