40|$|This article {{deals with}} an {{investigation}} into the specification and use of appropriate seating systems to reduce whole-body vibration (WBV) exposure in typical vehicles used in the SA mining industry. The EU Directive EU/ 44 / 2002 to be legislated in 2005 in European countries, provides legal and economic motivation for this project. The criteria for seat selection can be condensed to the requirements in the directive, which mandates an action level of 0. 5 m/s 2 and a vibration exposure limit of 1. 15 m/s 2 for an equivalent 8 -hour daily exposure period. As part of this study six suspension seats, which the manufacturers claim satisfy the requirements in ISO 70966, were tested to determine the most suitable seat for an <b>articulated</b> <b>dump</b> <b>truck.</b> Six test subjects, three 'light' and three 'heavy' as specified in ISO 70966, were used to estimate the seat transmissibility functions in the vertical direction of the six different suspension seats. Transmissibility functions were measured in the laboratory with two excitation levels of 1 m/s 2 and 2 m/s 2 r. m. s. in the 0. 5 - 30 Hz frequency range, as well as one spectrum approximating the EM 5 spectral class. SEAT values were calculated for road vibration data measured on a typical <b>articulated</b> <b>dump</b> <b>truck.</b> A set of seat selection guidelines that can be followed by vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, procurement officers and and the technical staff on a mine is proposed in this article. It is recommended that additional studies of the use and operating conditions of seating systems in the SA industry, as well as an epidemiological survey be commissioned to gather additional information on this subject. © The South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2005.

40|$|The {{ride and}} {{directional}} stability properties of an articulated frame steer vehicle (ASV) are investigated through formulation {{of a comprehensive}} three-dimensional vehicle model. The model integrates a kineto-dynamic formulation of the frame steering system, a torsio-elastic rear axle suspension, and random roughness of two parallel terrain tracks. The validity of the model is illustrated {{on the basis of}} the field-measured ride vibration data and steering strut responses to a 90 -degree-turn manoeuvre. The model is applied to determine the ride and yaw/roll dynamic responses of an <b>articulated</b> <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> with and without a rear-axle suspension under steady and transient steering inputs. The ride responses are evaluated in terms of weighted and un-weighted rms accelerations at the operator location, while the directional responses are obtained in terms of static and dynamic rollover thresholds, rearward amplification ratio, and critical speed corresponding to snaking instability. The results suggest that the rear-axle torsio-elastic suspension yields slightly lower yaw and roll stability limit of the vehicle but substantial reductions in the ride vibration levels. Tyre interactions with the rough terrains affect the stability limits in a highly adverse manner. The results suggest that suspension design with greater lateral and torsional stiffness could yield enhanced directional stability limits while preserving the ride performance...|$|E

In the simulation, the four-wheel slip rate was 0. 08 and the steering system of the truck was stable. The results verify that the equal-slip control strategy makes better use of the ground adhesion coefficient, is able to reasonably distribute drive power, notably reduces tire wear, and improves the use of driving power...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. In this {{document}} the reduced order simulation and optimisation of the passive suspension systems of a locally produced forty ton <b>articulated</b> <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> is discussed. The linearization of the suspension parameters were validated using {{two and three}} dimensional MATLAB models. A 24 degree-of-freedom, three dimensional ADAMS/VIEW model with linear parameters was developed and compared to measured data {{as well as with}} simulation results from a more complex 50 degree-of-freedom non-linear ADAMS/CAR model. The ADAMS/VIEW model correlated in some aspects better with the experimental data than an existing higher order ADAMS/CAR model and was used in the suspension system optimisation study. The road profile over which the vehicle was to prove its comfort was generated, from a spatial PSD (Power Spectral Density), to be representative of a typical haul road. The weighted RMS (Root Mean Squared) and VDV (Vibration Dose Value) values are used in the objective function for the optimisation study. The optimisation was performed by four different algorithms and an improvement of 30 % in ride comfort for the worst axis was achieved on the haul road. The improvement was realised by softening the struts and tires and hardening the cab mounts. The results were verified by simulating the optimised truck on different road surfaces and comparing the relative improvements with the original truck’s performance...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Pazooki Alireza, Ph. D. Concordia University, 2012 Articulated frame steer {{vehicles}} (ASVs), widely {{employed in}} different off-road sectors, are generally unsuspended vehicles. Owning to their complex operating environment, high mass center, relatively soft and large diameter tires, wide load variations and load distribution, and kineto-dynamics {{of the frame}} steering mechanism, these vehicles transmit higher magnitudes of low frequency whole-body vibration (WBV) to the operators and also exhibit lower roll and directional stability limits. While the superior performance potentials of axle suspension in limiting the WBV exposure have been clearly demonstrated, the implementations in ASVs have been limited due to the complex design challenges associated with conflicting requirements posed by the ride and roll/directional stability requirements. Growing concerns on human driver comfort and safety, and increasing demands for higher speed ASVs such as <b>articulated</b> <b>dump</b> <b>trucks,</b> however, call for alternate suspension designs for realizing an improved compromise between the ride and stability performance. This dissertation research is aimed at analysis of a torsio-elastic axle suspension concept for achieving improve ride, while preserving the directional stability limits of the ASV. For this purpose a comprehensive three-dimensional model of the articulated frame steer vehicles is developed for design {{and analysis of the}} proposed axle suspension concept. The model is formulated considering a three-dimensional tire model, tire lag, coherent right- and left-terrain track roughness, and kinematics and dynamics of the steering struts. Field measurements were performed to characterize the ride properties of a conventional forestry skidder and that of a skidder retrofitted with the rear-axle torsio-elastic suspension under different load conditions. The measured data were analyzed to assess the ride performance potential of the suspension and to examine validity of the simulation model. Both the field measured and simulation results revealed that the proposed suspension could yield significant reductions in the magnitudes of vibration transmitted to the operator location, irrespective of the load and speed conditions. A simple yaw-plane model of the vehicle is also formulated to study the role of steering system design including the steering valve flows, kineto-dynamics of the steering struts and leakage flows on the snaking stability limits of the ASV. The results showed that the critical speeds are strongly dependent upon the kineto-dynamics of the articulated steering system. The comprehensive three-dimensional model subsequently used for analysis of integrated ride and roll/directional stability limits of the vehicle and the axle suspension designs. The stability performance measures are defined to assess the vehicle stability limits under steady as well as transient directional maneuvers. The results show that the proposed rear-axle suspension deteriorates the stability performance only slightly, irrespective of the load condition. It is concluded that the proposed suspension concept could yield a very good compromise in ride and stability performance. The proposed model could serve as an effective and efficient tool for integrated ride and handling analysis and to seek primary suspension designs for an improved compromise between the ride and stability performance of ASVs. ...|$|R

40|$|MScEngThis project {{entails the}} design and {{development}} of a new 2 -DOF <b>articulated</b> <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> (ADT) suspension seat. A study of the ADT vibration environment was conducted using data measured with accelerometers inside the cabin. With the system’s required operational capabilities determined, the concept design phase resulted in a feasible concept. The first prototype was manufactured based on the initial set of specifications. A variety of numerical modelling techniques were used to analyse and evaluate the seat’s dynamic response. Vertical and lateral laboratory tests of the suspension seat with human occupants were completed. The vertical lumped parameter model of the suspension seat with a human occupant gave good correlation with the laboratory measured frequency response. A broad band input signal, and not the ISO 7096 (2000) EM 1 signal, was used to obtain the frequency response used to verify the lumped parameter model. The SEAT values for the ISO 7096 (2000) EM 1 signal and various ADT road conditions were calculated using the lumped parameter models for a small, medium and large subject, the same three subjects used in the laboratory tests. SEAT values using the ISO 7096 (2000) EM 1 signal of 0. 94, 0. 93 and 0. 88 were obtained for the small, medium and large subjects. The lowest SEAT values obtained using the road data were 0. 63, 0. 56 and 0. 48 for the small, medium and large subjects. The transmissibility curves determined from the lateral laboratory tests were used to calculate the SEAT values for the lateral ADT cabin vibrations. The lowest SEAT values obtained were 0. 83, 0. 83 and 0. 82 obtained for the small, medium and large subjects. After all the results from the testing and modelling were evaluated the design was assessed. All the data and information collected was used as input for the design of a second prototype, which was not manufactured. Not all the set specifications were achieved for the first prototype, but the new suspension seat gave comparable vertical vibration isolation performance to that of expensive commercially available ADT suspension seats. The lateral suspension demonstrated good lateral vibration isolation and is a feature not currently available in current ADT suspension seats...|$|E
