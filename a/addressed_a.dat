5|$|Wallace (1973) <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} {{criticisms of the}} {{committee}} including that it provides too little information on the reasons for rarity rejection.

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Sherman {{began to take}} {{a larger role in}} politics. In 1844, he <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> {{political}} rally on behalf of the Whig candidate for president that year, Henry Clay. Four years later, Sherman was a delegate to the Whig National Convention where the eventual winner Zachary Taylor was nominated. As with most conservative Whigs, Sherman supported the Compromise of 1850 as the best solution to the growing sectional divide. In 1852, Sherman was again a delegate to the Whig National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Winfield Scott, against rivals Daniel Webster and incumbent Millard Fillmore, who had become president following Taylor's death.|$|E
5|$|At the {{national}} convention of 1856, Stone presented {{a new strategy}} suggested by Antoinette Brown Blackwell to send a memorial to the various state legislatures signed by the officers of the National Woman’s Rights Convention. Antoinette Brown had married Samuel Charles Blackwell on January 24, 1856, becoming Stone's sister-in-law in the process. Stone, Brown Blackwell and Ernestine Rose were appointed a committee {{to carry out the}} plan. Stone drafted and printed the appeal, and Brown Blackwell mailed it to twenty-five state legislatures. Indiana and Pennsylvania referred the memorial to select committees, while both Massachusetts and Maine granted hearings. On March 6, 1857, Stone, Wendell Phillips and James Freeman Clarke addressed the Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts senate, and on March 10, Stone and Phillips <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> select committee of the Maine legislature.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} compares {{prosodic}} features of child-directed speech (CDS) and foreigner-directed speech (FDS), to exam-ine whether FDS is a derivative of CDS as suggested in socio-linguistic studies. Twelve female speakers completed a simple referential communication task <b>addressed</b> to <b>an</b> imaginary adult, an imaginary foreigner, and an imaginary child. The results showed that, {{compared to the}} adult-directed baseline (ADS), participants increased pitch range and f 0 maxi-ma when <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> child, but not when <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> for-eigner. Furthermore, participants lowered their speech rate when addressing interlocutors with limited linguistic capacity, but did so differentially: Participants tended to lengthen pauses when <b>addressing</b> <b>an</b> imaginary foreigner, and tended to lengthen segments when <b>addressing</b> <b>an</b> imaginary child. These {{findings suggest that the}} prosodic features of CDS and FDS are different, and that speakers have acquired knowl-edge about how to fine-tune their prosodic adjustments to the specific needs of different interlocutors. 1...|$|R

5|$|Fearful {{of arrest}} as a rebel once {{he left the}} Senate, Benjamin quickly {{departed}} Washington for New Orleans. On the day of Benjamin's resignation, the Provisional Confederate States Congress gathered in Montgomery, Alabama, and soon chose Davis as president. Davis {{was sworn in as}} provisional Confederate States President on February 18, 1861. At home in New Orleans for, it would prove, the last time, Benjamin <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> rally on Washington's Birthday, February 22, 1861. On February 25, Davis appointed Benjamin, still in New Orleans, as attorney general; the Louisianan was approved immediately and unanimously by the provisional Congress. Davis thus became the first chief executive in North America to appoint a Jew to his Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E

5|$|On {{his trip}} to Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. The {{president}} was given a full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet ministers who lined up {{to shake his hand}} were right-wingers of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker's visit was the first by a head of state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had paid a visit to Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> joint session of the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded that honor.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between May and July 1108, Henry <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> writ to Urse and the Bishop of Worcester from Reading. The royal {{document}} {{commanded the}} sheriff not summon the shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary nor that he summon them on dates {{other than those}} normal for such courts. From this, the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then fining {{those who did not}} attend. The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear what types of cases and the type of procedure {{that could be used in}} what type of case.|$|E
5|$|Urse was an {{assistant}} to William II's main minister, Ranulf Flambard, and frequently served as a royal judge. The historian Emma Mason argues that Urse, along with Flambard, Robert Fitzhamon, Roger Bigod, Haimo the dapifer, or seneschal, and Eudo, another dapifer, were the first recognisable barons of the Exchequer. During his absence from England, the king <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> number of writs to Urse, along with Haimo, Eudo, and Robert Bloet, ordering them to enforce William's decisions in England. The historian Francis West, who studied {{the office of the}} justiciarship, asserts that Haimo, Eudo, and Urse, along with Flambard, could be considered the first English justiciars.|$|E

5|$|Despite the honours and {{financial}} security she enjoyed, Catherine was preoccupied with reuniting with her children. Intent on finding {{a proxy for}} negotiations with the Sublime Porte, as well as obtaining resources for their release, she turned to Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, on 23 July 1470. On 11 February 1474, she <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> letter to the Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, asking him to help her reach the Ottoman border and enter negotiations. Sforza obliged. In the summer of 1474, the Queen was in Novi, a city in her family's possession. She was accompanied by her brother Vlatko's wife, Margarita Marzano, and probably wanted Vlatko's help in establishing contact with their younger half-brother, Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, who had converted to Islam and become an Ottoman statesman. Whether she succeeded in that endeavor is not clear, {{but in any case}} she failed to reunite with either of her children. They both followed in their uncle's footsteps, becoming Muslims and, in Sigismund's case, also attaining high-ranking posts in the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Further details {{concerning}} Sejanus' fall {{are provided}} by Cassius Dio, writing nearly 200 years later in his Roman History. It appears that, when Tiberius heard to what extent Sejanus had already usurped his authority in Rome, he immediately took steps to remove him from power. However, he realised that an outright condemnation could provoke Sejanus to attempt a coup. Instead, Tiberius <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> number of contradictory letters to the Senate, some of which praised Sejanus and his friends and some of which denounced them. Tiberius variously {{announced that he would}} arrive in Rome the next day or that he was at the point of death. He stepped down as consul, forcing Sejanus to do the same and conferred an honorary priesthood upon Caligula, rekindling popular support for the house of Germanicus. The ensuing confusion was successful in alienating Sejanus from many of his followers. With the intentions of the emperor no longer clear, it was now deemed a safer course of action at Rome to withdraw from overt support to Sejanus until the matter was clearly settled.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, {{and other}} {{civil rights activists}} founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

One of the group's inspirations was the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King after he attended a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> national audience. Other civil rights leaders involved in the SCLC with King included: James Bevel, Allen Johnson, Curtis W. Harris, Walter E. Fauntroy, C. T. Vivian, Andrew Young, The Freedom Singers, Charles Evers, Cleveland Robinson, Randolph Blackwell, Annie Bell Robinson Devine, Charles Kenzie Steele, Alfred Daniel Williams King, Benjamin Hooks, Aaron Henry and Bayard Rustin.|$|E
