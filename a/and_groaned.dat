500|$|Historian George Herring {{argues that}} Adams {{was the most}} independent-minded of the founders. Though he aligned with the Federalists, he was {{somewhat}} a party unto himself, disagreeing with the Federalists {{as much as he}} did the Democratic-Republicans. He was often described as [...] "prickly", but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition. Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as Adams himself admitted in his old age: [...] " [...] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, <b>and</b> <b>groaned,</b> and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore." [...] Adams' resolve to advance peace with France, rather than to continue hostilities, especially reduced his popularity. This {{played an important role in}} his reelection defeat, however he was so pleased with the outcome that he had it engraved on his tombstone. Adams spent much of his term at home in Massachusetts, ignoring the details of political patronage nursed by other office holders.|$|E

The {{structure was}} extremely sturdy, but it complained continually under its burden of heavy equipment and material. The ground level floor was concrete slab. [...] Over time, the interior walls became {{a hodgepodge of}} Transite, Masonite, and gypsum wallboard as various occupants grew, shrank, or repurposed their spaces.|$|E
2500|$|According to Vig, {{the team}} drew {{inspiration}} for {{its name from}} a hostile early comment, when {{a friend of the}} band heard recording material, probably for [...] "Vow" [...] <b>and</b> <b>groaned,</b> [...] "This shit sounds like garbage!" [...] However, according to This Is The Noise That keeps Me Awake, an autobiography of the band, Vig wrote in his 1993 studio journal about the creative process; of working for long periods of time, [...] "without coming up with anything cool... and when you least expect it, it all falls into place." [...] The name derives from the last line of this entry: [...] "I hope that all this garbage will become something beautiful!".|$|E
