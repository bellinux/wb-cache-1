25|$|Tapered roller {{bearings}} are bearings {{that can take}} large <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> {{as well as being}} able to sustain large radial forces. They were co-invented by German-American Henry Timken and Reginald Heinzelman. On August 27, 1897, Timken and Heizelman filed U.S. patent #606,635 which was issued to them jointly on June 28, 1898.|$|E

Some problems related to <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> measurement of water pump is studied in the paper and a special measurement device is designed. The data of real <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> vs. flow are measured during the pump operation and a measurement curve is sorted out by use of reasonable <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> transfer structure and optimized force measuring element. The relative non-linearity error of the measurement device is less than 0. 3 FS by calibration.

30|$|Menand, Sellami, and Bouguecha (2009) {{considered}} <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> transfer as {{an issue}} in deviated wells where friction and buckling phenomenon take place. The general perception of the industry is that once the drill pipe exceeds conventional buckling criteria, <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> cannot be transferred down-hole anymore. Their study showed that, even though buckling criteria are exceeded, <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> transfer could be still good if drill pipe is in rotation. They showed and explained how <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> is transferred down-hole in many simulated field conditions: sliding, rotating, with or without dog legs (Stephan et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. FEM is {{use for the}} {{mechanical}} analysis of reinforced retaining wall under earthquake loading. The main results are as following. The displacement and <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> increased with the increased seismic intensity. The displacement and <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> decreased with the increased the length of bar strip. The displacement and <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> decreased with the decreased the spacing of bar strip. The displacement and <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> decreased with the increased physical mechanics parameters of filling. Seismic response was similar under bilateral seismic loading and horizontal seismic loading, seismic response was slightly larger under bilateral seismic loading...|$|R

40|$|Effect of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> {{fluctuation}} on elasto-plastic {{behavior of}} steel piers with cylinder section was investigated by nonlinear finite element analysis. Five structural models with four kinds of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> fluctuation were analyzed，and their ultimate strength，ductility and energy absorption capability were discussed. As a result，it {{was found that}} the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> fluctuation has relatively high effect only on the ultimate strength and ductility...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviors}} {{of production and}} relaxation of fastening force in bolted joint for wood construction were experimentally investigated. In the fastening stage, the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in bolt and the fastening torque become larger with increasingly fastening the bolt until fastening torque reached at some level. However, the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in bolt was hard to increase when fastening the bolt at higher level than that, because of immediate relaxation of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in wood members. And in this stage, the compressive strain in wood member was increased at the portion near the washer first, {{and then it was}} distributed {{in the shape of a}} coniform or a fusiform having the tops in both washer sides. The relaxation of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in bolt was extremely large in a few minutes after fastening, and the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> was reduced to about half until 1000 minutes after fastening. Then, the change of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in bolt was subjected to the change of relative humidity of circumstance. The relaxation of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in bolt developed extremely in the case of initial <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> of above 600 to 800 kgf. Although the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in bolt was reduced over 50 percent of initial force, more than 80 percent of compressive strain in wood member was remained even after 1000 minutes after fastening. 木質部材のボルト接合部に関し, ボルト締結時におけるボルト軸カおよび木質部材内のひずみの発現, およびそれらの緩和について実験的にその挙動を明らかにした. (1) ボルト締結時において, ボルトの締付けに伴いボルト軸力および締付けトルクは増大するが, 木質部材では軸力の瞬間的な緩和が大きく, ある一定トルク以上では, 軸力の増加の割合が減少した. (2) ボルト締結時における部材内のひずみは, 座金近傍でのひずみの増大が先行し, その後, 軸力の増加に伴い締付け両端座金を頂点とするような円錐形ないしは紡錘形状に分布し増加する傾向を示した. (3) ボルト軸力は, 締付け直後数分間に大きく減少し, その後, 約 1000 分までの間は周囲の湿度変化の影響が現れず, ほぼ 50 %程度が緩和した. それ以降は, 周囲の湿度変化を受け緩和傾向が乱された. また, 初期軸力のボルト軸力が大きなものほど緩和の程度が大きく, とくに初期軸力 1000 kgfの場合には著しい緩和を示した. 本研究における実験条件の範囲内では, 初期ボルト軸カを 600 ～ 800 kgf に設定するのが最も効果的であると言える. (4) ボルト締結後の部材内のひずみ分布は, ボルトに近い部分での緩和が大きく, ボルトから遠くの位置でのひずみの緩和は小さかった. 周囲湿度の変化による影響は, ひずみの大きいところではそれほど大きくなく, ひずみの小さいところほど影響を受け易かった. (5) ボルト軸カが大きく緩和するのに対し, 部材内のひずみはさほど緩和しないことから, ボルト軸カの緩和には, 座金近傍の大きなひずみを生じているところの挙動が大きく左右しているものと考えられる...|$|R

50|$|If an axle has two bearings, and {{temperature}} varies, axle shrinks or expands, {{therefore it is}} not admissible for both bearings to be fixed on both their sides, since expansion of axle would exert <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> that would destroy these bearings.

40|$|Flexural {{strength}} of unreinforced masonry (URM) cross-sections is typically predicted {{by means of}} two-dimensional (2 D) interaction domains. Alternatively, three-dimensional (3 D) interaction domains {{can be used to}} include the balance of the whole masonry panel in the limit state equations of an extreme section. In this paper 3 D domains are presented to describe the interaction between shear <b>force,</b> <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> and its eccentricity for prismatic URM panels with rectangular cross-section. For both elastic and ultimate limit states, sectional equilibrium equations corresponding to a given axial strain diagram are merged with those of the entire masonry panel for cracked and uncracked conditions separately. Such domains are defined in a dimensionless format in order to be independent of the compressive {{strength of}} masonry. Limit state equations were derived for five different stress-strain relationships, to investigate the influence of masonry behaviour in uniaxial compression under the assumption of zero tensile strength. In this paper the general formulation is specialised for a strength-degrading constitutive model to emphasise the effects of strain softening. Finally, the 3 D domains were sectioned with planes corresponding to different levels of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> and <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> eccentricity in order to derive 2 D interaction domains expressed respectively in terms of shear <b>force</b> versus <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> eccentricity and shear <b>force</b> versus <b>axial</b> <b>force.</b> It is shown that any increase in the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> eccentricity causes a rotation of the shear <b>force</b> versus <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> domain, resulting in an allowable <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> lower than that associated with concentric compression...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} effect of {{viscosity}} on <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in the esophagus during primary peristalsis using a newly validated impedance-based <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> recording technique. METHODS: A probe able to simultaneously measure both <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> and manometry was positioned above the lower esophageal sphincter. Potable tap water and three thickened fluids were used to create boluses of different viscosities. Water has a viscosity of 1 mPa 7;s. The three thickened fluids were made with different concentrations of Clinutren Instant thickener. The viscous fluids were in appearance comparable to pudding (2 kPa 7;s), yogurt (6 kPa 7;s) and slush ice (10 kPa 7;s). Six healthy volunteers swallowed 5 and 10 mL of boluses multiple times. RESULTS: The pressure amplitude did not increase with the bolus viscosity nor with the bolus volume whereas the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> increased marginally with bolus volume (0. 1 > P > 0. 05). Both techniques showed that contraction duration increased with bolus viscosity (P < 0. 01). Association was found between <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> and pressure but the association became weaker with increasing viscosity. The pressure amplitude did not increase with the viscosity or bolus volume whereas the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> increased marginally with the bolus size. CONCLUSION: This indicates a discrepancy between the physiological functions that can be recorded with <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> measurements and pressure measurements...|$|R
50|$|It {{has to be}} {{considered}} that bone strength is highly dependent on geometry {{and direction of the}} acting forces in relation to this geometry. The fracture load for <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> of the tibia for example is about 50 to 60 times the body weight. The fracture load for forces perpendicular to the axial direction is about 10 times lower.|$|E
5000|$|Serious spinal injures {{are usually}} caused by <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> due to blows on the head, or bending and {{twisting}} {{forces on the}} back caused by blows to the shoulders, hips {{and other parts of}} the body. In the Cambridge Standard for Motorcyclists Clothing, Roderick Woods asserts that the majority of spinal injuries are caused by blows to the hip and shoulders. In the rare circumstance that a motorcyclist received a direct blow to the back, the damage would be unmitigable by armor. The concept of a [...] "back protector" [...] is therefore not endorsed by Woods. Although back protectors, as defined in the standard, cannot protect against <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> they are required to protect the scapula and there is now considerable anecdotal evidence that wearing a certified back protector can significantly reduce trauma in a major accident as they reduce the effect of impacts on the ribs and lessen the blows to internal organs too.|$|E
50|$|Because {{both the}} arch and the tie are mainly subject to <b>axial</b> <b>forces,</b> their cross {{sections}} {{can be very}} small. Usually, transverse bending in the deck is bigger than bending in longitudinal direction. Therefore, a concrete deck that spans between the arches is a good solution for bridges with arch distances that are not too large. The concrete deck has longitudinal prestressing tendons in the arch planes.|$|E
40|$|Since overlarge <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> {{can damage}} the pump, {{accurate}} calculation formula of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> on pump is very significant. The traditional formula {{is based on the}} assumption that the leakage amount of the pump is zero and the angular speed of fluid in the pump chamber rotates at half the impeller rotation’s angular speed. In order to propose an accurate calculation formula, the whole flow fields of multistage pumps with three different ring clearances were calculated by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The results indicate that the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> on first-stage impeller is larger than that on the second. Along with the change of ring clearance, the static pressure distribution on the shroud of impeller changes at the same time, which leads to the value change of <b>axial</b> <b>force.</b> Meanwhile, angular speed of the fluid in the pump chamber is changing. Therefore, this research works out the reason why the error of traditional <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> calculation is large when the amount of leakage is relatively high. At last, an accurate calculation formula of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> on pump is obtained through the verification of numerical simulation and experiment...|$|R

40|$|Vibrating micro-/nanosized {{cantilever}} beams {{under an}} applied <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> {{are the key}} components of various devices used in nanotechnology. In this study, we perform a complete theoretical investigation of the cantilever beams under an arbitrary value of the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> vibrating in a specific environment such as vacuum, air or viscous fluid. Based on the results easy accessible expressions enabling one the fast and highly accurate estimations {{of changes in the}} Q-factor and resonant frequencies of beam oscillating in viscous fluid caused by the applied <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> are derived and analyzed. It has been also shown that for beam-to-string and string vibrational regimes the mode shape starts to significantly deviate from the one known for a beam without <b>axial</b> <b>force.</b> Moreover, a linear dependency of the vibrational amplitude in resonance on the dimensionless tension parameter has been found. We revealed that only a large <b>axial</b> <b>force,</b> i. e. the string vibrational regime, significantly improves the Q-factor of beams submerged in fluid, while an increase of the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in beam and beam-to-string transition regimes has a negligibly small impact on the Q-factor enhancement. Experiments carried out on the carbon nanotubes and nanowires are in a good agreement with present theoretical predictions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{method has}} been used to {{investigate}} the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> of automotive water pump. As the excessive <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> can make some unexpected problems like impeller interference and coolant leakage we have focused on finding the cause of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> and its reduction in this paper. First, we have tested the closed type water pump with and without balance hole by the calculation methods. By examining the pressure contour around the impeller, we have found that the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> arises not only from the pressure difference around shroud but also from the pressure difference around hub. So we have tested two impellers- one is normal open type impeller and the other is open type impeller with modified hub. The results show that the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> reduction is about 150 ~ 200 N for normal one and 700 N@ 3000 RPM for modified impeller. And the hydraulic efficiency which is important in aspect of engine fuel efficiency is reduced about 6. 5 % for normal one but increased 4 %@ 3000 RPM for modified impeller...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made here {{to measure the}} forces of three directions, under {{conditions}} of different feed speeds, different tilt angles of tool and without or with the pin on the tool, by using octagonal ring dynamometer in the AA 2024 aluminum FSJ (Friction Stir Joining) process, and investigate how four main factors influence forces in the FSJ process. It is found that, high feed speed lead to small feed force and small lateral force, but high feed speed leads to large feed force in the stable joining stage of process. As the rotational speed increasing, the time of <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> drop from the maximum to the minimum required increased in the push-up process. In the stable joining stage, the rotational speed has {{little effect on the}} feed force; large rotational speed leads to small lateral <b>force</b> and <b>axial</b> <b>force.</b> The maximum <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> increases as the tilt angle of tool increases at the downward movement stage. At the moment of start feeding, as tilt angle of tool increases, the amplitudes of the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> increasing become large. In the stable joining stage, with the increase of tilt angle of tool, the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> is increased, the lateral force is decreased, and the feed force almost unchanged. The tool with pin will decrease <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in the downward movement stage.

50|$|A Rigid-frame {{bridge is}} a bridge {{in which the}} {{superstructure}} and substructure are rigidly connected {{to act as a}} continuous unit. Typically, the structure is cast monolithically, making the structure continuous from deck to foundation.

A bridge design consisting of a rigid frame can provide significant structural benefits, but can also be difficult to design and/or construct.|$|E
50|$|If one axle loses grip, {{different}} rotational speeds arise {{inside the}} differential which {{result in an}} increase in <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> that force the clutch plates to close. Once closed, the output shaft is locked resulting in the diversion {{of the majority of the}} torque to the axle achieving better traction. In the Crown Gear differential up to 85% of torque can flow to the rear, and up to 70% of torque can be diverted to the front axle.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{spinning}} mass is balanced, the only possibility {{to speed up}} the rotation is for the sides of the groove to exert forces on the ends of the axle. Furthermore, the normal and <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> will have no effect, so tangential force must be provided by friction. If the axle is stationary, the friction will only act to slow down the rotation, but the situation is very different if the axle is turned by applying a torque.|$|E
