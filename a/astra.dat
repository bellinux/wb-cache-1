Later that year, Holden also announced plans to sell the European <b>Astra</b> and the Korean Cruze alongside each other from 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Fastra II is {{a desktop}} {{supercomputer}} designed for tomography. It {{was built in}} late 2009 by the <b>ASTRA</b> (All Scale Tomographic Reconstruction Antwerp) group of researchers of the IBBT (Interdisciplinary institute for BroadBand Technology) VisionLab at the University of Antwerp and by Belgian computer shop Tones, in collaboration with Asus, a Taiwanese multinational computer product manufacturer, as the successor to the Fastra I (built in 2008).|$|E
5|$|The Fastra II's predecessor, the Fastra I, has 4 dual-GPU GeForce 9800 GX2 video cards, for a {{total of}} 8 GPUs. At that time, the <b>ASTRA</b> group needed a {{motherboard}} that had four PCI Express x16 slots with double-spacing between each of them. The only such motherboard the <b>ASTRA</b> group could find at that time was the MSI K9A2 Platinum, which has four such slots. In 2009, the Asus P6T7 WS Supercomputer motherboard, which the Fastra II uses, was released, which has seven PCI Express x16 slots. The Fastra II has six faster dual-GPU GeForce GTX 295 video cards, and a single-GPU GeForce GTX 275, {{for a total}} of 13 GPUs. In the Fastra II, the GPUs mainly perform tomographic reconstruction. The technique which allows GPUs to perform general-purpose tasks like this outside of gaming, instead of CPUs, is called GPGPU, general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.|$|E

5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} PS-13, and therefore required ballast {{to be placed in}} the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the <b>Astra</b> fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} was {{built as a}} researching and demonstration project by the <b>ASTRA</b> group of researchers at the Vision Lab in the University of Antwerp in Belgium, one of the researchers being Joost Batenburg. Unlike other modern supercomputers such as the Cray Jaguar and the IBM Roadrunner, which cost millions of euros, the Fastra II only uses consumer hardware, costing €6,000 in total.|$|E
5|$|Dein in the {{meantime}} pursued an offer from a television consortium, funded by the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC). They intended to create a football-only channel, available on the <b>Astra</b> satellite transponder. The Observer believed {{that in addition to}} broadcasting league matches, SBC would offer a selection of top clubs fees for airing matches against their European counterparts. Dein was impressed by the proposal – financier Chris Akers forecasted profits of up to £50 million – so he forwarded it to Parry. Although he too was impressed, SBC's offer eventually failed because of sponsorship doubts.|$|E

In the previous year, Nissan Pulsar hatchbacks were rebadged as the Holden <b>Astra,</b> {{as a result of}} a deal with Nissan. This arrangement ceased in 1989 when Holden entered a new alliance with Toyota, forming a new company: United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI). UAAI resulted in Holden selling rebadged versions of Toyota's Corolla and Camry, as the Holden Nova and Apollo respectively, with Toyota re-branding the Commodore as the Lexcen.|$|E

In June, David Fincher is confirmed to direct the World War Z sequel, marking Pitt and Fincher's fourth collaboration. Next, Pitt will star in James Gray's deep space epic Ad <b>Astra,</b> in which he will play the slightly autistic space engineer Roy McBride who searches across the galaxy for his father, played by Tommy Lee Jones.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Volunteer Corps' {{activity}} was only revived after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Among the relics {{left behind by}} the Corps is Dimitrie Lăzărel's banner, probably the only one of seven to have survived. In 1923, Lăzărel paraded it at the Volunteers' Union reunion in Arad. Referred to as the Darnița Banner, it was donated to a local church, then exhibited by the Museum of Banat, Timișoara. The Kishinev flag was donated by the Corps to <b>ASTRA</b> National Museum Complex of Sibiu.|$|E

5|$|There are radio {{stations}} broadcasting via Satellite to the United Kingdom, however these {{are aimed at}} home users for playback through their televisions since these same satellites are also used for television broadcast and usually use SES' <b>Astra</b> series of satellites at 28.2° east or the Eutelsat 28A satellite at 28.5° east. Radio stations broadcast free-to-air via the Sky Digital, Freesat from Sky platforms and any DVB-S compliant set-top box. The Freesat platform has all the BBC's national and regional digital {{radio stations}} as well as BBC London 94.9 from the launch on 6 May 2008 on the EPG.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} the Sibiu-based <b>Astra</b> {{magazine}} Transilvania (where he sometimes used the signature AG), Agârbiceanu remained the editor of Patria until 1927, and also resumed his collaboration with Viața Românească. However, he was disappointed by the cultural and economic decline which came {{as a consequence of}} Transylvania's incorporation: the local press, he noted, had largely lost its purpose and could not hope to survive competition. As noted by reviewers from Ilie Rad to Răzvan Voncu, some of Agârbiceanu's more valuable work saw print in minor provincial reviews.|$|E
5|$|With {{a lack of}} {{domestic}} capital that was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno's economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors {{of the country to}} foreign investment though the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies Freeport Sulphur Company / International Nickel Company. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as <b>Astra</b> Group and Salim Group.|$|E

5|$|A {{memorial}} to Ball, {{along with his}} parents, and a sister who died in infancy, appears on the exterior wall of {{the southwest corner of}} Holy Trinity Church in Lenton. Another memorial tablet is present inside the same church, mounted on the north wall and bearing the RFC and RAF motto Per Ardua ad <b>Astra,</b> along with decorations of medals and royal arms. In 1967, the Albert Ball VC Scholarships were instituted at his alma mater, Trent College. A propeller from one of Ball's aircraft and the original cross from his grave in France are displayed at the college's library and chapel, respectively. One of the houses at Nottingham High's Junior School is also named after Ball.|$|E
5|$|Agârbiceanu visited Bucharest, the Old Kingdom capital, in 1906, {{and sent}} {{enthusiastic}} travel notes for Unirea. He became {{a regular contributor}} to the Bucharest nationalist review Sămănătorul, which gave De la țară a sonorous welcome, and later to Sămănătoruls leftist rival, Viața Românească. From 1909, he {{was also one of the}} regulars at Neamul Românesc. For his literary activity, he was elected a corresponding member of <b>Astra</b> in 1912, and was promoted to full membership in 1925. From 1910 to 1919, he was parish priest at Orlat in Sibiu County. Agârbiceanu was also a member of Austria-Hungary's Romanian National Party (PNR), and supported PNR youth leader Octavian Goga, his colleague at Luceafărul and Tribuna. In 1910, he followed Goga as he parted from the PNR and launched his own independent faction.|$|E

5|$|Fire arrow: One of the {{earliest}} weaponized forms of gunpowder was the fire arrow which received {{its name from the}} translated Chinese term huǒjiàn (火箭), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an arrow from the 9th century onward. Later on solid fuel rockets utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire arrow became synonymous with rockets in the Chinese language. In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni <b>astra)</b> underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon.' Fire arrows are the predecessors of fire lances, the first firearm.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 to 1928, Agârbiceanu, a {{recipient}} of the National Prize for Literature, headed the Cluj chapter of <b>Astra</b> and edited Transilvania. It was in this magazine that he wrote a number of articles in support of eugenics, calling on priests to promote the movement in their parishes. Given the secular values of the movement's leaders in Romania, his participation was somewhat incongruous, but Agârbiceanu did not see a conflict between his religious creed and a current centered around supposedly objective natural laws. From 1930, he participated in Astra's literary section and headed its cultural congress, in which capacity he lectured on the organization's role in Romanian cultural life. Additionally, he played a prominent role during its annual congresses and committed himself to social activism. He was involved in Astra's literacy campaigns, inspecting and fundraising for village libraries {{in places such as}} Aleșd.|$|E
5|$|Shiva {{decides to}} travel to Panchavati under the {{guidance}} of Kali, who is the Naga queen and knows the path through the Dandak Forest to the Naga capital. While traveling they are attacked from the river side by a cache of ships containing {{the weapons of mass destruction}} known as Daivi <b>Astra</b> that was once forbidden by Lord Rudra, the legendary supreme ruler of India. After fleeing from the attack and safely reaching Panchavati, Shiva and Sati suspect Daksha to be behind this. Kali takes Shiva to a nearby school in the capital, where she believes that the greatest secret of the Nagas lies. There in a classroom, Shiva finds Brahaspati, perfectly alive and teaching a class.|$|E
