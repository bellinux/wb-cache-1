25|$|The {{objectives}} of the centre are to continuously assess the training needs, prepare <b>appropriate</b> <b>training</b> and course materials, arrange short courses, workshops and seminars in co-operation with other OIC organs and bodies as well as relevant national, regional and international organisations, and develop facilities of international standard to meet the growing demands of the OIC Countries {{in the field of}} energy and environment.|$|E

The number of devices in the community has grown as prices have fallen to affordable levels. There has been some concern among medical professionals that these home users do not necessarily have <b>appropriate</b> <b>training,</b> and many advocate the more widespread use of community responders, who can be appropriately trained and managed.|$|E

25|$|Preschool {{education}}, {{which began}} at age three, was another target of education reform in 1985. Preschool facilities {{were to be}} established in buildings made available by public enterprises, production teams, municipal authorities, local groups, and families. The government announced that it depended on individual organizations to sponsor their own preschool education and that preschool education {{was to become a}} part of the welfare services of various government organizations, institutes, and state- and collectively operated enterprises. Costs for preschool education varied according to services rendered. Officials also called for more preschool teachers with more <b>appropriate</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form of {{descriptive}} assessment involves recording the antecedents and consequences that naturally occur when the individual emits the behavior. This is referred to as ABC data collection, in which (A) represents the common antecedent, (B) represents the behavior of interest, and (C) represents the immediate consequences that occur following the behavior. ABC data collection is used to identify the naturally occurring consequences delivered in the environment in which the behavior occurs. ABC data collection can be conducted by a wide array of individuals who have received <b>appropriate</b> <b>training</b> on how to record the data.|$|E

25|$|As Witmer {{believed}} in the <b>appropriate</b> <b>training</b> of these school psychologists, he also {{stressed the importance of}} appropriate and accurate testing of these special children. The IQ testing movement was sweeping through the world of education after its creation in 1905. However, the IQ test negatively influenced special education. The IQ test creators, Lewis Terman and Henry Goddard, held a nativist view of intelligence, believing that intelligence was inherited and difficult if not impossible to modify in any meaningful way through education. These notions were often used as a basis for excluding children with disabilities from the public schools. Witmer argued against the standard pencil and paper IQ and Binet type tests in order to help select children for special education. Witmer's child selection process included observations and having children perform certain mental tasks.|$|E

While steaming beyond Saipan {{on the last}} leg of her voyage hositilities ceased. Peace focused attention on the need to clear harbor areas for the restoration of commerce and in Japan to gain access for the occupation forces. Operating until 8 September around the Okinawa area, Minah then sailed to Japan and assisted in clearing mines from Sasebo Harbor. Later steaming into Pusan, Korea, 5 October, she supervised Japanese minesweeping operations. While on this duty AMc-204 rescued the crew of a Japanese destroyer which struck a mine and sank and also employed her divers in checking previously sunken ships. Additional underwater location assignments were performed at Kure Harbor before departing Korean waters 15 January 1946.|$|E

25|$|In August 1940, the {{squadron}} was dispatched to Seletar, on Singapore, where it operated its Wirraways {{in support of}} ground forces that had been stationed there amid concerns of war with the Japanese. In early 1941, No. 21 Squadron, {{the squadron}} was re-designated a fighter unit and was sent to Sembawang to re-equip with the Brewster Buffalo. In mid-1941, as war with Japan became more likely, the squadron was sent to Malaya, operating out of Sungai Petani, where they augmented four other British Commonwealth, including No. 453 Squadron RAAF. The five British Commonwealth units—including two RAF and one Royal New Zealand Air Force squadrons—that flew Buffalos in the Malayan campaign were beset with numerous problems, including poorly built and ill-equipped planes; inadequate supplies of spare parts; inadequate numbers of support staff; airfields that were difficult to defend against air attack; lack of a clear and coherent command structure; antagonism between RAF and RAAF squadrons and personnel, and inexperienced pilots lacking <b>appropriate</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E
500|$|Shepard was {{designated}} Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963. He thereby became responsible for NASA [...] astronaut training. This involved {{the development of}} <b>appropriate</b> <b>training</b> programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment {{to be used by}} astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary had several head shot photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on the door to his private office, with a sign which said [...] "Mood of the Day". Visitors could then look at the photo to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him.

This colonial legacy had remained the status quo in society, even since independence in 1970, he maintained. [...] "The status quo is not good for the ordinary Fijians. It is good for the elites in society but not for the ordinary Fijians," [...] Chaudhry said.
