40|$|Background/Aim. Bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>{{disorder}}</b> is {{mental disorder}} with polygenic type of heredity. Heritability - relation between genetic and environmental variance {{is used to}} estimate the level of influence of genetic variance to phenotype variance. Study results show decreasing trend {{in the value of}} heritability of bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder,</b> thus indicating that this disorder is a complex behavioral threshold characteristic. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the contribution of genetic variance to phenotype variance of bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder,</b> i. e. to estimate heritability of this disorder. Methods. By the use of a questionnaire, 80 patients with over crossed threshold for bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> were asked for functional information about the members of their families belonging to the first degree of relation (fathers, mothers and full- sibs). By using ”Applet for calculating heritability for threshold traits (disease) “, and regression analysis, heritability of bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> as well as its statistical significance, were estimated (χ 2 test). Results. Heritability and relationship of genetic and environmental variance of bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> is 0. 2 with statistically significant difference from zero (p < 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{previously}} reported {{an association between}} the D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA) /G 30 locus and both schizophrenia and bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder.</b> Given the presumed role of DAOA/G 30 in the neurochemistry of psychosis and its localization in a schizophrenia and bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> linkage region (13 q 34), {{it was hypothesized that}} the bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> finding would be mainly due to an association with psychotic features. METHOD: The marker/haplotype associations obtained in a subset of 173 bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> patients with psychotic features were similar to those in the overall patient group, suggesting that stratification on the basis of psychotic features in general might be too crude a procedure. The authors therefore tested whether confining caseness to specific psychotic features would improve detection of genotype-phenotype correlations. RESULTS: In a logistic regression, "persecutory delusions" were found to be the only significant explanatory variable for the DAOA/G 30 risk genotype among 21 OPCRIT symptoms of psychosis. The authors therefore tested for association between DAOA/G 30 and bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> in the 90 cases with a history of persecutory delusions. Whereas this subset showed strong association (odds ratio= 1. 83 for the best marker), the remaining larger sample of 165 patients with no such history did not differ from comparison subjects, suggesting that the association between DAOA/G 30 and bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> is due to persecutory delusions. This was confirmed in an independent study of 294 bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> patients and 311 comparison subjects from Poland, in which an association between bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> and DAOA/G 30 was only seen when case definition was restricted to cases with persecutory delusions. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> with persecutory delusions constitutes a distinct subgroup of bipolar <b>affective</b> <b>disorder</b> that overlaps with schizophrenia...|$|R
25|$|Going {{in another}} direction, {{numerous}} links and overlaps {{have been found}} between major depressive disorder and bipolar syndromes, including mixed states (simultaneous depression and mania or hypomania). Hypomanic ('below manic') and more rarely manic signs and symptoms {{have been found in}} a significant number of cases of major depressive disorder, suggesting not a categorical distinction but a dimension of frequency which is higher in bipolar II and higher again in bipolar I. In addition, numerous subtypes of bipolar have been proposed beyond the types already in the DSM (which includes a milder form called cyclothymia). These extra subgroups have been defined in terms of more detailed gradations of mood severity, or the rapidity of cycling, or the extent or nature of psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, due to shared characteristics between some types of Bipolar disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, some researchers have suggested they may both lie on a spectrum of <b>affective</b> <b>disorders,</b> although others see more links to post-trauma syndromes.|$|E

A long-term case series study by Kelly and Lieberman of 17 patients with major refractory unipolar depression found that 14 patients showed sustained improvement of symptoms over an average timespan of two years, in some cases with higher doses of T3 than the traditional 50µg required to achieve therapeutic effect, with an average of 80µg and a dosage span of 24 months; dose range: 25-150µg. The same authors published a retrospective study of 125 patients with the two most common categories of bipolar disorders II and NOS whose treatment had previously been resistant to an average of 14 other medications.

25|$|Convulsive {{therapy was}} {{introduced}} in 1934 by Hungarian neuropsychiatrist Ladislas J. Meduna who, believing mistakenly that schizophrenia and epilepsy were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures first with camphor and then metrazol (cardiazol). Meduna {{is thought to be}} the father of convulsive therapy. In 1937, the first international meeting on convulsive therapy was held in Switzerland by the Swiss psychiatrist Muller. The proceedings were published in the American Journal of Psychiatry and, within three years, cardiazol convulsive therapy was being used worldwide. Italian Professor of neuropsychiatry Ugo Cerletti, who had been using electric shocks to produce seizures in animal experiments, and his colleague Lucio Bini developed the idea of using electricity as a substitute for metrazol in convulsive therapy and, in 1938, experimented {{for the first time on}} a person. It was believed early on that inducing convulsions aided in helping those with severe schizophrenia but later found to be most useful with <b>affective</b> <b>disorders</b> such as depression. Cerletti had noted a shock to the head produced convulsions in dogs. The idea to use electroshock on humans came to Cerletti when he saw how pigs were given an electric shock before being butchered to put them in an anesthetized state. Cerletti and Bini practiced until they felt they had the right parameters needed to have a successful human trial. Once they started trials on patients, they found that after 10-20 treatments the results were significant. Patients had much improved. A positive side effect to the treatment was retrograde amnesia. It was because of this side effect that patients could not remember the treatments and had no ill feelings toward it. ECT soon replaced metrazol therapy all over the world because it was cheaper, less frightening and more convenient. Cerletti and Bini were nominated for a Nobel Prize but did not receive one. By 1940, the procedure was introduced to both England and the US. In Germany and Austria, it was promoted by Friedrich Meggendorfer. Through the 1940s and 1950s, the use of ECT became widespread.|$|E

It is located in the chromosomal region of the velocardiofacial syndrome on 22 q 11 that is suspected to contain genes relevant to schizophrenia, and is involved in the metabolism of neurotransmitters. Positive association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the proline dehydrogenase locus and schizophrenia further supported the role of proline dehydrogenase in the development of schizophrenia.
