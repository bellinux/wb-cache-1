The proposed model is based on the limit equilibrium principle and accounts for geotechnical soil properties (cohesion, friction <b>angle,</b> <b>unit</b> weight of soil), soil saturation, slope steepness, and brush layer design parameters (number of stems per meter, length and diameter of stems, distance between brush layers).

The increasing number of available crystal structures of these proteins in the Protein Data Bank permits an initial estimation of their structural properties. Description We have developed two web servers—TMalphaDB for α-helix bundles and TMbetaDB for β-barrels—to analyse the growing repertoire of available crystal structures of membrane proteins. TMalphaDB and TMbetaDB permit to search for these specific sequence motifs in a non-redundant structure database of transmembrane segments and quantify structural parameters such as ϕ and ψ backbone dihedral angles, χ 1 side chain torsion <b>angle,</b> <b>unit</b> bend and unit twist. Conclusions The structural information offered by TMalphaDB and TMbetaDB permits to quantify structural distortions induced by specific sequence motifs, and to elucidate their role in the 3 D structure.

In this study, the performance of the standard Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) approach with RSL’s spectral database SPECCHIO attached is investigated. Due to its robustness regarding directional effects, SAM classification is estimated to be the most efficient.

Physical properties determination is {{an important}} factor for formulation of machinery projects and sizing of post-harvest operations, which may impact considerably on the products quality, influencing directly the operation cost and company profit. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate and determinate some physical properties (repose <b>angle,</b> <b>unit</b> and bulk density, porosity and color coordinates, particle size, moisture content, water activity, angle of internal friction and effective angle of internal friction) of coffee, such as to evaluate the influence of different roast and grinding degrees over these properties. Crude grain coffee (Coffea canephora and Coffea arabica), dehulled and dried were used. These were roasted at two levels: medium light and medium-dark brown, which Agtron numbers are, respectively, SCAA# 65 and SCAA# 45. After roasting process, grains were grinded at three particle sizes (thin, medium and thick). Both particle size and roast degree significantly affected physical properties of coffee. Coffee samples roasted at medium dark level obtained lower values of moisture content, water activity, repose angle, bulk and real density. Coffee samples grinded at level thin presented an increase of angle of internal friction and effective angle of internal friction, repose angle, bulk and real density, porosity and decrease of water activity values. ...|$|E
40|$|Thin-walled spread {{foundations}} {{are used}} in coastal projects where the soil strength is relatively low. Developing a predictive model of bearing capacity {{for this kind of}} foundation is of interest {{due to the fact that}} the famous bearing capacity equations are proposed for conventional footings. Many studies underlined the applicability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in predicting the bearing capacity of foundations. However, the majority of these models are built using conventional ANNs, which suffer from slow rate of learning as well as getting trapped in local minima. Moreover, they are mainly developed for conventional footings. The prime objective of this study is to propose an improved ANN-based predictive model of bearing capacity for thin-walled shallow foundations. In this regard, a relatively large dataset comprising 145 recorded cases of related footing load tests was compiled from the literature. The dataset includes bearing capacity (Qu), friction <b>angle,</b> <b>unit</b> weight of sand, footing width, and thin-wall length to footing width ratio (Lw/B). Apart from Qu, other parameters were set as model inputs. To enhance the diversity of the data, four more related laboratory footing load tests were conducted on the Johor Bahru sand, and results were added to the dataset. Experimental findings suggest an almost 0. 5 times increase in the bearing capacity in loose and dense sands when Lw/B is increased from 0. 5 to 1. 12. Overall, findings show the feasibility of the ANN-based predictive model improved with particle swarm optimization (PSO). The correlation coefficient was 0. 98 for testing data, suggesting that the model serves as a reliable tool in predicting the bearing capacity...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the landslide mechanism {{and the associated}} influence factors on the stability of slope-land, this study performed a systematic rainfall induced seepage and slope stability analyses using two dimensional finite element method and limit equilibrium method. After the establishment of numerical model, the rainfall induced seepage analysis was carried out on the Y 4 profile of Li-San landslide area. The numerical results were compared with those from measurements to verify the validity of numerical simulation. Subsequently, several types of fictitious slope were designed for the parametric studies to detect the influence scale and the sensitivity of various influence factors on the slope stability. In parametric studies, the influence factors encompass: Topography factors (slope inclination and slope height), Geological factors (effective cohesion, effective friction <b>angle,</b> <b>unit</b> weight of soil stratum, unsaturated suction friction angle and hydraulic conductivity function), Hydrology (rainfall patterns and initial groundwater table) and Geological structure (thickness of colluviums). Incorporating the dispersal of soaking line, seepage of infiltrated rainwater, variation of groundwater table and change of pore water pressure with the slope stability analyses, {{it is possible to}} interpret the landslide mechanism of slope-land in a rational manner. In accordance with the calculation results, several conclusions can be drawn from this study: Rainfall induced seepage analyses were performed on the Y 4 profile of Li-San landslide area using the Hyetographs of Typhoon Toraji, Bilis, Aere and Mindulle. It was indicated that Typhoon Toraji can give the most coincidence of the calculated groundwater variation with that from the measurement. In addition, the predicted tendency from other three Typhoons also shows a good agreement to a certain extent. To survey the significance of boundary condition on numerical calculations, this study performed a series of rainfall induced seepage analyses using 4 types of seepage boundary at the lateral side of numerical model. It was found that the influence of boundary condition type is minor if the geometry boundary was located at a distance of 3 times of slope height away from the main slope. As a consequence, it can be deduced that for the identical condition, the influence of boundary condition type on the calculation of factor of safety is also negligible. For a slope with steep inclination or large slope height, the wave front of soaking line beneath the slope toe is capable of infiltrating and dispersing into soil stratum from ground surface with a greater depth during the rainfall. Consequently, the soaking line may join the groundwater table together within short rainfall duration. In general, for P 1 instrumentation point located at the depth of 2 m below the slope toe, the initial pressure head is approaching to zero from a negative value during rainfall and eventually turns into positive value due to the overlap of soaking line and groundwater table. This also implies the area adjacent to P 1 instrumentation point has been converted from unsaturated to saturated state and the suction of unsaturated zone,vanishes entirely and the equivalent shear strength originated from suction,, becomes valid. At the mean time, for P 2 and P 3 instrumentation points which located at the depth of 2. 5 m below the mid-slope surface and at the depth of 3 m below the slope top respectively, the pressure head remain negative and this indicates both points are still situated at the unsaturated zone in between the soaking line and groundwater table. Moreover, based on the aforementioned discussions, it can be deduced that the potential sliding failure surface may initiate at the area adjacent to slope toe instead of the other areas of slope. For the situation which possesses a Fs > 1 at the last time step with rainfall duration of tf- 1, the overlap zone of soaking line and groundwater table is merely restricted to a relatively small extent nearby the slope toe. Accordingly, the minimum factor of safety, Fsmin(> 1), was calculated based on the potential surface sliding through the entire slope. On the contrary, for the situation which possesses a Fs 1) 大體上仍以滑動面通過整個坡面來進行計算。反之，在安全係數己小於 1 的最前一個時階，浸潤線與地下水水位線之結合區將會往上邊坡方向延伸一個範圍，並在下邊坡形成一個飽和區，因此破壞安全係數Fsfailure(< 1) 將以滑動面通過整個飽和區來進行計算。 未飽和土壤之Mohr-Coulomb剪力強度公式，因此邊坡之有效凝聚力、有效內摩擦角、未飽和土層之吸力及其當量吸力摩擦角之增加皆會提升邊坡之穩定性安全係數Fs值。再者，土層的單位重在穩定性分析中主要用來計算滑動面上之下滑驅動力及正向作用力。土層單位重之增加將會降低穩定性安全係數Fs值。 整體水力傳導係數函數值向上調升或向下調降，在降雨期間對既有之地下水水位影響不大。邊坡下方土層之壓力水頭主要受降雨浸潤線擴散之影響，而邊坡穩定性則受浸潤線與地下水水位線結合區在坡面上之延伸範圍所控制。由特定監測點之體積含水量深度分佈剖面來判釋，整體水力傳導係數函數值向上調升將促使地表未飽和區之範圍擴大。反之，向下調降將會縮小未飽和區之範圍。 對颱風及梅雨兩種雨型而言，平均降雨強度愈大，降雨浸潤線形成所需之降雨延時愈短，而邊坡也愈早發生不穩定。在平均降雨強度同為 20 mm/hr時，邊坡在梅雨雨型條件下(tf= 5 ~ 6 hr) 較颱風雨型條件下(tf= 7 ~ 8 hr) 提前發生不穩定。其主要原因為輸入之梅雨雨型初期降雨強度呈波動式之遞升，此與颱風雨型者呈均勻線性式之遞升不同所致。 邊坡之初始地下水水位線愈高(hwo愈小) ，其在降雨時與浸潤線發生結合之降雨延時也愈短。以降雨延時第 9 hr而言，在hwo= 1. 5 m之情況，將形成浸潤線與地下水水位線結合區域。而在hwo= 3. 5 m之情況，兩線正好發生結合。最後，在hwo= 7 m之情況，兩線仍無結合之跡象。 崩積層之厚度對浸潤線形成所需之降雨延時及向下之擴散深度影響不大，但對浸潤線與地下水水位線之結合有遲滯之作用。因此，當崩積層之厚度增加時，其浸潤線與地下水水位線發生結合所需之降雨延時亦將隨著增加。 由參數研究靈敏度分析中可發現，各項邊坡穩定性影響因子中，邊坡坡度β之改變對邊坡穩定性的影響度最高，而邊坡坡高H次之。目 錄	IX 圖 目 錄	XII 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 研究動機	 1 1. 2 研究目的	 1 1. 3 研究範圍	 1 第二章 文獻回顧	 3 2. 1 崩塌	 3 2. 1. 1 定義	 3 2. 2 崩塌之發生與影響因子	 4 2. 2. 1 影響因子與影響因子之量化評估	 6 2. 2. 2 崩塌影響因子之評分權重與評估系統	 10 2. 2. 3 邊坡穩定敏感度分析	 13 2. 2. 4 坡地崩塌分析相關文獻	 13 2. 3 降雨激發崩塌之力學機制	 14 2. 3. 1 崩塌的發生與降雨的關係	 14 2. 4 地表水	 18 2. 4. 1 雨型	 18 2. 4. 2 降雨量	 23 2. 4. 3 土壤之滲透性	 25 2. 4. 4 台灣地區降雨特性分析	 25 2. 4. 5 台灣地區區域性降雨型態範例	 26 2. 5 降雨對地下水位的影響	 34 2. 5. 1 地下水水位消散量之評估	 35 2. 5. 2 地下水水位變化量和有效累積降雨量之關係	 35 2. 6 土壤~水平衡模式	 36 2. 6. 1 水力傳導係數函數	 37 2. 6. 2 體積含水量函數之量測與預測	 41 2. 7 案例分析	 48 第三章 數值分析程式	 55 3. 1 滲流分析程式SEEP/W程式	 55 3. 1. 1 理論背景	 55 3. 1. 2 實務應用	 55 3. 1. 3 體積含水量函數(Volumetric Water Content Functions) 	 56 3. 1. 4 水力傳導係數函數(Hydraulic Conductivity Functions) 及水力傳導係數矩陣(Hydraulic Conductivity Matrix) 	 58 3. 1. 5 水流動法則(Flow Law) 	 59 3. 1. 6 控制方程式(Governing Equation) 	 60 3. 1. 7 元素類型(Element Type) 、座標系統(Coordinate System) 及內插函數(Interpolation Function) 	 61 3. 1. 8 數值變數場(Numerical Variable Field) 及內插函數之導數(Interpolation Function Derivatives) 	 64 3. 1. 9 水力梯度及流速(Gradients and Velocities) 	 67 3. 1. 10 使用參數	 68 3. 1. 11 邊界條件	 68 3. 2 邊坡穩定分析程式SLOPE/W程式程式	 69 3. 2. 1 分析原理及方法	 70 3. 2. 2 實務應用	 70 3. 2. 3 切片極限平衡法理論(Theory of Slice Limit Equilibrium Method) 	 71 3. 2. 4 通用極限平衡法 (General Limit Equilibrium Method) 	 75 3. 2. 5 力矩平衡安全係數及力平衡安全係數	 75 3. 2. 6 切片底邊之正向力及ma值之問題考量	 76 3. 2. 7 切片間之作用力	 77 3. 3 負值孔隙水壓力之效應及未飽和邊坡之安全係數	 81 3. 4 非均向性土壤強度(Anisotropic Soil Strength) 及其修正函數	 82 3. 5 有限元素應力法 (Finite Element Stress Method) 	 84 3. 5. 1 穩定安全係數	 84 3. 5. 2 正向應力及啟動剪應力	 85 第四章 研究方法	 89 4. 1 滲流分析數值程序之驗證(梨山地滑區案例分析) 	 89 4. 1. 1 幾何模式	 89 4. 1. 2 輸入參數	 91 4. 1. 3 降雨入滲分析之執行	 100 4. 2 邊界條件對滲流分析之影響	 101 4. 2. 1 邊界條件之類型	 102 4. 2. 2 邊界條件對計算成果影響之評估	 102 4. 3 降雨邊坡穩定性各項影響因子之參數研究	 103 4. 3. 1 地形因子(β、H) 	 103 4. 3. 2 地質因子	 104 4. 3. 3 水文因子	 105 4. 3. 4 崩積層厚度(dc) 	 107 4. 3. 5 參數選用及尺度範圍	 108 4. 3. 6 幾何模式	 109 4. 3. 7 降雨入滲分析執行	 109 4. 3. 8 邊坡穩定分析執行	 109 第五章 結果與討論	 112 5. 1 梨山地滑區降雨期間滲流分析地下水水位變動	 112 5. 1. 1 第一潛勢滑動面	 115 5. 1. 2 第二潛勢滑動面	 117 5. 1. 3 第三潛勢滑動面	 119 5. 1. 4 第四潛勢滑動面	 121 5. 1. 5 梨山地滑區不同颱風降雨型態時對地下水水位變動之影響	 123 5. 2 滲流邊界條件對滲流分析之影響評估	 125 5. 2. 1 滲流速度場分佈	 125 5. 2. 2 地下水水位、壓力水頭、安全係數及體積含水量	 128 5. 2. 3 地下水水位線與雨水入滲浸潤線間之變動對邊坡穩定性之影響	 130 5. 3 邊坡穩定影響因子參數研究	 131 5. 3. 1 地形因子 (β、H) 	 132 5. 3. 2 地質因子 (C、ψ、γ、ψb及k(u) ~u函數曲線) 	 140 5. 3. 3 水文因子 (颱風雨型、梅雨雨型及初始地下水水位) 	 153 5. 3. 4 崩積層厚度(dc) 	 161 5. 4 參數研究靈敏度分析	 164 第六章 結論與建議	 167 6. 1 結論	 167 6. 1. 1 梨山地滑區案例研究與數值模擬分析	 167 6. 1. 2 滲流邊界條件對滲流分析之影響評估	 167 6. 1. 3 邊坡穩定影響因子參數研究	 167 6. 2 建議	 169 參考文獻	 170 附錄A	 174 附錄B	 18...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Bu çalışmada, kumlu kil, düşük plastisiteli kil ve kum zeminlerin klasik zemin mekaniği ve doygun olmayan zemin mekaniği ilkelerine göre yeraltı su seviyesi değişimleriyle beraber şev stabilite analizleri sonucu elde edilen güvenlik sayıları incelenmiştir. Kumlu kil numunesi İstanbul Güneşli bölgesinden elde edilmiş olup, diğer numuneler daha önce yapılmış çalışmalardan elde edilmiştir. Laboratuvar çalışmaları Şubat 2014 – Temmuz 2014 tarihleri arasında İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Ord. Prof Dr. Hamdi Peynircioğlu Zemin Mekaniği Laboratuvarı’nda gerçekleştirilmiştir. Deneyler iki aşamalı olarak yapılmıştır. İlk aşama zeminin mühendislik ve fiziksel özelliklerinin belirlendiği; elek analizi, hidrometre, Atterberg limitleri analizi, piknometre, {{standart}} kompaksiyon ve kesme kutusu deneyleridir. İkinci aşamada ise zeminin doygun olmayan zemin mekaniği parametrelerini belirleyebilmek için basınç plakası deneyi uygulanmıştır. Kesme kutusu ve basınç plakasında kullanılan numuneler standart proktor deneyi sonrasında belirlenmiş olan optimum koşullara yakın koşullarda hazırlanmıştır. Şev stabilite analizlerinde kullanılan diğer numuneler için de farklı araştırmacılar tarafından benzer deneyler yapılmış olup, numunelerin doygun ve doygun olmayan parametreleri belirlenmiştir. Deneysel çalışmalar sonucunda elde edilmiş olan parametrelerle doygun ve doygun olmayan koşullarda şev stabilite analizleri yapılmış ve doygun olmayan parametrelerin elde edilen güvenlik sayısına etkisi incelenmiştir. Analizler, sıkıştırılarak hazırlanmış numunelerin zemin su karakteristik eğrisinden elde edilen uniform matrik emme basıncına göre, yeraltı su seviyesinin değişken olduğu ve zeminin tamamen suya doygun olduğu durumlar için yapılmış ve yeraltı su seviyesinin değişimiyle güvenlik sayısının değişimi araştırılmıştır.   Elde edilen sonuçlara göre; doygun olmayan zemin parametrelerinin şevlerin güvenlik sayısına etkisinin en çok gözlemlendiği numune kil oranının en yüksek olduğu numunedir. Numunelerde kum oranı arttıkça; doygun ve doygun olmayan zemin mekaniği ilkelerine göre yapılan analizlerin sonuçları arasındaki fark azalmaktadır. Yeraltı su seviyesinin yükselmesiyle her üç numunede de doygun ve doygun olmayan kabuller için elde edilen güvenlik sayıları birbirlerine yaklaşmakta; zeminin suya tamamen doygun olduğu durumda elde edilen güvenlik sayıları ise aynı olmaktadır. Şevler doygun duruma gelmeden de göçmeler meydana gelebildiğinden, doygun olmayan zemin mekaniğinin önemi artmaktadır. Analysis of {{slope stability}} {{is one of}} the main issues of geotechnical engineering. Natural or human made slopes’ problems are focus area, which geotechnical engineers have to bring a solution. There are main acceptances, which base on saturated soil mechanic principles to analyze slope stability.  However, this approach sometimes causes the uneconomical solutions. According to researches that were made in the last years, unsaturated soil mechanichs approach has been started to use in the slope stability analyses and this approach creates the economical and reliable results for slope stability analyses.   Depending of the developments in the technology, the laboratory devices has been used widely and the quality of devices has increased. Thanks to this development, soil mechanich acceptances has been started to change. The unsaturated soil mechanichs principles are one result of this change. In the scope of this thesis, the effects of properties of unsaturated soil mechanic’s parameters to factor of safety of slopes were searched. Effects of changing of ground water table level on the factor of safety of slopes and the different impacts of unsaturated soil mechanic principles on the various soil types were the main topics in the thesis. Although the unsaturated soil mechanic approach has been appeared since early of 1900 ’s, the development of acceptances has begun for last twenty years because of reasons, which was mentioned above paragraph. Especially for the dry conditions and the conditions where the ground water table level is far from the surface, the unsaturated soil mechanic parameters affect the stability of slopes, bearing capacity of foundations, consolidation and infiltration of soils. Unsaturated soil mechanic researches remark that the unsaturated soil parameters should not be ignored especially for clay soils. In this thesis, factor of safety that obtained from the results of slope stability analysis of sandy clay, low plasticity clay and poor graded sand soil are examined with the change of ground water table level for saturated and unsaturated soil mechanics principles.  The sandy clay sample is from Günesli vicinity of Istanbul and the other samples are got from the other researches. The thesis has two parts. In the first part, laboratory tests are available. The laboratory tests were performed in the Ord. Prof. Dr. Hamdi Peynircioğlu Soil Mechanics Laboratory, Istanbul Technical University between the dates February of 2014 and July of 2014.  The tests were performed by two stages. In the first stage, sieve analyses, hydrometer, Atterberg limits, pycnometer, standard compaction and direct shear tests are available. The second stage consists of pressure plate test, which gives the unsaturated soil properties. In the light of sieve analysis and Atterbeg limits, the soil sample that was obtained from the field was described as low plasticity clay according to Unified Soil Classification System. The samples, which were used for direct shear test and pressure plate test, were preapeared as near the optimum conditions these are defined from standart proctor test. The other samples, which were used for slope stability analyses have experienced to same tests from other researchers with sample obtained from field.   The Sample I is the sample which the experimentals applied in the labarotory by author of this thesis. The Sample II was taken from Gülsen’s research and the classifition of the soil is poor graded sand. The Sample II consists of 100 percent sand. The sample III is named as Indian Head Till is from Kutlu’s research. According to Unified Soil Classification System, the soil is low plasticity clay. For each soil samples, the parameters that were used in slope stability analyses were defined. These parameters were effective cohesion (c’) and effective internal friction angle (ɸ’) for saturated and unsaturated soil acceptances and soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) and matric suction for unsaturated soil acceptance. SWCC and matric suction was determined with pressure plate test for Sample I and Sample III and with tempe-pressure cell for Sample II. Both of the test devices use the axis translation technique. The axes translation technique was mentioned in the thesis with details.   Soil water characteristic curve {{is one of the}} main parameter, which specifies the behavior of unsaturated soils. Soil water characteristic curve is relationship of matric suction and degree or saturation or water content or volumetric water content. Soil water characteristic curve can be obtained from experimental, estimation or fitting methods. In the light of researches for the unsaturated soil mechanics, properties of soils as the clay or sand content, plasticity or coefficient of compressibility has significiant effects on the soil water characteristic curve. Suction pressure of soils is the other main parameter for unsaturated soil mechanic approaches. It includes both osmotic suction and matric suction parameters. Osmotic suction is related with chemical contents, which takes part in pores of soil. Because of difficulties to gauge the osmotic suction, it is usually neglected. Therefore, the matric suction becomes the main parameter for the suction pressure. The matric suction is difference between pore air pressure and pore water pressure. İt can be described as negative pore water pressure. Pore water pressure inceares under the ground water table level with depth and matric suction increases above the ground water table level. Researchs about unsaturated soil mechanics proove the positive effect of matric suction to the shear strength of soils. Because of ıts positive effects to the shear strength of soils, the calculations become more economical ıf we compare with saturated solution.   In the second part of the thesis, slope stability for saturated and unsaturated conditions was analyzed using parameters, which were obtained from experimental studies and the effect of unsaturated soil parameters on the factor of safety was defined. The change of factor of safety was examined with change of ground water table level. For each soil samples, same geometry of cross section was used for the models. Each stability of slopes was analyzed with the SLOPE/W, which takes part in GeoStudio packet programme. SLOPE/W programme benefits from Limit Eqiulibrium Methods. In the thesis, principles of Limit Equilibrium Methods and the usage of SLOPE/W are shared with details.  The results were obtained with Bishop Limit Equilibrium Method for each soil type. Mohr-Coulomb failure hpyothesis was accepted for the soil behavior. Three ground water conditions were examined for the solutions. For three soil samples, soil parameters for saturated and unsaturated acceptances were determined.    The first condition was the initial condition of the soils. There was no ground water level for initial conditions. For saturated soil acceptances, the parameters that were defined for the analysis were effective cohesion and effective internal friction, which were obtained from direct shear tests and unit weight of the soils. For unsaturated soil acceptances, the matric suction value was acted to effective cohesion. Defined cohesion for dry condition according to unsaturated acceptances was greater value than defined effective cohesion according to saturated acceptances. For unsaturated soil acceptances, soil water characteristic curve was necessary to account the cohesion value. Beside the soil water characteristic curve, to describe the cohesion of unsaturated soil acceptances for dry conditions, effective cohesion that was obtained from direct shear test and matric suction of the soil must be contributed to calculation of cohesion. The calculation of cohesion according to unsaturated soil principles for dry condition was told with details in the next chapters.   In the second condition for the soils, the ground water table level was defined and systematically it was assessed nearer positions to surface of ground. For saturated soil acceptances, the parameters which has determined for the stability analysis were effective cohesion, effective internal friction angle and unit weight of the soils. To get the factor of safety according to unsaturated soil acceptances, effective cohesion, effective internal friction <b>angle,</b> <b>unit</b> weight of soil and soil water characteristic curve were necessary. Soil water characteristic curve that was determined from experimental ways was defined in the programme related with volumetric water content and matric suction values.   For the third condition of the soil, soil pores was completely full of pore water. The ground water table level was fifty centimeter above of surface. The parameters were same with the conditions that ground water table level was defined. After the geometry of cross section, soil parameters and ground water conditions were defined, the factor of safety for the slope stability analyses was obtained.  SLOPE/W gave the crititical slip surfaces of circle and factor of safety for critical slip circle’s surface was the factor of safety value for the slope stability analyses.   The greatest factor of safety was obtained for the initial conditions according to unsaturated soil acceptance. The difference between saturated soil and unsaturated soil analyses was the most apparent value for Sample III. However, the difference was so little for the Sample II. That demonstrates, while the clay content was raising, unsaturated soil parameters had more significiant role in the shear strength theory.   While the ground water table level was increasing, factor of safety difference between saturated and unsaturated slope stability analyses decreased. This remarks that, while the soil was becoming more saturated, the effect of unsaturated soil parameters declined. With the increasing of ground water table level, factor of safety for unsaturated soil acceptances has significiantly declined for especially Sample III.   When the ground water table level was above of ground surface, there was no factor of safety difference between analyses with unsaturated soil principles and saturated soil principles. This is because there was no pore air pressure in the soil when the ground water table level above of ground surface. Because of this reason, unsaturated soil parameters had no effect on the shear strength of soils, when the soil pores were full of pore water. For the thesis, both of experimental and analytical studies were done. The results were presented with details. In the scope of the research, three soil samples were used. For a detailed study, the number of soil samples may increase. To define the ground water level, the rain infiltration case can be considered. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
