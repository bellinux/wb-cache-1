5000|$|This {{classification}} is for wheelchair basketball. Classification for {{the sport}} {{is done by the}} International Wheelchair Basketball Federation. Classification is extremely important in wheelchair basketball because when players point totals are added together, they cannot exceed fourteen points per team on the court at any time. Jane Buckley, writing for the Sporting Wheelies, describes the wheelchair basketball players in this classification as players having: [...] "May have some limb movement more control of their trunk. They are quite limited in their sideways movement." [...] The Australian Paralympic Committee defines this classification as: [...] "Players with good trunk movement in the forward direction to the floor and up again without <b>arm</b> <b>support.</b> They have good trunk rotation but no controlled sideways movement." [...] The International Wheelchair Basketball Federation defines a 3 point player as [...] "Good trunk movement in the forward direction to the floor and up again without <b>arm</b> <b>support.</b> Has good trunk rotation but no controlled sideways movement." [...] The Cardiff Celts, a wheelchair basketball team in Wales, explain this classification as, [...] "excellent stability of the trunk in a forwards and backwards direction. ... Typical Class 3 Disabilities include : L2-L4 paraplegia, with control of hip flexion and adduction movements, but without control of hip extension or abduction. Post-polio paralysis with minimal control of lower extremity movements. Hip disarticulation or above-knee amputees with very short residual limbs." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the largely}} Catholic Latgale region of Latvia, it was {{characteristic}} for the kokles to be constructed with {{an extension of}} the body beyond the peg line called a wing, that reinforces instrument's the sound and can also be used as an <b>arm</b> <b>support.</b> Estonian ethnologist Igor Tõnurist believes that the wing may be a more recent innovation, that developed sometime before the 14th century for the Baltic psaltery played in the Pskov and Novgorod lands and later was borrowed by some neighboring Baltic and Baltic Finnic people, such as Setos, Vepsians and Latgalians. In comparison with Kurzemes kokles, the finish of Latgale kokles is less thorough; the instrument is bigger and heavier, with more strings (sometimes even up to 12 and only in rare cases less than 9) and with a more sober decoration.|$|E

5000|$|... "Evidence from an Egyptian carving {{dating back}} to 2830 BC {{suggests}} that crutches have been used {{at least since the}} pharaohs ruled Egypt 5,000 years ago." [...] In 1917, Emile Schlick patented the first commercially produced crutch; the design consisted of a walking stick with an upper <b>arm</b> <b>support.</b> Later, A.R.

Through time, the design of crutches haven't changed much such that the classic design still is most commonly used. However, some modern inventor's have worked to develop innovative designs of this ancient assistive device in hopes to better address different types of patients.In 1997, forearm crutches got a boost when President Bill Clinton started wearing them after tearing his right quadriceps tendon. He called the forearm crutches his [...] "Stealth" [...] crutches. In a news conference, Clinton said, [...] "I think they were developed as an offshoot of B-2 technology...

50|$|By 1979 he was {{a regular}} driver on the Central Wisconsin (CWRA) circuit, {{finishing}} seventh in the season points. Originally from Illinois, Musgrave moved across the nearby state line {{so that he could}} race five nights per week in the CWRA. He raced at LaCrosse, State Park Speedway in Wausau, Grundy County Speedway, Wisconsin Dells Speedway (now Dells Raceway Park), and Waukegan. In 1981, he finished third in the points at Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR), two points behind Alan Kulwicki. Musgrave's highlight of the 1982 season was winning the Holiday 50 at Capital Speedway (now Madison International Speedway). Musgrave qualified the fastest five times in a row at WIR and was leading the points when he battered his wrist in a wreck. He returned the following week in a cast with a special <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> in the car. He finished third in points. Musgrave won ten CWRA features in 1983, including the Holiday 50 at Capital Super Speedway, the Triple Hot Dog Dash at Wisconsin Dells, and the Race of Champions at Capital's Oktober Nationals. Musgrave won seven features at Capital in 1984, along with two features at LaCrosse, two at State Park, and two at Wisconsin Dells. He ran out of money to fund his team in 1985, and he ended his season early. Musgrave returned in 1986 with a new car which contained several of his experimental ideas. He finished tenth in CWRA points even though he started the season over a month late. He had numerous feature wins that season, including the Firecracker 100 at Capital.|$|E
