25|$|When {{dialogue}} journals {{are used}} with adult students in second language settings, {{and also in}} teacher preparation, personal and family concerns tend to dominate the topics introduced by both instructor and students, such as the trauma of migration for new immigrants. Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, & Young found some positive outcomes of dialogue journal use for middle school students at risk for <b>academic</b> <b>failure,</b> social isolation, and dropping out of school. A unique use of dialogue journals with adolescents in an HIV/STI prevention program found that the individualized written interactions helped assess participants’ understanding and internalization of information {{in a way that}} addressed unsafe behavior, built trust, and engaged those who were less likely to participate in class discussions.|$|E
25|$|Contrastingly {{in other}} Asian cultures, {{especially}} for families in South Asia and the Far East, family honor depends on other {{factors such as}} education. Academic success of a student {{is seen as a}} source of pride and honor for the Asian family. Therefore, both the Asian student and the parents work hard to avoid <b>academic</b> <b>failure</b> which brings shame to the family. In the past, honor in East Asia was also linked to success in the battlefield. In Japan, for example, ritualized suicide practices such as harakiri were committed by Japanese samurai for centuries {{in the event of a}} defeat in battle. Instead of being captured or living with the shame of defeat, harakiri was committed in order to preserve the honor of their families.|$|E

25|$|According to Gillberg, {{clinically}} severe form DAMP (or ADHD+DCD) affects about 1.5% of {{the general}} population of school age children; another few per cent are affected by more moderate variants. Boys are overrepresented; girls are currently probably underdiagnosed. There are many overlapping conditions, including conduct disorder, depression/anxiety, and <b>academic</b> <b>failure.</b> There is a strong link with autism spectrum disorders in severe DAMP. Familial factors and pre- and perinatal risk factors account for much of the variance. Psychosocial risk factors appear to increase the risk of marked psychiatric abnormality in DAMP. Outcome in early adult age was psychosocially poor in one study in almost 60% of unmedicated cases. About half of all cases with ADHD have DCD, and conversely, ADHD occurs in about half of all cases of DCD.|$|E
25|$|Permission to sit the Pass School was granted. Betjeman famously {{decided to}} offer a paper in Welsh. Osbert Lancaster tells the story that a tutor came by train twice a week (first class) from Aberystwyth to teach Betjeman. However, Jesus College {{had a number of}} Welsh tutors who more {{probably}} would have taught him. Betjeman finally had to leave {{at the end of the}} Michaelmas term, 1928. Betjeman did pass his Divinity examination on his third try but was 'sent down' after failing the Pass School. He had achieved a satisfactory result in only one of the three required papers (on Shakespeare and other English authors). Betjeman's <b>academic</b> <b>failure</b> at Oxford rankled with him for the rest of his life and he was never reconciled with C.S. Lewis, towards whom he nursed a bitter detestation. This situation was perhaps complicated by his enduring love of Oxford, from which he accepted an honorary doctorate of letters in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Cobb {{never had}} an easy time as husband and father. His {{children}} {{found him to be}} demanding, yet also capable of kindness and extreme warmth. He expected his sons to be exceptional athletes in general and baseball players in particular. Tyrus Raymond, Jr. flunked out of Princeton (where he had played on the varsity tennis team), much to his father's dismay. The elder Cobb subsequently traveled to the Princeton campus and beat his son with a whip to ensure against future <b>academic</b> <b>failure.</b> Tyrus Raymond, Jr. then entered Yale University and became captain of the tennis team while improving his academics, but was then arrested twice in 1930 for drunkenness and left Yale without graduating. Cobb helped his son deal with his pending legal problems, but then permanently broke off with him. Even though Tyrus Raymond, Jr. finally reformed and eventually earned an M.D. from the Medical College of South Carolina and practiced obstetrics and gynecology in Dublin, Georgia, until his premature death at 42 on September 9, 1952, from a brain tumor, his father remained distant.|$|E

The latter requires girls to collect dining room plates and litter during their lunch break. Otherwise discipline is dealt with on an ad-hoc basis, through dialogue with the girls, their tutors and parents. <b>Academic</b> <b>failures</b> are addressed by direct contact with parents and 'catch-up' sessions.|$|R
25|$|Radiation therapy uses special {{equipment}} to send {{high doses of}} radiation to the cancer cells. Most cells in the body grow and divide to form new cells. But cancer cells grow and divide faster {{than many of the}} normal cells around them. Radiation works by making small breaks in the DNA inside cell. Radiation might not be a choice of treatment if the tumour was diagnosed on the late stage or is located on vulnerable places. Moreover, radiation causes significant side effects if used in children aged 0–14. It was determined to be a beneficial treatment but it causes significant side effects that influence the lifestyle of the young patients. Radiotherapy is the use of high-energy rays, usually x-rays and similar rays (such as electrons) to treat disease. It works by destroying cancer cells in the area that's treated. Although normal cells can also be damaged by radiotherapy, they can usually repair themselves, but cancer cells can't. If the tumour was found on the late stage, it requires patient`s higher radiation explosion and might be harmful for the organs.Radiotherapy is determined to be an effective treatment in adults but it causes significant side effects that can influence patients` daily living. In children radiotherapy mostly causes long-term side effects such as hearing loss and blindness. Children who had received cranial radiotherapy are deemed at a high risk for <b>academic</b> <b>failure</b> and cognitive delay.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with his}} duties at the Lampoon, Benchley {{acted in a}} number of {{theatrical}} productions, including Hasty Pudding productions of The Crystal Gazer and Below Zero. He also held the position of κροκόδιλος for the Pudding in 1912. Benchley kept these achievements in mind as he began to contemplate a career for himself after college. Charles Townsend Copeland, an English professor, recommended that Benchley go into writing, and Benchley and future Benchley illustrator Gluyas Williams from the Lampoon considered going into freelance work writing and illustrating theatrical reviews. Another English professor recommended that Benchley speak with the Curtis Publishing Company; but Benchley was initially against the idea, and ultimately took a position at a civil service office in Philadelphia. Owing to an <b>academic</b> <b>failure</b> in his senior year due to an illness, Benchley would not receive his Bachelor of Arts from Harvard until the completion of his credits in 1913. His shortcoming was the submission of a [...] "scholarly paper" [...] – which Benchley eventually rectified by a treatise on the U.S. – Canadian Fisheries Dispute, written {{from the point of view}} of a cod. He took a position with Curtis shortly after he received his diploma.|$|E

2500|$|Following the 1948 {{football}} season, Lombardi {{accepted an}} assistant's job, at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, {{a position that}} would greatly influence his future coaching style.

[...] "As integral as religion was to [...] sense of self, {{it was not until}} he reached West Point and combined his spiritual discipline with Blaik's military discipline that his coaching persona began to take its mature form." [...] Blaik's emphasis on execution would become a trademark of Lombardi's coaching. Lombardi coached at West Point for five seasons, with varying results. The 1949 and 1950 seasons were successful. But the 1951 and 1952 seasons were not successful due to the aftermath of a cadet cribbing scandal (a violation of the Cadet Honor Code) which was revealed in the spring of 1951. As a result, 43 of the 45 members of the varsity football team were discharged by administrative order. [...] "Decades later, looking back on his rise, Lombardi came to regard..." [...] Blaik's decision not to resign [...] "...as a pivotal moment in his [...] career"— it taught him perseverance. After the seasons of 1951 and 1952 not much was expected from the 1953 team as it had also lost six players due to <b>academic</b> <b>failure.</b> The team of 1953 however did go on to be 7–1–1, as Lombardi had a bigger role than ever in coaching the team. Following these five seasons at Army, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching position with the New York Giants.|$|E

40|$|Major American {{universities}} and colleges that participate in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I athletics have been struggling {{for the past decade}} with {{the problem of how to}} address <b>academic</b> <b>failures</b> of student-athletes. This problem has become one of particular conceren because many student-athletes, for whatever reason, do not graduate. It has been concluded that four principal factors contribute to this problem: first, pressure from alumni, athletic administrators and fans to win at any cost; second, recruitment of student-athletes who lack the necessary academic preparation to be successful in academic and athletic programs; third, the fact that student-athletes register for a variety of courses which will not lead to graduation; and fourth, the substantial amount of negative publicity {{universities and}} colleges are receiving from the media regarding <b>academic</b> <b>failures</b> of student-athletes (Baker, 1984; Gabriel, 1984; Monaghan, 1984). ^ In an effort to solve the academic problems of some athletes, many major institutions have created support service programs which provide academic advising and counseling solely for student-athletes.
