This transition would require military aircraft to file flight plans and obey civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|Saville was a {{technical}} and scientific-minded leader who helped pioneer advanced mathematics for operations research, and computer systems for centralized coordination of air defense.

After retiring from the military, Saville worked in the defense industry.|$|E

5|$|According to Roberts, it {{is clear}} that the next phase of {{negotiations}} was intended to go beyond prisoner exchanges, as the prisoner of war negotiator Stilinović was not involved. Đilas and Velebit were passed through the German lines to Sarajevo and were then flown to Zagreb on 25 March in <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>aircraft.</b> These negotiations were with German representatives supervised by Ott, apparently on all the points discussed at Gornji Vakuf, and the Partisans made it clear to the Germans that their proposals did not amount to an offer of surrender. Velebit met personally with Glaise-Horstenau, as the Austrian had known Velebit's father, a Yugoslav general. After this first visit to Zagreb, Velebit visited Partisan commanders in Slavonia and eastern Bosnia passing on orders for the suspension of attacks on the Germans and their rail communications, and the release of prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Ellis Charles Wackett, CB, CBE (13August 1901– 3August 1984) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Its chief engineer from 1935 to 1959, he served on the RAAF's controlling body, the Air Board, for a record seventeen years, and has been credited with infusing operations with new standards of airworthiness. Commencing his service career as a Royal Australian Navy cadet during World WarI, Wackett transferred to the Air Force in 1923 while on an engineering course in Britain. He qualified as a pilot before completing his studies and returning to Australia, where he inaugurated parachute instruction within the RAAF and made the country's first freefall descent from <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>aircraft</b> in 1926. The following year, he led a three-month survey flight to Papua New Guinea.|$|E

25|$|The Boeing P-8 Poseidon (formerly the Multimission Maritime Aircraft or MMA) is <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{developed}} for the United States Navy (USN). The aircraft has been developed by Boeing Defense, Space & Security, modified from the 737-800ERX. The P-8 conducts anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASUW), and shipping interdiction, along with an early warning self-protection (EWSP) ability, otherwise known as electronic support measures (ESM). This involves carrying torpedoes, depth charges, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and other weapons. It is able to drop and monitor sonobuoys. It is designed to operate {{in conjunction with the}} Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton Broad Area Maritime Surveillance unmanned aerial vehicle.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009 a coup d'état ousted President Manuel Zelaya; he {{was taken}} in <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>aircraft</b> to {{neighboring}} Costa Rica. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called {{for the restoration of}} Zelaya. Several Latin American nations including Mexico temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico. The United States sent out mixed messages after the coup; Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support for Zelaya's return to power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advised by John Negroponte, the former Reagan-era to Honduras implicated in the Iran-Contra affair, refrained from expressing support. She has since explained that the US would have had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster a military coup, although the US has a record of ignoring these events when it chooses. Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Chávez' Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples of our America (ALBA), and had actually joined in 2008. After the 2009 coup, Honduras withdrew its membership.|$|E
25|$|According to the Mexican government, {{the attacks}} of that day {{were one of the}} most brazen moves by {{organized}} crime against Mexican security forces in the ongoing Mexican Drug War (2006–present). The attack was also unique in the sense that a relatively new criminal group in Mexico like that CJNG was willing to confront the government head-on. Though organized crime groups in Mexico had used rocket launchers against security forces in the past, {{it was the first time}} in history that they had shot down <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>aircraft.</b> That attacks of that day showed the government that the CJNG had the manpower and operational capacity to respond against the crackdowns and efforts of the Mexican government. The CJNG's influence in Mexico's criminal landscape grew significantly since 2009–2010. The group was formed as a splinter organization of the Milenio Cartel and Sinaloa Cartel after several of its leaders were arrested or killed. Their international drug trafficking operations, specifically for heroin and methamphetamine, increased the group's financial power and capacity. Their market share growth in Mexican territory was also correlated to the arrest and deaths of their rival criminal group leaders like the Knights Templar Cartel and Los Zetas. The CJNG's stronghold, Jalisco, gave the group a strategic advantage from its competitors since Jalisco ranked high in industrial output and gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E

500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} {{that the incidence of}} deaths in commercial aviation accidents had risen sharply in 1971, up from 146 deaths in 1970 and 158 deaths in 1969. Additionally, these deaths had occurred at a time when airlines were cutting back flights due to the economic recession, and airlines had flown about 6% fewer hours in 1971 than 1970. The eight fatal accidents of 1971 included three mid-air collisions and four landing approach crashes; one of these collisions, All Nippon Airways Flight 58, which also involved <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>aircraft,</b> became the deadliest air disaster worldwide at the time it took place with 162 deaths.

He had visited the Irvin Air Chute Company while in the US during 1924 and recommended purchase at the time, but a backlog of orders for the RAF meant that the Australian equipment took almost two years to arrive. Flying Officer Ellis Wackett was assigned to instruct volunteers at RAAF Richmond, and made the country's first freefall descent from <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>aircraft,</b> an Airco DH.9, on 26May. Williams himself jumped over Point Cook on 5August, having decided that it would set [...] "a good example if, before issuing an order for the compulsory wearing of parachutes, I showed my own confidence in them..." [...] Though his descent took him perilously close to the base water tank ("I {{thought it would be}} a poor ending to drown there, or even to be pulled out dripping wet") and [...] "too close to be comfortable to a 30,000 volt electric transmission line", he completed the exercise unscathed.|$|E

ARVN General Trần Văn Cẩm was captured in Tuy Hòa after his helicopter had landed on the ground, where he tried to survey the battlefield. The destruction of the ARVN 22nd Infantry Division, which had about 10,000 fully equipped men, stirred up chaos in Nha Trang; more than 3,000 South Vietnamese recruits from the Lam Son Army Training Centre retreated into the city, and another 1,000 soldiers went on a rampage and looted goods on the main streets. The chief of Khánh Hòa Province, Colonel Ly Ba Pham, boarded <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>aircraft</b> and flew out to Phan Rang, after he had notified Saigon that [...] "the situation is irreversible". On the afternoon of April 2, Nha Trang was overrun by the North Vietnamese, and not a single battle was fought in its defence.
