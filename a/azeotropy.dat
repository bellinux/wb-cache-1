40|$|Distillation {{is one of}} the {{dominating}} separation processes, {{but there}} are some problems as inseparable mixtures areformed in some cases. This phenomenon is called as <b>azeotropy.</b> It is essential to understand <b>azeotropy</b> in any distillationprocesses since azeotropes, i. e. inseparable mixtures, cannot be separated by ordinary distillation. In this study, to constructa model which predicts the azeotropic formation at any pressure, a novel approach using support vector machine (SVM) ispresented. The SVM method is used to classify data in the two classes, that is, azeotropes and non-azeotropes. 13 variables,including pressure, were used as explanatory variables in this model. From the result of the SVM models which were constructed with data measured at 1 atm and data measured at all pressures, the 1 atm model showed a higher prediction performance to the data measured at 1 atm than the all pressure model. Thus, for improving the performance of the all pressuremodel, we focused on intermolecular forces of solvents. The SVM models were constructed with only data of the solventshaving same subgroups. The accuracy of the model increased and it is expected that this proposed method will be used topredict azeotropic formation at any pressure with high accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Binary fluid {{mixtures}} {{display a}} wide array of fluid phase behavior ranging from simple vapor-liquid equilibrium diagrams to more complicated topology like <b>azeotropy</b> and heteroazeotropy. As a first step towards understanding the phenomena of equilibrium of binary molecular systems, the properties of binary monoatomic fluids have been studied in this work. An additional simplification made in this work is that of a symmetrical binary system where all similar molecules interact via the hard-core Yukawa (HCY) potential, u(r), while the dissimilar molecules interact via a potential, delta u(r) where delta is a scalar parameter. The value of delta here is 0. 75, which leads to the dissimilar molecules showing a tendency to dislike one another and the resulting phase diagram is such that the mixing-demixing line intersects the vapor-liquid equilibrium curve away from the vapor-liquid critical point. The effect of the variable potential range parameter of the HCY potential on the topology of the phase diagrams is investigated using grand canonical transition matrix Monte Carlo simulations and the conditions of temperature and pressure at which the system exhibits <b>azeotropy</b> and heteroazeotropy are ascertained. We find that the densities of the mixtures, as predicted by our simulation at equimolar concentrations, are in close agreement with the self-consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation results of Scholl-Paschinger and co-workers.

40|$|We have {{calculated}} gravity‐induced {{density and}} concentration gradients using scaled equations of state fashioned after that of Leung and Griffiths for binary mixtures near gas–liquid critical lines. The mixtures considered here {{are those of}} helium‐ 3 and helium‐ 4 and {{of carbon dioxide and}} ethane.

The concentration gradients in the helium mixture have the same appearance as the density gradients. In the carbon dioxide–ethane system, however, the form of the concentration profile varies greatly, depending on the overall composition. Moreover, the temperature at which a mixture separates into two phases is slightly different from that expected for the mixture in the absence of gravity. We have also examined the case where a mixture is subjected to a large gravitational field such as can be generated in a centrifuge and found that, although the density gradient in all the mixtures is like that in pure fluids, the concentration gradients in the mixtures of carbon dioxide and ethane have complex features related to the presence of critical <b>azeotropy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Using {{explicit}} analytical computations, generic {{occurrence of}} inequivalence between {{two or more}} statistical ensembles is obtained for a large class of equilibrium states of two-dimensional and geophysical turbulent flows. The occurrence of statistical ensemble inequivalence is shown {{to be related to}} previously observed phase transitions in the equilibrium flow topology. We find in these turbulent flow equilibria, two mechanisms for the appearance of ensemble equivalences, that were not observed in any physical systems before. These mechanisms are associated respectively with second-order <b>azeotropy</b> (simultaneous appearance of two second-order phase transitions), and with bicritical points (bifurcation from a first-order to two second-order phase transition lines). The important roles of domain geometry, of topography, and of a screening length scale (the Rossby radius of deformation) are discussed. It is found that decreasing the screening length scale (making interactions more local) surprisingly widens the range of parameters associated with ensemble inequivalence. These results are then generalized to a larger class of models, and applied to a complete description of an academic model for inertial oceanic circulation, the Fofonoff flow.

40|$|Recently we {{proposed}} a new approach for analyzing and understanding dynamics and feasibility of combined reaction separation processes (Grüner and Kienle, 2004). The apprach is based on assumption of simultaneous phase and reaction equilibrium and {{can be viewed as}} an extension of the well-known equilibrium theory developed by Rhee et. al. (1986, 1989) among other non-reactive separation processes. It makes use of transformed concentration variables, which were first indtroduces by Doherty and co-worker (1987) for the steady state design of reactive distillation processes. It was shown that these transformed concentration variables can be directly generalized to the corresponding dynamic problem. Further, they can also be applied to other reactive separation processes, like fixed-bed as well as moving bed chromatographic reactors, for example. The approach provides profound insight into the dynamic behavior of these processes reveals inherent bounds feasible operation caused by reactive <b>azeotropy.</b> In the present contribution the methods are applied to ternary reaction systems of type 2 A B + C. It is shown that in the first case total conversion is only possible if reactant A has intermediate affinity to the solid phase. If A has highest or lowest affinity to the solid phase conversion, is limited due to reactive <b>azeotropy</b> for any feed concentration. In contrast to this in the second case the behavior depends on the feed concentration. If the feed concentration is sufficiently low, total conversion is possible for any order of affinities to the solid phase. Instead for high feed concentrations similar limitations occur as in the first case. As a practical example for the second reaction scheme, some ester hydrolysis reactions of methyl and ethyl formate, as well as methyl and ethyl acetate are discussed by Seidel-Morgenstern and co-workers (2004). Water is taken as a solvent in large excess and therefore has approximately constant concentration. In this application, the ester has always the highest affinity to the solid phase. It is shown that in the present case no limitations occur within the feasible range of feed concentration below the solubility boundary. The theoretical predictions are in agreement with simulation results from a rigorous model and with experimental observations. References: Barbosa, D., M. F. Doherty, Pro. R. Soc. Lond.

We focussed our work on the understanding of the microscopic conditions that control the phase behaviour of these mixtures, with a particular emphasis of the eﬀect on the liquid-liquid separation and the stabilisation of n -alkane + perﬂuoro-n -alkane mixtures when a diblock surfactant is added. We selected the n -heptane + perﬂuoromethane binary mixture, and studied the changes on the phase behaviour when a symmetric (same number of alkyl and perﬂuoroalkyl chemical groups) or an asymmetric (diﬀerent number of alkyl and perﬂuoroalkyl chemical groups) diblock surfactants is added to the binary mixture. We have obtained the phase diagrams {{of a wide range of}} binary and ternary mixtures at diﬀerent thermodynamic conditions. We have found a variety of interesting behaviours as we modify the alkyl or/and the perﬂuoroalkyl chain-length of the diblock surfactants: the usual changes in the vapour-liquid phase separation, changes in the type of phase diagrams (typically from type I to type V phase behaviour according to the Scott and Konynenburg classiﬁcation), <b>azeotropy,</b> and Bancroft points. We noted that the main eﬀect of adding a symmetric or an asymmetric surfactant to the n -heptane + perﬂuoromethane mixture is to stabilise the system, i. e., to decrease the two-phase (liquid-liquid) immiscibility region of the ternary diagram as the surfactant concentration is increased...|$|E
