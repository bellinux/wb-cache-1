50|$|One of {{the first}} {{problems}} he encountered with the Great Yarmouth MR9s was, {{that in order for}} the <b>automatic</b> <b>bypass</b> vacuum generator to provide sufficient vacuum for braking assistance idling speed had to be kept low, this resulted in an engine straining at its mountings. Eventually failure of the mountings happened on one of them but not before another managed to shed its dynamo whilst in service, others had sheared a number of chassis brackets. He also found the gearchange linkage (although it kept the engine in place when the mountings failed) developed far too much free play and in order to select reverse on one he had to open the half-door on the passenger side of the cab. Others managed to grind to a halt when two gears were selected simultaneously.|$|E
40|$|In {{uninterruptible}} {{power supplies}} (UPS) using an <b>automatic</b> <b>bypass</b> switch, {{to reduce the}} transients due to the switch commutations, it is convenient that the voltage waveforms produced by the inverter are synchronized with the grid ones. In three-phase UPS, the inverter controller employs, as reference signals, {{the components of the}} grid voltage phasor, referred to a fix reference frame, suitably multiplied by an amplitude correction factor. Generally, the reference signals are affected by harmonics and amplitude unbalances. Therefore, improper synchronization between the inverter outputs and the grid voltages can arise. To improve the synchronization, many solutions based on a phase locked loop (PLL) system have been proposed in literature. The paper proposes a different PLL structure employing a Steady-State Linear Kalman Filter (SSLKF), based on a third-order linear and time-invariant observation model. Such filter is able to provide an accurate tracking of the grid voltage phasor also in critical operating conditions. The paper describes, at first, different PLL structures and then the proposed architecture based on a prediction-correction filter and its implementation on a DSP controller. Finally, a comparison, obtained by simulation, with traditional filters and some significant experimental results on a pre-production prototype are carried out. Â© 2008 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{has become}} one of the most important topics in computing. To meet the ever increasing demands of the mobile market, the next generation of processors will have to deliver a high compute performance at an extremely limited energy budget. Wide single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) architectures provide a promising solution, as they have the potential to achieve high compute performance at a low energy cost. We propose a configurable wide SIMD architecture that utilizes explicit datapath techniques to further optimize energy efficiency without sacrificing computational performance. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture, multiple instantiations of the proposed wide SIMD architecture and its <b>automatic</b> <b>bypassing</b> counterpart, as well as a baseline RISC processor, are implemented. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed architecture is efficient and scalable in terms of area, performance, and energy. In a 128 -PE SIMD processor, the proposed architecture is able to achieve an average of 206 times speed-up and reduces the total energy dissipation by 48. 3 % on average and up to 94 %, compared to a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processor. Compared to the corresponding SIMD architecture with <b>automatic</b> <b>bypassing,</b> an average of 64 % of all register file accesses is avoided by the 128 -PE, explicitly bypassed SIMD. For total energy dissipation, an average of 27. 5 %, and maximum of 43. 0 %, reduction is achieved...|$|R

Designs typically include redundancy with automatic fault detection, automatic fault isolation, and <b>automatic</b> fault <b>bypass.</b> These reconfigure systems without human intervention after combat damage and normal failure.|$|R
50|$|Systems with {{spare parts}} that are {{energized}} but that lack <b>automatic</b> fault <b>bypass</b> are not actually redundant because human action {{is required to}} restore operation after every failure.

40|$|We {{describe}} <b>automatic</b> <b>bypassing,</b> {{a desirable}} optimization of Eden's implementation {{aimed at reducing}} the number of messages and/or threads at runtime. Eden [BLOMP 97] extends the lazy functional language Haskell with a set of coordination features, aimed to express parallel algorithms. These include process abstractions (or process schemes) and process instantiations (or applications of a process scheme to actual inputs). When a new process is instantiated, their input and output channels are connected to its parent process. This implies that, in principle, only tree [...] like process topologies can be created. But the aimed topology may not be hierarchical (e. g. pipelines, grids, etc.). It is desirable to be able to connect every producer to its actual consumer, trying to avoid the intermediate processes frequently used only to set up the topology. The strategy consists of a combination of compile time analysis and runtime support. Both are explained in detail. Also, the savin [...] ...|$|R

50|$|If {{a system}} is {{designed}} with both redundancy and <b>automatic</b> fault <b>bypass,</b> then MTBF is the anticipated lifespan of the system if these features cover all possible failure modes (infinity for all practical purposes). Such systems will continue without noticeable interruption when these conditions are satisfied unless there are secondary failures. This is called active redundancy, which requires no maintenance to prevent mission failure. Active redundancy is required for systems that cannot be maintained, such as satellites.|$|R
40|$|The {{automatic}} stereo warehouse {{system is}} a storage system with multi-storey warehouse, by which the automation access and integrated automation management are realized in the computer's direct control and management. The emerging, <b>bypass</b> <b>automatic</b> stereo warehouse has gained more and more application in rapid access. The stacker's working time directly affects {{the efficiency of the}} warehouse. To improve the <b>bypass</b> <b>automatic</b> warehouse efficiency and analyze the stacker route, an integrated optimization model considering the export selection and the path picking is established. The model aims to the picking task cycle and develops the population's generating method of genetic algorithm, then solves the optimization model. The last section in this stage is the initial point of the next optimization stage, using the nearest neighbor method to find the optimal export location. Simulation and practical application show that the model and the algorithm are feasible and effective...|$|R
40|$|A {{challenging}} part of International Space Station (ISS) {{thermal control}} design {{is the ability}} to incorporate design changes into an integrated system without negatively impacting performance. The challenge presents itself in that the typical ISS Internal Active Thermal Control System (IATCS) consists of an integrated hardware/software system that provides active coolant resources to a variety of users. Software algorithms control the IATCS to specific temperatures, flow rates, and pressure differentials {{in order to meet the}} user-defined requirements. What may seem to be small design changes imposed on the system may in fact result in system instability or the temporary inability to meet user requirements. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief description of the solution process and analyses used to implement one such design change that required the incorporation of an <b>automatic</b> coolant <b>bypass</b> in the ISS Node 2 element...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{innovative}} sensor suited to perform real-time measurements of operating voltage and current, open-circuit voltage, and short-circuit current of string-connected photovoltaic (PV) panels is presented. An effective disconnection system {{ensures that the}} sensor {{does not affect the}} behavior of the string during the measurement phase and offers many benefits like the <b>automatic</b> detection of <b>bypass</b> events; moreover, the sensor does not require additional cables thanks to a wireless communication and a power supply section based on energy harvesting. An extensive experimental campaign is performed to prove the reliability and usefulness of the sensor for continuous monitoring of PV plants. The capability to detect faults and accurately localize malfunctioning panels in a PV string is highlighte...|$|R
50|$|In April 2010, a Puget Sound Energy began a US$200 {{million project}} to {{rehabilitate}} and upgrade the power plant. The project included retrofitting {{the first four}} of the generators in Plant 1 and replacing the fifth. A turbine-generator would be replaced in Plant 2 as well. The weir was lowered to 16 ft in height, lengthened by 37 ft and the water-intake structure was replaced. Lowering the weir will help reduce flood waters upstream of the falls. The penstocks, which feed the power plants with water, were to be upgraded as well. Finally, <b>automatic</b> shut-off and <b>bypass</b> valves were installed for Plant 2. The shut-off valves will better prepare the plant for emergencies and the bypass valves will allow water to flow downstream in the case that Plant 2 is offline. To promote tourism, recreation and culture, several upgrades to include new visitor centers, hiking trails, a boardwalk and improved landscaping were implemented. Renovations on Plant 2 were completed in April 2013. The new 6.5 MW Francis turbine generator in Plant 1 and the entire project was finished in mid-2014. The project raised the installed capacity of the power plant from 44.4 MW to 53.9 MW.|$|R
40|$|In many {{real-world}} applications, ego-motion estimation and mapping must {{be conducted}} online. In the robotics world, especially, real-time motion estimates {{are important for}} control of autonomous vehicles, while online generated maps are crucial for obstacle avoidance and path planning. Further, the complete map of a traversed environment can be taken as an input for further processing such as scene segmentation, 3 D reasoning, and virtual reality. To date, fusing {{a large amount of}} data from a variety of sensors in real-time remains a nontrivial problem. The problem is particularly hard if is to be solved in 3 D, accurately, robustly, and in a small form factor. This thesis proposes to tackle the problem by leveraging range, vision, and inertial sensing in a coarse-to-fine manor, through multi-layer processing. In a modularized processing pipeline, modules taking light computation execute at high frequencies to gain robustness w. r. t. high-rate, rapid motion. Modules consuming heavy processing run at low frequencies to ensure accuracy in resulting motion estimates and maps. Further, the modularized processing pipeline is capable of handling sensor degradation by <b>automatic</b> reconfiguration <b>bypassing</b> failure modules. Vision-based methods typically fail in low-light or texture-less scenes. Likewise, lidar-based methods are problematic in symmetric or extruded environments such as a long and straight corridor. When such degradation occurs, the proposed pipeline automatically determines a degraded subspace in the problem state space, and solves the problem partially in the well-conditioned subspace. Consequently, the final solution is formed by combination of the âhealthyâ parts from each module. The proposed ego-motion estimation and mapping methods have been validated in extensive experiments ranging from car-mounted, hand-carried, to drone-attached setups. Experiments are conducted in various environments covering structured urban areas as well as unstructured natural scenes. Results indicate that the methods can carry out high-precision estimation over a long distance of travel as well as robustness w. r. t. high-speed, aggressive motion and environmental degradation...|$|R
