5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and <b>are</b> <b>legal</b> to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E

5|$|TNA held a No Disqualification {{match between}} Abyss, who was {{accompanied}} by James Mitchell, and Sabu next. Its duration was 11 minutes and 30 seconds. This was originally promoted as Abyss versus Sabu, however, a No Disqualification stipulation was added during the event. In a No Disqualification match, weapons <b>are</b> <b>legal,</b> as well as outside interference, with a victor determined only by pinfall or submission. In the final minutes, Abyss retrieved a bag of thumbtacks which were hidden under the ring.

This led to Abyss slamming Sabu back-first onto the barbed-wire wrapped steal chair with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver to win the encounter at 10 minutes and 48 seconds.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 Lethal Lockdown {{match was}} the seventh bout on the card, between Team Cage (Christian Cage, Matt Morgan, Kevin Nash, Rhino, and Sting) and Team Tomko (Tomko, A.J. Styles, James Storm, and Team 3D). The {{duration}} of the contest was 26 minutes and 45 seconds. A Lethal Lockdown match is fought under no disqualification rules, in which weapons <b>are</b> <b>legal</b> and one wrestler from each team starts the match in the cage. Afterwards, members from each team enter at time intervals until all wrestlers {{are involved in the}} bout so a pinfall or submission can occur. Cage and Styles started the match. Brother Ray, Rhino, Storm, Nash, Brother Devon, Morgan, Tomko, and Sting were the order of entrances for the contest. Shortly after Sting's entrance, a roof covered in weapons was lowered onto the cage. With Sting's participation all men were involved in the match, as such a pinfall or submission could now occur. During the encounter, Cage set up a table on top of the roof of the cage. Later, he and Styles were fighting on top of a ladder on top of the cage, when Storm pushed over the ladder causing them both to crash through the table. Storm then climbed down from the roof into the cage, where Rhino tackled and pinned him to secure the victory for Team Cage.|$|E
5|$|The Engineering Experiment Station {{was renamed}} the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1984. A {{separate}} organization, originally called the Industrial Development Council, {{changed its name}} to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in February 1946, and finally to the Georgia Tech Research Corporation in 1984. There <b>are</b> <b>legal</b> difficulties when an American university wishes to accept contracts from some entities, especially the federal government, so the second organization is a contracting organization. Most importantly, it allows the university to perform multi-year contracts that are not possible under state law, which requires that money received must be spent in the same fiscal year. The name change coincided with a shift in focus toward obtaining industrial research contracts in addition to its contracts with the federal government. GTRI expanded its footprint in the mid to late 1980s: the Centennial Research Building opened on {{the north end of the}} Georgia Tech campus in 1985, providing expanded lab and office space, and the electromagnetic radiation measurement range was established at GTRI's Cobb County research facility.|$|E
