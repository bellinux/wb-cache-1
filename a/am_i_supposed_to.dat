2500|$|Gaye {{had also}} been deeply {{affected}} by the social ills plaguing the United States at the time, and covered the track [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", in 1969, which became a UK hit for Gaye in 1970. Gaye cited the 1965 Watts riots as a pivotal moment in his life in which he asked himself, [...] "with the world exploding around me, how <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> keep singing love songs?"

[...] MacKenzie was not specifically referring to the coverage of the Hillsborough disaster and made no mention of the tragedy during the interview, but the Liverpool Echo published a piece reporting MacKenzie's statements and criticising the apparent lack of shame or regret over the Hillsborough coverage implied by them (and the fact that MacKenzie may still regard the misleading coverage as a [...] "good story").|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} the What's Going On album, Gaye recorded {{a cover of}} the song, [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary, including Curtis Mayfield. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by The Temptations in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social {{events such as the}} 1965 Watts riots and once asked himself, [...] "with the world exploding around me, how <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> keep singing love songs?"

[...] In the 1980s, Donahue was the first national television program to reveal widespread child molestation by Catholic priests, something for which he was widely criticized. In 2002 he told Oprah Winfrey, [...] "I once did a priest pedophilia show on St. Patrick's Day, and a priest called in and said, 'How <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> work on a playground with children?'

Before American Idol, he was a non-profit organizer, working with children with special needs. He has spoken of suffering from emotional depression and credited the children that he worked with for helping him to recover from his illness. He has also said that the children motivated him to audition for American Idol. He auditioned in Pittsburgh with [...] "How <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Supposed</b> <b>to</b> Live Without You".

Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her?

He stopped drawing and painting and concentrated only on photography, working in the disorderly conditions of his home. Of the transition, he says, [...] "The paintings were already painted, the drawings drawn. What <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do? <b>I</b> looked for new media.

(Bell also sang backup on Joe Cocker's [...] "Bye Bye Blackbird" [...] in 1969, which featured a guitar solo from another Led Zeppelin member, Jimmy Page.) Jones later arranged, produced and recorded Bell's 1973 RCA album Comin' Atcha. She contributed to the soundtrack of the romance film A Touch of Class (1973).

6000|$|There {{was also}} the {{solution}} of a second governess, a young person to come in by the day and really do the work; but to this Miss Overmore wouldn't for a moment listen, arguing against it with great public relish and wanting to know from all comers--she put it even to Maisie herself--they didn't see how frightfully it would give her away. [...] "What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be at all, don't you see, if I'm not here to look after her?" [...] She was in a false position and so freely and loudly called attention to it {{that it seemed to}} become almost a source of glory. The way out of it of course was just to do her plain duty; but that was unfortunately what, with his excessive, his exorbitant demands on her, which every one indeed appeared quite to understand, he practically, he selfishly prevented. Beale Farange, for Miss Overmore, was now never anything but [...] "he," [...] and the house was as full as ever of lively gentlemen with whom, under that designation, she chaffingly talked about him. Maisie meanwhile, as a subject of familiar gossip on what was to be done with her, was left so much to herself that she had hours of wistful thought of the large loose discipline of Mrs. Wix; yet she none the less held it under her father's roof a point of superiority that none of his visitors were ladies. It added to this odd security that she had once heard a gentleman say to him {{as if it were a}} great joke and in obvious reference to Miss Overmore: [...] "Hanged if she'll let another woman come near you--hanged if she ever will. She'd let fly a stick at her as they do at a strange cat!" [...] Maisie greatly preferred gentlemen as inmates in spite of their also having their way--louder but sooner over--of laughing out at her. They pulled and pinched, they teased and tickled her; some of them even, as they termed it, shied things at her, and all of them thought it funny to call her by names having no resemblance to her own. The ladies on the other hand addressed her as [...] "You poor pet" [...] and scarcely touched her even to kiss her. But it was of the ladies she was most afraid.|$|E
