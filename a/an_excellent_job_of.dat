5|$|The major field {{operation}} of the fall was Hood's Franklin-Nashville Campaign, an invasion of Tennessee, which he undertook despite Beauregard's counsel that it made little operational or logistical sense. Hood did not treat Beauregard with the respect due to the department commander, communicating his plans reluctantly and making movements {{without regard to the}} consequences for his supply line, which Beauregard scrambled to maintain. While Hood traveled through Alabama and into Tennessee, Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman began his March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah, which focused Beauregard's attention back to Georgia. He was ineffective in stopping, or even delaying, Sherman's advance. He had inadequate local forces and was reluctant to strip defenses from other locations to concentrate them against Sherman. Furthermore, Sherman did <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> deceiving the Confederates as to the intermediate and final targets of his march. Savannah fell on December 21 and Sherman's army began to march north into South Carolina in January. Also in late December, Beauregard found out that Hood's army had been severely damaged in its defeat at the Battle of Nashville; there were very few men in fighting condition who could oppose Sherman's advance.|$|E

However, he noted that the levels are much larger than the original's and include hidden bonuses, giving it greater longevity. Dan Hsu and Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized that the game is more of an expansion pack of the original Jumping Flash! than a new game, while Shawn Smith and Crispin Boyer applauded it for having much better graphics and larger levels than the original.

One other large Kuiper belt object [...] Quaoar [...] has similar red coloring and water ice absorption, and it is hypothesized that the red coloration of this object is due to irradiation of the small amounts of methane able to be retained on Quaoar. 2007 OR 10, though warmer than Quaoar, is in a similar volatile retention because it is sufficiently larger that its stronger gravity can still retain methane. We propose, therefore, that the red coloration on 2007 OR 10 is also caused by the retention of small amounts of methane.

40|$|In March of 2005, Ohio's {{high school}} sophomores {{will take the}} new Ohio Graduation Test (OGT) {{for the first time}} - for keeps. For these {{students}} (and those who come after) the OGT will be the gateway to a high school diploma, post secondary education, good paying jobs and successful careers. Failure to pass the OGT will leave the limited options of a Graduate Equivalency Diploma (GED) or a complicated appeals process. While a high stakes graduation exam is not new to Ohio, this test is different. By all indications it is far more rigorous than the old Ninth Grade Proficiency Test, there are less opportunities to re-take the test, and it is geared to measure an extensive set of new academic content standards. Tests like the OGT are part of what has become known as the "standardsbased" reform movement in education. Simply put, they allow states to measure whether or not students are learning according to whatever set of standards, benchmarks and indicators are adopted by that state. They also help meet, in part, the reporting requirements of the Federal "No Child Left Behind" (NCLB) Act. Such tests, however, are not without problems. Most problematic is their relevancy to what is required by higher education and the workforce. Ohio has a new, evolving, P- 16 agenda. Placing 39 th among states in four-year college degrees, Ohio must begin to reconsider the entire continuum of education and the workforce to insure its economic future. If educational systems are to be productive, serious questions emerge as to such issues as loss of instructional time due to testing, costs of such tests and whether or not such tests are "productive" from the aspect of improving instruction or promoting access to college and post secondary instruction.
