40|$|Among {{vegetable}} {{farmers in}} Jordan, there are conflicting attitudes towards the extension activities {{provided by the}} public sector. Some farmers accept and adopt the recommendations of these activities; on the other hand, some people are not satisfied and consider these activities {{a waste of time}} for both the farmers and the government. This situation has serious impacts on the quality, duration and efficiency of the extension activities provided by government related agencies. Also, the situation will end in providing low-quality <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> to the farmers or providing these services in a non-productive manner. The actual attitudes of vegetable farmers towards Public <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Services</b> (PAES) in the Dear Alla Area of Jordan were investigated in this study. A total of 80 vegetable farmers were selected for the study. A questionnaire consisting of two main parts was used for data collection; the first part was related to personal and socio-economic characteristics of the sample individuals. The second part was related to extension activities. A five-point Likert-type scale was used as an instrument to gather primary data. The farmers rated their attitudes toward Public <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Services</b> (PAES) through 10 statements related carefully to the Public <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Services.</b> Data analysis was done in two sections, consisting of data description and data inferential analysis. The results of the study revealed that the farmersâ overall attitude towards the public <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> activities was negative. The farmersâ attitudes according to age, experience, educational level and frequency and type of contact with public <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> were also negative. The negative attitude of the participant farmers towards the Public <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Services</b> means that the farmers were not satisfied with these services. Identifying the sources and types of public extension programs, the provision of legal and policy framework, farmerâ participation, the determination of public extension functions, providing skilled manpower and networking and enhancing the capabilities of public <b>extension</b> <b>service</b> providers may aid in changing the farmersâ attitudes towards the Public <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> to be positive...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{identifies}} and evaluates {{factors influencing}} {{the willingness to}} participate financially in <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> delivery in Ekiti-State, Nigeria. A total of 120 respondents who were smallholders were interviewed {{with the aid of}} a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Data were collected on socio-economic characteristics of the respondents. The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Probit regression model. Result of the Probit model estimates showed that; off farm income (p< 0. 05) and schooling years (p< 0. 10) positively influence willingness to participate financially in <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> delivery, while, age (p< 0. 05) and household size (p< 0. 05), negatively influence willingness to participate financially in <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> delivery.

40|$|The {{top-down}} public <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> {{system in}} China and its early commercialization reforms during the 1990 s have left millions of farmers {{without access to}} <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> A pilot inclusive <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> system was introduced in 2005 to better meet the diverse needs of small-scale farmers. Three key features of the experiment are (1) inclusion of all farmers as target beneficiaries, (2) effective identification of farmers' <b>extension</b> <b>service</b> needs, and (3) an accountability system to provide better <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> to farmers. This paper describes design of the reform initiative and examines its effect on farmers' access to <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Based on farmer supplied data from six counties for the years 2005 to 2007, this paper shows that inclusive reform initiatives significantly improve farmers' access to and actually received of <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> {{as well as their}} adoption of new technologies. Implications for further reforms to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> system are also discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Public <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>services</b> is {{becoming}} {{too expensive to}} finance by some developing countries.

40|$|The paper {{began by}} brining {{to the fore}} the basics {{of public and private}} funded <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> It exposed the {{weakness}} and the inherent inconsistencies of private funded <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> and posits that this model would not be practical in a Third World country like Nigeria. It alluded to the fact that some private bodies have done reasonably well in providing <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> to rural farmers. Proponents of privatized <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> are of the opinion that public financed <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> is bedeviled with the many weaknesses associated with government bureaucracies. On the contrary, supporters of public funded <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> maintained that 95 % of extension work world over is done by one government department or the other and that privatized extension would not be visible in Nigeria, a country that has about 65 % of his farmers operating at subsistence level and who are too poor to pay for <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, the paper shows the hypocrisy of the First world who wants subsidies removed for the agricultural enterprise in all ramifications in the Third Word countries and who in the contrary heavily subsidized their own agricultural sector, these subsidies have hurt African milk, livestock and grains export. Finally, it recommended that instead of an outright privatization of the agricultural sector, a middle ground (a blend of public-private <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension)</b> should be pursued and this it maintained would be most practical in the Third world milieu...|$|R

30|$|As it was {{hypothesized}} in the above section, educational level, wealth status, off-farm employment, <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> and {{the distance to the}} nearest health center of the household head is found to be statistically significant at 10  % level of significance. It implies that as the educational level of the household head increases, the level of understanding about climate change adaptation increases. In LTSB, a significant number of household heads are illiterate and highly vulnerable to climate change hazards. Similarly, households who are rich in wealth relatively cop up climate change more than the poor. They stated in the focus group discussion also that during the loss of crop and livestock might lead to food problems for the coming season more by the poor than the rich households. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> played a significant role for climate change adaptation. Access to <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> also increases the likelihood of adaptation to climate change impacts. This suggests that <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> help farmers to take climate change and weather patterns into account and help advise them on how to tackle climatic variability and change. The likelihoods of <b>agricultural</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> and off-farm employment is also found to be significant in adapting climate change in LTSB more by those who engaged in than the non-users.|$|R
