Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in astrology has largely declined.|$|E

5|$|Education in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} education within the modern borders of Scotland, between {{the departure of the}} Romans from Britain in the fifth century, until the establishment of the Renaissance late fifteenth century and early sixteenth century. Few sources on Scottish education survived the Medieval era. In the early Middle Ages, Scotland was an oral society, with verbal rather than literary education. Though there are indications of a Gaelic education system similar to that of Ireland, few details are known. The establishment of Christianity from the sixth century brought Latin to Scotland as <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based {{primarily}} at Pennsylvania State University, was established.

5|$|Of Stratton's many contributions, {{his studies}} on {{perception}} and visual illusions {{would continue to}} influence the field of psychology well after his death. Of the nine books he wrote, the first was <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> look at the methodology and scope of experimental psychology. The remaining, including one unfinished at his death, were on sociology, international relations and the issues of war and how findings from psychology {{could be used to}} eradicate conflict between nations. Stratton considered these issues more salient to the application of psychology in the real world, though his ideas on this front did not produce a lasting impact in the field because of their subjective and non-experimental nature.|$|E

5|$|Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's {{review in}} BioSocieties journal, {{acknowledges}} that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in {{a black and white}} manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.|$|E

5|$|The College of Law is {{currently}} 100th in the U.S. News & World Report's law school rankings, having risen steadily from 132nd when first ranked.

The Best Value rating was based on three criteria: bar passage rate, average indebtedness after graduation, and employment nine months after graduation. The FIU College of Law was also ranked 3rd amongst Florida schools for the scholarly impact of its faculty, behind University of Florida and Florida State University. According to the Leiter Rankings, the College of Law has already made <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> impact that dramatically outpaces its academic reputation.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} attested {{examples of}} mathematical calculations {{date to the}} predynastic Naqada period, and show a fully developed numeral system. The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain. Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of Christianity from {{the sixth century}} brought Latin to Scotland as <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small, educated and overwhelmingly male, elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society. Literary life revolved around the contemplation of texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks {{were part of the}} mainstream of European Christian culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} structure is alluded to in Legea minții, {{which is about}} discovering one's true calling. The plot follows its protagonist, <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> priest {{by the name of}} Andrei Pascu, as he finds himself in his work as a missionary of religion and cultural nationalism, despite being set back by poverty and revisited by his worldly past. Similar themes are developed elsewhere. In Popa Man, a lapsed priest and smuggler is suddenly confronted with the consequences of his actions, and destroys himself with drink. In Stana, named after its female protagonist, a war invalid is a passive witness to his wife's moral decay. When he dies, his wooden leg serves as a haunting reminder of his virtues, driving Stana to despair.|$|E
