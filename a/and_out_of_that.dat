500|$|Former {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season's finale: [...] "On those occasions when Meredith's {{not involved in}} a plot about her love life, I do kind of like her, but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really, really can't stand her." [...] During the show's third season, {{the development of the}} character received negative reviews, with Cristopher Monfette of IGN stating that her storyline has become [...] "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Also during the third season, Robert Rorke of the New York Post noted the decline in Meredith's role in the show, expressing disappointment: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Similarly, Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused, [...] "This whole 'Oh I need more time,' but 'Oh, I'm jealous if you look at someone else' angst was tired in the second season, frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer. The will-they-or-won't-they plot doesn't work because they've already been in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> relationship too many times. Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked." [...] On a more positive note, her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV's [...] list of the [...] "Best TV Couples of All Time" [...] and in the same list by TV Guide.|$|E
