5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{constitutes}} a food source which, although not rich in easily absorbed carbohydrates or fat, contains vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Fresh mushrooms consist of over 80% moisture, although reported values tend to differ somewhat as moisture content {{can be affected}} by environmental temperature <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> humidity during growth and storage, {{as well as the}} relative amount of water that may be produced as a result of normal metabolic processes during storage.|$|E
5|$|Communities with {{demonstrated}} {{loyalty to}} Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation.

5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{supported}} monophyly {{in the family}} Bovidae (a group of organisms comprises an ancestral species and all their descendants). The number of subfamilies in Bovidae is disputed, with suggestions {{of as many as}} ten and as few as two subfamilies. However, molecular, morphological and fossil evidence indicates the existence of eight distinct subfamilies : Aepycerotinae (consisting of just the impala), Alcelaphinae (bontebok, hartebeest, wildebeest <b>and</b> <b>relatives),</b> Antilopinae (several antelopes, gazelles, <b>and</b> <b>relatives),</b> Bovinae (cattle, buffaloes, bison and other antelopes), Caprinae (goats, sheep, ibex, serows <b>and</b> <b>relatives),</b> Cephalophinae (duikers), Hippotraginae (addax, oryx <b>and</b> <b>relatives)</b> <b>and</b> Reduncinae (reedbuck and kob antelopes). In addition, three extinct subfamilies are known: Hypsodontinae (mid-Miocene), Oiocerinae (Turolian) and the subfamily Tethytraginae, which contains Tethytragus (mid-Miocene).|$|R

5|$|Aged six, Castro, {{along with}} his elder {{siblings}} Ramón and Angela, was sent {{to live with their}} teacher in Santiago de Cuba, dwelling in cramped conditions <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> poverty, often failing to have enough to eat because of their tutor's poor economic situation. Aged eight, Castro was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, although later became an atheist. Being baptized enabled Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in Santiago, where he regularly misbehaved, and so was sent to the privately funded, Jesuit-run Dolores School in Santiago. In 1945 he transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit-run El Colegio de Belén in Havana. Although Castro took an interest in history, geography and debating at Belén, he did not excel academically, instead devoting much of his time to playing sport.|$|E
5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than a}} degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E
5|$|Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling {{was working}} as a {{researcher}} and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990.

There were six sequels, of which the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written four books for adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012) and—under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith—the crime fiction novels The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014) and Career of Evil (2015).|$|E

5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by {{the length of the}} anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} his campaign for a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned that, {{if they did not}} name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Two {{studies to}} {{determine}} satisfaction regarding information, communication and support, {{and the degree}} of distress, anxiety and depression among patients <b>and</b> <b>relatives.</b> To compare the patients <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> reports with the staff s expectations. To determine how the patient s degree of anxiety and depression correlated with the satisfaction. Design: Prospective studies. Setting: Patients from gastro surgical, gastro medical and observation wards <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> from the intensive care unit at Ullevål University Hospital. Methods: A questionnaire was developed by the authors and used with small modifications for the three groups. All together it was 176 patients, 68 <b>relatives</b> <b>and</b> 95 staff members answering. The patients were also given the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and 119 returned a second questionnaire four weeks later. The degree of satisfaction was measured on a five-point scale (0 - 4). Main results: The average satisfaction score was 3, 4 +/- 0, 08 SE for <b>relatives</b> <b>and</b> 3, 0 +/- 0, 04 for patients. The staff expected significantly lower degrees of satisfaction (2, 9 +/- 0, 08 for <b>relatives</b> <b>and</b> 2, 4 +/- 0, 05 for patients) (p< 0, 01). They also expected patients <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> to experience more distress. The patients satisfaction was strongly correlated to their HAD score (p< 0, 01). Conclusions: The patients <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> were satisfied to a rather high degree with the information, communication and support. The staff underestimated both patients <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> overestimated their degree of distress. There is a correlation between patients satisfaction and their degree of anxiety and depression...|$|R
