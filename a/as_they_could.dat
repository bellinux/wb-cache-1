5|$|Alexios and his guards {{resisted}} as long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> before retreating. As they retreated, Alexios {{was separated}} from his guard and was attacked by Norman soldiers. While escaping, he was wounded in his forehead and {{lost a lot of}} blood, but eventually made it back to Ohrid, where he regrouped his army.|$|E
5|$|EWH Gifford and Partners {{were the}} {{structural}} engineers, while the general contractors were {{a company called}} Trollope and Colls Limited. The designers settled on a tower block so as to leave {{as much of the}} gardens and grounds intact <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
5|$|Highrise {{development}} has slowed since the 1970s and mainly {{in recent years}} because of enforcements imposed by the Civil Aviation Authority on the heights of buildings <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> affect aircraft from the Airport (e.g. Beetham Tower).|$|E

6000|$|... "The detectives!" [...] {{shouted the}} workmen, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> sought {{convenient}} places for hiding; and the moonlighters {{were left to}} dispose of themselves <b>as</b> best <b>they</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the period}} {{leading up to}} 1776, a number of events led to a drastic change in the diet of the American colonists. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> no longer depend on British and West Indian imports, {{agricultural}} practices of the colonists {{began to focus on}} becoming completely self-sufficient.|$|E
5|$|The opening was {{rejected}} as {{too expensive to}} film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would have pushed the budget to $50million. While they tried {{to hold on to}} the opening as long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> Paramount threatened to cancel pre-production unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} six venues—the Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range, the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, the Jawaharlal Nehru Sports Complex, the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, the Siri Fort Sports Complex and the Yamuna Sports Complex—had varying {{capacities}} {{as reflected in the}} table <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> hold their allocated sport(s) in more than one facility. For example, the Yamuna Sports Complex's archery facility could hold 1,500 while its facility for table tennis could hold 4,297.|$|E

5|$|At that time, the Federal {{government}} was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes {{in the ground and}} gather up the oil <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} night race in Formula One, the , Webber {{qualified}} in 13th position. Red Bull pulled in both Webber and David Coulthard for their pit stops as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> when the safety car came on track, due to Nelson Piquet, Jr. crashing, giving them both great track position. This led to Webber running in 2nd place before a gearbox issue put {{him out of the}} race on lap 29.|$|E
5|$|During {{the march}} through {{vineyards}} and cornfields, the emaciated children ate as much <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Lukić {{states that the}} Partisans rested the remaining children at Žumberak for a day, before arranging {{for them to be}} transferred across the Kupa river into liberated areas of the Bosanska Krajina. According to one survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, some of the children who were liberated from the camp by the Partisans inAugust 1942 were placed with families in the Žumberak district and were subsequently re-captured by the Ustaše. Some were killed and others were returned to the camp.|$|E

5|$|Eos– The Goddess of Dawn and {{the sister}} of Helios. Eos told Kratos of the machinations of Morpheus, who had taken {{advantage}} of her brother's disappearance. When Kratos found Eos in the Caves of Olympus, she advised him to find the Primordial Fires and free Helios' loyal Fire Steeds, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> find the Sun God. She also provided him with the magical ability, Light of Dawn. She did not appear in God of War III, leaving her fate unknown. The character was voiced by Erin Torpey in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Fairley was {{acutely aware}} that much {{remained}} unknown about malaria. In particular, {{he was interested in}} the possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related sulphonamide) might be a causal prophylactic against malaria, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{the closest}} to {{completion}} and her construction was continued in case the Germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers. Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end. After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not fully incorporate the lessons of the war.|$|E

60|$|The {{boys had}} dried and pressed their {{clothing}} <b>as</b> best <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> {{and put on}} clean collars, cuffs, and neckties, and therefore looked quite presentable once more.|$|R
5|$|In 1890, the railway's {{arrival in}} Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> no longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.|$|E
5|$|International {{tensions}} grew in {{the late}} 1930s. Crises were caused by the German occupation of the Rhineland in 1936; the Anschluss and Sudeten crisis of 1938; and the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and the Italian invasion of Albania {{in the spring of}} 1939. These events forced the Dutch government to exercise greater vigilance, but they limited their reaction as much <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> The most important measure was a partial mobilisation of 100,000 men in April 1939.|$|E
5|$|King {{argues that}} enslaved {{children}} {{did not have the}} opportunities for childhood and thus, did not have childhoods. Slave children instead worked as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> were often separated from caregivers and family, and were subject to punishment of many sorts, sometimes no different than those levied on adults. The children's trauma was compared to that of war—enduring abuses, sexual exploitation, inability to protect themselves—and they aged prematurely through these experiences.|$|E

5|$|No {{members of}} the general public were {{permitted}} on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.|$|E
5|$|O'Regan {{said that}} Australian players were not {{prepared}} for playing cricket in Asia, as they {{were not aware of}} the dangers of bookmakers and betting on the Indian subcontinent. He recommended that every new player should be warned of the dangers of becoming involved with bookmakers, and the penalties that it entails. The ICC announced that no further action would be taken against Waugh and Warne <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be tried twice for the same offence.|$|E
5|$|Prices {{remained}} high in Dawson {{and supply}} fluctuated {{according to the}} season. During the winter of 1897 salt became worth its weight in gold, while nails, vital for construction work, rose in price to $28 ($760) per lb (0.45kg). Cans of butter sold for $5 ($140) each. The only eight horses in Dawson were slaughtered for dog food <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be kept alive over the winter. The first fresh goods arriving {{in the spring of}} 1898 sold for record prices, eggs reaching $3 ($81) each and apples $1 ($27).|$|E
