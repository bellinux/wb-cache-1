5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> <b>treatment.</b> This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E

40|$|Coke oven liquor is a toxic {{wastewater}} {{produced in}} large quantities by the Iron and Steel, and Coking Industries, and gives rise to major effluent treatment problems in those industries. Conscious of the potentially serious environmental impact of the discharge of such wastes, pollution control agencies in many countries have made progressively more stringent quality requirements for the discharge of the treated waste. The most common means of treating the waste is the activated sludge process. Problems with achieving consistently satisfactory treatment by this process have been experienced in the past. The need {{to improve the quality}} of the discharge of the treated waste prompted attempts by TOMLINS to model the process using Adenosine Triphosophnte (ATP) as a measure of biomass, but these were unsuccessful. This thesis describes work that was carried out to determine the significance of ATP in the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> <b>treatment</b> of the waste. The use of ATP measurements in wastewater treatment were reviewed. Investigations were conducted into the ATP behaviour of the batch <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> <b>treatment</b> of two major components of the waste, phenol, and thiocyanate, and the continuous <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> <b>treatment</b> of the liquor itself, using laboratory scale apparatus. On the basis of these results equations were formulated to describe the significance of ATP as a measured activity and biomass in the treatment system. These were used as the basis for proposals to use ATP as a control parameter in the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> <b>treatment</b> of coke oven liquor, and wastewaters in general.
