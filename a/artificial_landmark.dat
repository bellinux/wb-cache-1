First, a color scalable <b>artificial</b> <b>landmark</b> model is designed to give position information of the environment. Second, using the color segmentation, invariance of cross-ratio and self-adaptive window to detect the landmark, so the position information could be got. Finally, the binocular stereo vision is used by combining with the position information of <b>artificial</b> <b>landmark.</b> The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed <b>artificial</b> <b>landmark</b> model is robust to the light and camera position, and the self-localization accuracy can meet the requirement of indoor mobile robot.

However, due to slow measurements presented by the image sensor, {{it might not have}} enough updates of the particle, adding uncertainty in the location. Another drawback is that the identification of <b>artificial</b> <b>landmarks</b> used in this study is based on a measurement likelihood that aggregates to the possibility of introducing wrong data association.|$|R

40|$|An {{autonomous}} navigational {{system for}} a mobile robot was developed based on a Laser-Range-Finder-based path planning and navigational algorithms. The system was enhanced by incorporating collision avoidance algorithms using data from a sonar sensor array, and further improved by establishing two virtual regions {{in front of the}} robot for obstacle detection and avoidance. Several virtual detector bands with varying dimensions were also added to the sides of the robot to check for rotational clearance safety and to determine the direction of rotation. The autonomous navigational system was tested extensively under indoor environment.
