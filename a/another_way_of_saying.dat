Actually, it would be inefficient to use the same balance in either country (because of the relative availability of either input factor) but, in principle this would be possible. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> this is that the per-capita productivity is the same in both countries in the same technology with identical amounts of capital.|$|E
25|$|The {{eigenvalues}} of unitary matrices {{are pure}} phases, {{so that the}} value of a unitary conserved quantity is a complex number of unit magnitude, not a real number. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> this is that a unitary matrix is the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix, so that the additive conserved real quantity, the phase, is only well-defined up to an integer multiple of 2π. Only when the unitary symmetry matrix is part of a family that comes arbitrarily close to the identity are the conserved real quantities single-valued, and then the demand that they are conserved become a much more exacting constraint.|$|E
25|$|A {{function}} or map {{from one}} topological space to another is called continuous if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the real numbers {{to the real}} numbers (both spaces with the Standard Topology), then this definition of continuous {{is equivalent to the}} definition of continuous in calculus. If a continuous function is one-to-one and onto, and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties, and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut. But the circle is not homeomorphic to the doughnut.|$|E

40|$|Bula!”, the Fijian ‘hello’, is {{probably}} the best known Fijian word. Whatever their own language, people who come from Fiji like to say bula to each other when they meet {{in other parts of the}} world. It has even become the name of a kind of shirt and the casual, colourful style of dress for which Fiji is famous. Originally bula meant ‘to live’ or ‘to be alive’, and it is a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> wishing someone good health and a long life. But bula is not the only Fijian word for ‘hello’. In fact, throughout the western part of Fiji, including western Vitilevu, the Yasawa and Mamanuca islands, and Vatulele, the usual word for ‘hello’ is cola (pronounced thola). So if you are in western Fiji, try <b>saying</b> cola instead <b>of</b> bula, and the gesture will be appreciated. There is also a slightly more enthusiastic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> hello: bula vinaka, literally ‘good life’, and the western equivalent of this is cola vinā. Finally, there is <b>another,</b> more respectful, <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> hello, which is by adding nī before the bula or bula vinaka. So Nī bula or Nī bula vinaka is what you might say if you were formally introduced to a chief, or a person of high status such as a mayor or member of parliament. In the morning, people are more likely to say yadra, which literally means ‘awake’. This corresponds to ‘good morning’ in English. Again, the respectful <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> ‘good morning’ is nī yadra. You can reply to any of these greetings by repeating the same, or you can simply say io, literally meaning ‘yes’ – and always remember to smile...|$|R
25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

He wrote of the six main characters, [...] "Are we supposed to care about these people?

[...] He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes.

2500|$|However, [...] This {{means that}} 10-adic numbers {{do not always}} have multiplicative inverses i.e. valid reciprocals, which in turn implies that though 10-adic numbers form a ring they do not form a field, a {{deficiency}} that makes them much less useful as an analytical tool. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> {{this is that the}} ring of 10-adic numbers is not an integral domain because they contain zero divisors.

[...] "As the kernel begins to heat up, the water vapor inside of the kernel will also become very hot, increasing the pressure inside of the hull. Around 212°F (100°C) the internal water will expand into steam and create an outward force on the hull because of the increasing kinetic energy as the molecules begin to move faster and faster.

The company gave {{up trying to}} retail its models and set up a branch company called X-El Products to sell reissued promos. The X-El reissues have {{sometimes}} been passed off as originals in antique malls and flea markets. The X-El Products era was an ironic time. Models were carefully prepared and respected by collectors, but there was no capital to develop new products, so the company fell into decline. One consumer purchase update card sent by X-El Products to buyers in 1988 encouraged patience when waiting for models that wer ordered, saying, [...] "These promos are not done on a mass production basis. They are practically made to order and babied from start to finish." [...] This is <b>another</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> that Jo-Han did not have the resources to improve their service.

Further, they state, [...] "U" [...] students all have passed a bar of exclusivity by getting into the increasingly selective University itself. With an array of student groups numbering in the thousands, and a multitude of Greek chapter personalities, fraternity and sorority proponents are confident that all students who wish to join a Greek society can find one where they can flourish. The matter of religious and race exclusivity appears to have passed several generations ago: While some chapters are historically black, Hispanic, or Asian-oriented, there is no race exclusivity or other discrimination exclusivity in any of Minnesota's chapters. All are integrated, and have been for some time. Minnesota was the second Big Ten school (after Wisconsin) to see its fraternities and sororities drop all bias clauses (race, color or creed) from their bylaws and policies. Older chapters have been integrated since the 1950s and 1960s and the multi-cultural Greek chapters since their founding in more recent years.|$|E
2500|$|Brain {{plasticity}} {{refers to}} the brain's ability to change structure and function. This ties into the common phrase, [...] "if you don't use it, you lose it," [...] which is <b>another</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying,</b> if you don't use it, your brain will devote less somatotopic space for it. One proposed mechanism for the observed age-related plasticity deficits in animals {{is the result of}} age-induced alterations in calcium regulation. [...] The changes in our abilities to handle calcium will ultimately influence neuronal firing and the ability to propagate action potentials, which in turn would affect the ability of the brain to alter its structure or function (i.e. its plastic nature). Due to the complexity of the brain, with all of its structures and functions, it is logical to assume that some areas would be more vulnerable to aging than others. Two circuits worth mentioning here are the hippocampal and neocortical circuits. [...] It has been suggested that age-related cognitive decline is due in part not to neuronal death but to synaptic alterations. Evidence in support of this idea from animal work has also suggested that this cognitive deficit is due to functional and biochemical factors such as changes in enzymatic activity, chemical messengers, or gene expression in cortical circuits.|$|E

The population is dying out. Thanks to the [...] "heroic efforts" [...] of the Yeltsinites the country has lost 5 out of the 22 million square kilometers of its historical territory. Russia has lost half of its production capacity {{and has yet to}} reach the 1990 level of output. Our country is facing three mortal dangers: de-industrialization, de-population and mental debilitation. The ruling group has neither notable successes to boast of, nor a clear plan of action. All its activities are geared to a single goal: to stay in power at all costs. Until recently it has been able to keep in power due to the [...] "windfall" [...] high world prices for energy. Its social support rests on the notorious “vertical power structure” which is <b>another</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> intimidation and blackmail of the broad social strata and the handouts that power chips off the oil and gas pie and throws out to the population in crumbs, especially on the eve of elections.|$|E
2500|$|Paul the Apostle in {{addressing}} slavery in Ephesians 6:-8 neither condemns slavery nor condones it. Nothing {{in the passage}} affirms slavery as a naturally valid or divinely mandated institution. [...] Rather, Paul’s discussion of the duties of Christian slaves and the responsibilities of Christian masters transforms the institution, even if it falls short of calling for outright abolition. In the ancient world the slave was a thing. Aristotle wrote that there could never be friendship between master and slave, for master and slave have nothing in common: “a slave is a living tool, just as a tool is an inanimate slave.” [...] Paul’s words are entirely different. He calls the slave a “slave of Christ,” one who wants to do “the will of God” and who will receive a “reward” for “whatever good he does”. [...] Likewise, the master is responsible to God for how he treats the slave, who is ultimately God’s rather than his own property. This is <b>another</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> that the slave, {{no less than the}} master, has been made in God’s image. As such, he possesses inestimable worth and great dignity. He is to be treated properly. In such a framework slavery, even though it remained slavery, could never be the same institution as for non-Christians. [...] Tradition describes Pope Pius I (term c. 158-167) and Pope Callixtus I (term c. 217-222) as former slaves.|$|E
2500|$|Another factor {{connected}} {{with these two}} schools demands separate attention, [...] {{because it is a}} consequence of segregation so outlandish that the Attorney General, with commendable candor, has in effect refused to defend it. I refer to the fact that school bus transportation is provided those attending No. 29 who, except for color, are in the same situation as this infant plaintiff. Yet neither school bus transportation, nor its equivalent is provided this plaintiff even to attend No. 107. In fact, the State Board of Education refused to authorize the transportation of this then seven-year-old plaintiff to the Negro school, even though the bus for white children went right past her home, and even though the two schools are no more than a mile apart. Moreover, there is no public transportation available from or near plaintiff's home to or near the Negro school. The State Board ruled that because of the State constitutional provision for separate schools, a Negro child may not ride in a bus serving a white school. If we assume that this is so, then this practice in and of itself, is another reason why the facilities offered this plaintiff at No. 107 are inferior to those provided at No. 29. To suggest, under the facts here presented, that there are not enough Negroes to warrant the cost of a school bus for them is only <b>another</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> that they are not entitled to equal services because they are Negroes.
