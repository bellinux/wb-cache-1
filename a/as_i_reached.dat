2500|$|Quicker than thought I {{brought my}} saber down {{with all my}} {{strength}} upon [...] head. He was moving as the blow fell, and I suppose I did not strike him where I intended, for he received a deep saber cut {{in the back of}} the neck. He fell senseless on his side, then rolled over on his back. He had in his hand a short Sharpe's cavalry carbine. I think he had just fired <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Colonel Washington, for the Marine who followed me into the aperture made by the ladder received a bullet in the abdomen, from which he died in a few minutes. The shot might have been fired by someone else in the insurgent party, but I think it was from Brown. Instinctively as Brown fell I gave him a saber thrust in the left breast. The sword I carried was a light uniform weapon, and, either not having a point or striking something hard in Brown's accouterments, did not penetrate. The blade bent double.|$|E

6000|$|Yes, I {{accompany}} him to places [...] Only dreamers know, Where the shy hares limp long paces, [...] Where the night rooks go; Into old aisles where {{the past is}} all to him, [...] Close as his shade can do, Always lacking the power to call to him, [...] Near <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> thereto! ...|$|R

My horses stand ready saddled, my {{servants}} are prepared, the signal for rising {{will be given}} so soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> Kilsyth. If it is my fate that calls me, I will not shun meeting it. It will be something," [...] he said, taking her hand, [...] "to die deserving your compassion, since I cannot gain your love." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Chester was {{standing}} in the door <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the road. [...] "Good-bye!" [...] she cried, [...] "and good fortune go with you!" [...] I raised my hat, and gave Orso a little jerk with the chain.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> {{the terrace}} I {{saw a man}} walking up and down, smoking a pipe. He stood {{at the top of}} the steps and waited for me. It was Colonel Ray. He took me by the arm.|$|E
60|$|As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> my house, I called Walkirk {{from his}} writing, and rapidly gave him {{instructions}} {{in regard to}} the execution of an idea which had come into my mind during my brotherhood labors of the morning.|$|E
