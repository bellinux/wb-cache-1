5|$|The helmet of {{the arms}} was not {{specified}} in the charter, but the engraver sketched out a peer's helmet on the final design, which is used. This {{is contrary to the}} heraldic rules, as a society or corporation normally has an esquire's helmet; it is thought that either the engraver was ignorant of this rule, which was not strictly adhered to until around 1615, or that he used the peer's helmet <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to Lord Brouncker, a peer and the first President of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|All {{housing and}} major hangars were {{completed}} in 1918, including a large steel-and-wood hangar, two concrete hangars for seaplanes and flying boats, a supply warehouse, a machine shop, a photography laboratory and a powerhouse. In 1919, {{the field was}} named Luke Field after Frank Luke, a World War I ace and Medal of Honor recipient. The U.S. Army's introduction of aviation to Ford Island triggered expansion throughout Hawaii {{with the development of}} civilian airports, the creation of the Hawaii chapter of the National Aeronautic Association, and a national flying code. The army's aviation division was generally favorably received by the Hawaiians, who took the military's investment in their land <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May, a {{delegation}} of 31 Samogitian nobles arrived in Königsberg and promised loyalty to Vytautas by signing the Treaty of Königsberg. The joint forces of Vytautas and the Teutonic Knights consisted largely of volunteers and mercenaries from western Europe, notably from France, the German states, and England. Henry, Earl of Derby, the future King Henry IV of England and Marshal of France Jean Le Maingre were among the participants. The English crusaders left detailed records of their actions in Prussia and Lithuania, and their exploits were mentioned by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales, possibly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to the English knights and the future king. In the meantime, Jogaila achieved some military successes; his forces captured several castles in Podlaskie, leaving them to be guarded by Polish garrisons, and took Hrodna in April 1390 after a six-week siege.|$|E

5|$|Sky Sports {{said that}} during the 2011–12 season McLean had begun to emerge {{as one of the}} top young talents in the SPL. His first game of the season was on 6 August, in a 1–1 draw against Dundee United, where he came on as an 80th-minute substitute. His first start came a week later in a 1–0 loss to Motherwell. McLean then played {{regularly}} in the first team over the next few months and was in excellent form. He scored his first senior goal in a 1–0 win over St Johnstone on 29 October and was rewarded with the SPL Young Player of the Month award for October 2011. After this, team-mate Gary Teale said that he thought McLean was very similar to former Rangers and Scotland captain Barry Ferguson, and that he thought McLean would have a brilliant future in the game. In the weeks leading up to his award, McLean had been watched by English Championship clubs Burnley and Crystal Palace, with Celtic also reportedly interested in him. Lennon encouraged interest from other clubs, saying that he took it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to McLean's development. But he also said that he would not consider selling McLean in the near future and expressed his delight at the fact that he had already signed McLean on a long-term contract. On 19 November, McLean scored his second goal for St Mirren, in a 2–1 win over Dunfermline Athletic. He then scored St Mirren's first goal, on 10 December, as they came from behind to secure a 2–2 draw against Aberdeen. McLean was one of the four players nominated for the SPL young Player of the Year Award. In January 2014 it was announced that McLean would be out-of-action for 6 weeks following knee surgery.|$|E

25|$|Many {{traditional}} {{drinks are}} indigenous to Russia {{and are not}} present in other national cuisines. The most notable of these are vodka, sbiten', kvass, medovukha and mors. Many of them are no longer common and {{have been replaced by}} drinks originating in Europe. Nonetheless, these beverages were formerly drunk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to meat and poultry dishes, sweet porridge, and dessert. Of particular note is sbiten, an immensely popular medieval drink which has since been replaced by tea as the Russian mainstay beverage.|$|E
25|$|Robert Burns {{lived at}} the nearby Ellisland Farm from 1788 to 1791.

In September 1788 he composed The Day Returns <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to Riddell and his wife, commenting that At their fire-side I have enjoyed more pleasant evenings than at all the houses of fashionable {{people in this country}} put together. Robert had fought in the American War and was an accomplished musical composer and musician as well as an antiquarian.|$|E

I admit it may be called an exaggeration; but {{there really is a}} sort of sham Socialism that the modern politicians may quite possibly agree to set up; if they do succeed in setting it up, the battle for the poor is lost.|$|R
500|$|Reflections from {{athletes and}} {{officials}} provide {{an insight into}} {{the value of this}} inaugural event. Bill Mather-Brown, an Australian athlete, said [...] "The 1962 Games was the first time I had been asked for an autograph.

Sometimes we [...] were not sure people really wanted our signature or were just being polite and wanted us to feel good".|$|E
500|$|The general fan {{reaction}} to the character was positive, and the fans appreciated de Boer's performances. One negative issue which was raised {{was the number of}} Ezri-centric episodes reduced the number of those available to close up the story arcs involving other characters. The actress had been concerned that the fans did not like her while the production was underway as she was not receiving any fan mail, except for that which she received on her first day of filming. De Boer was not aware that the production team had been holding sacks of mail from the public for her, and she was only able to access it about three quarters of the way through the season. Ezri was referred to as [...] "Ally McTrill" [...] by TV Guide magazine — a reference to the title character on the television series Ally McBeal — which de Boer took <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment.</b>|$|E

Cartman also writes comments about Wendy on a blackboard, which is a prop often used by Beck on his television program. The day after [...] "Dances with Smurfs" [...] originally aired, Beck himself discussed the episode on his radio program. Beck said he had not watched the episode himself but took the parody <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment,</b> and that he particularly enjoyed Cartman's hair, which was combed in a style similar to Beck. Steve [...] "Stu" [...] Burguiere, the executive producer of Beck's radio show, also complimented the episode, and said of Parker and Stone, [...] "These guys skewer everybody and they are always very good at it." ...|$|E

500|$|Dawson {{described}} the prosthetics for the Klingon version of Torres as [...] "a forehead, nose, and teeth". She {{felt that the}} look was not as sophisticated as the character's normal appearance as a half-human/half-Klingon {{because of the lack}} of skin tones and nuances of the facial features. While Dawson's make-up typically took two hours to apply, the full Klingon prosthetics took around three hours. To save time reapplying the make-up and prosthetics repeatedly, each day's shooting would concentrate on one of the two characters, and switch the following day. Dawson compared the experience to repertory theatre. Despite the casting of the photo double, and attention to scheduling, Kolbe expressed disappointment in not being able to shoot more scenes with the two versions of Torres in the cave, but understood the frequent use of the split screen could negatively impact the production cost. After the episode had aired, Dawson called her parents to ask their opinions. They replied: [...] "ou were good, but the girl that played that Klingon was really great!" [...] Dawson took their remarks <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment.</b>|$|E
500|$|Former Major League Baseball player Wes Parker almost {{literally}} {{walked into}} his role. He was doing play-by-play reporting for a Los Angeles television station owned by Lear's partner, Jerry Perenchio. [...] "Lear casually asked if I'd {{be interested in the}} part. I said yes, but knew it was out of the question, because in real life things don't happen that way. Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show. I read for the part, got it and didn't sleep at all that night." [...] Linda Gray was somewhat non-plussed upon being offered the role of transgender Linda Murkland. [...] "I remember meeting Norman and him saying, 'You'll be perfect for the role.' I didn't know whether to take that <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> or what." [...] To prepare for her role, Linda Gray asked Lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman. Gray met with her for several hours prior to the beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production. Lois Nettleton reportedly based her characterization of Christina Stockwood on Clark Gable. Production started in early March 1977 with director Herbert Kenwith.|$|E
500|$|None of {{the columns}} after Dunne joined The American Magazine {{attracted}} the attention the earlier ones had, but Mr. Dooley continued {{to comment on the}} issues of the day. [...] Andrew Carnegie was a repeated target, as was John D. Rockefeller, whom Dooley summed up with [...] "he never done anything wrong, save in the way of business" [...] In 1909, during the debates over the Payne–Aldrich Tariff, Dunne examined the bill and came out of it with an exotic item called [...] "divvy-divvy", which Mr. Dooley allowed, [...] "was let in <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to [...] Senator Aldrich. It's his motto." [...] A seventh Dooley book was published in 1910, but given disappointing sales, the publishers abandoned plans for another in 1911. Although Dunne was a strong supporter of Roosevelt in the contentious 1912 presidential election, Mr. Dooley retained his customary above-the-fray attitude, mocking Roosevelt's excited oratory with Dooley feeling there was a large fire somewhere, a mystery solved when he opens the newspaper and learns [...] "much to my relief, that it was not my pants but the Republic that was on fire".|$|E

500|$|In [...] "The Coon", Butters {{suspects}} heavyset comedian Bruce Vilanch is Cartman's superhero {{alter ego}} {{based on his}} physique. After the episode aired, Vilanch sent a card to Parker and Stone thanking them for referring to him. Shortly after [...] "Whale Whores" [...] aired, Paul Watson {{said he was not}} offended by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad South Park brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter, and the Japanese role in it, to a large audience. After Billy Mays appeared in [...] "Dead Celebrities", his son Billy Mays III said he loved the episode and found its portrayal of his father tasteful and respectful. Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, the stars of Ghost Hunters who were also mocked in [...] "Dead Celebrities", said they loved the parody and encouraged fans to watch the show on their Twitter accounts. The day after [...] "Dances with Smurfs" [...] originally aired, Glenn Beck discussed the episode on his radio program and said he took the parody <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment.</b> The Jonas Brothers' publicist specifically forbade reporters from asking the band members about their portrayal in [...] "The Ring".

500|$|Laybourne Smith's {{first major}} work with Woods, Bagot & Jory was the {{refurbishment}} of the National Bank building on King William Street, {{and from there}} he graduated {{to work on a}} number of notable buildings within South Australia and interstate. Both the firm in general and Laybourne Smith in particular were traditionalists in their designs, to the point where Page reports that Laybourne Smith took <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> a description of one of his works in 1965 as [...] "striped pants and all". This traditionalism was particularly evident in their work for the University of Adelaide. Between 1910 and 1945, the firm served as architects to the University of Adelaide, and Bagot strove towards congruity for the university. The result included a number of buildings that were designed by Laybourne Smith in a [...] "Georgian revival" [...] style, including the original heritage listed Student Union building and the main building of the Waite Agricultural Research Institute, which is also heritage listed and has been described as being [...] "reministent of the great English country houses". Similarly, Laybourne Smith applied traditional designs to a number of ecclesiastical projects. These include St Cuthbert's Anglican Church in North Adelaide, which is heritage listed as an example of Gothic Revival architecture; and the romanesque St. Dominic's Chapel at the Cabra Dominican College in Cumberland Park.|$|E
500|$|Between {{the first}} and second season of {{promenade}} concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. [...] In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, [...] "I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> that the queen said to him, [...] "Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?" ...|$|E
