50|$|An <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent</b> is {{a hormone}} {{antagonist}} acting upon thyroid hormones.|$|E
50|$|The main antithyroid {{drugs are}} {{carbimazole}} (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. A less common <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent</b> is potassium perchlorate.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{perchlorate}} {{can be used}} as an <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent</b> used {{to treat}} hyperthyroidism, usually in combination with one other medication. This application exploits the similar ionic radius and hydrophilicity of perchlorate and iodide.|$|E

40|$|Methimazole and {{propylthiouracil}} {{have been}} used in the management of hyperthyroidism {{for more than half a}} century. However, hepatotoxicity is one of the most deleterious side effects associated with these medications. The mechanism(s) of hepatic injury induced by <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents</b> is not fully recognized yet. Furthermore, there are no specific tools for predicting the occurrence of hepatotoxicity induced by these drugs. The purpose of this article is to give an overview on possible susceptibility factors in liver injury induced by <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents.</b> Age, gender, metabolism characteristics, alcohol consumption, underlying diseases, immunologic mechanisms, and drug interactions are involved in enhancing antithyroid drugs-induced hepatic damage. An outline on the clinically used treatments for antithyroid drugs-induced hepatotoxicity and the potential therapeutic strategies found to be effective against this complication are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{metabolic}} rate {{can be affected}} by some drugs, such as <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents,</b> drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism, such as propylthiouracil and methimazole, bring the {{metabolic rate}} down to normal and restore euthyroidism. Some {{research has focused on}} developing antiobesity drugs to raise the metabolic rate, such as drugs to stimulate thermogenesis in skeletal muscle.|$|R
50|$|Administration is oral, with peak serum {{concentrations}} {{occurring in}} one hour, and actively concentrated to the thyroid gland. Depending on several patient variables, however, euthyroid status {{may not be}} achieved until 2-4 months after treatment initiation. Of note, the drug is approximately 70% protein-bound and significantly ionized at normal physiologic pH, while the <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent</b> methimazole is substantially less protein bound. However both are equally transferred across the placenta.|$|E
40|$|Remarkable {{morphological}} {{and physiological}} changes may be {{brought about by}} the administration of estrogenic hormones to the prepuberal pullet. These changes may include increases of the oviduct weight, liver weight, liver protein and liver lipid {{as well as of the}} levels of calcium, phosphorus, protein and lipid in the blood. There is some experimental evidence that these responses may be conditioned by the effects of the thyroid hormones. There is a somewhat more limited literature on the effects of the <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent,</b> thiouracil, on estrogen-induced changes of serum calcium, serum protein, liver weight, liver protein and liver lipid...|$|E
40|$|Neuroanatomical mapping {{as well as}} the {{influence}} of thyroid status on brain mast cell distribution and detectable mast cell number in adult Rana esculenta is studied. Treatment with tizoxin (T 4) does not modify number or activational state of brain mast cells, whereas administration of the <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent</b> 6 -n-propyl- 2 -thiouracil induces a significant increase (up to 40 %) in the mast cell number within the telencephalon and diencephalon. Hypophysectomy induces a significant decrease (up to 65 %) of mast cells in all brain regions, whereas the pituitary homogenate augments their number, The results suggest that the pituitary-thyroid axis may be involved in the regulation of brain mast cell population...|$|E
50|$|Six mg of iodide a day {{can be used}} {{to treat}} {{patients}} with hyperthyroidism due to its ability to inhibit the organification process in thyroid hormone synthesis, the so-called Wolff-Chaikoff Effect. Prior to 1940, iodides were the predominant <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents.</b> In large doses, iodides inhibit proteolysis of thyroglobulin, which permits TH to be synthesized and stored in colloid, but not released into the bloodstream.|$|R
40|$|Inhaled {{corticosteroids}} (ICSs) {{are used}} as first-line drugs for asthma, and various novel antiasthma drugs targeting type 2 immune mediators are now under development. However, molecularly targeted drugs are expensive, creating an economic burden on patients. We and others previously found pendrin/SLC 26 A 4 as a downstream molecule of IL- 13, a signature type 2 cytokine critical for asthma, and showed its significance in the pathogenesis of asthma using model mice. However, the molecular mechanism of how pendrin causes airway inflammation remained elusive. We have recently demonstrated that hypothiocyanite (OSCN−) produced by the pendrin/DUOX/peroxidase pathway {{has the potential to}} cause airway inflammation. Pendrin transports thiocyanate (SCN−) into pulmonary lumens at the apical side. Peroxidases catalyze SCN− and H 2 O 2 generated by DUOX into OSCN−. Low doses of OSCN− activate NF-κB in airway epithelial cells, whereas OSCN− in high doses causes necrosis of the cells, inducing the release of IL- 33 and accelerating inflammation. OSCN− production is augmented in asthma model mice and possibly in some asthma patients. Heme peroxidase inhibitors, widely used as <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents,</b> diminish asthma-like phenotypes in mice, indicating the significance of this pathway. These findings suggest the possibility of repositioning <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents</b> as antiasthma drugs...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we did not}} observe cases of {{clinical}} hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism because patients were referred to the endocrinologist in case of abnormal TSH concentrations. Therefore, we focused on treatment with l-thyroxine or <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents</b> as a measure of thyroid dysfunction. It must be noted that the large proportion of patients taking l-thyroxine in the present sample (one-third) {{may be due to the}} over-surveillance bias in patients treated with lithium as well as to the multiple indications for treatment: hypothyroidism (lithium- and/or autoimmunity-related), hormone replacement after thyroidectomy (for goitre or cancer), and TSH-suppressing therapy of nodular goitre. The apparent association between treatment with l-thyroxine and stage G 3 b (Table  2) vanished in the adjusted analyses (Tables  3 and 4).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Thiamazole is {{a widely}} used <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent</b> that has been {{approved}} {{for the treatment of}} hyperthyroidism. Although thiamazole-induced hepatotoxicity is a main side effect, it may progress to liver failure in a very few cases. Case Presentation We described a 24 -year-old patient with hyperthyroidism and trilogy of Fallot, who developed liver failure due to thiamazole. Liver biopsy showed intrahepatic cholestasis, mild inflammatory infiltrates, as well as significant fibrosis, indicating both acute and chronic liver injuries. Although a series of potent therapies were given, the patient deceased due to severe liver decompensation. Conclusions This case suggests that thiamazole-induced hepatotoxicity in the setting of advanced fibrosis increases the risk of poor outcome. Regular liver function monitoring during thiamazole therapy is therefore important. </p...|$|E
40|$|Exposure of rats {{to higher}} {{environmental}} temperature (36 - 37 °C) decreased {{the capacity of}} their kidney mitochondria to oxidize succinate. The decrease was corrected on the addition of exogenous cytochromec. Kidney mitochondria of heat-exposed animals showed decreased rates of H_ 2 O_ 2 generation when α-glycerophosphate, but not succinate, was used as electron donor. These mitochondria also showed decreased activity of α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase but not of succinate dehydrogenase. The content of cytochrome c in kidney mitochondria of heat-exposed animals was low even though the concentration of the pigment in the whole tissue did not decrease. Starvation as well as administration of an <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent</b> like propylthiouracil simulated some {{of the effects of}} heat exposure on kidney mitochondria, but the cytochrome c-dependent reversal of inhibition of oxidation was obtained only in heat exposure...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} diisopropyl 1, 3 -dithiolan- 2 -ylidenemalonate (NKK- 100) on experi-mental fatty livers was {{investigated}} in chicks administered an <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent</b> plus synthetic estrogen or in estrogenized, starved-refed chicks, NKK- 100 was added at levels of 250, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg diet, Liver weight was significantly decreased by administration of NKK- 100 at 1500 mg/kg diet in the estrogen-administered chicks. Liver lipid content and liver lipid deposition were significantly and inversely decreased with increasing NKK- 100 concentration in the diet in the estrogen administered chicks. Plasma transaminase activity, which was elevated by the estrogen administration, was reduced by the administration of NKK- 100. These results suggest that NKK- 100 may be of value in preventing fatty livers in poultry. (Key words: fatty liver, liver lipid, plasma glutamate oxalacetate transaminase, estrogen, NKK- 100...|$|E
40|$|Pure {{red cell}} aplasia (PRCA) is an {{uncommon}} hemato-logic disorder characterized by severe anemia, with al-most {{complete absence of}} erythroblasts in otherwise nor-mal bone marrow and reticulocytopenia with normal leukocyte and platelet counts in the peripheral blood. 1, 2 The course may be acute and self-limiting or chronic.

40|$|Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a {{major problem}} for {{pharmaceutical}} industry and drug development. Mechanisms of DILI are many and varied. Elucidating the mechanisms of DILI will allow clinicians to prevent liver failure, need for liver transplantation, and death induced by drugs. Methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are two convenient <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents</b> which their administration is accompanied by hepatotoxicity as a deleterious side effect. Although several cases of antithyroid drugs-induced liver injury are reported, there is no clear idea about the mechanism(s) of hepatotoxicity induced by these medications. Different mechanisms such as reactive metabolites formation, oxidative stress induction, intracellular targets dysfunction, and immune-mediated toxicity are postulated to be involved in antithyroid agents-induced hepatic damage. Due to the idiosyncratic nature of antithyroid drugs-induced hepatotoxicity, it is impossible to draw a specific conclusion about the mechanisms of liver injury. However, it seems that reactive metabolite formation and immune-mediated toxicity have a great role in antithyroids liver toxicity, especially those caused by methimazole. This review attempted to discuss different mechanisms proposed {{to be involved in the}} hepatic injury induced by antithyroid drugs...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of thyroid disorders including subclinical diseases {{is compatible with}} that of diabetes mellitus, {{one of the most}} epidemic metabolic disorders causing social problems. Graves' disease accounts for more than 90 % thyrotoxicosis in Japan. However painless thyroiditis, which is self-limiting, should be ruled out before treatment. One of the important issues for the treatment of Graves' disease with antithyroid drugs is how to manage the agranulocytosis, {{one of the most serious}} side effects of <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents.</b> Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-related vasculitis is also an important side effect recognized recent 1 y. Regarding to hypo-function of thyroid, patients with hyperlipidemia should be evaluate thyroid functions. Remarkable low levels of free thyroxine are frequent 1 y reported in patients with serious disease, or after major operations but 1 -thyroxine replacement therapy is not indicated for these patients. Simultaneous measurement of TSH and free thyroid hormones may be helpful for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most epidemic thyroid disorder, is not always accompanied with hypothyroidism but is a risk factor for overt hypothyroidism. Treatment of adult hypothyroidism should be initiated with low doses of T 4, especially in patients with coronary heart diseases...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Symptoms of both {{hypothyroidism}} and thyrotoxicosis can {{be easily}} overlooked in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). We report on a patient whose parkinsonian tremor worsened and proved refractory not only to common treatment, but also to deep brain stimulation (DBS). Case Presentation. A 61 -year-old woman with advanced PD underwent bilateral subthalamic DBS, with an excellent outcome. Twenty-one months after the surgery, however, patient’s resting/postural tremor markedly worsened. There was a slight improvement for 1 month after repeated adjustments of DBS parameters, but then the tremor worsened again. Since even a minimal increase of the dose of dopaminergic drugs caused extremely severe dyskinesias, an anticholinergic drug biperiden and benzodiazepine clonazepam were introduced, what helped for another month. With the onset of severe diarrhoea, a laboratory workup was performed. Thyrotoxicosis was detected. During treatment with the <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent</b> carbimazole, the parkinsonian tremor clearly improved within two weeks. Conclusion. A hyperthyroid state can markedly exaggerate all forms of tremor, {{as well as other}} types of movement disorders. This condition can be overlooked or masked by other symptoms. Therefore, if the tremor in a patient with PD gradually worsens and proves resistant to the usual treatment, examine the thyroid gland...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{profitability}} of the meat production in the livestock industry there were many cases of abuse of different substances with anabolic effect - stilbenes, stilbene derivatives, their salts and esters, <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents,</b> natural and synthetic hormones sterodini, lactones of resorcylic acid and beta-agonists. Mode of action of substances with anabolic effect in the body differs in these groups of substances, and results in increased nitrogen retention, protein synthesis and breakdown of fat. Although the mechanisms of action are different and can be direct or indirect, use of anabolic steroids results in the same final effect, i. e. higher growth in animal breeding and better organoleptic properties of meat. Toxicological studies showed {{that the use of}} anabolic steroids on animals has resulted in numerous toxic effects on human health, considering it to be accumulated in animal tissue, which is further used in human nutrition. More cases of abuse of anabolic steroids in the world has led to significant adverse consequences for the health of consumers.

40|$|First-line {{treatment}} in Graves' disease is often done with <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents</b> (ATD), but relapse rates remain high making definite treatment necessary. Predictors for relapse risk help guiding initial treatment decisions.; We aimed to externally validate the prognostic {{accuracy of the}} recently proposed Graves' Recurrent Events After Therapy (GREAT) score to predict relapse risk in Graves' disease.; We retrospectively analyzed data (2004 - 2014) of patients with a first episode of Graves' hyperthyroidism from four Swiss endocrine outpatient clinics.; Relapse of hyperthyroidism analyzed by multivariate Cox regression.; Of the 741 included patients, 371 experienced a relapse (50. 1 %) after a mean follow-up of 25. 6 months after ATD start. In univariate regression analysis, higher serum free T 4, higher thyrotropin-binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII), younger age and larger goiter were associated with higher relapse risk. We found a strong increase in relapse risk with more points in the GREAT score from 33. 8 % in patients with GREAT class I (0 - 1 points), 59. 4 % in class II (2 - 3 points) with a hazard ratio of 1. 79 (95 % CI: 1. 42 - 2. 27, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and 73. 6 % in class III (4 - 6 points) with a hazard ratio of 2. 24 (95 % CI: 1. 64 - 3. 06, P[*]<[*] 0. 001).; Based on this retrospective analysis within a large patient population from a multicenter study, the GREAT score shows good external validity {{and can be used}} for assessing the risk for relapse in Graves' disease, which influence the initial treatment decisions...|$|R

40|$|TSH is {{the major}} {{stimulator}} of thyrocyte proliferation, but its role in thyroid carcinogenesis remains unclear. To address this question, we used a mouse model of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) (TRβPV/PV mice). These mice, harboring a dominantly negative mutation (PV) of the thyroid hormone-β receptor (TRβ), exhibit increased serum thyroid hormone and elevated TSH. To eliminate TSH growth-stimulating effect, TRβPV/PV mice were crossed with TSH receptor gene knockout (TSHR−/−) mice. Wild-type siblings of TRβPV/PV mice were treated with an <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent,</b> propylthiouracil, to elevate serum TSH for evaluating long-term TSH effect (WT-PTU mice). Thyroids from TRβPV/PVTSHR−/− showed impaired growth with no occurrence of FTC. Both WT-PTU and TRβPV/PV mice displayed enlarged thyroids, but only TRβPV/PV mice developed metastatic FTC. Molecular analyses indicate that PV acted, via multiple mechanisms, to activate the integrins-Src-focal adhesion kinase-p 38 MAPK pathway and affect cytoskeletal restructuring to increase tumor cell migration and invasion. Thus, growth stimulated by TSH is a prerequisite but not sufficient for metastatic cancer to occur. Additional genetic alterations (such as PV), destined to alter focal adhesion and migration capacities, are required to empower hyperplastic follicular cells to invade and metastasize. These in vivo findings provide new insights in understanding carcinogenesis of the human thyroid...|$|E

In our previous work, the E-State approach was used to introduce two new antithyroid drugs Abouthiouzine (ABZ) [1 -n-butyl- 3 (isonicotinamido) - 2 -thiourea] and Abouthiouline (ABL) [1 -cyclohexyl- 3 (3 -quinolyl) - 2 -thiourea] with modified acyclic thiourylene structure to reduce antioxidative and mutagenic activity. This {{study was conducted to}} compare the antioxidant, phagocytic, clastogenic and proliferative effects of our newly designed <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents</b> with propylthiouracil, methimazole and thyroxine. Different experiments were undertaken on the agents to investigate their antioxidant and proliferative activities. Chemiluminescence’s (CL) response and phagocytic activity on isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) were used to evaluate antioxidant effects. Micronucleus test on femoral cells of mice as well as protein and nucleic acids level in hepatic cells were also used to investigate proliferative and mutagenic effects. It was found that all compounds except abouthiouzine inhibited the CL response and suppressed the phagocytic activity; however, the intensity was comparatively less than that of propylthiouracil. Cytological studies demonstrated that none of the compounds were clastogenic, however, the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) to normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE) was found to be increasing by the treatment with propylthiouracil, methimazole and thyroxine, whereas this ratio was comparatively less after treatment with Compounds I and IV, Abouthiouline and Abouthiouzine. These results were supported by biochemical analysis. The newly synthesized antithyroid drugs reduced the antioxidative and proliferative activity as compared to propylthiouracil and methimazole. Further studies are warranted to determine the exact mode of action of these compounds before clinical trials are undertaken to suppress agranulocytosis...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 61 -year-old male patient with chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease and a large cervicomediastinal multinodular hyperfunctioning goiter that made thyroidectomy a daunting task, especially considering the risk of intraoperative bleeding. The preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scan showed the right thyroid lobe very deeply rooted in the mediastinum, below the horizontal plane passing through the aortic arch. The thyroid mass imprinted the arterious and venous innominate trunks. To avoid a median sternotomy and remove the enlarged thyroid through a cervical approach alone, we decided to reduce the goiter in volume preoperatively by embolizing the thyroid arteries. We embolized the superior and inferior left, and the inferior right thyroid arteries. We spared the superior right thyroid artery because its blood supply contributed little to thyroid perfusion. After embolization, the patient was treated with <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents</b> and corticosteroid drug therapy. At the same time, severe leukocytosis developed, thyroid hormone values increased, and a CT scan obtained 7 days after embolization showed the thyroid unchanged in volume. We therefore discharged the patient and were waiting for his laboratory blood chemical findings to return to normal. Thirty days later the patient was readmitted to hospital, and a new CT scan showed that the thyroid mass had diminished to half its initial volume. We could therefore perform a total thyroidectomy through a cervical approach alone. The only problem arose in dissecting tight right inferior laryngeal nerve adhesions to the thyroid capsule, probably sequelae of postembolization thyroiditis. Even though preoperative thyroid-artery embolization cannot be considered a routine technique in cervicomediastinal goiter surgery, in a rare patient who presents with a voluminous goiter such as the one we describe here, it is a useful procedure...|$|R
40|$|Pregnant rats were {{submitted}} to a selenium-deficient diet immediately after mating; it was continued for 4 weeks after delivery. The pups were sacrificed at 3 and 4 weeks of age. Perchlorate, an <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agent</b> inhibiting iodide trapping in the thyroid, was administered via the drinking water to half of the rats. Rats {{submitted to a}} normal laboratory diet and to the experimental diet supplemented with selenium were used as controls. The effects of selenium deficiency were {{an increase in the}} number of growth abnormalities, growth retardation, and decreased seleno-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in plasma and in various organs. These effects were relieved by selenium supplementation in the diet. Perchlorate treatment induced the classic picture of primary hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency increased thyroid hormone levels in perchlorate-treated rats and in controls drinking tap water. In the latter group, it also decreased TSH plasma concentration and thyroid weight. These effects were partially reversed by Se supplementation. In vitro experiments, performed on adult rats, revealed increased radioiodide uptake and organification in glands from the rats submitted to the selenium-free diet. Plasma T 3 half-life was similar in control and Se-deficient rats. These data suggest a higher efficiency of thyroid hormone synthesis in the thyroids of selenium-deficient rats, despite a lower thyroid stimulation as evaluated by serum TSH. They are compatible with the hypothesis that decreased selenium supply, leading to a decreased GSH-Px in the thyroid, increases hydrogen peroxide steady state level and thus thyroid peroxidase activity and thyroid hormone synthesis.

The purpose of this current work was to explore, for the first time, the disposition of abouthiouzine following intravenous and oral administration using an animal model; also, to study its plasma protein binding properties. Abouthiouzine (2 mg/kg intravenously) was administered to healthy male Vole rabbits and Beagle dogs. A dose of 20 mg/kg of the drug was also given orally to another group of Beagle dogs. Abouthiouzine plasma concentrations were measured using an HPLC method, and its pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by non-compartmental analysis. Abouthiouzine plasma protein binding was determined using an ultrafiltration technique. The drug was quickly eliminated from the rabbit and dog systemic circulations with terminal half-lives (T 1 / 2 l) of 0. 7 h and 1. 9 h, respectively. The calculated T 1 / 2 l following the oral administration in dogs was 1. 8 h. Total abouthiouzine clearance (CL) in rabbits was 7. 84 0. 87 ml/min/kg, and 4. 03 0. 83 ml/min/kg in dogs. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) in rabbits and dogs was 360. 09 63. 41 ml/kg and 481. 10 62. 64 ml/kg, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability in dogs was 16 %, which may indicate poor absorption characteristics of the pure drug and/or an extensive first past effect. Protein binding {{studies have demonstrated that}} abouthiouzine has moderate-to-high binding properties (63 %– 86 %).

Abouthiouzine plasma protein binding was determined using an ultrafiltration technique. The drug was quickly eliminated from the rabbit and dog systemic circulations with terminal half-lives (T- 1 / 2 lambda) of 0. 7 h and 1. 9 h, respectively. The calculated T- 1 / 2 lambda following the oral administration in dogs was 1. 8 h. Total abouthiouzine clearance (CL) in rabbits was 7. 84 +/- 0. 87 ml/min/kg, and 4. 03 +/- 0. 83 ml/min/kg in dogs. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V-ss) in rabbits and dogs was 360. 09 +/- 63. 41 ml/kg and 481. 10 +/- 62. 64 ml/kg, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability in dogs was similar to 16 %, which may indicate poor absorption characteristics of the pure drug and/or an extensive first past effect. Protein binding {{studies have demonstrated that}} abouthiouzine has moderate-to-high binding properties (similar to 63 %- 86 %). Further studies are needed to evaluate the route of elimination of abouthiouzine in these animal models including any metabolite formation and the role of enterohepatic recycling in this process.

40|$|Determination of fibrinolytic {{activity}} of male adnexal f l uid (human seminal fluid, dog prostatic fluid) was made using fibrin-plate method. The results are summarized as follows. I. Fibrinolytic enzymes of human seminal plasma. 1) In very few instances, a little plasmin ac t ivity {{was found in}} human seminal plasma which was proved to be almost all plasminogen activator and so proactivator was absent or trace. 2) As thermostability, the fibrinolytic activity showed a peak at 37 °C in a range between pH 4 and 9. 3) There was n o significant relationship between fibrinolytic activity and number or motility rate of spermatozoa in patients with male sterility. 4) In patients with male sterility, fibrinolytic activ i t y was increased in all cases after treatment with gonadotropin and testosterone. However the activity showed a decrease around 40 th. to 60 th. day of treatment in many cases. More than a half of cases, moreover, the activity again increased at 20 days after cessation of the treatment. II. Fibrinolytic enzymes of dog prostatic fluid. 1) Fibrinolytic {{activity of}} prostatic fluid obtained from so called Huggins' dog was determined. 2) Fibrinolytic activity of dog prostatic fluid showed highest peak during 20 to 40 minutes followed by a decrease around 120 minutes. 3) As the increase in dose of pilocarpin-H CI injected, the amount of prostatic fluid and activity of fibrinolysis were increased. 4) Treatment with various h o rmones made the fibrinolytic activity of prostatic fluid altered. Increase of fibrinolytic activity was achieved after testosterone propionate or gonadotropin injections, slight in crease was observed after ACTH, anabolic hormones or prolactin injections, slight decrease after cortisone therapy and decrease after estrogen administration. No significant change occurred after treatment with thyroid hormone or <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} disorders (IDD) including goiter {{is still}} considered {{as one of the}} major nutritional problems in Indonesia, including in Central Java. Theoritically, IDD is usually and widely reported to be found in high mountain areas, where the iodine content in soil and water usually low. Eventhough iodine supplementation and salt fortification with iodine program have been done widely, the result of the program has not shown to be optimum. But, in fact, {{it has been reported that}} endemic goiter areas have spreaded widely into low land and coastal areas. The importance of iodine deficiency in goitrogenesis and the prevention and treatment of endemic goiter by iodine supplementation are firmly established. However, epidemiologic and experimental evidence revealed that environmental phenomenons may be responsible for many goiters. Several categories of naturally occurring and anthropogenic <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents</b> may enter the water, air, and food exposure pathways, becoming important environmental goitrogenic factors in areas. Their effects may be additive to those of iodine deficiency, making the intensity of the manifestations of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) more severe. Their presence should be considered particularly in areas where the features of IDD persist despite adequate iodine prophylaxis. The primary objective of this report was to determine and summarize if the prevalence of goiter in low land and coastal areas has changes over the period 1995 - 1996 to 2003. The prevalence tended to be higher and a new "endemic goiter area" was found. Goiter appears to be a mild to moderate public health problem in low land as well as costal areas. The prevalence and severity of goiter was more severe compared to the previous decade. The change may be due to ecological phenomenon like eroded flood,which may have potentially goitrogenic and adverse effect on the imbalancy of macro-micro elements in soils. In order to have an effective program, the regular monitoring of iodine content and other macro and micronutrient (such as selenium and plumbum) content in the environment (soil, water, food) is essential. ...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) such as {{superoxide}} radical anion (O 2 •¯), hydroxylradical (OH•), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) that are produced during the metabolism of oxygen under oxidative stress in aerobic organisms destroy several key biomolecules {{and lead to}} a number of disease states. Mammalian systems possess several effective defense mechanisms including antioxidant enzymes to detoxify these ROS. The selenocysteine-containing Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is particularly an efficient enzyme in the detoxification of H 2 O 2 and other hydroperoxides by using glutathione (GSH) as cofactor. The chemistry at the active siteof GPx has been extensively investigated with the help of synthetic selenium compounds. Although the anti-inflammatory compound ebselen(2 -phenyl- 1, 2 -benzoisoselenazol- 3 (2 H) -one) is undergoing phase III clinical trial as antioxidant, the chemistry of ebselen is still not understood. The present study on a number of ebselen derivatives with various N-substitutions reveals that the substitution at the N atom is important for the antioxidant activity. This study also suggests that the nature for thiol cofactor has a dramatic effect on the GPx activity of ebselen derivatives. It has been shown that ebselen exhibits very poor catalytic activity in the presence of aromatic thiols mainly due to strong Se…. O nonbonded interactions that lead to extensive thiol exchange reactions in the selenenyl sulfide intermediate. To prevent the se…. O interactions, a series of tertiary amide-based diselenides have been synthesized along with their secondary amide counterparts. Detailed structure-activity correlation studies reveal that the GPx-like activity of the sec-amide-based compounds can be significantly enhanced by the substitution at the free-NH group of sec-amide functionality. The N,N-dialkylbenzylamine-based diselenides exhibit their catalytic activities via the generation of selenols which was confirmed by the reaction with anti-arthritic gold(I) compounds. Interestingly, the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the 6 th position of the benzene ring of N,N-dialkylbenzylamine-based diselenides by a methoxy group prevents the thiol exchange reactions mainly be weakening the Se…N interactions and thus enhances the GPx activity. On the other hand, the catalytic activity of the tert-amine-based diselenides can also be increased by replacing the tert-amino groups with the corresponding sec-amine moieties. It has been observed that the basic amino group in the amine-based diselenides deprotonates the selenol and also the thiol cofactor, which is crucial for the higher catalytic activities of the amine-based compounds. Peroxynitrite (PN, ONOO), a strong nitrating agent, is known to inactivate a number of proteins, enzymes and other biomolecules by nitration of tyrosine residues. In this study, we have shown that the commonly used antithyroid drugs and their analogues inhibit protein tyrosine nitration. This study reveals that <b>antithyroid</b> <b>agents</b> having PN scavenging activity may be beneficial of hyperthyroidism as these compounds may protect the thyroid gland from nitrative or nitrosative stress...|$|R
