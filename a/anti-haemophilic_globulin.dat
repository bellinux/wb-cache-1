In 1937, Patek and Taylor, two doctors from Harvard, discovered <b>anti-haemophilic</b> <b>globulin.</b> In 1947, Pavlosky, a doctor from Buenos Aires, found haemophilia A and haemophilia B to be separate diseases by doing a lab test. This test was done by transferring the blood of one haemophiliac to another haemophiliac. The fact that this corrected the clotting problem showed that there was more than one form of haemophilia.|$|E

Without {{the help of}} investigating the relatives, the nephew of Case 1, the haemophiliac, and the uncle of Case 2, with Christmas disease, {{there would have been}} considerable delay in reaching the diagnosis and so instituting the correct treatment. Ordinarily the laboratory diagnosis of classical haemophilia (haemophilia A) and Christmas disease (haemophilia B, plasma thromboplastin component deficiency) is easy using the thromboplastin genera-tion test as described by Biggs and Douglas (1953). Nevertheless difficulty arises when the patient mildly deficient in <b>anti-haemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> or Christmas factor is transfused following haemorrhage. The concentration of the deficient factor may be raised for a variable period above 30 % wit...|$|E
40|$|In {{the theory}} of blood {{coagulation}} proposed by Biggs (1955) it is supposed that blood thrombo-plastin is produced by the interaction of <b>anti-haemophilic</b> <b>globulin,</b> Christmas factor, platelet lipoid factor, factor VII, factor V, and calcium. Russell viper venom (R. V. V.) {{can act as a}} thromboplastin, i. e., convert prothrombin to thrombin, only after combination with platelet lipoid factor and factor V (Rapaport, Aas, and Owren, 1954 a). The action of R. V. V. would, therefore, appear to resemble that of a mixture of antihaemophilic globulin, Christmas factor, and factor VII, and the observation of Owren (1954) that R. V. V. gives normal one-stage prothrombin times with samples of plasma deficient in these sub-stances supports this hypothesis. The experiments described in this paper were undertaken to obtain more direct evidence of the relation of R. V. V. to the substances developed during coagulation. The thromboplastin generation test devised by Biggs and Douglas (1953), which enables the contribu-tions of the clotting factors in plasma, in serum, and in platelets to be assessed separately, was used for this purpose. By introducing R. V. V. in place of the ordinary constituents of the test, the relative efficacy of R. V. V. and the thromboplastin ante-cedents found in the human blood has been deter-mined. In addition, the effect of plasma lipoid on the coagulant action of. R. V. V. (Macfarlane, Trevan, and Attwood, 1941; Fullerton and Anastasopoulos, 1949) and the effect of adsorption of R. V. V. on a mineral precipitate (Jenkins, 1954) have been re-investigated...|$|E
