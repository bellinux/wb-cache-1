50|$|<b>Attornment</b> in {{commercial}} real estate is generally used {{in the context of}} a subordination, non-disturbance and <b>attornment</b> agreement (SNDA), which protects both the tenant and the lender in the event the landlord defaults on its commercial lending obligations. The lease remains in full force and effect.|$|E
50|$|In mortgages, an <b>attornment</b> clause is {{a clause}} whereby the {{mortgagor}} attorns tenant to the mortgagee, thus giving the mortgagee {{the right to}} distrain, as an additional security. As used in modern legal transactions, the term <b>attornment</b> refers to an acknowledgment {{of the existence of}} the relationship of landlord and tenant. A tenant often has the duty under the tenant's lease, particularly in commercial leases, to provide an <b>attornment</b> upon request, and is required by a creditor or potential buyer of property from the landlord to establish the nature of existing encumbrances on and income streams flowing from a property, as an element of the due diligence process associated with the transaction. Frequently, a tenant must declare the existence of any outstanding disputes with the landlord at the time the <b>attornment</b> is executed and waives any dispute not declared at that time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Attornment</b> (from French tourner, [...] "to turn"), in English real {{property}} law, is the acknowledgment {{of a new}} lord by the tenant on the alienation of land. Under the feudal system, the relations of landlord and tenant were {{to a certain extent}} reciprocal. So it was considered unreasonable to the tenant to subject him to a new lord without his own approval, and it thus came about that alienation could not take place without the consent of the tenant. <b>Attornment</b> was also extended to all cases of lessees for life or for years. The necessity for <b>attornment</b> was abolished by an act of 1705.|$|E
5000|$|In certain cases, the {{possession}} {{does not need}} to be actual possession, but may be constructive possession. For example, possession of a document of title will often suffice where it is not possible to possess the goods. [...] In many legal systems, there may also be constructive possession by <b>attornment.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{request for}} an <b>attornment</b> from a tenant which is refused {{can be used by}} a {{landlord}} as a basis for establishing grounds for eviction on the grounds of insecurity that the lease will be honored, or the existence of an actual case or controversy suitable for resolution in a declaratory judgment action.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{that it was}} [...] "M" [...] who {{delivered}} the car, {{it was necessary for}} Santam to prove that there had been some form of <b>attornment,</b> a tripartite agreement between Santam, the panelbeater and [...] "M" [...] to the effect that, although the panelbeater had formerly held for [...] "M," [...] it would thereafter hold for Santam. There was, however, no attempt to prove such an attornment; accordingly, the attempt to establish possession prior to 5 July had to fail.|$|E
50|$|Perumpuzha {{is a small}} {{suburban}} town in Kollam {{district of}} Kerala, India.The junction is the meeting place of Kottiyam-Kundara & Kollam-Veliyam roads. Distance from Kollam city is about 16 km. Near to the town junction there is a market called Perumpuzha market. Assissi <b>Attornment</b> Hospital is just 1 or 2 minutes walk from the junction. If you walk 3 minutes from junction towards north, a cashew factory is there. Previously it was under the Dalmia Management. The local name for the company was 'Sayippinte Company'. But now it is under CAPEX (A Kerala Govt. undertaking).|$|E
5000|$|... "A {{delivery}} order was not {{regarded as a}} document of title at common law {{with the result that}} the transfer of the {{delivery order}} did not effect transfer of constructive possession of the goods. <b>Attornment</b> {{on the part of the}} bailee was required (i.e., an acknowledgement that the bailee held the goods on behalf of the transferee). The Uniform Documents of Title Act permits the use of negotiable delivery orders (if the order directs delivery to a named person or order). However, it is still necessary to single out delivery orders for special treatment. Until the delivery order is accepted by the bailee, there is no basi for imposing obligations on the bailee. See discussion under sections 18 and 19 [...] See also the definition of [...] "issuer"." ...|$|E
5000|$|Justice La Forest {{wrote the}} {{unanimous}} reasons of court for dismissing the appeal. After surveying the case law in both England and the United States {{he noted that}} the old common law rules, based on territoriality, sovereignty, independence and <b>attornment,</b> were outdated. La Forest argued that a modern approach based on the principle of comity ("the deference and respect due by other states to the actions of a state legitimately taken within its territory") and reciprocity were needed a basis of recognizing foreign judgments. The infringement on the nation's sovereignty is justified where there is mutual convenience between states. The earlier views of distrusting the justice system of other countries, he argued, was outdated. Instead, he emphasized that the business community operates on a world economy and so the law must accommodate [...] "the flow of wealth, skills and people across state lines".|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} settlement, apparently on {{the marriage}} of Maurice and Alice Poyntz, was licensed on 1 November 1437, as recorded in the Patent Rolls:“Licence, for 4 marks paid in the hanaper, for Maurice Denys to enfeoff John Fort, Simon Cotesbroke, John Burnell the younger and John Pakker of Iron Acton, and their heirs, of two parts (i.e. 2/3rds) of the manors of Alveston and Erdecote (i.e. Earthcott Green), with the hundred and frankpledge of Langele, (i.e. Langley) co. Gloucester, held in chief, and of {{the remainder of the}} third part of the premises, likewise held in chief, after the death of Margaret, the wife of John Kemys, who with her said husband, holds the same in dower. Licence also for the said feoffees, after having had seisin and received the <b>attornment</b> of the said John Kemys and Margaret to refeoff the said Maurice and Alice, his wife, and the heirs of their bodies of the said two parts, and to grant them the said remainder under the same entail, with remainder to the right heirs of the said Maurice."Such entails were usual and required by the father of the bride to ensure that his daughter and her progeny obtained title to the estate of the proposed husband. Since Sir Walter Denys eventually obtained Alveston, Earthcott Green and Langeley hundred, it would seem that he must have been the heir of the body of Alice Poyntz, not of Katherine Stradling, as the pedigree in the 1623 Visitation of Gloucestershire shows. However, it appears the entail was never finalised, as in 1466 Maurice and Alice obtain licence again to settle the same manors on feoffees, which power they would not have had if the manors had been held by feoffees since 1437. Also, the settlement of 1466, shortly before Maurice's death, does not give remainder to the heirs of the body of Alice, which might explain how Sir Walter Denys obtained the manors. The 1466 settlement is recorded in the Patent Rolls, dated at Westminster, 12 October 1466:“Licence, for 33s. 4d. Paid in the hanaper, for Maurice Denys, esquire, and Alice his wife to grant the manors of Alleweston and Erthecote and the hundreds of Langley and Alleweston, co. Gloucester, held in chief, to Humphrey Poyntz and Thomas Lymeryk, and for the latter to regrant the same to the said Maurice and Alice for life, with remainder to the heirs of the body of Maurice and final remainder to his right heirs." ...|$|E
40|$|South African law, as a mixed jurisdiction, {{is based}} on both common law and civil law principles. The legal rules {{pertaining}} to the bill of lading illustrate how divergent legal systems are harmonised in South African law. Although neither the bill of lading nor the Safex silo receipt {{can be regarded as}} negotiable instruments, both exhibit the characteristics of a document of title. Bulk cargo and grain stored in a silo, however, provide particular difficulties with regard to effecting symbolical delivery of the goods and thus transferring ownership. It is submitted that, despite reservations about construing an <b>attornment</b> in the case of bills of lading in English law, <b>attornment</b> could be employed as a form of delivery, both in the case of grain in mass storage, and where bills of lading and silo receipts are dematerialised...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the advantages of}} a nondistrubance and <b>attornment</b> provision in a lease. An NDA clause benefits the both the subtenant and landlord and may help a tenant attract subtenants. It gives security to subtenants that if the tenant declares bankruptcy the subleases will remain intact. The landlord benefits because it eliminates the need to find new tenants...|$|E
40|$|Among private lawyers {{trained in}} Western European or Western European-derived legal traditions there is broad {{consensus}} about the central features of law. This consensus crystallizes around {{the features that}} distinguish law from other normative systems (exogenous criteria of identification), and around the features that distinguish Western European law from other legal orders (endogenous criteria of identification). This paper presents alternatives to both orthodoxies: it adopts a legal pluralist conception of normativity itself, rejecting the tenets of monism, centralism, positivism and prescriptivism that together define conventional conceptions of law’s domain (law’s sites); and it adopts a legal pluralist conception of legal normativity in particular, rejecting both institutionalization and formalization as litmus tests for identifying legal rules (law’s modes). As a ground for exploring the legal pluralist heresy we have chosen a central concept of private law – marriage. Consistently with critical legal pluralist methodology, which emphasizes heterogeneity, flux and dissonance in the normative lives of human agents and which is especially attuned to trajectories of internormativity, we organize this inquiry around (and in counterpoint to) the liturgical form of the Roman Catholic wedding ceremony. Ultimately what is heresy in one normative order may be apostasy in another; and what is apostasy in one may be revelation in a third. In a legal pluralist cosmology, eschatological questions are always present and must always be subject to <b>attornment</b> because they can themselves never be finally decided...|$|E
40|$|In May 2014, it was {{discovered}} that Dezheng Resources, a Chinese trading company, had multiple warehouse receipts issued for metal stored in the ports of Qingdao and Penglai in Shandong province. Approximately 400 ’ 000 tons of alumina, aluminium and copper worth around $ 380 million were used to obtain $ 4. 2 billion in financing from 18 Chinese and 7 international banks. The fraud {{was discovered}} {{in the course of a}} government corruption investigation of a Party official. The warehouses have been put under lockdown and have not reopened since. A large part of the financing had been done in the form of commodity repurchase agreements, or repos. These instruments are ownership structures, in which title to the goods and risks pass from the trader to the financier for the duration of the transaction, as opposed to secured lending, in which the goods are pledged to the lender who has a security interest in them. Among the many lawsuits that followed the scandal, the most prominent one was Mercuria v Citibank that was expected to be a test of a key principle of repos, that of the true sale. The objective of this report is to study the consequences of the scandal for commodity repo financing. We start by examining the functioning of these instruments and the context in which the scandal happened. Based on that knowledge, we analyze how Qingdao has affected the use of repos and draw up recommendations regarding the legal and operational aspects of setting up these deals. We find that while in Mercuria v Citibank the issues of true sale and whether it is possible to contract out of <b>attornment</b> to effect delivery were not considered by the judge, the repo structure as such was upheld and remains fundamentally viable. In addition to complying with true sale, the structures should be reviewed by lawyers to ensure that they work across the jurisdictions governing the sale and repurchase contracts and that of the country where the goods are located. In order to reduce the risk of fraud, the lenders should have visibility over the goods’ origin and engage in financing of trading flows that serve to satisfy a real industrial or commercial demand, conduct due diligence on counterparties and warehouses, make use of collateral management agreements and actually visit the storage locations. It is critical not to deal on documentary basis only, but to be aware of the reality of the goods one acquires and the risks to which they are exposed...|$|E
