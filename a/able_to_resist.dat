5|$|In some archaea, the {{lipid bilayer}} is {{replaced}} by a monolayer. In effect, the archaea fuse the tails of two phospholipid molecules into a single molecule with two polar heads (a bolaamphiphile); this fusion may make their membranes more rigid and better <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> harsh environments. For example, the lipids in Ferroplasma are of this type, which is thought to aid this organism's survival in its highly acidic habitat.|$|E
5|$|Michael's cousin, Dan, then laid {{claim to}} Wallachia. Many of Michael's boyars (including the {{influential}} Albul and Utmeș) defected to the pretender. Dan crossed into Wallachia in early 1420. Initially, Michael was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist,</b> {{but since he}} had failed to implement all provisions of his 1419 treaty with the Ottoman Empire, his cousin was able to obtain military assistance from the Ottomans. Michael received support from Hungary, but their united forces were routed in the summer of 1420. Michael was killed on the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} as Secretary of State by Daniel Webster. In response to concerns raised {{by one of}} the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit, Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain modifications to the treaty. Letcher brought these modifications to the Mexican diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking with the blessing of the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded {{that they would not be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> such action, but still refused to accept the modifications to the treaty.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir {{was wise}} {{enough to realize that}} such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also {{realized}} what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir would not have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E
5|$|Human {{habitation}} in {{the southern}} portion of the Florida peninsula dates to 15,000years ago. Before European colonization, the region was dominated by the native Calusa and Tequesta tribes. With Spanish colonization, both tribes declined gradually during the following two centuries. The Seminole formed from mostly Creek {{people who had been}} warring to the North; they assimilated other peoples and created a new culture. After being forced from northern Florida into the Everglades during the Seminole Wars of the early 19th century, they adapted to the region and were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> removal by the United States Army.|$|E

5|$|News of the {{outbreak}} of war took five months to reach the Indian Ocean but British forces, recently engaged in the Third Anglo-Mysore War, were mobilised in preparation and immediately seized the ports of French India. Only Pondicherry was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist,</b> and a siege was instigated on 1 August 1793 by Colonel John Braithwaite while Cornwallis imposed a naval blockade. British forces constructed trenches and batteries, often under heavy fire, over the following weeks. Twenty days after the city was cut off, Braithwaite began a bombardment of the defences. Within hours the French commander Colonel Prosper de Clermont requested a truce, followed the next morning by an unconditional surrender.|$|E
5|$|The small glaciers in {{the forest}} are less <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> melting than the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Once a glacier begins retreating, it may fall into disequilibrium and be unable to find mass balance (accumulation versus melting rate) at any size. Without a {{favorable}} climate change, {{it will continue to}} retreat until it disappears. Loss of glacial ice already reduces the summer glacial runoff that supplies water to streams and lakes and provides a cold-water source vital to certain fish and plant species. This, in turn, may {{have a significant impact on}} the forest ecosystem over time.|$|E
5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed. The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both the quality and {{quantity}} of products in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery and a lack of oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E

The Dark Presence has grown strong enough to start to influence the townspeople and create the forces that have chased Alan. That night, as Alan and Barry take shelter, they get drunk on moonshine, and Alan starts to recall memories of being forced to write Departure during the prior week, and realizes that the Dark Presence is now trying to use his writings to escape.|$|E
5|$|As {{fighting}} raged in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den, Col. Strong Vincent of V Corps had {{a precarious}} hold on Little Round Top, an important hill {{at the extreme}} left of the Union line. His brigade of four relatively small regiments was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> repeated assaults by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade of Hood's division. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, had realized {{the importance of this}} position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, an artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy Little Round Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of Little Round Top with a bayonet charge by the 20th Maine, ordered by Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain but possibly led by Lt. Holman S. Melcher, {{was one of the most}} fabled episodes in the Civil War and propelled Col. Chamberlain into prominence after the war.|$|E
5|$|Since only castles {{built of}} stone and walled towns had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> Mongol attacks, {{following}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Mongols the kings encouraged both the landowners and the townspeople to build stone fortifications. New stone fortresses were built, for example, at Codlea, Rimetea, and Unguraş. The process of urbanization was characterized by the predominance of the Saxon towns: out of the eight towns in Transylvania, only Alba Iulia and Dej were situated in the counties. A charter referring to inns, bakeries, and bathhouses in Rodna proves the city-like way of life of its inhabitants. Salt was still the most important item of trade in this period, but trading with oxen, maidservants, and wine is also documented in royal charters.|$|E

40|$|This study {{sheds light}} on the {{difficulties}} people face in cooperating <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> coercion. We adapt a threshold public goods game to investigate whether people are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cooperate <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> coercion despite individual incentives to free-ride. Behavior in this resistance game {{is similar to that}} observed in multi-period public goods games. Specifically, we observe "out-of-equilibrium" outcomes and a decrease in successful resistance in later periods of a session compared to earlier ones. Nevertheless, cooperation remains relatively high even in the later periods. Finally, we find that increasing the resistance threshold has a substantial negative effect on the probability of successful resistance. ...|$|R
5|$|The diets of {{both groups}} {{consisted}} mostly of shellfish and fish, small mammals, game, and wild plants. Having access only to soft limestone, most of the tools fashioned by Native Americans in the region were made of shell, bone, wood, and animal teeth; shark teeth were used as cutting blades, and sharpened reeds became arrows and spears. Shell mounds still exist today within the park, giving archaeologists and anthropologists evidence of the raw materials available to the indigenous people for tool construction. Spanish explorers estimated the number of Tequesta at first contact to be around 800, and Calusa at 2,000; the National Park Service reports there were probably about 20,000 natives living {{in or near the}} Everglades when the Spanish established contact in the late 16th century. The Calusa society was more advanced, as they lived in social strata, and were able to create canals, earthworks, and shellworks. The Calusa were also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> Spanish attempts at conquest.|$|E
5|$|From {{the summer}} of 1940, the Committee became {{increasingly}} divided between the members keen for closer collaboration with the Germans, led by Victor Leemans, and those who wished to remain strictly within the proscribed Belgian legal framework, led by Ernst de Bunswyck. In October 1940, the Germans were able to pass fundamental changes to the system of regional Burgomasters in the country though the Committee without resistance. The Committee had announced in October 1940 that it would refuse to enforce anti-Jewish legislation, but did not resist their implementation by the military government. The Committee's ambivalent stance meant that Belgian policemen and civil servants were not instructed to refuse to participate in rounding-up of Jews {{as part of the}} Final Solution from 1942. Tensions grew between the Germans and the committee in December 1940, and in early 1941 the Germans reshuffled the committee; appointing more pro-Nazi members. From March 1941, {{it became clear that the}} Committee would no longer be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> German demands, even those clearly violating the Hague Convention.|$|E
5|$|Germany had {{pressured}} Finland {{to enlarge}} its offensive activities in Karelia {{to aid the}} Germans in their Leningrad operation. Finnish attacks on Leningrad itself remained limited. Finland stopped its advance just short of Leningrad and had no intentions to attack the city. The situation was different in eastern Karelia. The Finnish government agreed to restart its offensive into Soviet Karelia to reach Lake Onega and the Svir River. On 4 September this new drive was launched on a broad front. Albeit reinforced by fresh reserve troops, heavy losses elsewhere on the front meant that the Soviet defenders of the 7th Army were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> the Finnish advance. Olonets was taken on 5 September. On 7 September, Finnish forward units reached the Svir River. Petrozavodsk, {{the capital city of}} the region fell on 1 October. From there the Army of Karelia moved north along the shores of Lake Onega to secure the remaining area west of Lake Onega, while simultaneously establishing a defensive position along the Svir River. Slowed by winter's onset they nevertheless continued to advance slowly during the following weeks. Medvezhyegorsk was captured on 5 December and Poventsa fell the next day. On 7 December Finland called a stop to all offensive operations, going onto the defensive.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eighth}} century, Mercia {{was the most}} {{powerful}} kingdom in southern England, {{but in the early}} ninth Wessex became dominant. In the 820s King Egbert of Wessex conquered south-east England (Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Essex). His reign saw the beginning of Viking attacks, but Egbert and his son Æthelwulf, who succeeded in 839, were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> them. Æthelwulf died in 858, and he was followed by four sons in succession. King Æthelbald died in 860, and King Æthelberht in 865; Æthelwold's father, Æthelred, then succeeded to the throne. In the same year the Viking Great Heathen Army invaded England. Within five years they had conquered Northumbria and East Anglia, and forced Mercia to buy them off. In late 870 the Vikings invaded Wessex, and in early 871 they fought armies under Æthelred and Alfred in four battles in quick succession, the last two of which Wessex lost. Æthelred died shortly after Easter that year, leaving young sons. Primogeniture was not established in this period, and it was believed that kings should be adults, so he was succeeded by his younger brother Alfred.|$|E
5|$|What {{is known}} of the {{inhabitants}} of Florida after 1566 was recorded by European explorers and settlers. Juan Ponce de León is credited as the first European to have contact with Florida's indigenous people in 1513. Ponce de León met with hostility from tribes {{that may have been}} the Ais and the Tequesta before rounding Cape Sable to meet the Calusa, the largest and most powerful tribe in South Florida. Ponce de León found {{at least one of the}} Calusa fluent in Spanish. The explorer assumed the Spanish-speaker was from Hispaniola, but anthropologists have suggested that communication and trade between Calusa and native people in Cuba and the Florida Keys was common, or that Ponce de León was not the first Spaniard to make contact with the native people of Florida. During his second visit to South Florida, Ponce de León was killed by the Calusa, and the tribe gained a reputation for violence, causing future explorers to avoid them. In the more than 200years the Calusa had relations with the Spanish, they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> their attempts to missionize them.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} of native Catholics expanded greatly {{in the years following}} his consecration, Soegijapranata was soon faced with numerous trials. The Empire of Japan invaded the Indies beginning in early 1942, and during the ensuing occupation numerous churches were seized and clergymen were arrested or killed. Soegijapranata was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> several of these seizures, and {{spent the rest of the}} occupation serving the Catholics in his vicariate. After President Sukarno proclaimed the country's independence in August 1945, Semarang was overcome with unrest. Soegijapranata helped broker a ceasefire after a five-day battle between Japanese and Indonesian troops and called for the central government to send someone to deal with the unrest and food shortages in the city. However, these problems continued to grow, and in 1947 Soegijapranata moved his seat to Yogyakarta. For the remainder of the national revolution Soegijapranata worked to promote international recognition of Indonesia's independence. Soon after the Dutch, who had returned in late 1945, recognised the country's independence, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. During the post-revolution years he wrote extensively against communism and expanded the church; he also served as a mediator between several political factions. He was made an archbishop on 3January 1961, when Semarang was elevated to an ecclesiastical province. At the time he was in Europe, participating in the first session of the Second Vatican Council. Soegijapranata died in 1963, in Steyl, the Netherlands. His body was flown back to Indonesia, where he was made a national hero and interred at Giri Tunggal Heroes' Cemetery in Semarang.|$|E
