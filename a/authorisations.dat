5|$|The {{earliest}} known American lodges were in Pennsylvania. The Collector for {{the port}} of Pennsylvania, John Moore, wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, {{two years before the}} formation of the first Grand Lodge in London. The Premier Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania. Other lodges in the colony obtained <b>authorisations</b> from the later Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was particularly well represented in the travelling lodges of the British Army. Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any Grand Lodge, applying and paying for their authorisation only after they were confident of their own survival.|$|E
5|$|In 1532, Pedro de Alvarado, {{governor}} of Guatemala, was issued with royal authorisation {{to conquer the}} general area of Higueras, {{in order to establish}} a Caribbean port for Guatemala. Less than a year after permission was given to Alvarado, then {{governor of}} Honduras and Higueras, Diego Alvítez, was given royal authorisation to pacify and colonise the Naco valley and the area around Puerto de Caballos. Soon afterwards, in 1533, Francisco de Montejo, governor of Yucatán, was granted governorship over a huge area extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ulúa River, Naco and Puerto de Caballos, so long as neither Alvarado nor Alvítez had established themselves in those regions. At the same time, Alvardo received reconfirmation of his permission to conquer those parts of Higueras that had not been pacified by the governors of Yucatán and Honduras-Higueras. Effectively, all three governors had royal permission to conquer and settle the same general region, and could interpret the royal <b>authorisations</b> as they chose.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{two main}} contributions. The {{first one is}} BP-TRBAC, a unified <b>authorisation</b> model that can support legacy systems as well as business process systems. BP-TRBAC supports specific features that are required by business process environments. BP-TRBAC {{is designed to be}} used as an independent enterprise-wide <b>authorisation</b> model, rather than having it as part of the workflow system. It is designed to be the main <b>authorisation</b> model for an organisation. The second contribution is BP-XACML, an <b>authorisation</b> policy language that is designed to represent BPM <b>authorisation</b> policies for business processes. The contribution also includes a policy model for BP-XACML. Using BP-TRBAC as an <b>authorisation</b> model together with BP-XACML as an <b>authorisation</b> policy language will allow an organisation to manage and control <b>authorisation</b> requests from workflow systems and other legacy systems...|$|R
40|$|Authorised users (insiders) {{are behind}} the {{majority}} of security incidents with high financial impacts. Because <b>authorisation</b> {{is the process of}} controlling users’ access to resources, improving <b>authorisation</b> techniques may mitigate the insider threat. Current approaches to <b>authorisation</b> suffer from the assumption that users will (can) not depart from the expected behaviour implicit in the <b>authorisation</b> policy. In reality however, users can and do depart from the canonical behaviour. This paper argues that the conflict of interest between insiders and <b>authorisation</b> mechanisms is analogous to the subset of problems formally studied in the field of game theory. It proposes a game theoretic <b>authorisation</b> model that can ensure users’ potential misuse of a resource is explicitly considered while making an <b>authorisation</b> decision. The resulting <b>authorisation</b> model is dynamic in the sense that its access decisions vary according to the changes in explicit factors that influence the cost of misuse for both the <b>authorisation</b> mechanism and the insider...|$|R

25|$|During the transition, then-C Sir Colin McColl {{embraced a}} new, albeit limited, policy of {{openness}} towards the press and public, with 'public affairs' falling into the brief of Director, Counter-Intelligence and Security (renamed Director, Security and Public Affairs). McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 {{by the government of}} John Major. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 Intelligence Services Act. Although the Act provided procedures for <b>authorisations</b> and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for <b>authorisations)</b> and 1985 (under the Interception of Communications Act, for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.|$|E

30|$|ECHA and Member States {{authorities}} learned {{an important}} lesson while proposing SVHC {{for inclusion in the}} candidate list, and in Annex XIV for <b>authorisation.</b> The experience revealed that <b>authorisation</b> is not always the appropriate measure to reduce and to control the risks of SVHC. <b>Authorisation</b> is focusing on the use of a substance and on placing on the market for a certain use. Especially for SVHC released into the environment as constituents or residues in articles, <b>authorisation</b> is not helpful to reduce emissions, because articles are not subject to <b>authorisation.</b> In addition, <b>authorisation</b> is not appropriate to introduce maximum residue levels for substances of very high concern in articles. The need to minimise the levels of SVHC in articles might especially be considered for imported articles. Hence, for certain SVHC, a restriction might be a better alternative to control the risks adequately.|$|R
