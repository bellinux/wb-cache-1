50|$|In May 1973, the KAF {{received}} five of {{an eventual}} eight Fairchild C-123K Provider transports on paper, which were employed extensively alongside the C-47s of the 1st Transport Squadron on air-drop resupply operations. That same month, under an <b>accelerated</b> <b>delivery</b> programme named Project Nimble Voyage, the Americans gave the KAF ten UH-1G helicopter gunships, which {{were assigned to}} the Helicopter Squadron. Five of the machines were deployed to Battambang Airbase and the other five helicopters were stationed at Pochentong, being used extensively alongside the AC-47 and AU-24A gunships in the Mekong-Bassac convoy support role. Under Project Flycatcher, an improvement programme for the KAF, the Americans delivered twelve T-28D Trojans, six UH-1H helicopters, five C-123K Providers and a smaller number of C-47 transports and O-1D Bird Dogs, later followed by a single AU-24A mini-gunship and twenty-four Cessna T-37B Tweet jet trainers before the programme was officially terminated on June 30, 1973. This was to be the last US delivery of aircraft to Cambodia, which nevertheless significantly improved the combat capability of the KAF.|$|E

40|$|In public procurement, {{social welfare}} often {{depends on how}} quickly the good is delivered. A leading example is highway construction, where slow {{completion}} inflicts a negative externality on commuters. In response, highway departments award some contracts using scoring auctions, which give contractors explicit incentives for <b>accelerated</b> <b>delivery.</b> We characterize efficient design of these mechanisms. We then gather an extensive dataset of highway projects awarded by the California Department of Transportation between 2003 and 2008. By comparing otherwise similar contracts, we show that where the scoring design was used, contracts were completed 30 - 40 % faster and the welfare gains to commuters exceeded the increase in procurement costs. Using a structural model that endogenizes participation and bidding, we estimate that the counterfactual welfare gain from switching all contracts from the standard design to the efficient A+B design is nearly 22 % of the total contract value ($ 1. 14 billion). ...|$|E
40|$|The B-cell antigen {{receptor}} (BCR) internalizes bound antigen such that antigen-derived peptides become associated with emigrating {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class II molecules for presentation to T cells. Experiments with B-cell transfectants reveal that BCR confers a specificity of intracellular targeting since chimeric {{antigen receptor}}s which internalize antigen by virtue of a heterologous cytoplasmic domain do not necessarily give rise to presentation. In contrast, however, previous {{studies have shown that}} antigen binding to irrelevant cell surface molecules (e. g. transferrin receptor, MHC class I) can ultimately lead to presentation. The solution to this paradox appears to be that the intracellular targeting by BCR actually reflects an acceleration of antigen delivery. Depending {{on the nature of the}} BCR-antigen interaction, this accelerated targeting can be essential in determining whether or not internalization leads to significant presentation. Physiologically, the <b>accelerated</b> <b>delivery</b> of antigen by BCR could prove of particular importance early in the immune response when antigen-BCR interaction is likely to be poor...|$|E
