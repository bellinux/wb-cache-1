Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with Caracol in Belize. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the acropolis, including the building of the site's first ballcourt.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of his}} favourites, Hazlitt places Cymbeline {{first in}} his discussions of Shakespeare's plays, {{according}} it extensive treatment.

5|$|The castle was {{outdated}} {{but remained}} {{vital to the}} defense of Kamianets and nearby trade routes; as a result, the voivode of Kraków, Spytek of Melsztyn, began modernizing the complex {{at the turn of the}} 15th century. During the reconstruction, the old towers were renovated and ten new towers were added. <b>A</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> later, the castle was updated again, this time by military engineer and architect , who built the New Western and Eastern Towers, the castle's eastern wall and an underground gallery, as well as the Full Gates and housing for the town's starosta community.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire, roads in the region deteriorated. Only the Via Sclavonica is known to have existed in the region by year 1030. It was an eastwest route {{spanning}} from Pazin to Poreč. Road transport in the region lost significance after the peninsula was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice. From 18091813, the TriestePula route was rebuilt by the First French Empire, after the French captured the entire region from Venice and the Habsburgs. Upgrades to the regional road network continued after the Austrian Empire acquired Istria at the 18141815 Congress of Vienna. By 1830, the road network in Istria had expanded to a degree that would not change for <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> The only significant improvement of region's roads was paving of the TriestePula road in 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Yamhad was {{an ancient}} Semitic kingdom {{centered}} on Ḥalab (Aleppo), Syria. The kingdom emerged {{at the end}} of the 19th century BC, and was ruled by the Yamhadite dynasty kings, who counted on both military and diplomacy to expand their realm. From the beginning of its establishment, the kingdom withstood the aggressions of its neighbors Mari, Qatna and Assyria, and was turned into the most powerful Syrian kingdom of its era through the actions of its king Yarim-Lim I. By the middle of the 18th century BC, most of Syria minus the south came under the authority of Yamhad, either as a direct possession or through vassalage, and for nearly <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> Yamhad dominated northern, northwestern and eastern Syria, and had influence over small kingdoms in Mesopotamia at the borders of Elam. The kingdom was eventually destroyed by the Hittites, then annexed by Mitanni in the 16th centuryBC.|$|E
5|$|In the 11th century, the earls of Orkney were at {{the height}} of their power. The Earl of Orkney, Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, also ruled Caithness and Sutherland, and seems to have {{controlled}} the western seaboard of Scotland, and the Hebrides. Historian Magnús Stefánsson described the political situation of the Hebrides and the Isle of Man during the 11th and early 12th century as being unstable, and suffering from the rivalries of petty kings and chieftains. In 1079, the Hebridean warlord Gofraidh Crobhán was able to unite the Hebrides and the Isle of Man into an effective independent kingdom. In 10989, the Norwegian king Magnús Óláfsson invaded the Hebrides, and asserted his right over the islands; he did so again in 11023. He is thought to have planned to unite Orkney, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Mann, under the control of his son. In 1103, Magnús was slain in Ireland, and no Norwegian king set foot in the islands for over <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> With Magnús' death, the Outer Hebrides were brought back {{under the control of the}} Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, whose kings tactfully recognised Norwegian sovereignty. In 1156, the kingdom was partitioned following an inconclusive sea battle between the warlord Somhairle mac Gille Brighde, and the Manx king Gofraidh mac Amhlaibh: the Outer Hebrides remained under the control of Gofraidh, but the Inner Hebrides were ruled separately by Somhairle. Two years later, Somhairle successfully invaded the Isle of Man, took the throne, and ruled the entire Kingdom of Mann and the Isles until his death in 1164.|$|E
