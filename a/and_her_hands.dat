5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, {{her eyes}} as she checks the {{rear-view}} mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour {{can be seen as a}} foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|During a Friday night performance, Tony is drunk as {{he comes}} {{backstage}} during the interim between his part in Acts IV and V. Felicity is angry that Tony, a recovering alcoholic, got drunk again; she has had to issue several refunds because of his drunken behaviour on stage. She sends him into the shower to sober up, and summons Jim. He is unsure whether he knows the lines well enough to go onstage in Tony's place, but Laura encourages {{him to take the}} chance. As she hands him a prop dagger, he sees blood all over the dagger <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Tony comes out of the shower and wants to finish the performance, so Jim allows him to go. Laura berates Jim for his lack of ambition. She is left alone in the dressing room and hears noises coming from the shower; but when she goes to look, it is empty. A scream is then heard from the stage.|$|E

25|$|Her tomb {{was created}} by Pietro Torrigiano, who {{probably}} arrived in England in 1509 and received the commission in the following year. The gilded bronze sculpture on the tomb depicts Margaret with her head resting on pillows <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> raised in prayer, wearing garments characteristic of widowhood; the face was probably sculpted from a death mask. The black marble tomb is embellished with heraldic bronze insignia, including a yale, her heraldic badge, at her feet.|$|E

2500|$|Hanbali: According to the Hanbali school, {{there are}} two differing views on whether a woman's whole body is awrah or not. Mālik, Awzāʿī, and Shafiʿī suggest that the awrah of a woman is her entire body {{excluding}} her face <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Hence, covering the face would not be obligatory (fard) in this madhhab.|$|E

2500|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} {{from the}} Catholic Church, Soubirous's claims were eventually declared [...] "worthy of belief" [...] after a canonical investigation, and the Marian apparition {{is now known}} as Our Lady of Lourdes. Since her death, Soubirous's body has apparently remained internally incorrupt, but it is not without blemish; during her third exhumation in 1925, the firm of Pierre Imans made light wax coverings for her face <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> due to the discoloration that her skin had undergone. These masks were placed on her face and hands before she was moved to her crystal reliquary in June 1925.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though she}} was {{familiar}} with the road, Hazel quickly became disoriented due to the blinding, blowing white snow, which made it impossible to see more than a few feet in front of her. She was dressed in warm coat, hat, gloves and sturdy, one-buckle overshoes, but the clothing was insufficient protection against the wind and freezing temperatures, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and feet became numb in the cold. When the sleigh hit a coulee, Hazel slid from the sleigh into waist-deep, mushy snow. She said, [...] "Oh, my! I am wet clear to the waist and my shoes are full of water," [...] her brother recalled later. Her prolonged exposure virtually guaranteed eventual severe hypothermia.|$|E
2500|$|On May 28, 1981, at {{approximately}} 2:15am, Fred Schultz's ex-wife Christine {{was murdered in}} her Milwaukee home.

She had been gagged and blindfolded <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> were tied in front of her with rope. Her two sons, then 7 and 11 years old, found her face down on her bed and bleeding. The older boy, Sean, had seen the assailant and described him as a masked male figure in a green army jacket and black shoes. He also said the man had a long (approx. 6" [...] or 15cm) reddish-colored ponytail. Bembenek had dyed blonde hair, weighed 140 pounds and was [...]|$|E

2500|$|In the forest, Adonis {{has been}} mortally wounded by the boar. Venus hears his cries and rushes to the scene. Seeing the distraught goddess {{with her hair}} loose, half naked, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> bloodstained, Belona is moved to pity and sings a lament. She and the nymph, Libia, try to {{convince}} Venus {{not to look at}} Adonis' body. The chorus describes how the blood of Adonis is turning the white roses around him red. Venus calls upon the gods with a lament. Marte cruelly describes the death of Adonis to Venus, and reveals his bloody body lying among the roses. Venus laments and faints. Amor then appears from the sky to announce that Jupiter has been moved by the plight of the lovers and will elevate them together to Mount Olympus [...] Adonis {{in the form of a}} flower (an anemone) and Venus as the Evening Star. Marte, Venus, Adonis, and Belona all comment, and as the sun sets, Venus and Adonis ascend to the heavens.|$|E
2500|$|Edging {{closer and}} without {{reference}} {{points in the}} whiteout they realised they had got very close to a person {{on their hands and}} knees – Davidson was still up on the plateau trying to crawl for help. [...] away, the closest they could manage, two crew were unloaded but after they had reached the casualty they could not carry her to the helicopter because her legs were locked in a kneeling position. The helicopter could get no closer because when it applied power the blowing snow obliterated vision so one of the crew jumped out to lead it in the right direction using the winch wire. There was no sign of anyone else from Davidson's group. Davidson was taken by helicopter to Aviemore where she was met by ambulance. She was in the advanced stages of hypothermia <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> were frozen solid but, although she was confused and barely able to speak, she managed to let her rescuers know {{that the rest of the}} party was close to where she had been rescued.|$|E
2500|$|Living under reduced {{circumstances}} in Zürich, Maria Alexandrovna was reunited {{with her two}} eldest daughters Marie, Queen of Romania, and Victoria Melita, Grand Duchess of Russia {{who had been on}} the opposite side during the war. In July 1920, she wrote: [...] "I am too utterly disgusted with the present state of the world and mankind in general... They have destroyed and ruined my beloved Russia, my much-loved Germany". She was a broken woman, her figure, always plump, became thin <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> trembling. Although she had been affected by gastric troubles, her death came unexpectedly. [...] Eight days after her sixty-seventh birthday, on 25 October 1920, the only child of Tsar Alexander II to survive the Russian Revolution died in her sleep of a heart attack. She [...] was buried in the ducal mausoleum at [...] in Coburg besides her husband and their son. [...] " [...] She was profoundly religious", her eldest daughter wrote, [...] "I hope God will not disappoint her as most things and beings did in this life".|$|E

2500|$|The {{execution}} {{was performed}} in the square of Hötorget in Stockholm the 5 August 1676. Malin Matsdotter was to be executed alongside Anna [...] "Annika" [...] Simonsdotter Hack, known as [...] "Tysk-Annika", who had also been accused {{and sentenced to death}} on the testimony of her own children, but was to be executed the normal way by decapitation before burning. The contrast between the behavior of the two have been noted. Anna Simonsdotter was described as full humility and respect and behaved as was expected by her, and though she did not directly say that she was guilty, she behaved as was expected of her, and [...] "by her remorse, by her psalms, and by falling on her knees and lifting her head <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> to the sky, confirmed the justice in the verdict and the justice in the world". According to contemporary witnesses, Malin Matsdotter behaved with great dignity and courage during her execution. When asked to take the hand of her daughter to make peace with her before death, she refused. She [...] "did not seem to fear death much, courageously mounting the stake", and even the official execution protocol noted that she [...] "was very tough".|$|E
