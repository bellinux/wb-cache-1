Macrosporogenesis {{and development of}} the female gametophyte have been studied. The ovule is anatropous, tenuinucellate and unitegmic with 1 - 3 -cellular archesporium.

The single <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell</b> differenti-ates into a macrospore mother cell and after meiosis a linear tetrad forms in the ovule.

First, only the <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell</b> and/or megasporocyte are present within their ovaries {{at the time}} of anthesis. Second, their suspensors consist of a single cell and their mature embryos consist of a gradient of small to large cells. Nile red staining of a globular embryo reveals the presence of cuticular material in the surface wall of embryo proper and the lateral walls of suspensor cell, indicating that the basal wall of suspensor cell is the major route for nutrient supply from maternal tissues to embryo proper. Third, their seed coats are derived from a single integument, and lignin but not cuticular material is present in the outer most layer of seed coat and persists through seed maturation.|$|E

We have previously {{reported that the}} multiple <b>archesporial</b> <b>cells</b> 1 (mac 1) mutation identifies a gene that {{plays an important role}} in the switch of the hypodermal cells from the vegetative pathway to the meiotic (sporogenous) pathway in maize ovules. Here we report that the mac 1 mutation alters the developmental fate of the hypodermal cells of the maize anther. In a normal anther a hypodermal cell divides periclinally with the inner cell giving rise to the sporogenous <b>archesporial</b> <b>cells</b> while the outer cell, together with adjacent cells, forms the primary parietal layer. The cells of the parietal layer then undergo two cycles of periclinal divisions to give rise to three wall layers. In mac 1 anthers the primary parietal layer usually fails to divide periclinally so that the three wall layers do not form, while the <b>archesporial</b> <b>cells</b> divide excessively and most fail to form microsporocytes.

In all these varieties gametic chromosome number is n= 24. Meiosis in pollen mother cells is normal and characterised by the regular incidence of 24 bivalents and their regular disjunction. This has resulted in high pollen fertility. Occassionally occurring two univalents in var. panicoides and one tetravalent in var. velutina are the only abnormalities observed.

The developmental stage of the archesporium at which colchicine took effect was determined by cytological examination of the ploidy levels of the nuclei of the adjacent tapetal cells. The type of pollen abnormality induced depended on the time of application and the concentration of colchicine. Uninucleate monads with 4 randomly positioned pores and uninucleate monads without pores were obtained with 0 5 % colchicine. Multipored polyads and multipored uninucleate monads were observed together in anthers treated with o-oi % colchicine. Naturally occurring aberrant pollen types in hybrids of Triticum aestivum x Aegilops mutica or T. aestivum x Aegilops sharonensis have revealed a constant relation-ship between the disposition of the meiotic spindles and the siting of the pollen pores. The colchicine-induced abnormalities have further clarified the nature of this relationship leading to the interpretation that both the positioning of the spindles and the siting of the pores are pre-determined by events taking place in the premeiotic interphase at a time just after the last mitosis of the pollen mother cells and the penultimate mitosis of the tapetum.

We have analyzed somatic gynoecial sectors marked with red flavonoid pigments by excision of Ac from the P locus. Somatic sector analysis indicates the epidermal lineage starts {{as a single}} cell layer {{at the base of}} the ovary and thickens into several cell layers, presumably by periclinal divisions, near the silk attachment point. The silk attachment point appears to be mainly an epidermal outgrowth of two of three fused carpels and presumably the silk contains only LI, or mostly LI, with only traces of subepidermal LII cells. The third carpel, covering the germinal face of the kernel, retains a multicellular LII and unicellular LI organization but fails to contribute substantially to stylar outgrowth. Ac transpositions in subepidermal somatic sectors are transmitted to the <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell</b> lineage. Ac transpositions that occur in epidermal sectors are not transmitted to offspring.

40|$|Few Arabidopsis mutants {{defective}} {{in early}} {{male or female}} germline development have been reported. A novel extinction screen has been devised which permits the identification of mutants deficient in the earliest stages of anther development. Using mutagenized plants carrying GUS reporter constructs driven by tapetal-specific promoters originally derived from Brassica genes, {{a wide spectrum of}} mutants have been identified in Arabidopsis, ranging from those defective in <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation to others expressed later in development. Crosses between these lines and known anther development mutants have enabled the identification of lines carrying mutations in genes expressed during very early anther formation. Initial characterization reveals these early mutants fall into two classes, gne (GUS-negative) 1 -like, and gne 2 -like. Members of the gne 1 mutant class initiate all four layers of the anther wall and an appropriate number of sporogenous cells; however, as development proceeds the tapetal and middle-layer cells enlarge, eventually crushing the sporogenous cells. The gne 2 class anthers are disrupted at an earlier stage, with the middle and tapetal layers failing to form, and an excess of sporogenous cells developing until the germline aborts late in meiosis II.

The transcript profiling experiments focused on the identification of genes with a modulated expression profile during meiosis, while premeiotic <b>archesporial</b> <b>cells</b> and postmeiotic microspores served as a reference. About 8000 transcript tags, estimated at 30 % of the total transcriptome, were generated, of which around 6 % exhibited a modulated gene expression pattern at meiosis. Cluster analysis revealed a transcriptional cascade that coincides with the initiation and progression through all stages of the two meiotic divisions. Fragments that exhibited high expression specifically during meiosis I were characterized further by sequencing; 90 out of the 293 sequenced fragments showed homology with known genes, belonging {{to a wide range}} of gene classes, including previously characterized meiotic genes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Plant germlines arise late in {{development}} from archesporial initials in the L 2 {{layer of the}} anther and ovule primordia. These cells generate a radially symmetrical array of tissues that, in the Arabidopsis anther, comprises a core of sporogenous cells (meiocytes) and the enveloping tapetum, middle cell, and endothecium layers. The putative transcription factor NZZ/SPL {{is required for the}} specification of <b>archesporial</b> <b>cells,</b> but nothing is known of how their number is regulated, or what controls cell fate in the lineages they generate. Here, we report detailed characterization of extra sporogenous cells (exs), a male sterile mutant that generates extra meiocytes but lacks tapetal and middle cell layers. RESULTS: We identified the EXS locus by map-based cloning and found it to encode a putative LRR receptor kinase. In the anther, an increased number of L 2 layer <b>cells</b> assume an <b>archesporial</b> fate and divide to generate a larger number of sporogenous cells. In seeds, the exs mutation results in smaller embryonic cells, delayed embryo development, and smaller mature embryos. Consistent with the observed phenotype, EXS is expressed in the inflorescence meristem, floral apices, anthers, and in developing seeds. CONCLUSIONS: EXS regulates the number of cells that divide in the L 2 layer of the anther, and thus the number of functional male archesporial initials. In the young seed, EXS affects cell size in the embryo and the rate at which it develops. The apparently contrasting roles of EXS in the anther and embryo suggest that signaling through the EXS receptor kinase is a feature of a number of regulatory pathways in Arabidopsis...|$|R
40|$|Compared to the {{diversity}} of other floral organs, the steps in anther ontogeny, final cell types, and overall organ shape are remarkably conserved among Angiosperms. Defects in pre-meiotic anthers that alter cellular composition or function typically result in male-sterility. Given the ease of identifying male-sterile mutants, dozens of genes with key roles in early anther development have been identified and cloned in model species, ordered by time of action and spatiotemporal expression, and used to propose explanatory models for critical steps in cell fate specification. Despite rapid progress, fundamental issues in anther development remain unresolved, and it is unclear if insights from one species {{can be applied to}} others. Here we construct a comparison of Arabidopsis, rice, and maize immature anthers to pinpoint distinctions in developmental pace. We analyze the mechanisms by which <b>archesporial</b> (pre-meiotic) <b>cells</b> are specified distinct from the soma, discuss what constitutes meiotic preparation, and review what is known about the secondary parietal layer and its terminal periclinal division that generates the tapetal and middle layers.

40|$|The {{switch from}} the {{vegetative}} to the reproductive pathway {{of development in}} flowering plants requires {{the commitment of the}} subepidermal cells of the ovules and anthers to enter the meiotic pathway. These cells, the hypodermal cells, either directly or indirectly form the archesporial cells that, in turn, differentiate into the megasporocytes and microsporocytes. We have isolated a recessive pleiotropic mutation that we have termed multiple archesporial cells 1 (mac 1) and located it to the short arm of chromosome 10. Its cytological phenotype suggests that this locus {{plays an important role in}} the switch of the hypodermal cells from the vegetative to the meiotic (sporogenous) pathway in maize ovules. During normal ovule development in maize, only a single hypodermal cell develops into an <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell</b> and this differentiates into the single megasporocyte. In mac 1 mutant ovules several hypodermal cells develop into archesporial cells, and the resulting megasporocytes undergo a normal meiosis. More than one megaspore survives in the tetrad and more than one embryo sac is formed in each ovule. Ears on mutant plants show partial sterility resulting from abnormalities in megaspore differentiation and embryo sac formation. The sporophytic expression of this gene is therefore also important for normal female gametophyte development...|$|E

We constructed cDNA libraries from orchid ovule tissue during <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, megasporocyte formation, and the transition to meiosis, as well as during the final mitotic divisions of female gametophyte development. RNA gel blot hybridization analysis revealed that four clones were stage specific and expressed solely in ovule tissue, whereas one clone was specific to pollen tubes. Two other clones were not ovule specific. Sequence analysis and in situ hybridization revealed the identities and domain of expression {{of several of the}} cDNAs. O 39 encodes a putative homeobox transcription factor that is expressed early in the differentiation of the ovule primordium; O 40 encodes a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase (CYP 78 A 2) that is pollen tube specific. O 108 encodes a protein of unknown function that is expressed exclusively in the outer layer of the outer integument and in the female gametophyte of mature ovules. O 126 encodes a glycine-rich protein that is expressed in mature ovules, and O 141 encodes a cysteine proteinase that is expressed in the outer integument of ovules during seed formation.

40|$|InCymbidium sinense {{embryo sac}} {{development}} follows the bisporic pattern. This pattern of development {{is rare in}} orchids. Changes in the structure and organization of the microtubular cytoskeleton during megasporogenesis in this orchid were followed using an immunofluorescence technique and confocal microscopy. At the initial stage of development the microtubules in the archespore are randomly oriented throughout the cortex and cytoplasm. Later, microtubules undergo reorganization with more microtubules distributed in the cortex and around the nucleus. Megasporocyte formation is marked by the elongation of the <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell.</b> The cytoskeleton in the elongated megasporocyte is radially organized with microtubules extending from the nucleus to the peripheral region of the cell. In the megasporocyte some of the microtubules also show a polarized pattern of distribution with more microtubules at the chalazal end than the micropylar end. After meiosis I, a dyad is formed. Each dyad member possesses a complement of randomly oriented microtubules. But some microtubules in the dyad also show radial orientation. Soon afterwards microtubules in the degenerating micropylar dyad cell disappear. The functional (chalazal) dyad cell proceeds to meiosis II giving rise to a two-nucleate embryo sac. The pattern of microtubule organization in the two-nucleate embryo sac is quite complex. Each nucleus {{is surrounded by a}} set of randomly distributed microtubules. But the vacuolar region between the two nuclei is surrounded by a parallel array of cytoplasmic microtubules. No preprophase bands were observed during the development of the megasporocyte.

40|$|In {{flowering}} plants, {{after the}} transition from vegetative growth to reproductive development, primordial germ cell initials differentiate from somatic cells in flowers. Several genes that control {{the early stages of}} germ-cell development have been identified, however, {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanism determining the germ cell fate during sexual reproduction in plants. The MEL 1 (MEIOSIS ARRESIED ATLEPTOTENE 1) is the only plant ARGONAUTE (AGO) gene specifically expressing at the primordial germ cells. AGO proteins are known to be a key player in gene-silencing pathways guided by small RNAs. PlWl-domain containing subfamily has important roles in maintaining germ stem cells in animal. In plant, however, there is no AGO gene which belonging to PIWI subfamily. Therefore, a specific AGO gene system in plant germ cell development would be suggested. 　In this study, I focused on the characterization gene expressed at early stages of germ cells development specifically in relation to the MEL 1 function. MEL 1 is well-characterized ARGONAUTE family that has essential functions in germ cell development. To date the rice MEL 1 is the only gene available for investigating a genetic system conducting plant germ cell initiation and maintenance. A large portion of the genes identified specific in very early stages in germ cell development had unknown function However, comparison of gene expression profiles between wild-type and mell- 1 mutant down- or up-regulated in mell- 1 mutant revealed many possible causal genes for mell- 1 dysfunction, i. e. most of which are not characterized previously. Of these genes, the OsSPLl 4, one of SQUAMOSA(SQUA) promoter-binding-like(SPL) family genes, encoding a putative transcription factor, revealed to up-regulated in the mell-l mutant in both Affymetrix (Fold change= 4. 37) and Agilent (= 3. 01) microarray. Sequence and experimental analyses indicated that eleven OsSPL genes including OsSPL 14 were putative targets of OsmiR 156, suggesting a possibility that the OsSPL 14 should be directly targeted by the rice MEL 1 AGO with miR 156 microRNA as a guide molecule. Moreover, the volume of miR 156 RNA detected in the co-IP fraction with the anti-MEL 1 antibody 3. 2 -fold more than in that with the pre-immune serum. The detection level of miRl 56 depended on that of the MEL 1 protein, as the miR 156 co-IP with the MEL 1 immune complex protein, but few or not with precipitates recovered using mell- 1 mutant or preimmune serum. These data strongly suggest that the MEL 1 forms a complex with the miR 156 microRNA in vivo. These results strongly suggested that the miR 156 microRNA was one of good candidates of guide RNA molecules of the MEL 1 AGO. 　Analysis performed in each section and results obtained from the analysis are summarized as follows. 　In the Section 1, the whole transcriptome profiles of plant reproductive process, including early stages that are difficult to be dissected in Arabidopsis, was obtained by using the Affymetrix rice genome array analysis and provided as a dataset of rice reproductive expression atlas. In addition, using the atlas data, the gene expression patterns of several genes that the are highly expressed in early development stage were investigated. A large part of genes that are expressed in early reproductive development remains uncharacterized because most of pre-meiotic stage specific genes were not categorized to any functions by GO analysis. However, the expression patterns of other meiosis-related genes were well corresponded previous reports. The specific genes that were found in this study may have the crucial function at early germ cells development stages. 　In the section 2, to confirm the spatial and temporal expression of the MEL 1 gene, mRNA in situ hybridization was performed on the anther sections with the MSP 1 gene as cellular marker of young anther tissues. Expression of the MEL 1 was earlier than that of the MSP 1, which clearly indicates that the MEL 1 mRNA expression start at the archesporial initials. The MEL 1 expression is not required for the germ-cell initiation, but for the maintenance of germ cells. In the Section 2, in situ hybridization of the OsNOZZLE(OsNZZ), a putative rice ortholog of Arabidopsis SPOLOCYTELESS|NOZZLE was also performed. Different from the MEL 1 and the, MSP 1,the OsNZZ mRNA was expressed both in developing anther wall layers and sporogenous cells similar that of Arabidopsis SPL/NZZ, but it was not detected in <b>archesporial</b> <b>cells.</b> Although their function is not the same as Arabidopsis SPL/NZZ, OsNZZ may have function in early germ cell development. 　In the Section 3, the microarray at 1 -cm young panicle, several genes responsive for environmental stresses and/or hormone-responsive genes up-regulated. It suggests that absence of the MEL 1 may cause stressful condition, thus many stress-response genes and ethylene signaling-related gene are induced. TheMEL 1 may inhibits stress responses in germ cells to accomplish precise germ cell division and meiosis. In addition, some transposable element-like transcripts were also up-regulated in mel- 1 mutant. It was demonstrated that Drosophila piwi mutations impact retrotransposon mobility. MEL 1 may also suppress the activity of transposable elements during rice germ-cell development. On the other hand, many genes related to cell structure and cycle were down-regulated in the mell- 1 mutant. These results may indicated that in mell- 1 mutant, the failure of pre-meiotic mitosis of sporogenous cells in the mell- 1 mutant anther (Nonomura et al. 2007) was caused by down-regulation of these genes. At pre-meiotic S/G 2 stage of young anthers, few genes were affected by the mell- 1 mutation. Most of up- and down-regulation of genes in the later stages of pre-meiotic germ-cell development might be secondary effects of mell- 1 mutation. 　Finally, the Section 4 suggested a possibility that the rice MEL 1 AGO directly regulated the OsSPL 14 gene with the plant specific microRNA, miR 156 as described above. 　Results obtained in this thesis will provide new and useful information to understand the gene functions in initiation of germ cells development and maintenance of germ cell identity in rice...|$|R

Ubiquinol–cytochrome c reductase iron-sulfur protein, which is necessary for mitochondrial respiration, is a subunit of mitochondrial electron transport chain multimeric enzyme complexes. To better understand the biological function of the ubiquinol–cytochrome c reductase iron–sulfur protein, the full-length cDNAof BcRISP 1 was cloned; it was found to contain 810 base pairs and encode 269 amino acids. Unusually, high expression of the BcRISP 1 gene in the <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell</b> stages was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of cytoplasmic male sterile lines and maintainer lines. The seed set was affected by the overexpression of BcRISP 1, and shorter siliques with lower seed sets were observed in 35 S::BcRISP 1 Arabidopsis plants. These characteristics may have resulted from the reduced formation of pollen and impaired pollen tube growth. qRT-PCR results revealed that in 35 S::BcRISP 1 plants, the expression levels of themitochondrial respiratory chain-related genes, COX 10 and RIP 1, were enhanced, whereas the expression levels of QCR 7 and SDH 2 - 1 were reduced. This result implies that overexpression of BcRISP 1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants may disrupt the mitochondrial electron transport chain by affecting the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain-related genes and therefore, reducing the seed set...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of megasporocytes and the functional megaspore formation in Deschampsia antarctica were analyzed {{with the use}} of microscopic methods. A single <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell</b> was formed directly under the epidermis in the micropylar region of the ovule without producing a parietal cell. In successive stages of development, the meiocyte was transformed into a megaspore tetrad after meiosis. Most megaspores were arranged in a linear fashion, but some tetrads were T-shaped. Only one of the 60 analyzed ovules contained a cell in the direct proximity of the megasporocyte, which could be an aposporous initial. Most of the evaluated D. antarctica ovules featured monosporic embryo sacs of the Polygonum type. Approximately 30 % of ovules contained numerous megaspores that were enlarged. The megaspores were located at chalazal and micropylar poles, and some ovules featured two megaspores – terminal and medial – in the chalazal region, or even three megaspores at the chalazal pole. In those cases, the micropylar megaspore was significantly smaller than the remaining megaspores, and it did not have the characteristic features of functional megaspores. Meiocytes and megaspores of D. antarctica contained polysaccharides that were detectable by PAS-reaction and aniline blue staining. Starch granules and cell walls of megasporocytes, megaspores and nucellar cells were PAS-positive. Fluorescent callose deposits were identified in the micropylar end of the megasporocytes. During meiosis and after its completion, thick callose deposits were also visible in the periclinal walls and in a small amount in the anticlinal walls of megaspores forming linear and T-shaped tetrads. Callose deposits fluorescence was not observed in the walls of the nucellar cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{differentiation}} {{and development}} of ovules in orchid flowers are pollination dependent. To define the developmental signals and timing of critical events associated with ovule differentiation, we have examined factors that regulate the initial events in megasporogenesis and female gametophyte development and characterized its progression toward maturity and fertilization. Two days after pollination, ovary wall epidermal cells begin to elongate and form hair cells; this is the earliest visible morphological change, and it occurs at least 3 days prior to pollen germination, indicating that signals associated with pollination itself trigger these early events. The effects of inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis on early morphological changes indicated that ethylene, {{in the presence of}} auxin, is required to initiate ovary development and, indirectly, subsequent ovule differentiation. Surprisingly, pollen germination and growth were also strongly inhibited by inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis, indicating that male gametophyte development is also regulated by ethylene. Detailed characterization of the development of both the female and male gametophyte in pollinated orchid flowers indicated that pollen tubes entered the ovary and grew along the ovary wall for 10 to 35 days, at which time growth was arrested. Approximately 40 days after pollination, coincident with ovule differentiation as indicated by the presence of a single <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell,</b> the direction of pollen tube growth became redirected toward the ovule, suggesting a chemical signaling between the developing ovule and male gametophyte. Taken together, these results indicate that both auxin and ethylene contribute to the regulation of both ovary and ovule development and to the coordination of development of male and female gametophytes...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{research}} was strawberry (Fragaria ×ananassa(Weston) Duchesne) commonly cultivated {{in the area of}} Lublin Voivodeship (Poland). Three different cultivars of this species viz ‘Senga Sengana’, ‘Selva’ and ‘Mount Everest’were investigated with the aim to characterise ovule development in strawberry. Special attention was paid to the formation of the archesporium. With this aim, fresh flower buds were collected at different developmental stages and fixed them in Navashin fixative (formalin, acetic acid, chromic acid – 3 : 3 : 0. 5). After preparing paraffin sections (6 - 8 µm thick) (following the standard paraffin method procedure) the material was stained with aqueous solutions of 1 % Safranin-O and ethanol solution of 0, 5 % Light Green. The stages of ovule development were observed under a Nikon Optiphot II optical microscope. The data obtained shows that in the three investigated strawberry cultivars the nucelli formation starts in the differentiating ovules located at the surface of the overgrown receptacle. Longitudinal sections of crassinucellar strawberry ovules on the early stages of development revealed that the most characteristic feature is the formation of a multicellular archesporium. It begins very often from at least two cells which are much larger than the other nucellus cells. These cells are derived in the result of longitudinal division of the original <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell.</b> After series of divisions along the long axis in each archesporial cells, the number of archesporial cells increases and multicellular archesporium arises. Archesporial cells are often surrounded by elongated, lens-shaped nucellus cells. At that time, the nucellus in strawberry ovules is composed of epidermal and subepidermal layers and inner integument is developed {{at the base of the}} differentiating nucellus. The investigated cultivars differ markedly in the number of the cells building the archesporium, the number of the archesporium cells which degenerate, and the further modes of female gametophyte development...|$|E
40|$|In nun orchid (Phaius tankervilliae (Alton) B 1.) {{embryo sac}} {{development}} follows the monosporic pattern. Changes {{in the pattern}} of organization of the microtubular cytoskeleton during megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis in this orchid were studied using the immunofluorescence technique and eonfocal microscopy. At the initial stage of development the microtubules in the arehesporium were randomly oriented into a network. Later the <b>archesporial</b> <b>cell</b> elongated to form the megasporocyte. The cytoskeleton in the elongated megasporoeyte was radially organized in which microtubules extending from the nuclear envelope to the peripheral region of the cell. The megasporoeyte then underwent meiosis 1 to form a dyad. The dyad cell at the chalazal end was larger than the cell at the micropylar end. Microtubules in the dyad cell were radially oriented. The dyad underwent meiosis to give rise to a linear array of four megaspores (i. e. tetrad formation). The chalazal-far most megaspore survived and became the functional megaspore, which contained a set of randomly oriented microtubules. The microtubules in the other 3 megaspore disappeared as the cells degenerated. The functional megaspore then underwent mitotic division giveing rise to a 2 nucleate embryo sac. The nuclei of the 2 -nucleate embryo sac were separated by a set of longitudinally oriented microtubules which ran parallel to the long axis of the embryo sac. Each nucleus in the embryo sac was surrounded by a set of perinuelear microtubules. The gnucleate embryo sac again underwent mitotic division to form a 4 -nucleate embryo sac. The division of the two nuclei was synchronous. But the orientation of the division plan of the two spindles was different (i. e. the spindle microtubules at the chalazal end ran parallel with the long axis of the embryo sac and those at the mieropylar end ran at right angle to the axis of the embryo sac). The 4 nuclei of the 4 -nucleate embryo sac were all tightly surrounded by randomly oriented microtubules. Later the paired nuclei at the micropylr end and at the chalazal end as well underwent mitotic division in seguence. At this time when the embryo sac had reached the 8 -nucleate embryo sac stage. The pattern of organization of the microtubules was very complex. Initially the nuclei were surrounded by a set of randomly oriented microtubules, but after the two polar nuclei had moved to the central region of the embryo sac, three different organizational zones of microtubules appeared, viz: a randomly oriented set of microtubules surrounding each nucleus in the chalazal zone: a set (in the form of a basket) of cortical microtubules which surrounded the vacuoles and the two polar nuclei in the central zone and a loosely knitted network of microtubules surrounding the nucleus that later became the egg cell nucleus in the micropylar zone. The two nuclei that would become the nuclei of the synergids were surrounded by a set of more densely packed mierotubules. Towards far the most micropylar end some microtubules formed thick bundles. The site of appearance of these thick bundles coincided with the site of development of the filiform apparatus. The pattern of microtubule organization after cellularization (i. e. at the beginning of embryo sac maturation) did not change much. The author's results indicated that various patterns of microtubule organization observed in the developing embryo sac of nun orchid reflected the complexity and dynamism of the embryo sac. 光鏡的觀察確定了鶴頂蘭(Phaius tankervilliae (Aiton) B 1.) 胚囊發育屬單袍子寥型。應用免疫熒 光標記技術及共焦鏡觀察了胚囊發育過程中微管分佈的變化。當孢原細胞初形成時，細胞內的微管呈網狀分佈。之後，孢原細胞體積增大發育為大孢子母細胞。大孢子母細胞延長，進入減數分裂I 。微管由分裂前的網狀分佈變為輻射狀排列。二分體的兩個細胞內的微管分佈一樣，呈輻射狀。四分體的近珠孔端的 3 個大孢子解體，細胞內的微管消失。靠合點端的功能大孢子內有許多微管呈網狀分佈。當功能大孢子進入第一次有絲分裂時，細胞內的微管由網狀變為輻射狀，從核膜伸展至週質。再經兩次有絲分裂形成八核胚囊。在核分裂之前微管一般是呈網狀分佈並緊包圍著核。在分裂期間二核和四核胚囊都呈極性現象，微管系統也呈極性分佈。微管在八核胚囊內的分佈變化情形特別複雜。首先，八核分別作不同程度的移動，其中兩個核移向胚囊中央，珠孔端和合點端的 3 個核分別互相靠攏，形成 3 個區，即中央區、​​反 足區和卵器區。胚囊未形成區時. 8 個核都被網狀分佈的微管包圍著。當胚囊明顯分成區時，反足區內的微管仍作網狀分佈。中央區的微管分佈則趨疏鬆，形成籃形結構，包圍著液泡和兩個極核。在卵器區內卵核被 1 層微管網絡包圍著。而 1 對助細胞核除被較密集的微管網絡包圍之外，近珠孔端部位還形成一堆粗而扭曲的微管束。這個微管束的出現部位與絲狀器的形成部位吻合。胚囊成熟時，胚囊內的微管系統不再有很大的變化。link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
