5|$|The castle {{continued}} to fulfil several other local functions. During {{the outbreak of}} plague in 1666, the castle {{was used as an}} isolation ward for infected patients, and during the Napoleonic Wars the castle was used to hold the equipment and stores of the local Framlingham Volunteer regiment. Following the closure of the poorhouse, the castle was then used as a drill hall and as a county court, as well as containing the local parish jail <b>and</b> <b>stocks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the brief}} April War, the Germans had {{captured}} over 300 ex-VVKJ aircraft. They considered {{them to be}} of little use for the Luftwaffe, so {{it was decided to}} equip the ZNDH with an appropriate number of these aircraft. These aircraft, scattered in every corner of Yugoslavia, were then collected, minor damage repaired <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> of fuel and spare parts stored at airfield workshops. Naturally, the majority of the aircraft were more or less damaged and action was undertaken to repair as many of them as possible. Former VVKJ pilots of Croatian background and other personnel of aeronautical specialty were approached and offered instant rehabilitation (most of them were in German POW camps), jobs and safety for their families.|$|E
5|$|Smith's net worth, {{including}} {{real estate}} <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> and bonds, was $3,250,000, {{and as he}} had no will his estate was divided equally among his mother, brother, nephew (James McGill) and niece (Eleanor Ewing). William Smith and James McGill later moved to Indianapolis in 1913 after purchasing the Indianapolis Baseball Club for $150,000. George Smith, the 1916 Kentucky Derby winner, was named after Pittsburgh Phil because he had once owned the colt's dam, Consuelo II. His racing Maxims, gleaned from his only interview with Edward Cole {{a few years before}} his death, are still considered valid by modern handicappers.|$|E

5|$|When the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed. However, by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect. Faced {{with the prospect of}} no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores that had already been produced, Groves ordered that a number of Little Boys be prepared as an interim measure until a cure could be found. No Little Boy assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little Boy could be found, although there were drawings of the various components, <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|The {{market was}} also the {{location}} for public punishment of wrongdoers, <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> and a pillory were set at a prominent position at {{the eastern end of}} the Guildhall. The stocks were used for the punishment of relatively minor offences such as breaching the regulations on the price of bread, public brawling or incivility to the Mayor; wrongdoers would on occasion also be paraded around the market wearing paper hats bearing details of their offence. The pillory was used for more serious offences such as sedition. On at least two occasions in the late 16th century people convicted of sedition were nailed to the pillory by their ears; on completion of their time on the pillory their ears were cut off. Public whippings of criminals were also conducted in the marketplace. Although not all executions in the period are recorded, it is known that public hangings also took place in the market square and around the market cross.|$|E

Their capacity was not as great as {{it could have been}} because, due to fear of Japanese air attacks, they had to quickly unload in the darkness. Some 800 men were employed by day and 800 by night unloading craft on the beaches. By 1 November, there were 12,000 rounds of 25 pounder ammunition in the Finschhafen area, <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> were increasing at a rate of two LCM loads per day.

25|$|While event {{studies of}} stock splits is {{consistent}} with the EMH (Fama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll, 1969), other empirical analyses have found problems with the efficient-market hypothesis. Early examples include the observation that small neglected stocks <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> with low book-market ratios (value stocks) tended to achieve abnormally high returns relative to what could be explained by the CAPM. Further tests of portfolio efficiency by Gibbons, Ross and Shanken (1989) (GJR) led to rejections of the CAPM, although tests of efficiency inevitably run into the joint hypothesis problem (see, Roll's Critique).|$|E

40|$|The primary {{contribution}} {{of this study}} is to assess whether public real estate markets <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> markets are linked at the local, regional, and global levels, and to assess the evolution of their dynamic relationship and gradual integration during the last two decades. For individual pairs of real estate <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> markets, our analysis shows that the current levels of local, regional, and global correlation between real estate <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> markets are time-varying and are, at most, moderate at the respective integration levels. The real estate <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> markets are both contemporaneously and causally linked in their returns and volatilities; however the causality relationship appears weaker. In the long run, the real estate markets have slowly become more integrated with the global <b>and</b> regional <b>stock</b> markets; while less integrated with the local stock markets. In addition, the extracted common factors allow for a direct assessment of the dynamic relationships between the real estate <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> markets as a group, and thereby complement the individual results. Finally, there appears to be a declining real estate <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> return dispersion <b>and</b> differential at the local, regional, and global levels for all nine economies, indicating a tendency of return convergence between real estate <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> market in an international environment.
