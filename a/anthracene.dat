5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} reported {{detecting the}} spectral signatures of <b>anthracene</b> and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules {{had ever been}} found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond {{to each other in}} various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{has led to}} {{a better}} understanding of chemical bonds and non-covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, such as the tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV), and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic C–C bonds and aromatic C–C bonds; this finding led to the idea of resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and <b>anthracene</b> in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement.|$|E

25|$|For example, in {{phenanthrene}} one Clar {{structure has}} two sextets at the extremities, {{while the other}} resonance structure has just one central sextet; therefore in this molecule the outer rings have greater aromatic character whereas the central ring is less aromatic and therefore more reactive. In contrast, in <b>anthracene</b> the resonance structures have one sextet, which can be {{at any of the}} three rings, and the aromaticity spreads out more evenly across the whole molecule. This difference in number of sextets is reflected in the UV absorbance spectra of these two isomers; phenanthrene has a highest wavelength absorbance around 290nm, while <b>anthracene</b> has highest wavelength bands around 380nm. Three Clar structures with two sextets each are present in chrysene. Superposition of these structures reveals that the aromaticity in the outer rings is greater (each has a sextet in two of the three Clar structures) compared to the inner rings (each has a sextet in only one of the three).|$|E

25|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs, also poly{{aromatic hydrocarbons}} or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) are hydrocarbons—organic compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen—that {{are composed of}} multiple aromatic rings (organic rings in which the electrons are delocalized).

The simplest such chemicals are naphthalene, having two aromatic rings, and the three-ring compounds <b>anthracene</b> and phenanthrene.|$|E
25|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons are molecules containing {{two or more}} simple aromatic rings fused together by sharing two neighboring carbon atoms (see also simple aromatic rings). Examples are naphthalene, <b>anthracene,</b> and phenanthrene. In fused aromatics, not all carbon–carbon bonds are necessarily equivalent, as the electrons are not delocalized over the entire molecule. The aromaticity of these molecules can be explained using their orbital picture.
