5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is an {{international}} cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council (ICC). An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. , 37 players have represented the Hong Kong national team in ODIs, since its debut in 2004. Many of these players are of South Asian origin, a demographic which comprises only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the overall population of Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the {{contaminated}} spray was thrown {{back into the}} air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the zircon is {{converted}} to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{literature}} has been preserved {{on a wide}} variety of media. This includes papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of the floodplain of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E
5|$|In May 1965 the Rhodesian Front {{government}} went to {{the country}} in a general election with Van der Byl one of the leading campaigners. Discussion of unilaterally declaring independence had already begun. Van der Byl argued that only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of Rhodesian business opposed it; however, his campaign speeches typically included an argument against business involvement in politics. He cited Johannesburg mining interests' support for the Progressive Party in South Africa, big business support for the Nazi Party in Germany, and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia being financed by United States big business.|$|E
50|$|Lazarus taxa are {{observational}} {{artifacts that}} appear to occur either because of (local) extinction, later resupplied, or as a sampling artifact.

5|$|In a {{land where}} {{approximately}} 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books {{said to have been}} given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E

5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury {{to a greater extent}} than NAP.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} labor market effects of {{bilateral}} exchange rate realignment. We place emphasis on the composition of trade, the role of intermediates, and the underlying conditions of {{the labor market}}. Employment effects hinge on the fraction exported to and imported from the trading partner. A larger fraction exported to and <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fraction</b> imported from the trading partner make {{it more likely that}} appreciation has beneficial effects. Furthermore, more sticky price expectations in wage formation, <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fraction</b> of intermediates in the production process, and a lower rate of importer pass through make it more likely that appreciation of the exchange rate of the trade partner has positive employment effects. At a more technical level, the scope for substitution away from higher priced inputs, either toward other sources of supply, or toward value added, is also important to the direction and magnitude of changes in employment. bilateral exchange rates, devaluation, exchange rates and trade, trade and employment...|$|R
40|$|Studies of the {{centrifugation}} {{of adult}} rats showed an unexpected {{decrease in the}} mass of fat-free muscle and bone, {{in spite of the}} added load induced by centrifugation. It is suggested that the lower but constant fat-free body mass was probably regulated during centrifugation. Rats placed in weightless conditions for 18. 5 days gave indirect but strong evidence that the muscle had increased in mass. Other changes in the rats placed in weightless conditions included <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fraction</b> of skeletal mineral, <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fraction</b> of water in the total fat-free body, and a net shift of fluid from skin to viscera. Adult rats centrifuged throughout the post-weaning growth period exhibited smaller masses of bone and central nervous system (probably attributable to slower growth of the total body), and a larger mass of skin than controls at 1 G. Efforts at simulating the effects of weightlessness or centrifugation on the body composition of rats by regimens at terrestrial gravity were inconclusive...|$|R
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of a second. The second {{problem was that the}} planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
5|$|When stars form in {{the present}} Milky Way galaxy they are {{composed}} of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of heavier elements.

5|$|A 2006 {{study of}} inland {{bodies of water}} around Canberra where wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles share territories showed little overlap {{in the range of}} prey taken. Wedge-tailed eagles took rabbits, various macropods, {{terrestrial}} birds such as cockatoos and parrots, and various passerines including magpies and starlings. White-bellied sea eagles caught fish, water-dwelling reptiles such as the eastern long-necked turtle and Australian water dragon, and waterbirds such as ducks, grebes and coots. Both species preyed on the maned duck. Rabbits constituted only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the white-bellied sea eagle's diet. Despite nesting near each other, the two species seldom interacted, as the wedge-tailed eagles hunted away from water and the white-bellied sea eagles foraged along the lake shores. However, conflict with wedge-tailed eagles over nesting sites in remnant trees has been recorded in Tasmania.|$|E
