2500|$|The {{first line}} of defence against {{invasion}} by the PRC is the ROC's own armed forces. Current ROC military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until the US military responds. There is, however, no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations Act or any other treaty that the United States will defend Taiwan, even {{in the event of}} invasion. The joint declaration on security between the US and Japan signed in 1996 may imply that Japan would be involved in any response. However, Japan has refused to stipulate whether the [...] "area surrounding Japan" [...] mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan, and the precise purpose of the pact is unclear. The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (<b>ANZUS</b> <b>Treaty)</b> may mean that other US allies, such as Australia, could theoretically be involved. In practice, the risk of losing economic ties with China may prevent Australia from taking action. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada, Chile, and Peru conduct maritime exercises in the Pacific Ocean every two years called RIMPAC.

2500|$|The postwar Commonwealth {{was given}} a fresh mission by Queen Elizabeth in her Christmas Day 1953 broadcast, where she envisioned the Commonwealth as [...] "an entirely new {{conception}} – built on the highest qualities of the Spirit of Man: friendship, loyalty, {{and the desire for}} freedom and peace." [...] Hoped for success was reinforced by such achievements as climbing Mount Everest in 1953, breaking the four minute mile in 1954, and in 1966 a solo circumnavigation of the globe. However, the humiliation of the Suez Crisis of 1956 badly hurt morale of Britain and the Commonwealth as a whole. [...] More broadly, there was the loss of a central role of the British Empire: the defence of the Empire. That role was no longer militarily or financially feasible, as Britain's withdrawal from Greece in 1947 had painfully demonstrated. Britain itself was now just one part of the NATO military alliance in which the Commonwealth had no role apart from Canada. The <b>ANZUS</b> <b>treaty</b> of 1955 linked Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in a defensive alliance, with Britain and the Commonwealth left out. The second major function of the Empire made London the financial centre of the system. After the Second World War, the British treasury was so weak that it could not operate independently of the United States. The loss of defence and financial roles, furthermore, undermined Joseph Chamberlain's early 20th century vision of a world empire that could combine Imperial preference, mutual defence, and social growth arm. Furthermore, Britain's cosmopolitan role in world affairs became increasingly limited, especially with the losses of India and Singapore. [...] While British elites at first hoped the Commonwealth would preserve and project British influence, they gradually lost their enthusiasm, argues Krishnan Srinivasan. Early enthusiasm waned as British policies came under fire in Commonwealth meetings. Public opinion became troubled as immigration from non-white member states became large-scale.|$|E

Alternate suggestions, such as reducing the RNZN to a coast guard-type force responsible for coastal and fisheries protection, replacing the frigates with smaller offshore patrol vessels, or reorienting the navy to primarily operate submarines, were made in several venues, but were seen as unacceptable loss in capability. Around the same time, the 1984-elected Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand implemented a nuclear-free zone, which incensed the United States of America and led to a deterioration of relations between the two nations, including the American withdrawal of support for New Zealand under the <b>ANZUS</b> security <b>treaty.</b> In response, the New Zealand government sought to improve ties with Australia; one such avenue was to promote military interoperability between the countries by standardising equipment and procedures where possible.

40|$|Few {{countries}} {{had seen the}} necessity for anti-terrorism legislation prior to 11 September 2001 (9 / 11) but that worldwide shock resulted in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 calling for measures to combat international terrorism on 28 September 2001. Australia and Canada, middle powers at the United Nations, and close allies with the United States, {{were among the first}} to react in support of counter-terrorism action, Australia invoking the <b>ANZUS</b> Security <b>Treaty</b> between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America, and Canada supporting the response to 9 / 11 through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Both countries were quick to begin drafting anti-terrorism legislation that would fulfil the United Nations requirements under Resolution 1373 targeting the financing of terrorism and other actions. Canada introduced its anti-terrorism legislation on 15 October 2001 and Australia, having had an election in November 2001, began debating its anti-terrorism legislation on 13 February 2002. This dissertation investigates the legislative discourse on anti-terrorism laws as the elected Members of Parliament in Australia and Canada debated the proposed new measures between 17 September 2001 and 31 March 2003, the period covering the passage of most of the early anti-terrorism legislation. The research aims to determine how the new laws, necessary at the time because of an increased awareness of the international character of terrorism, would be justified considering the increased law enforcement powers proposed in parts of the new legislation. There was a perceived lack of capacity to deal with terrorism in existing criminal laws. Terrorist acts were identifiable as crimes but were regarded differently and prevention was one aspect of this difference. Terrorism seemed to call for differentiation in the law but a major difficulty was in clarifying inherent characteristics of terrorism. The verbatim records of parliamentary debates in both countries, documented in Hansard, provided an authoritative source of the views expressed by politicians, on the government side introducing and supporting the reasoning for the new legislation, and on the opposition side by the several political factions represented, each with a party policy and purpose to uphold. Forty-five themes were identified as topics through which anti-terrorism legislation was debated. Every time a Member of Parliament spoke on a topic related to a theme, an instance was recorded, creating a database of over 5, 000 instances. The four key topics forming the basis for the new legislation were the Terrorism Event, National Security, Criminal Justice and Anti-Terrorism Legislation. Statistical comparison of the discourse quantities produced in relation to each theme did not support the hypothesis that the introduction of Anti-Terrorism legislation was discussed predominantly as a national security issue in Australia and a criminal justice issue in Canada...|$|R
