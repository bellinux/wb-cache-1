25|$|In {{broadest}} terms, flies are {{categorized as}} either imitative or attractive. Imitative flies resemble natural food items. Attractive flies trigger instinctive strikes by employing {{a range of}} characteristics that do not necessarily mimic prey items. Flies can be fished floating on the surface (dry flies), partially submerged (emergers), or below the surface (nymphs, streamers, and wet flies). A dry fly is typically thought to represent an insect landing on, falling on (terrestrials), or emerging from, the water's surface as might a grasshopper, dragonfly, mayfly, ant, beetle, stonefly or caddisfly. Other surface flies include poppers and hair bugs that might resemble mice, frogs, etc. Sub-surface flies are designed to resemble {{a wide variety of}} prey including <b>aquatic</b> <b>insect</b> larvae, nymphs and pupae, baitfish, crayfish, leeches, worms, etc. Wet flies, known as streamers, are generally thought to imitate minnows, leeches or scuds.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> are {{considered}} a key component for stream food webs because of their contribution to the flow of energy from basal resources to the top predators. For this reason, the study of trophic guilds on <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> is necessary to understand the transformation of energy and matter in stream ecosystems. The study of trophic guilds on <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> has been widely documented in temperate streams. In contrast, {{little is known about}} feeding habits and trophic guilds in Neotropical streams. However, several lines of evidence indicate that <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> in the Neotropical region are generally omnivores and that the Fine Particulate Organic Matter (FPOM) is the main food item. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the diets and the trophic guilds of <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> in an unexplored region of northern Colombia (Molino River, La Guajira). <b>Aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> were sampled using a Surber net, covering the different kind of substrates over a 100 m reach. Samples were sorted and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. We analyzed 250 guts of <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> belonging to six orders, nine families, and 10 genera (Leptonema, Chimarra, Anacroneuria, Nectopsyche, Tabanus, Simulium, Pseudodisersus, Corydalus, Camelobaetidius, and Baetodes). We found that FPOM, algae, and animal tissue were the most important food items in the gut content of the <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> at the Molino River. Our results suggest that <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> in the Molino River are generally detritivores, highlighting the importance of the dead organic matter in Neotropical streams. We reported -for the first time- the trophic guilds of the genera Nectopsyche and Pseudodisersus, which were categorized as herbivorous. Our results suggest that <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> in the Molino River exploit a variety of food resources and emphasize the importance of the study of feeding habits on <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> in unexplored Neotropical streams...|$|R
50|$|Aquatic-terrestrial {{subsidies}} are {{a type of}} ecological resource subsidy in which materials, energy, and nutrients are transferred from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems. Aquatic-terrestrial {{subsidies are}} typically caused by organism movement across the aquatic-terrestrial boundary. For example, emerging <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> develop in streams and lakes before emerging as winged terrestrial adults. After emerging, many adult <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> are eaten by terrestrial animals like spiders, birds, bats, and lizards. Because the adult <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> are produced in a different ecosystem than their predators (aquatic versus terrestrial), movement of <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> to terrestrial food webs is termed a subsidy.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> are {{the major}} groups of {{arthropods}} that spend some parts of their life cycle in the water. These insects {{play an important role}} for transmission of some human and animal diseases. There is few information about the <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> fauna of Iran. Methods: To study the <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> fauna, adult, nymphal and larval collections were carried out from different habitats using the standard technique in Zayandeh Roud River, Isfahan Province,central Iran, during summer 2011. Results: In total, 741 speimens of <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> were collected and morphologically identified. They include 7 families and 12 genera representing 2 Orders. The order of Diptera (92. 31 %) and Coleoptera (7. 69 %). The families Culicidae, Syrphidae and Chironomidae from Diptera order, Gyrinidae, Dytiscidae, Haliplidae, Hydrophilidae from Coleoptera order were identified. Conclusion: Some <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> play an important role for transmission of human and animal diseases. These insects also are important for biological control. Therefore ecological study on <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> can provide information about ecology of insects in an area for any decision making...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{toxicological}} effects of pyrethroids on non-target <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> are mediated by several modes of entry of pyrethroids into aquatic ecosystems, {{as well as}} the toxicological characteristics of particular pyrethroids under field conditions. Toxicokinetics, movement across the integument of <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects,</b> and the toxicodynamics of pyrethroids are discussed, and their physiological, symptomatic and ecological effects evaluated. The relationship between pyrethroid toxicity and insecticide uptake is not fully defined. Based on laboratory and field data, {{it is likely that the}} susceptibility of <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> (vector and non-vector) is related to biochemical and physiological constraints associated with life in aquatic ecosystems. Understanding factors that influence <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> susceptibility to pyrethroids is critical for the effective and safe use of these compounds in areas adjacent to aquatic environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Most adult <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> {{that emerge}} from streams live briefly in the nearby {{riparian}} zone. Adult activities, such as mating, dispersal, and feeding, influence their distribution in the terrestrial habitat. A study at Big Sulphur Creek, California, has shown that both numbers and biomass of adult <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> are greatest in the near-stream vegetation; however, adults can be relatively common 150 meters or more from the stream. Because adult <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> are abundant, they represent a primary food resource for many riparian insectivores. The role of adult <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> in the riparian zone must be better understood for riparian management plans to be complete. The adult stages of most stream insects inhabit the riparian zone (e. g., Anderson and Wallace 1984; Erma...|$|R

30|$|<b>Aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> {{have been}} shown to {{influence}} the community structure of benthic algae in temperate streams by food selection (Hill and Knight [1987]; Feminella and Resh [1991]; Feminella and Hawkins [1995]; Peterson et al.

40|$|Stomach {{contents}} of 3, 672 Dolly Varden char collected from September 1967 to November 1968 were examined {{to determine the}} food habits of this species. Of these, 3, 100 (86 %) had food in their stomachs. Aquatic invertebrates (Insecta and Crustacea) comprised over 90 % of the diet. Food habits varied with habitat. <b>Aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> were most important in the diet of stream fish while <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> and crustaceans were most important in the diet of lake fish. Food habits of lake fish were re- 1 ated to lake bottom type {{and access to the}} sea. Fish in landlocked lakes fed primarily on <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects,</b> fish, and fish eggs. In lakes with access to the sea, crustaceans, followed by <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects,</b> were the major food items in those with firm bottoms adjacent to shore while <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects,</b> followed by crustaceans, were the major food items in those with muck bottoms adjacent to shore. As fish size increased, feeding activity decreased and <b>aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> became less important in the diet while crustaceans and fish became more important. During summer, feeding activity was highest for lake fish while it was highest during autumn and summer for stream fish. <b>Aquatic</b> <b>insects</b> were the dominant food item in summer while crustaceans and fish were dominant in spring and autumn.
