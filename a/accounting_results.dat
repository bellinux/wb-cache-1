50|$|Accounting technique, i.e. how {{measurement}} results are produced, can differ. In calculation, three techniques apply: ratio accounting, variance accounting and accounting form.

50|$|Another {{productivity}} model {{also gives}} {{details of the}} income distribution.

50|$|We can use {{the real}} process data of the {{production}} model {{in order to show}} the logic of the growth accounting model and identify possible differences in relation to the productivity model. When the production data is the same in the model comparison the differences in the <b>accounting</b> <b>results</b> are only due to accounting models. We get the following growth accounting from the production data.|$|E
50|$|The growth {{accounting}} procedure proceeds as follows. First is calculated the growth {{rates for the}} output and the inputs by dividing the Period 2 numbers with the Period 1 numbers. Then the weights of inputs are computed as input shares of the total input (Period 1). Weighted growth rates (WG) are obtained by weighting growth rates with the weights. The <b>accounting</b> <b>result</b> is obtained by subtracting the weighted growth rates of the inputs from {{the growth rate of}} the output. In this case the <b>accounting</b> <b>result</b> is 0.015 which implies a productivity growth by 1.5%.|$|R

50|$|The <b>accounting</b> <b>results</b> {{are easily}} {{interpreted}} and understood. We {{see that the}} real income has increased by 58.12 units from which 41.12 units come from the increase of productivity growth and the rest 17.00 units come from the production volume growth. The total increase of real income (58.12) is distributed to the stakeholders of production, in this case 39.00 units to the customers and to the suppliers of inputs and the rest 19.12 units to the owners.|$|E
50|$|The {{interpretation}} of the economics underlying a transaction and even {{the wording of the}} accounting standards can vary between firms.

This use of judgment by management thus increases the chances that the earnings presented in a firm's financial statements may have been manipulated.|$|E

50|$|A {{model used}} {{here is a}} typical {{production}} analysis model by help {{of which it is}} possible to calculate the outcome of the real process, income distribution process and production process. The starting point is a profitability calculation using surplus value as a criterion of profitability. The surplus value calculation is the only valid measure for understanding the connection between profitability and productivity or understanding the connection between real process and production process. A valid analysis of production necessitates considering all production inputs, and the surplus value calculation is the only calculation to conform to the requirement. If we omit an input in productivity or income accounting, this means that the omitted input can be used unlimitedly in production without any cost impact on <b>accounting</b> <b>results.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{accounting}} {{result of the}} growth accounting model is expressed as an index number, in this example 1.015, which depicts the average productivity change. As demonstrated above we cannot draw correct conclusions based on average productivity numbers. This {{is due to the}} fact that productivity is accounted as an independent variable separated from the entity it belongs to, i.e. real income formation. Hence, if we compare in a practical situation two growth <b>accounting</b> <b>results</b> of the same production process we do not know which one is better in terms of production performance. We have to know separately income effects of productivity change and production volume change or their combined income effect in order to understand which one result is better and how much better.|$|E

Taxation acts in the sense of stimulating the investment activity on the level of the company, which highlights the dual character of taxation: on the one hand, it materializes in obligatory taxes paid to the State which directly influence the result and the treasury of the company, {{and on the other hand}} the company can use the fiscal advantages to its benefit. The <b>accounting</b> <b>result</b> represents either the accounting profit before the final taxation, if the income is higher than the expenses, or otherwise the accounting loss before the final taxation. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{performance}} measurement system properties on managerial time orientation. Building on evidence in the accounting literature on myopic managerial decision making, we explore the effects of extending traditional accounting-based performance measures with leading performance indicators. Under balanced scorecard logic, such indicators will enhance managerial time orientation as they help perceive managers the longer-term consequences of their investment decisions. We develop hypotheses on the combined and interactive effects of the time period between the leading indicator and lagging (<b>accounting)</b> <b>results,</b> {{and the length of}} the evaluation period for the <b>accounting</b> <b>results.</b> These hypotheses are tested through a survey of business controllers, and a laboratory experiment in which subjects performed an investment task.

The objective {{of this article is}} to contribute to the study of determinants of <b>accounting</b> <b>result</b> management. The <b>accounting</b> <b>result</b> management deviates from the accounting principles (honesty, regularity and faithful image) and finds its motivations in the contractual relations between the managers and stakeholders. This is in the legal, not more frame. The appreciation of accounting information players is different, their interests are different. Therefore, the flexibility of accounting rules allowed to the managers is opportunistic. The accounting representation cannot be completely objective, it is more or less subjective, but the freedom of judgment should be based on a high level of ethical sensibility. The ethical side in accounting has something to say about the result management, it allows the result to offer a faithful image. ...|$|R
