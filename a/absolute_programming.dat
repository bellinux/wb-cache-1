It is well known that industrial robots have relatively good position repeatability characteristics but suffer from a lack of precision in terms of <b>absolute</b> accuracy.

The paper analyzes the cost-effectiveness of existing programs in depth, including public works, food distribution, and a free fertilizer distribution program.

They claimed that music is not explicitly [...] "about" [...] anything {{and that it is}} non-representational.

One example of program music is Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, in which the fourth movement is the composer's depiction of a story about an artist who poisons himself with opium and then is executed. The majority of opposition to absolute instrumental-based music came from composer Richard Wagner and the philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Wagner's works were chiefly programmatic and often used vocalization, and he said that [...] "Where music can go no further, there comes the word… the word stands higher than the tone."

Establishing the {{instrumental}} sensitivity {{as a function}} of wavelength within the domain covered by the F 850 LP (z) filter is critical for a number of ACS science <b>programs.</b> <b>Absolute</b> sensitivity calibrations with hot white dwarfs showed that substantial updates up to 20 % in the blue were needed relative to pre-flight estimates, and were suggestive of a significant gradient in the far-red (0. 85 – 1. 1 microns) QE update needed (but did not suffice to constrain this well). We report here observations of several hot white dwarfs; as well as a M 7 V, a L 3. 5 V and a T 6. 5 V star in F 625 W, F 814 W and F 850 LP with ACS/WFC. The concentration of flux for the coolest stars to the longest wavelengths probed with F 850 LP provide a means of defining the quantum efficiency curve underlying this broad filter. We find, unique to the z-band filter, that over the range O, M, L, T stars that the encircled energy for small-to-moderate apertures can vary at the level of 10 s of percent. Attempts to separate out underlying QE variations and wavelength dependent PSF effects are reported on here.

Methods: We sent an 11 -item survey by email to all students who applied to EM residency programs at four different institutions representing diverse geographical regions. Students were asked questions about their perception of Doximity rankings and how it may have impacted their rank list decisions. Results: Response rate was 58 % of 1, 372 opened electronic surveys. This study found that a majority of medical students applying to residency in EM were aware of the Doximity rankings prior to submitting rank lists (67 %). One-quarter of these applicants changed the number of programs and ranks of those programs when completing their rank list based on the Doximity rankings (26 %). Though the <b>absolute</b> number of <b>programs</b> changed on the rank lists was small, the results demonstrate that the EM Doximity rankings impact applicant decision-making in ranking residency programs.

Methods: Data on inactivity were extracted for 142 countries for the year 2010 from the WHO Data Repository. Data for HDI were obtained for the year 2010 from the United Nations Development <b>Program.</b> <b>Absolute</b> and relative gender differences were calculated for countries according to four HDI categories. The potential effects of increasing women’s activity levels on achievement of the WHO physical inactivity target were computed. Results: Overall inactivity prevalence was higher in women (27 %) than in men (20 %). Women were more inactive than men in all except eight countries. Absolute gender differences [median 7. 5 % (range − 10. 1 to 33. 2) ] did not vary by HDI category, but there was a small negative correlation between relative gender difference in inactivity and HDI (rho − 0. 19; p = 0. 02), which was mostly influenced by three outlier countries with low HDI. A decrease in inactivity levels of 4. 8 % points among women across the world would achieve the WHO target of reducing global levels of inactivity by 10 %. Conclusion: Gender differences in the prevalence of physical inactivity were highly variable, both within and across categories of HDI.

Programmed death- 1 expression was elevated on human immunodeficiency virus-specific peripheral blood CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells and correlated with disease severity. During human immunodeficiency infection, lymphoid tissue acts as a major viral reservoir and is an important site for viral replication, but it is also essential for regulatory processes important for immune recovery. We compared programmed death- 1 expression in 2 consecutive inguinal lymph nodes of 14 patients, excised before antiretroviral therapy (antiretroviral therapy as of 1997 - 1999) and 16 to 20 months under antiretroviral therapy. In analogy to lymph nodes of human immunodeficiency virus-negative individuals, in all treated patients, the germinal center area decreased, whereas the number of germinal centers did not significantly change. Programmed death- 1 expression was mostly found in germinal centers. The <b>absolute</b> extent of <b>programmed</b> death 1 expression per section was not significantly altered after antiretroviral therapy resulting in a significant-relative increase of programmed death 1 per shrunken germinal center. In colocalization studies, CD 45 R 0 + cells that include helper/inducer T cells strongly expressed programmed death- 1 before and during therapy, whereas CD 8 + T cells, fewer in numbers, showed a weak expression for programmed death- 1. Thus, although antiretroviral therapy seems {{to reduce the number of}} programmed death- 1 -positive CD 8 + T lymphocytes within germinal centers, it does not down-regulate programmed death- 1 expression on the helper/inducer T-cell subset that may remain exhausted and therefore unable to trigger immune recovery...|$|R

The Jones-Geroch dust case, ostensibly a false positive, is resolved by noting that holes in the dust in some models ensure that no physically relevant nonvanishing timelike vector field exists there, so no absolute object exists. The Torretti constant curvature spaces case, allegedly a false negative, is resolved by testing an irreducible piece of the metric, the conformal metric density of weight - 2 / 3, for absoluteness; this geometric object is absolute. A new counterexample is proposed involving the orthonormal tetrad said to be necessary to couple spinors to a curved metric. The threat of finding an absolute object in GTR + spinors is overcome by the use of an alternative spinor formalism that takes a symmetric square root of the metric (with the help of the matrix diag(- 1, 1, 1, 1)), eliminating 6 of the 16 tetrad components as irrelevant. The importance of eliminating irrelevant structures, as Anderson emphasized, is clear. The importance of the choice of physical fields is also evident. A new counterexample due to Robert Geroch and Domenico Giulini, however, finds an absolute object in vacuum GTR itself, namely the scalar density $g$ given by the metric components' determinant. Thus either the definition of absoluteness or its use to analyze GTR's substantive general covariance is flawed. Anderson's belief that all absolute objects are nonvariational (that is, not varied in a suitable action principle) and vice versa is also falsified by the Geroch-Giulini counterexample. However, it remains plausible that all nonvariational fields are absolute, so adding nonvariationality as a necessary condition for absoluteness, as Hiskes once suggested, would likely leave no useful work to the Anderson-Friedman condition of sameness in all models. Simply having only variational fields in an action principle (suitably free of irrelevant fields) might be a satisfactory analysis of substantive general covariance, if one exists. This proposal also resembles the suggestion that GTR is "already parameterized," if one decides to parameterize theories by defining the nonvariational fields in terms of preferred coordinates called clock fields. More questions need to be addressed. Which fields should be tested for absoluteness: only primitive fields (which ones?), or all or some (which?) of their concomitants also? Geroch observes that some kinds of geometric objects, such as tangent vectors, scalar densities, and tangent vector densities of non-unit weight, satisfy the condition of sameness in all models if they merely fail to vanish. If these "susceptible" geometric objects can hardly help being absolute, to what degree are they, or the theories harboring them, responsible for this absoluteness? The answer to this question helps to determine the significance of the Geroch-Giulini counterexample...|$|R
40|$|Parisian musical life {{underwent}} a tectonic {{shift in the}} late nineteenth century. Throughout the 1800 s, and particularly during the Second Empire (1852 - 70), opera and other forms of theatrical entertainment had dominated the French musical scene. In the final decades of the century, however, a generation of French composers devoted considerable efforts to large-scale symphonic forms. A driving force in the advancement of orchestral music was the "Franck circle" or bande à Franck [...] a group of more-or-less young composers mentored by an unassuming organ professor at the Paris Conservatoire. In their symphonic works, these musicians challenged the longstanding Austro-German dominance of serious instrumental genres and cultivated a distinctly French musical voice. This dissertation explores the burgeoning symphonic culture of Paris circa 1880 - 1900 by examining four representative compositions by prominent members of the Franck circle: Augusta Holmès's Les Argonautes (1880), Ernest Chausson's Viviane (1882 - 83, revised 1887), César Franck's Psyché (1886 - 87), and Vincent d'Indy's Istar (1896). Each of these pieces, the subject of an individual chapter, offers a study in the relationship between compositional practice and cultural identity. The critical success of Les Argonautes catapulted Holmès to national prominence and established her {{reputation as one of the}} most progressive composers in France. Chausson's extensive revisions to Viviane, his first major orchestral work, reveal his evolving attitudes about descriptive music and Wagner [...] the composer who cast the longest shadow in fin-de-siècle France. Although Franck based Psyché on a legend from Greek antiquity, his approach to musical signification allowed his disciples to interpret the piece variously as a Christian allegory or as absolute music. D'Indy's polemical stances on genre, artistic influence, and morality belie the ideological complexities and paradoxes in his Istar. In addition to illuminating these works through reception history, musical analysis, manuscript studies, and the composers' own writings, the dissertation will address three interrelated topics in each chapter. First, I explore how the bande à Franck understood the concept of "serious" music, and how this conception shaped Third Republic attitudes about orchestral genres, <b>absolute</b> music, and <b>program</b> music. Second, I examine how French composers responded to the legacy of Wagner in non-theatrical genres. Finally, I discuss how these four musicians fashioned a cultural, national, and personal identity through [...] and sometimes in tension with [...] their orchestral works...|$|R
