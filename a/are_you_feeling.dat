500|$|Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune {{noted that}} Rihanna assumes {{the role of}} playing the victim in the song, and not the offender, saying [...] "She's wary of men even when she’s flirting with them in Wait Your Turn." [...] Prior to Greenblatt's album review of Rated R, where she briefly commented on [...] "Wait Your Turn", she also {{reviewed}} the song when it leaked onto the Internet in early November, saying [...] "Now that the wait is nearly ova, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> it, Music Mixers? I cannot tell a lie; I’m a little underwhelmed by this new walk-the-plank Pirate incarnation." [...] William Goodman of Spin magazine was more critical and dismissive of the song, saying [...] "Wait Your Turn'...leaked online over the weekend, and like the album's lead track, 'Russian Roulette,' it's a total let down: clunky, Auto-Tuned vocals repeat The wait is ova / The wait is ova ad nauseam, over dark atmospherics and a spare dub beat that fails to connect...it's certainly not worth the wait." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 24, 1961, Blanc was {{involved}} in a near-fatal car accident. He was driving alone when his sports car collided head-on with a car driven by 18-year-old college student Arthur Rolston on Sunset Boulevard. Rolston suffered minor injuries, but Blanc was rushed to the UCLA Medical Center with a triple skull fracture that left him in a coma for two weeks, along with sustaining fractures to both legs and the pelvis. About two weeks after the accident, one of Blanc's neurologists tried a different approach. Blanc was asked, [...] "How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> today, Bugs Bunny?" [...] After a slight pause, Blanc answered, in a weak voice, [...] "Eh... just fine, Doc. How are you?" [...] The doctor then asked Tweety if he was there, too. [...] "I tot I taw a puddy tat," [...] was the reply. Blanc returned home on March 17. Four days later, Blanc filed a US$500,000 lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. His accident, one of 26 in the preceding two years at the intersection known as Dead Man's Curve, resulted in the city funding the restructuring of curves at the location.|$|E
