5000|$|In early 19th century, Europeans from Tasmania started {{settling}} in the area. They were chiefly responsible for introducing {{several species of}} exotic plants and animals into the area as they found the terrain to be drab and filled with strange animals like kangaroo. They introduced new variety of plants such as boxthorn hedges for fences and trees such as oaks, willows and pine, creating an ambiance of their homeland. Kangaroos were hunted, rabbits and furred animals were killed for their valuable skin. This had ill effects on the native vegetation and faunal species. So much so that [...] "high <b>artichoke</b> <b>thistles</b> blanketed the creek flats and slopes, horehound had spread everywhere, boxthorn bushes crowded the slopes and plains, and other weed species filled the gaps. Erosion gullies scarred the steep slopes. Rubbish was piled here and there".|$|R

40|$|High {{performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) with UV detection is nowadays the reference method {{to identify and}} quantify the biomarkers of quality and authenticity of plants and food supplements. Seven medicinal plants were collected from wild flora: Taraxacum officinalis (1), Cynara scolimus (2), Silybum marianum (3), Hypericum perforatum (4),  Chelidonium majus (5), Lycopodium clavatum (6) and   Hippophae rhamnoides (7)   leaves and fruits.   Two products (A and B) were obtained by mixing individual plant powders. Therefore product A was obtained by mixing dandelion, <b>artichoke</b> and milk <b>thistle,</b> 1 : 1 : 1 while product B by mixing St John’s wort, Celandine and Wolf’s claw, 1 : 1 : 1. The methanolic extracts of individual plants as well as three different extracts of products A and B (using acidulated water, neutral water and acidulated methanol) were analyzed using HPLC-UV for their phenolics’ fingerprint and composition. The qualitative (untargeted analysis) and quantitative (targeted analysis) results were further compared using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) {{in order to identify}} their specific biomarkers. Thus, quantitative evaluation of individual phenolics in case of individual plants and products A and B extracts, showed specific and significant differences of composition. Both products A and B contained elagic acid as major compound. For product A, good biomarkers were trans -cinnamic, chlorogenic, caffeic and p- coumaric acids, as well silymarin and silibine originating from milk thistle. For product B, good biomarkers were quercetin and kaempherol, gallic and protocatecuic acids, this product being rich in flavonoids. In conclusion, HPLC-UV coupled with PCA analysis proved to be a rapid and useful way to identify the main biomarkers of plants’ authentication, as well of final products’ quality and safety. </p...|$|R

The park was noted {{as one of the}} few remaining significant areas of bushland in the foothills. By 2006, the flora list contained 411 species, with 107 of these non-native. Five of the native species were then noted as rare or vulnerable, including Prasophyllum pallidum (pale leek-orchid). The park has significant stands of pink gums (Eucalyptus fasciculosa) and long-leafed box (Eucalyptus goniocalyx). button daisy, pussy tail (Ptilotus macrocephalus), needlebush (Hakea sericea), silky guinea flower (Hibbertia sericea) and black rapier sedge (Lepidosperma carphoides) are common. black-boys (Xanthorrhoea), hop bush (Dodonaea viscosa ssp. spatulata) and tea-tree form the understory in parts of the park. The area around the ruins of Newman's Nursery is noted for its spring orchid display. Quarry floors have large plants typical of much of the Mount Lofty Ranges. Golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha) and drooping sheoak (Allocasuarina verticillata), as well as red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), native pine (Callitris preissii) and blue gum (Eucalyptus leucoxylon) are common.Invasive weeds are prevalent in, and damaging to, the park.

40|$|Invasive {{plants are}} one of the most serious {{environmental}} issues facing California. They disrupt ecosystems by altering physical processes, displacing native plants, and degrading wildlife habitat. The California Invasive Plant Inventory is a vital resource for those working to protect the state’s natural areas. The Inventory summarizes the impacts, potential for spread, and distri-bution of more than 200 non-native plants that invade wildlands in California. The Inventory represents the best available knowledge of the state’s invasive plant experts. It is designed to prioritize plants for control at the state and local levels, to provide key information to those working in habitat restoration, to show areas where research is needed. to aid those preparing or commenting on envi-ronmental planning documents, and to educate public policy makers. Detailed assessments for each plant, with docu-mented sources, are available online at www. cal-ipc. org.

40|$|Overview. <b>Artichoke</b> <b>Thistle</b> (Cynara cardunculus; CYCA), a deep-rooted {{perennial}} thistle, is {{an extremely}} problematic invader of disturbed grasslands in southern California. It has invaded large areas (over 4, 000 acres) of the Nature Reserve of Orange County (NROC). The NROC, working with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), established a control program for CYCA involving direct application of herbicide to individual plants. Thousands of acres have been treated annually since 1994. We had three objectives of this project. First, we resurveyed areas initially surveyed in 1998 to assess the changes in areas that {{have been part of}} the control program. We particularly focused on changes in CYCA cover, and if it was associated with other aspects of NROC management (Brassica nigra; BRNI, Nassella pulchra; NAPU, native species richness). Secondly, we assessed how treated areas responded to the cessation of herbicide control for one year. Thirdly, we initiated a restoration project in eight areas with low native diversity. We detail the results of these efforts in this report, and include data collected as part of the accompanying CD...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{vegetation}} {{structure and}} composition, particularly {{due to the}} invasion of exotic species, are predicted to influence biosphere-atmosphere exchanges of mass and energy. Invasion of Cynara cardunculus (cardoon or <b>artichoke</b> <b>thistle),</b> a perennial, non-native thistle in coastal California grasslands presently dominated by non-native annual grasses, may alter rates of ecosystem CO 2 exchange and evapotranspiration (ET). During spring and summer 2006, we compared midday maximum net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) and ET among adjacent grassland plots where Cynara was present and where it was absent. Measurements of NEE supported the prediction that deeply-rooted Cynara increase midday ecosystem C-assimilation. Cynara-mediated shifts in NEE were associated with increases in ecosystem photosynthesis rather than changes in ecosystem respiration. Furthermore, the presence of Cynara was associated with increased ET during the growing season. An increase in aboveground live biomass (a proxy for leaf area) associated with Cynara invasion may underlie shifts in ecosystem CO 2 and water vapor exchange. Following mid-growing season sampling during April, we removed Cynara from half of the Cynara-containing plots with spot applications of herbicide. Three weeks later, midday fluxes in removal plots were indistinguishable from those in plots where Cynara was never present suggesting a lack of biogeochemical legacy effects. Similar to woody-encroachment in some semi-arid ecosystems, Cynara invasion increases midday ecosystem CO 2 assimilation and evapotranspiration rates and {{has the potential to}} increase C-storage in California coastal grasslands...|$|E
40|$|The wild {{artichoke}} (also {{known as}} <b>artichoke</b> <b>thistle</b> and cardoon) Cynara cardunculus L. is a perennial in the thistle tribe (Cynareae) of the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It shares a recent common ancestor with the modem cultivated "globe " artichoke Cynara skolymus L. Both plants {{have their origin in}} edible Cynara cultivars used by early {{farmers in the}} Mediterranean region (1). These cultivars were probably subjected to the unintentional selective pressures of the repetitive disturbance environment that is characteristic of agricultural activities such as cultivation and grazing. This early Mediterranean and Middle Eastern agricultural disturbance regime is postulated to have given rise to many of the worst agricultural weeds and invasive plant species (2), including several thistles (3). In combination with the naturally robust growth properties of thistles world-wide, this evolutionary selection gave the Cynara cultivars the genetic potential to become highly successful weeds. C. skolymus was developed from the early Cynara cultivars in medieval monastery gardens, by artificial selection for superior agrinomic properties (1). Many of the aggressive and invasive traits of C. skolymus may have been lost during this selection process, as the globe artichoke has not been reported as a problem invasive anywhere in the world (1). The wild artichoke came to the U. S. in the mid- 1800 s as the cultivated edible cardoon, Cynara cardunculus. Escape from cultivation and subsequent propagation by seed probably resulted in a reversion to many of this cultivar's aggressive and 'wild ' characteristics. The result of this evolutionary history is a robust, invasive plant that shares many vegetative and reproductive characteristics with the world’s worst weeds (4, see box: 'Weedy Characteristics of Cynara cardunculus') ...|$|E
40|$|Historically, over 4, 000 {{acres of}} the Orange County Central & Coastal Sub region NCCP/HCP Reserve System have been invaded {{by a number of}} exotic plant species {{including}} several annual grasses, <b>artichoke</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cynara cardunculus, CYCA), mustards and other exotic forbs. Invasion has resulted in displacement of many desirable plant species and overall degradation of the reserve’s target plant community, coastal sage scrub. To control the spread of CYCA, the Nature Reserve of Orange County (NROC) established a management program involving spot application of herbicide (Fusillade and Round-up) to individual plants. Since 1994, thousands of acres have been treated annually. Additionally, NROC has chemically and mechanically managed other exotic, invasive species such as Ricinus communis (castor bean) and Nicotiana glauca (tree tobacco). While these weed control efforts reduce target invasive species, whether the native plant community is recovering is not necessarily clear, nor is the long-term sustainability of control efforts.   Following degradation, recovery of a native system rarely follows the reverse path of degradation (Fig. 1). Instead alternative paths {{that may or may not}} have a trajectory towards the original or goal state can occur (Bradshaw; Cramer et al 2008). In highly degraded areas, sites may become stuck in an alternative or novel state. These novel or alternative trajectories and states play a key role in recovery and restoration and may be dependent on management action. A common example of this is the replacement of a targeted exotic species by a new exotic following control of the original target exotic (Denslow & D’Anonio 2005; Flory & Clay 2009). Within the NROC community, there has been concern that such a replacement occurred following the long-term CYCA removal program such that Brassica nigra (black mustard, BRNI) replaced CYCA. Assessing recovery after control measures is a powerful tool to aid in restoration decision-making and ultimately guiding future management actions for the reserve system.   Goals and Objectives:   Our objectives were to address a number of critical issues relevant to restoration planning at NROC, including:    Task 1 : Provide an updated description of the vegetation community at 109 sites within the Reserve System previously sampled in 1998, 2007 and 2008.    Task 2 : Teasing apart trends due to management efforts from other trends due to environment or land use change (e. g., grazing cessation in the early 1990 s).    Task 3 : Determining thresholds in both native and weed species abundance that will allow for further unassisted recovery.    Task 4 : Identifying areas where sites are “stuck” (i. e., not recovering) and need additional intervention (e. g., seeding, mowing, soil amendments).   By capitalizing on past vegetation monitoring and additional analysis of monitoring data, we hoped to reveal the mechanisms underlying the complex dynamics of vegetation recovery over time and inform restoration decision-making within the NCCP/HCP Reserve System.  Project Start Date: April 1, 2013 Project Completion Date: December 31, 2014 Contracted Organization: University of California, Berkele...|$|E
