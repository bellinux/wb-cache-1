5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>and</b> a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division but lately, have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector is declining. Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E
5|$|Stannis's maester, Cressen, is {{preoccupied with}} his lord's {{decisions}} and {{especially with the}} influence that the foreign priestess Melisandre has over him. Having come {{under the influence of}} the Red Priestess and her god, the Lord of Light R'hllor, Stannis has even converted to the new religion and has ordered the burning of the statues of the Westerosi Seven Gods. Willing to sacrifice himself for Stannis's sake, Cressen puts poison in <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>and</b> asks Melisandre to drink from it after he has done so. While he dies almost immediately, the priestess swallows the entire cup unaffected.|$|E
5|$|The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans {{recommends}} consuming five to nine {{servings of}} fruit and vegetables daily. The total amount consumed will vary according to age and gender, and is determined based upon the standard portion sizes typically consumed, as well as general nutritional content. Potatoes {{are not included in}} the count as they are mainly providers of starch. For most vegetables and vegetable juices, one serving is half of <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>and</b> can be eaten raw or cooked. For leafy greens, such as lettuce and spinach, a single serving is typically a full cup. A variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients needed for health.|$|E

25|$|The Bulgarian {{army was}} well armed {{according}} to the Avar model: the soldiers had a sabre or a sword, a long spear and a bow with an arrow-quiver on the back. On the saddle they hung a round shield, a mace and a lasso, which the Bulgarians called arkani. On their decorated belts the soldiers carried the most necessary objects such as flints and steel, a knife, <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>and</b> a needle case. The heavy cavalry was supplied with metal armour and helmets. The horses were also armoured. Armour was of two types— chain-mail and plate armour. The commanders had belts with golden or silver buckles which corresponded to their rank and title.|$|E
25|$|At 20 {{months of}} age, when {{presented}} with three familiar objects (e.g., a ball, a bottle and <b>a</b> <b>cup)</b> <b>and</b> one unfamiliar object (e.g., an egg piercer), children are able to conclude that in the request “Can I have the zib,” zib must refer to the unfamiliar object, i.e., the egg piercer, {{even if they have}} never heard that pseudoword before. Children as young as 15 months can complete this task successfully if the experiment is conducted with fewer objects. This task shows that children aged 15 to 20 months can assign meaning to a new word after only a single exposure. Fast mapping is a necessary ability for children to acquire the number of words they have to learn during {{the first few years of}} life: Children acquire an average of nine words per day between 18 months and 6 years of age.|$|E

25|$|Gyges {{asks the}} Queen {{to join in}} the dancing. She takes <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>and</b> empties it as if to drown her thoughts. She dances in a trance and empties another cup, which is filled by the ghost of Candaules, who {{suddenly}} tears the crown from her head. Terrified, she swoons and Gyges hurries to her side and endeavours to lead her to her throne, but again, the ghost appears. Nisia, panic-stricken, runs among the dancers, who cannot see the reason for her fear. At last, exhausted, she falls in Gyges's arms, but the ghost points to his grave, where he awaits his guilty wife. A deathly pallor steals over her features and she sinks to the ground dead. Gyges, overcome with grief, tries to restore her to life. At this moment, Pythia appears. She tells Gyges not to grieve, but to thank Heaven for having preserved him from death and she indicates a cup of poison that Nisia had prepared for him.|$|E
25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand <b>a</b> <b>cup,</b> <b>and</b> in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E
