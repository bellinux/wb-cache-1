5|$|There is {{debate in}} Bulgarian {{academic}} circles {{as to whether}} the church was built as <b>a</b> <b>monastery</b> church or as a separate cathedral. If the buildings neighbouring the church are interpreted as the residential part of <b>a</b> <b>monastery,</b> it was most probably established after the construction of the Round Church, during the rule of Tsar Peter I (r. 927–969). The absence of entrances on these buildings on the sides facing the church and the presence of a large atrium make it unlikely. Another argument against the Round Church being <b>a</b> <b>monastery</b> church is its location, isolated from other buildings yet accessible to the public outside the inner city. Scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it a city cathedral and compares it in function to the Great Basilica in Pliska. Another researcher, Krastyu Miyatev, sees it as a royal church of Simeon, but art historian Nikola Mavrodinov and archaeologist Totyu Totev insist it belonged to <b>a</b> <b>monastery</b> from the beginning.|$|E

5|$|The current {{building}} of the Patriarchal Cathedral is considered by scholars to have been built in two stages. The first stage of construction {{was carried out in}} the late 11th century or the 12th century. The cathedral was initially built as <b>a</b> <b>monastery</b> church in the middle of <b>a</b> <b>monastery</b> compound, though in the early 12th century it was already the seat of the Bulgarian patriarch. The compound suffered large-scale damage caused by a fire, which necessitated the church's reconstruction in middle of the 14th century, perhaps during the rule of Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria (r. 1331–71). Besides repair and reinforcement efforts, work on the church in the 14th century also included the construction of the exonarthex and the bell tower.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} during his reign, Sigeberht abdicated his power to Ecgric and retired to lead a {{religious}} life within <b>a</b> <b>monastery</b> he had built for his own use. Bede does not name the location of Sigeberht's monastery, but later sources name it as Beodricesworth, afterwards called Bury St Edmunds. If that identification is accepted, the likely site was in the original precinct of the mediaeval abbey at Bury St Edmunds, probably the 'worth' or curtilage of Beodric after whom the place was originally named. The site occupied a strong position on {{the upper reaches of}} the Lark valley, which drains north-west into the Great Fen through important early settlements at Icklingham, Culford, West Stow and others. This was a line of access towards Ely, where a foundation of Saint Augustine may already have existed, and towards Soham, where Saint Felix is thought to have founded <b>a</b> <b>monastery.</b>|$|E
