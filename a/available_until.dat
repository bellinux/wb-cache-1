5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen <b>available</b> <b>until</b> it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup of carbon dioxide and lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.|$|E

5|$|Pure {{beryllium}} metal did {{not become}} readily <b>available</b> <b>until</b> 1957, {{even though it had}} been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified magnesium. The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized {{that this would be}} impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become <b>available</b> <b>until</b> 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E

5|$|Due to its sudden {{development}} and project track into southwest Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued {{a tropical storm}} warning and hours later a hurricane warning from the Dry Tortugas to Marathon in the Florida Keys and along the southwestern coastline northward to Fort Myers. A hurricane watch was also issued from Marathon to Jupiter Inlet. At {{the time of the}} issuance of the hurricane warning, Alberto had been moving steadily northeastward; extrapolating its motion indicated a landfall on Key West within 12hours and a mainland landfall at Key Largo within 24hours. Additionally, most computer models predicted Alberto to continue northeastward across south Florida. Only one model, not <b>available</b> <b>until</b> later, suggested a weakness in steering currents that would prevent a Florida landfall.|$|E
5|$|Expert bakers {{who arrived}} among the {{immigrants}} from Eastern and Central Europe in the 1920s and 30s introduced handmade sourdough breads. From the 1950s, mass-produced bread replaced these loaves and standard, government subsidized loaves known as leḥem aḥid became mostly <b>available</b> <b>until</b> the 1980s, when specialized bakeries again began producing rich sourdough breads in the European tradition, and breads in a Mediterranean style with accents such as olives, cheese, herbs or sun-dried tomatoes. A large variety of breads {{is now available}} from bakeries and cafes.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th century on, the {{crossbow}} (called , tzangra in Greek) {{became increasingly}} important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon <b>available</b> <b>until</b> {{the advent of}} fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery. The Byzantines made infrequent use of the weapon, chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles. Cannons were introduced {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only had a few artillery pieces for the defence of the land walls of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there is no indication that the Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.|$|E

5|$|The Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{estimated}} that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the existing fleet, and later implementing a successor program would cost $14–$21billion. It was reported {{not only that}} a new fleet would not be <b>available</b> <b>until</b> 2024 (at which point the existing helicopters would have remained in service while being over 50 years old), but that terminating the existing program would waste more than $3billion in sunk VH-71 costs. Following the President’s decision to terminate the program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded {{it would be more}} cost effective and less time consuming to continue with a variation of the existing VH-71 program.|$|E
5|$|The {{casualties}} {{suffered by}} the two combatants are difficult to determine, due to several factors. In regard to the Germans, equipment losses were {{complicated by the fact}} that they made determined efforts to recover and repair tanks. For example, tanks disabled one day often appeared a day or two later repaired. German personnel losses are clouded by the lack of access to German unit records, which were seized at the end of the war. Many were transferred to the United States national archives and were not made <b>available</b> <b>until</b> 1978, while others were taken by the Soviet Union, which declined to confirm their existence.|$|E
5|$|The decorations are {{all high}} quality and often highly complex. In one decoration, which {{occupies}} a one-inch square {{piece of a}} page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses, although lenses of the required power are not {{known to have been}} <b>available</b> <b>until</b> hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these designs have also had an enduring popularity. Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos.|$|E

5|$|The final {{storm was}} last noted on October17. These dates {{fall within the}} period with the most {{tropical}} cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Only two tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously. The hurricane brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica, resulting in eight deaths. This storm also left damage to crops and vessels in portions of the Bahamas and Cuba. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not <b>available</b> <b>until</b> the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated.|$|E
5|$|The reason no {{successful}} rescue {{was ever}} effected {{lies in the}} remoteness of the Hebrides from the anglophone world in the early 18th century. No reliable naval charts of the area became <b>available</b> <b>until</b> 1776. Without local assistance and knowledge, finding a captive in this wilderness would have required a significant expeditionary force. Nonetheless, the lack of action taken by Edinburgh society in general and her children in particular to retrieve {{one of their own}} is remarkable. The Kirk hierarchy, for example, made no attempt to contact her or convey news of her condition to the capital, yet they could easily have done so. Whatever the call of morality and natural justice may have suggested, John Chiesley's daughter evidently did not command a sympathetic audience in her home town.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{were made}} in 1876, {{introducing}} more elaborate uniforms for commissioned officers based on those worn by the 13th Hussars, with similarly militaristic uniforms for the other ranks, using gold braid to distinguish the non-commissioned officers. These uniforms were initially of rather low quality, as the government had contracted out the work to prison convicts. The winter uniforms comprised grey overcoats with fur caps and moccasins, although the police preferred wearing warmer buffalo coats, which were <b>available</b> <b>until</b> the herds died out. In 1886, the hussar-style uniforms were replaced by a simpler dragoon version, and dark-blue undress uniforms introduced. In the 1880s, blue pea jackets made from pilot cloth became popular among the police {{as part of their}} winter outfit, and were officially issued from 1893 onwards. There were continual attempts to produce a consistent uniform across the force, but this was only ever partially successful due to the multiple government suppliers who each produced slightly different variants.|$|E

5|$|Following this, in 1972, the {{legislature}} {{added a new}} SR117, which extended this part of SR75 southwest to the Mexican border near Border Field State Park, to the state highway system, and a southerly extension of SR125 to the border at Otay Mesa to the state highway and Freeway and Expressway systems. Two years later, planning began {{for the construction of}} the Otay Mesa crossing and the construction of SR75 to connect it to I-5 and I-805. Later, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO), the local association of municipal governments, recommended using $4million of federal funding for the construction of SR75. The CPO later endorsed expediting construction of the freeway before completion of the border crossing, so that the freeway would primarily serve border traffic, thus preventing land speculation in Otay Mesa. While Mexican authorities wanted the crossing constructed in 1975, the CPO indicated that the funding for SR75 would not be <b>available</b> <b>until</b> at least 1980, or even 1985. Following this, Representative Lionel Van Deerlin attempted to accelerate the construction of the crossing, even though there was no funding for the highway.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to make the vehicle stand out in the market against similar rivals, which {{included}} its own derivatives, Peugeot added a more glamorous two-door cabriolet to the standard three-door hatchback. Although announced at the hatchback's launch, the first models were not <b>available</b> <b>until</b> 1982. Designed and built by the Italian coachbuilder Pininfarina, who had been building open-top Peugeots since the 1960s, it came only with the 1360cc engine; two engine versions were offered, 53 or 59kilowatts (72 or 80PS)—the former was dropped after 1984, at which time a slightly revised cabriolet was released featuring the later style 104 dashboard, twin carburettors and a lined hood; the 80bhp engine was shared with the Rallye. At the time of its launch it was the only cabrio small car available from the manufacturer, although other models subsequently entered the market segment created by the Samba, including PSA's own Citroën Visa Decapotable. Pininfarina built 13,062Samba cabriolets.|$|E
5|$|Nhill {{was always}} {{meant to be}} a {{temporary}} location for No.1 OTU, whose home was to be East Sale, also in Victoria. As accommodation at East Sale would not be <b>available</b> <b>until</b> October 1942, the school's 1,630 personnel were relocated to Bairnsdale in June and July. The base's living quarters, recreational buildings and 88 tents could not fully accommodate this influx, so the RAAF rented hotels in Bairnsdale for 320 airmen. On 10December 1942, No.1 OTU Detached Flight, consisting of 15 Hudsons and 108 personnel including air and maintenance crews, was sent to North-Eastern Area Command to help fulfill urgent transport requirements in New Guinea. This force joined a military Douglas DC-2 and eleven civil aircraft pressed into service to form RAAF Special Transport Flight, which operated out of Wards Airfield from 14December 1942 to 11January 1943. The Hudsons flew 645 sorties, carrying some 1,100 troops and almost 800 tons of equipment. Two of the Hudsons were lost, one to enemy action and one to friendly fire, and several were damaged.|$|E
