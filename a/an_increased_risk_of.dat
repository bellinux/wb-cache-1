Rough sex can be a factor associated with <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, {{and there may be}} a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

5|$|Phenformin, another biguanide, was {{withdrawn}} from the market because of <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> lactic acidosis (rate of 40-64 per 100,000 patient-years).

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cardiovascular disease and some also <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E

A 2006 analysis of 138 randomised trials and almost 150 000 participants showed that selective COX-2 inhibitors are associated with <b>a</b> moderately <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> vascular events, mainly due to <b>a</b> twofold <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> myocardial infarction, and also that high-dose regimens of some traditional NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen, but not naproxen) are associated with <b>a</b> similar <b>increase</b> in <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> vascular events.|$|R

In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
