In 1999, the <b>AMP</b> co-founded The Journal of Medical Diagnostics. Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical Diagnostics in 2001. From 2002 onwards, the HapMap Project aggregated information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human populationthe single nucleotide polymorphismsand their relationship with disease. In 2012, molecular diagnostic techniques for Thalassemia use genetic hybridization tests to identify the specific single nucleotide polymorphism causing an individual's disease.|$|E

40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (<b>AMPs)</b> {{are natural}} products found across diverse taxa {{as part of}} the innate immune system against pathogen attacks. Some <b>AMPs</b> are synthesised through the canonical gene expression machinery and are called ribosomal <b>AMPs.</b> Other <b>AMPs</b> are assembled by modular enzymes generating nonribosomal <b>AMPs</b> and harbour unusual structural diversity. Plants synthesise an array of <b>AMPs,</b> yet are still subject to many pathogen invasions. Crop breeding programs struggle to release new cultivars in which complete disease resistance is achieved, and usually such resistance becomes quickly overcome by the targeted pathogens which have a shorter generation time. <b>AMPs</b> could offer a solution by exploring not only plant-derived <b>AMPs,</b> related or unrelated to the crop of interest, but also non-plant <b>AMPs</b> produced by bacteria, fungi, oomycetes or animals. This review highlights some promising candidates within the plant kingdom and elsewhere, and offers some perspectives on how to identify and validate their bioactivities. Technological advances, particularly in mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), have been instrumental in identifying and elucidating the structure of novel <b>AMPs,</b> especially nonribosomal peptides which cannot be identified through genomics approaches. The majority of non-plant <b>AMPs</b> showing potential for plant disease immunity are often tested using in vitro assays. The greatest challenge remains the functional validation of candidate <b>AMPs</b> in plants through transgenic experiments, particularly introducing nonribosomal <b>AMPs</b> into crops...|$|R

The essential mechanisms of action of <b>AMPs</b> toward microbial cells have been reported as electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction between <b>AMPs</b> (cationic <b>AMPs)</b> and microbial cell membranes. These effects also contribute to the potential mechanism of anticancer activities of <b>AMPs</b> as well. The membrane difference between cancer cells and normal cells are believed to play significant roles in <b>AMPs</b> orienting process.

40|$|The {{frequent}} {{emergence of}} drug-resistant bacteria {{has created an}} urgent demand for new antimicrobial agents. Traditional methods of novel antibiotic development are almost obsolete. Antimicrobial peptides (<b>AMPs)</b> are now regarded as a potential solution to revive the traditional methods of antibiotic development, although, until now, many <b>AMPs</b> have failed in clinical trials. A comprehensive database of <b>AMPs</b> with information about their antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity will help promote the process of finding novel <b>AMPs</b> with improved antimicrobial activity and reduced cytotoxicity and eventually accelerate the speed of translating the discovery of new <b>AMPs</b> into clinical or preclinical trials. LAMP, a database linking <b>AMPs,</b> serves {{as a tool to}} aid the discovery and design of <b>AMPs</b> as new antimicrobial agents. The current version of LAMP has 5, 547 entries, comprising 3, 904 natural <b>AMPs</b> and 1, 643 synthetic peptides. The database can be queried using either simply keywords or combinatorial conditions searches. Equipped with the detailed antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity data, the cross-linking and top similar <b>AMPs</b> functions implemented in LAMP will help enhance our current understanding of <b>AMPs</b> and this may speed up the development of new <b>AMPs</b> for medical applications.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (<b>AMPs)</b> {{are important}} {{components of the}} innate immune system of many vertebrate and invertebrate species. These small peptides directly kill microorganisms by inducing microbial cell death. This review focuses on the mechanisms of direct antimicrobial effects against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria of the main human <b>AMPs,</b> α-defensins, β-defensins, the cathelicidin LL- 37 and the histatins. Effectiveness of the <b>AMPs</b> is dependent on both {{the properties of the}} <b>AMPs</b> and the target microbe. The size, cationic charge and amphipathicity allows <b>AMPs</b> to target and disrupt the membrane integrity of several bacteria. Different mechanisms of lipid bilayer disruption by <b>AMPs</b> are described by the ‘barrel-stave’, the ‘toroidal-pore’ and the ‘carpet’ model. Although these models are generally accepted to clarify direct antimicrobial killing by <b>AMPs,</b> the precise mechanisms of the main human <b>AMPs</b> remains to be clarified. In addition, the microbicidal activity of some <b>AMPs</b> might be explained by other mechanisms...|$|R

5|$|ATP {{is also a}} {{substrate}} of adenylate cyclase, {{most commonly}} in G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways and is transformed to second messenger, cyclic <b>AMP,</b> which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (<b>AMPs)</b> {{are usually}} small molecule peptides, which display broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, high efficiency, and stability. For the multiple-antibiotic-resistant strains, <b>AMPs</b> {{play a significant}} role in the development of novel antibiotics because of their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities and specific antimicrobial mechanism. Besides broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, <b>AMPs</b> also have anti-inflammatory activity. The neutralization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) plays a key role in anti-inflammatory action of <b>AMPs.</b> On the one hand, <b>AMPs</b> can readily penetrate the cell wall barrier by neutralizing LPS to remove Gram-negative bacteria that can lead to infection. On the contrary, <b>AMPs</b> can also inhibit the production of biological inflammatory cytokines to reduce the inflammatory response through neutralizing circulating LPS. In addition, <b>AMPs</b> also modulate the host immune system by chemotaxis of leukocytes, to promote immune cell proliferation, epithelialization, and angiogenesis and thus play a protective role. This review summarizes some recent researches about anti-inflammatory <b>AMPs,</b> with a focus on the interaction of <b>AMPs</b> and LPS on the past decade...|$|R

5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (<b>AMP)</b> (as opposed to a change in total <b>AMP</b> or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular <b>AMP</b> has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} RAAF's {{reorganisation}} {{following the}} outbreak of World WarII, No.1 Group was formed under Wrigley's command in Melbourne on 20November 1939, to oversee the operations of air bases and units in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Promoted air commodore, in 1940 Wrigley served as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Southern Area, the successor organisation to No.1 Group, before taking up the position of Air Member for Personnel (<b>AMP)</b> in November that year. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1941 New Year Honours. As <b>AMP,</b> Wrigley's responsibilities included organising the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF), established on 25March 1941 as the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in the country. He believed that recruiting servicewomen was essential to augment the many ground staff required to support the war effort, and considered that while such an organisation should be constitutionally separate from the RAAF, its members should be closely integrated within the current force structure.|$|E

5|$|In glycolysis, {{hexokinase}} {{is directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control {{point for the}} glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of <b>AMP.</b> The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic <b>AMP,</b> ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E

5|$|Other NAD-dependent enzymes include {{bacterial}} DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends {{by using}} NAD {{as a substrate}} to donate an adenosine monophosphate (<b>AMP)</b> moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end.

30|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (<b>AMPs),</b> {{with their}} extraordinary properties, such as broad-spectrum activity, rapid action and difficult development of resistance, have become promising molecules as new antibiotics. Despite their various mechanisms of action, {{the interaction of}} <b>AMPs</b> with the bacterial cell membrane is the key step for their mode of action. Moreover, it is generally accepted that the membrane is the primary target of most <b>AMPs,</b> and the interaction between <b>AMPs</b> and eukaryotic cell membranes (causing toxicity to host cells) limits their clinical application. Therefore, researchers are engaged in reforming or de novo designing <b>AMPs</b> as a ‘singleedged sword’ that contains high antimicrobial activity yet low cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells. To improve the antimicrobial activity of <b>AMPs,</b> {{the relationship between the}} structure and function of <b>AMPs</b> has been rigorously pursued.

30|$|<b>AMPs</b> destroy {{bacteria}} {{in a unique}} way that does is less prone to resistance. However, although hundreds of <b>AMPs</b> have been isolated, only a few have been investigated for their possible mode of action. The generally accepted mode of action for <b>AMPs</b> against Gram-negative bacteria is that the <b>AMPs</b> interact with the highly negatively charged surface of the membrane consisting of lipopolysaccharide. Then, the <b>AMPs</b> insert and translocate to the outer bilayer to bind the anionic inner membrane by a self-promoted uptake pathway (Hancock 2001; Mangoni et al. 2004). However, some studies discovered that rapid killing occurs due to serious reduction of membrane integrity at high concentrations. Membrane activity for the <b>AMPs</b> Os and Os-C may have intracellular targets such as DNA, similar to melittin at low concentrations (Taute et al. 2015). The killing mode of <b>AMPs</b> is complex and remains incompletely understood.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMultidrug {{resistance}} {{bacteria are}} a major concern worldwide. These pathogens cannot be treated with conventional antibiotics and thus alternative therapeutic agents are needed. Antimicrobial peptides (<b>AMPs)</b> {{are considered to be}} good candidates for this purpose. Most <b>AMPs</b> are short and positively charged amphipathic peptides, which are found in all known forms of life. <b>AMPs</b> are known to kill bacteria by binding to the negatively charged bacterial surface, and in most cases cause membrane disruption. Resistance toward <b>AMPs</b> can be developed, by modification of bacterial surface molecules, secretion of protective material and up-regulation or elimination of specific proteins. Because of the general mechanisms of attachment and action of <b>AMPs,</b> bacterial resistance to <b>AMPs</b> often involves biophysical and biochemical changes such as surface rigidity, cell wall thickness, surface charge, as well as membrane and cell wall modification. Here we focus on the biophysical, surface and surrounding changes that bacteria undergo in acquiring resistance to <b>AMPs.</b> In addition we discuss the question of whether bacterial resistance to administered <b>AMPs</b> might compromise our innate immunity to endogenous <b>AMPs.</b> This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bacterial Resistance to Antimicrobial Peptides...|$|R
