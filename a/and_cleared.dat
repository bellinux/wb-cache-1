5|$|In 1940, the {{airfield}} {{was occupied by}} the Royal Air Force, who erected Nissen huts <b>and</b> <b>cleared</b> the area of obstacles as {{it was intended to}} use the area as an Emergency Landing Ground.

Between March and June 1940 the airfield was used by No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Redhill as a relief landing ground. Knotley Hall was again requisitioned for use as the officers' quarters, although the tennis courts were off-limits.|$|E

5|$|Two plagues afflicted coastal New England in 1614 and 1617, {{possibly}} {{transmitted from}} British and French fishermen to natives {{on the shore}} (although no concrete evidence exists to prove such a connection).

5|$|After {{a pair of}} Tiger {{possessions}} {{that ended}} with punts and an Alabama possession that ended with a lost fumble by McCarron, the Crimson Tide started their fourth scoring drive of the afternoon. The drive began with a 22-yard McCarron pass to Christion Jones and finished with a 15-yard Yeldon touchdown run. Immediately after Yeldon scored, the referees stopped the game temporarily <b>and</b> <b>cleared</b> the field due to lightning strikes {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the stadium. After a 40-minute stoppage, the game resumed with a Jeremy Shelley extra point and a Crimson Tide lead of 28–0. Missouri responded on the kickoff that ensued with their only touchdown of the afternoon on a 98-yard Marcus Murphy return that made the halftime score 28–7.|$|E
5|$|Another catch {{went down}} off Miller {{late in the}} day when Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip.

The British troops moved forward into Bénouville <b>and</b> <b>cleared</b> the Germans in house to house fighting. By midday, most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion had arrived at the bridges. Despite the ferocity of the attacks, the battalion and the coup-de-main force were able to hold the bridges until 19:00, when the leading elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division arrived and began to relieve the airborne troops, a process that was completed around 01:00 7 June.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, the {{executive}} committee of the Berlin city council proposed a site {{on the banks of}} the river Spree, roughly corresponding to the current location of the Berlin Finance Department and the offices of the Social Association of Germany. The proposal was rejected by the full city council because it would overshadow the city hall. Further proposals were put on hold for several years. After discussing many locations, in 1898, chief of construction Ludwig Hoffmann became involved and the council agreed on Molkenmarkt.

5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} McClory again {{started working on}} a project to bring a Thunderball {{adaptation}} to production and, with the working title Warhead (a.k.a.

The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the Thunderball novel only, and once again the project was deferred. Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service, but then producer Jack Schwartzman became involved <b>and</b> <b>cleared</b> a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project and licensed the rights from McClory.|$|E

5|$|Lumber {{became one}} of the leading {{industries}} in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons. The PhiladelphiaErie Pike (present day Pennsylvania Route 504) opened the Black Moshannon area to settlers by 1821. The first settlers opened the Antes Tavern along the Pike, trapped fur-bearing animals, <b>and</b> <b>cleared</b> land for farming.|$|E
5|$|N. nigricollis usually inhabits savanna and {{semi-desert}} {{regions of}} Africa. However, {{they can be}} found at altitudes up to , as well as in tropical and subtropical regions of central Africa in moist savanna <b>and</b> <b>cleared</b> former forest regions, particularly near rivers and streams. Adaptable snakes, Naja n.nigricollis occurs in southeastern Nigeria where their habitat has been transformed from rainforest to man-made farmlands, plantations, suburban areas, and a few fragmented forests. This species of cobra has found advantages in the drastic changes which have taken place in Nigeria's rainforests. A study by herpetologist Luca Luiselli suggests this snake now forages in much drier microhabitats.|$|E
5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply <b>and</b> <b>cleared</b> canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E
