40|$|The {{sanitary}} {{practices of}} beef cattle farmers have immediate reflections on animal health and bring potential risks {{to public health}} and the environment. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} verify the risk perception in 90 farmers from 66 towns in the State of São Paulo, in matters related to the purchase and management of veterinary products. Through qualitative approach, personal interview ─ using open and closed questions, and multiple correspondence analysis, it was verified tendencies of associations between socioeconomic factors and the perception of the farmers. The addressed issues were about the observation of the grace period of veterinary products, the mention of the grace period of two veterinary products in use in the property, which criterion is used to decide on the purchase of veterinary products, the estimating of body weight or <b>actual</b> <b>weighing</b> of animals upon deworming and whether the person who administer the veterinary products has received any kind of training or not. Farmers with complete or incomplete elementary education tend to adopt practices judged as improper or unsuitable; they do not estimate body weight or conduct the <b>actual</b> <b>weighing</b> of animals upon deworming and do not take part in training activities for the administration of products. Farmers with secondary education tend not to observe the grace period of products and spontaneously name price or quality as criterion to decide on the purchase of products. On the other hand, farmers with higher education correctly answered the grace period of two veterinary products, tend to estimate or weight the animals upon administration of products and participate or develop training activities. When the farmers were grouped according to the total number of their herd, the tendencies revealed that professional advice is the criterion employed by farmers with herds of up to 100 animals; however, they do not estimate body weigh [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a seaport can be assessed in strategic terms by means of portfolio analyses based on traffic volumes expressed in nominal tons. This article suggests that differences {{in the creation of}} value added among traffic categories can greatly contribute to such strategic assessment. A weighted analysis of traffic data allows the identification of market niches with potential for future development. However, the <b>actual</b> <b>weighing</b> of traffic volumes usually lacks transparency and is based on weighing rules which have only limited validity. Therefore, these rules cannot be viewed as appropriate for a generalised use in the context of seaport comparisons. In this paper, an ‘Antwerp rule’ and a ‘range rule’ are developed, based on relevant maritime traffic information. The former rule can be usefully applied to data on the Antwerp port, whereas the latter allows the introduction of the value added concept in comparative traffic studies that include all ports in the Hamburg-Le Havre range. The introduction of intrinsic cargo handling tons in port comparisons enables ports with important volumes of general cargo, such as Antwerp, Zeebrugge and Hamburg, to improve their competitive position.

40|$|Background In several {{provinces of}} Eastern Indonesia, the {{majority}} of births take place at home (60 %) and are assisted by traditional birth attendants. Most of these newborns do not have their birth weight recorded, {{due to lack of}} available weighing scales or lack of skill to perform the measurement, especially in rural areas. As such, an early iden tification oflow birth weight cases is needed to prevent infan t morbidity and mortality. Objective To assess anthropometric measurements including calf, chest, and h ead circumferences as a method of choice for detecting low birth weight, as substitute for <b>actual</b> <b>weighing.</b> Methods This cross-sectional study was performed at Banjar Barn, South Kalimantan, Indonesia, from January to March 2012. Subjects were full term, singleton, and live-born infants during the study period, and obtained from private clinics by a purposive sampling procedure. Calf, chest, and h ead circumferences were measured to identify the most suitable substitute for birth weight using Pearson's correlation, ROC, sensitivity, and specificity. Results In this study, a correlation was shown between birth weight and all anthropometric measurements. Optimal calf, chest, and head circumference cutoff points to identify low birth weight infants were 10. 3 cm, 30. 7 cm, and 3 1. 2 cm, respectively. The area under the curves (AUC) showed good accuracy for all measuremen t types. Calf circumference had the closest estimated true prevalence to the true prevalence (8. 52 % and 8. 6 %, respectively) compared to the other measurement types. Conclusion Calf circumference is the most suitable measurement as a substitute for birth weight, due to its estimated true prevalence...|$|E

40|$|Background: Developments in enzyme {{replacement}} therapy have kindled discussions on adding Pompe disease, characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, to neonatal screening. Pompe disease {{does not fit}} traditional screening criteria {{as it is a}} broad-spectrum phenotype disorder that may occur in lethal form in early infancy or manifest in less severe forms from infancy to late adulthood. Current screening tests cannot differentiate between these forms. Normally, expanding screening is discussed among experts in advisory bodies. While advisory reports usually mention the procedures and outcome of deliberations, little is known of the importance attached to different arguments and the <b>actual</b> <b>weighing</b> processes involved. In this research we aim to explore the views {{of a wide range of}} relevant professionals to gain more insight into the process of weighing pros and cons of neonatal screening for Pompe disease, as an example of the dilemmas involved in screening for broad-spectrum phenotype disorders. Methods: We conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with medical, lab, insurance and screening professionals, and executive staff of patient organisations. They were asked about their first reaction to neonatal screening for Pompe disease, after which benefits and harms and requirements for screening were explored in more detail. Results: Advantages included health gain by timely intervention, avoiding a diagnostic quest, having a reproductive choice and gaining more knowledge about the natural course and treatment. Being prepared was mentioned as an advantage for the later manifesting cases. Disadvantages included treatment costs and uncertainties about its effect, the timing of treatment in later manifesting cases, the psychological burden for the patient-in-waiting and the family. Also the downsides of having prior knowledge as well as having to consider a reproductive option were mentioned as disadvantages. Conclusion: When weighing pros and cons, interviewees attach different importance to different arguments, based on personal and professional views. Professionals expect benefits from neonatal screening for Pompe disease, especially for early-onset cases. Some interviewees valued screening in later manifesting cases as well, while stressing the need for adequate support of pre-symptomatic patients and their families. Others considered the psychological burden and uncertainties regarding treatment as reasons not to screen...|$|E
40|$|Food waste {{has been}} proclaimed {{to be the}} key issue of concern that has drawn the {{attention}} of national and international scientific communities. This is due to changes in food systems and global situations. The issue of food waste is important because a large amount of food is being wasted during the production and distribution of food. One-third of food produced globally is wasted or lost from farm to fork. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and quantify the factors that contribute to generation of household food waste. The evaluation was done using face-to-face interviews based on a structured questionnaire and the <b>actual</b> <b>weighing</b> of households’ food wasted was quantified using a weighing kitchen scale. A total of 210 participants were interviewed. Food waste samples were collected from five selected study areas of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality (CTMM) : Atteridgeville Ext 6, 16 and 17, Lyttelton, Montana Park, Olievenhoutbosch Ext 36 and Silver Lakes Golf Estate, in Gauteng province, South Africa. The acquired data was captured into Microsoft Excel, and analysed. The chi-square statistical test was done using SAS statistical software. Out of 210 interviewed participants, 55 % of the households had a monthly income of R 10 000 + and 45 % had a monthly income of less than R 10 000. A total of 59 % of respondents agreed that they wasted food, while 41 % thought they did not waste food at all. The results also show that 35 % of households included in the survey in selected areas of the CTMM threw away pap (referred as maize porridge), 26 % wasted rice, 25 % bread and 14 % fruit and vegetables. Households wasted an average total of 6 kg per week per household. This was attributed to over preparation of porridge and rice; buying too much food; falling for special offers; poor storage; food residue, and fruit and vegetables going off. Households with a monthly income of R 500 - R 5 000 wasted more food than households with an income of more than R 5 000. As such, it can be concluded that income has an impact on the amount of food wasted within the selected areas of CTMM. Moreover, analysis of the data confirmed that there is a statistically significant relationship between income level and food waste. The statistical chi-square test was applied and a probability value (p-value) of < 0. 0001 was obtained, indicating that the difference between income categories was more than just a random pattern. (Note that any p-value of < 0. 05 is considered to be statistically significant, i. e. an indication of an underlying consistent, non-random pattern.) Environmental SciencesM. Sc.

40|$|Background: bserving plate {{waste is}} {{categorized}} {{as a simple}} way but yet still needs evaluation. When many foods are wasted, a dietitian should quickly respond and know the best way how to overcome the matters. There are three accurate ways to determine plate waste: plate waste weighing, visual estimation, and 24 hours recall. The application of each method really depends on its purposes. According to previous researches there are significant and positive correlations between the visual estimation of Comstock Scale and plate waste weighing. Visual estimation, moreover, has more advantages as {{it is easy to}} apply, cheap, and less time consuming. Considering those advantages, visual estimation needs to be socialized and considered as a new accurate method besides weighing methods. Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} know the medical official accuracy in determining plate waste using visual estimation of 6 point Comstock Scale. Methods: An observational study was conducted using a cross-sectional design. Subjects were nurses and meal servants from hospital wards. Before the meal served to the patient the food is weighed, than the observers officer has to observed portion sized. After the patient having meal, plate waste should be estimated using Comstock Scale by the officer after that the plate waste have to be weight to know the <b>actual</b> <b>weigh.</b> The accuracy difference between two groups in determining plate waste using Comstock Scale were analysed with t-test. Results: There was significant differences of accuracy (p= 0. 01) between nurse group and meal servant in estimating wasted rice and wasted meat (p= 0. 02). The difference were not due to the job factor but the significant of various meal (p= 0. 0001). The work experience is a significant factor in the accuracy of plate waste (p= 0. 42). There was no correlation between kind of job and kind of meal (p= 0. 47), and kind of meal with the work experience (p= 0. 79). Conclusion: Visual estimation of 6 point Comstock scale could be used by both nurses and meal servant in determining plate waste...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aerosol {{chemical}} mass closure is revisited and {{a simple}} and inexpensive methodology is proposed. This methodology relies on data obtained for aerosol mass, and concentration of the major ions and the two main carbon components, the organic carbon (OC) and the black carbon (BC). Atmospheric particles are separated into coarse (AD> 2 µm) and fine (AD k of OC-to-POM (Particulate Organic Matter) which is fixed {{to the value of}} 1. 8 accounting for secondary species. The coarse soluble calcium is shown to display a correlation (regression coefficient f, y axis intercept b) with the missing mass. Conversely, the fine fraction is dominated by organic species and assumption is made for dust which is assumed to have the same f factor as the coarse mode dust. The fine mode mass obtained from chemical analyses is then adjusted to the <b>actual</b> <b>weighed</b> mass by tuning the k conversion factor. The k coefficient is kept different in the two modes due to the expected different origins of the organic particles. Using the f and k coefficient obtained from the data set, the mass closure is reached for each individual sample with an undetermined fraction less than 10 %. The procedure has been applied to different urban and peri-urban environments in Europe and in Beijing and its efficiency and uncertainties on f and k values are discussed. The f and k coefficients are shown to offer consistent geochemical indications on aerosol origin and transformations. f allows to retrieve dust mass and its value accounting for Ca abundance in dust at the site of investigation may serve as an indicator of dust origin and aerosol interactions with anthropogenic acids. f values were found to vary in the 0. 08 – 0. 12 range in European urban areas, and a broader range in Beijing (0. 01 – 0. 16). As expected, k appears to be a relevant proxy for particle origin and ageing and varies in the 1. 4 – 1. 8 range. For Beijing, k exhibits high values of about 1. 7 in winter and summer. Winter values suggest that fresh coal aerosol might be responsible for such a high k value, which was not taken into account in previous works...|$|R

2500|$|The English penny first {{appeared}} in Anglo-Saxon times, as a silver coin.

40|$|Students {{usually have}} a {{subjective}} feeling about their performance after taking an exam so they can imagine the grade {{they are going to}} obtain. Besides, students normally have relative opinion of the marks they deserve. We asked students for their self-assessment (expected and deserved grades) after taking some exams in order to compare their estimations with the actual mark. On the other hand, students were asked for the percentage of classes they attended and if the contents of the exam were a reflection of the subject under examination. We use this information to study the relationship between subjective marks and actual exams outcomes. We have used three different statistical procedures in order to explore the relationship between subjective and actual grades. Linear regression, logistic regression and Bayesian nets were used for building models with the interest variables. We show expected marks are related lineally with exam outcomes whereas the percentage of attended classes is related, non-lineally, with the probability of passing the test. In predictive terms, the Bayesian model showed the best fit by predicting the actual mark above 90 % of accuracy. These results could be used for <b>weighing</b> <b>actual</b> and subjective marks to get more valid formal assessments...|$|R

This study was carried out at the Ribat university hospital at Burri, Khartoum from December 6, 2003 to May 3, 2004 to evaluate the relative accuracy of three ultrasonographic formulas in estimating fetal weight in term Sudanese ladies. 200 pregnant ladies, aged between 18 and 42 years, were examined sonologically by a senior radiologist using an Aloka SSD- 650 real time scanner and the fetal weights were calculated using the Aloka formula A, Aoki’s formula and Shephard’s formula. 36. 5 % of the study population were primigravidas and the rest were parous women. The mean gestational age at delivery was 39. 5 ± 1. 4 weeks while 11. 5 % of the deliveries occurred after more than 40 weeks of gestation (post term) 41. 0 % of the ladies delivered on the same day of sonological examination, 45. 0 % delivered one day after examination while 14. 0 % delivered two days after examination. The study found that the birth weights of 93. 0 % of the newborn babies were within the reference weight of 2500 – 4000 grams. Only 4. 0 % of the newborns have low birth weights (below the 10 th percentile) while 3. 0 % were macrosomic (above 90 th percentile). 54. 5 % of the newborn babies were of male gender compared with 45. 5 % female babies. The mean birth weight for the study population was found to be 3196. 70 ± 454. 16 grams. Male newborns had a higher mean birth weight (3281 ± 664. 308 grams) compared to newborn girls whose mean birth weight was 3107 ± 635. 077 grams. Two of the evaluated formulas, Aoki’s and Shephard’s formuals tended to underestimate fetal weights while the third formula, the Aloka formula gave estimates higher than the mean actual birth weight. However, all three evaluated formulas were found to be accurate for estimation of fetal birth weight in Sudanese ladies. The Aoki formula had the highest degree of accuracy with 77. 0 % of its estimates falling within 10. 0 % of actual birth weights.
