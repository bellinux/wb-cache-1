5|$|In children, {{particularly}} those younger {{than six years}} old, the diagnosis can be difficult and the condition is often initially mistaken (sometimes {{for up to two}} weeks) for other causes of pains <b>and</b> <b>difficulty</b> walking, such as viral infections, or bone and joint problems.|$|E
5|$|Airbus briefly {{considered}} the variable camber wing, {{a concept that}} requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost <b>and</b> <b>difficulty</b> of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opened in}} 1800 {{at the cost}} of £100,000, the new harbour at Grimsby failed to attract the levels of trade the company had projected, caused largely by a lack of inland {{transport}} networks. The financial problems facing the Grimsby Haven Company led to factions <b>and</b> <b>difficulty</b> in its running and put strain on Boucherett's relations with Yarborough; having invested much money and time in the now failing company, Boucherett also found it draining of him financially.|$|E

5|$|Banished is a city-building {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed by Shining Rock Software. It was released for Microsoft Windows on February 18, 2014. The game focuses on careful resource management and survival as an isolated and growing society. Its gameplay {{can be compared}} with economic theory on sustainability and optimization. Banished received mixed reviews on release, with reviewers praising graphics <b>and</b> <b>difficulty</b> early in the game, but criticizing a lack of feedback for player actions and lower emphasis on survival as the city grows.|$|E
5|$|Canoeing {{or other}} non-motorized boating {{is the most}} popular method of {{exploring}} the BWCAW. A 2007 study found more than 94% of overnight visitors used a non-motorized boat to travel through the park. The BWCAW's size and abundance of campsites, lakes, rivers and portage trails allow for almost countless options for different routes. Many online maps and guidebooks offer suggested routes based on entry point, duration <b>and</b> <b>difficulty.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} at Harvard, Whitehead {{produced}} his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote Science and the Modern World, which was immediately hailed {{as an alternative to}} the Cartesian dualism that plagued popular science.

5|$|RAD {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{researched}} and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM.

5|$|Stanier, the {{designer}} of the locomotives, felt that the added weight <b>and</b> <b>difficulty</b> in maintenance due to the streamlining was too high {{a price to pay}} for the actual benefits gained at high speed. Therefore, in 1938 a third batch of five locomotives (again named after Duchesses) was built, Nos. 6230–6234, without streamlining at an average cost of £10,659 each.|$|E

5|$|The local {{symptoms}} of victims bitten by the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one {{to six hours}} after being bitten by this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral ptosis, diplopia, discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak feeling in limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, dysphagia, tunnel vision, <b>and</b> <b>difficulty</b> breathing. In case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. Hyponatremia is also seen, but less commonly.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} inferences {{that can be}} made from the A-not-B error has been challenged.

5|$|Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis may be problems. The cost <b>and</b> <b>difficulty</b> of {{screening}} and assessment can delay diagnosis.

There are indications AS has been diagnosed more frequently in recent years, partly as a residual diagnosis for children of normal intelligence who are not autistic but have social difficulties.|$|E

5|$|Erik Chisholm wrote {{well over}} 100 works, {{including}} 35 orchestral works, 7 concertante works (including a violin concerto and two piano concertos), 7 works for orchestra and voice or chorus, 54 piano works, 3 organ works, 43 songs, 8 choral part-songs, 7 ballets, and 9 operas including one on Robert Burns. He also made several interesting arrangements by composers such as Handel and Mozart. He arranged a string orchestra {{version of the}} Symphony for Solo Piano, Op. 39 Nos. 4–7 by Charles-Valentin Alkan, a composer still largely unknown at that time, the original {{of which has been}} said to surpass even the Transcendental Études of Franz Liszt in scale <b>and</b> <b>difficulty.</b>|$|E

In return the majority shareholder Ronald Perelman was required to relinquish control of Panavision, and he no longer has any equity in the company. In June 2013, its creditors sued over an unpaid debt of $1.7 million, threatening to dissolve the company if they win.|$|E
