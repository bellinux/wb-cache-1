5|$|The bulb of the radish {{is usually}} eaten raw, {{although}} tougher specimens can be steamed. The raw flesh has a crisp texture and a pungent, peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanates,</b> {{also present in}} mustard, horseradish, and wasabi.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of cocktail of phytochemicals from broccoli with gold salt results in dual reduction and surface capping to produce well-defined stable and biocompatible gold nanoparticles (B-AuNPs). Broccoli phytochemicals–coated gold nanopar-ticles (B-AuNPs) have been fully characterized. Detailed in vitro stability in various biological fluids and affinity and selectivity for tumor cells have been investigated. The B-AuNPs showed significant in vitro cytotoxic effects against various cancer cells (MDA-MB- 231, PC- 3, U 266, SkBr 3, and T 47 D) as confirmed by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl thiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) and flow cytometry apoptosis assays. Surface encapsulation of cocktail of broccoli phytochemicals on AuNPs facilitates the cellular internalization, thereby validating the in vitro therapeutic {{effects of these}} nanoparticles. Detailed analyses performed by combination of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS–MS) have confirmed the presence of biologically active phytochemicals including glucoraphanin, phenethyl glucosino-lates, quercetin, folic acid, vitamin C, <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanates,</b> 2 -phenylethyl isothiocyanates, and sulforaphane. The unique syner-gistic cocktail effects of B-AuNPs will provide new opportunities for generating biocompatible AuNPs for molecular imaging and therapeutic applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{current review}} {{focuses on a}} plant with a wide {{spectrum}} of potential uses, Armoracia rusticana syn. Armoracia lapathifolia), commonly known as horseradish. The plant has been cultivated {{for a long time and}} is used in food industry, mainly as a condiment, but recent research has provided data on other possible uses. This paper focuses on the botany, distribution, agriculture, and chemical characterization of this root, and its possible therapeutical uses. Relations to other species, distribution, and ethnopharmacology are briefly discussed. An introduction is provided about the stability and technical properties of the main constituents. Detailed pharmacological description is given on the chief chemical compounds, <b>allyl</b> and phenethyl <b>isothiocyanates,</b> including in vitro and animal studies and pharmacokinetics. The main isothiocyanates are mainly researched as possible anticancer and antimicrobial agents...|$|R
2500|$|The intact {{horseradish}} root has hardly any aroma. When cut or grated enzymes from the now-broken plant cells break down sinigrin (a glucosinolate) to produce <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (mustard oil), which irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes. Grated mash {{should be used}} immediately or preserved in vinegar for best flavor. [...] Once exposed to air or heat it will begin to lose its pungency, darken in color, and become unpleasantly bitter tasting over time.|$|E
2500|$|Substances such as ethanol and {{capsaicin}} cause {{a burning}} sensation by inducing a trigeminal nerve reaction together with normal taste reception. The sensation of heat {{is caused by}} the food's activating nerves that express TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors. Some such plant-derived compounds that provide this sensation are capsaicin from chili peppers, piperine from black pepper, gingerol from ginger root and <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> from horseradish. The piquant ("hot" [...] or [...] "spicy") sensation provided by such foods and spices {{plays an important role in}} a diverse range of cuisines across the world—especially in equatorial and sub-tropical climates, such as Ethiopian, Peruvian, Hungarian, Indian, Korean, Indonesian, Lao, Malaysian, Mexican, New Mexican, Singaporean, Southwest Chinese (including Szechuan cuisine), Vietnamese, and Thai cuisines.|$|E

40|$|Isothiocyanates are {{electrophiles}} {{that are}} able to induce phase II biotransformation enzyme gene expression via an electrophile-responsive element (EpRE) in the gene regulatory region. To study the potency of different isothiocyanates to induce the expression of EpRE-regulated genes, a Hepa- 1 c 1 c 7 luciferase reporter cell line was exposed to structurally different isothiocyanates. The reporter cell line, EpRE(mGST-Ya) –LUX, contains the EpRE from the regulatory region of the mouse glutathione S-transferase Ya gene. Isothiocyanates containing a methyl-sulfur side chain, e. g. sulforaphane, showed a lower EC 50 (0. 8 – 3. 2 µM) and a comparable induction factor (17 – 22. 4) compared to the structurally different isothiocyanates containing an alkyl or aromatic side chain, e. g. <b>allyl</b> and phenylethyl <b>isothiocyanate</b> (EC 50 3. 9 – 6. 5 µM, induction factor 17. 5 – 23). After 24 h of exposure, on average (±SD) 23 ± 5 % of the isothiocyanate was found in the cells and 77 % in the cell medium. Isothiocyanates prove to be strong inducers of electrophile-responsive element-mediated gene expression at physiological concentrations. The here described luciferase reporter cell line is a suitable assay to measure the potency of compounds to induce EpRE-regulated gene expressio...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of sulfur-containing chemopreventive agents, {{including}} <b>allyl</b> sulfides and <b>isothiocyanates,</b> on human redox networks. Isothiocyanates inhibited isolated redox-active enzymes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. As shown for the most active compound, benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), on thioredoxin reductase, the inhibition has an initial competitive part (Kis 6. 1 " 1. 0 mM) followed by a time-dependent irreversible inhibition (k 2 s 72. 8 " 25. 5 M- 1 s- 1). Also, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase were irreversibly modified by BITC. Sulforaphane led to irreversible inhibition of the studied redox enzymes, but with 5 – 10 times lower k 2 values. In contrast, allyl sulfides had only moderate effects on the tested enzymes. However, diallyl disulfide was found to react directly with reduced glutathione (k 2 s 100 M- 2 s- 1). This reaction might contribute to enhanced oxidative stress and the induction of the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase as determined on activity and transcript levels. All chemopreventive agents tested induced transcript levels of genes associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This upregulation {{was accompanied by a}} dose-dependent decrease in cell number. Our data indicate that modulation of cellular redox networks is likely to contribute to {{the effects of}} sulfur-containing chemopreventive agents...|$|R
50|$|<b>Allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> {{serves the}} plant {{as a defense}} against herbivores. Since it is harmful to the plant itself, it is stored in the {{harmless}} form of a glucosinolate, separate from the myrosinase enzyme. Once the herbivore chews the plant, the noxious <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> is produced. <b>Allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> is also responsible for the pungent taste of horseradish and wasabi. It can be produced synthetically, sometimes known as synthetic mustard oil.|$|E
50|$|The pungency of the {{condiment}} mustard {{results when}} {{ground mustard seeds}} are mixed with water, vinegar, or other liquid (or even when chewed). Under these conditions, a chemical reaction between the enzyme myrosinase and a glucosinolate known as sinigrin from the seeds of black mustard (Brassica nigra) or brown Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) produces <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate.</b> By distillation one can produce a very sharp-tasting essential oil, sometimes called volatile oil of mustard, containing more than 92% <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate.</b> The pungency of <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> {{is due to the}} activation of the TRPA1 ion channel in sensory neurons. White mustard (Brassica hirta) does not yield <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate,</b> but a different and milder isothiocyanate.|$|E

50|$|The product {{obtained}} {{in this fashion}} is sometimes known as synthetic mustard oil. <b>Allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> can also be liberated by dry distillation of the seeds. The {{product obtained}} in this fashion is known as volatile oil of mustard and is usually around 92% pure. It is used principally as a flavoring agent in foods.

5000|$|The great {{majority}} of allyl chloride is converted to epichlorohydrin. [...] Other commercially significant derivatives include allyl alcohol, allylamine, <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (synthetic mustard oil) and allylsilane.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} in wasabi {{that provides}} for its initial pungency is the volatile <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate,</b> which {{is produced by}} hydrolysis of natural thioglucosides (conjugates of the sugar glucose, and sulfur-containing organic compounds); the hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by myrosinase and occurs when the enzyme is released on cell rupture caused by maceration - e.g., grating - of the plant. The same compound {{is responsible for the}} pungency of horseradish and mustard. <b>Allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> can also be released when the wasabi plants have been damaged, because it is being used as a defense mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|All three allylamines, mono-, di-, and triallylamine, are {{produced}} by the treating allyl chloride with ammonia followed by distillation. [...] Pure samples can be prepared by hydrolysis of <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate.</b> [...] It behaves as a typical amine.|$|E

50|$|The {{characteristic}} pungent flavour {{of mustard}} oil {{is due to}} <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate.</b> Mustard oil has about 60% monounsaturated fatty acids (42% erucic acid and 12% oleic acid); it has about 21% polyunsaturated fats (6% the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and 15% the omega-6 linoleic acid), and it has about 12% saturated fats.|$|E
5000|$|An enzymatic {{reaction}} in the wet mustard powder produces a chemical called <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate,</b> which is absorbed through the skin as a transdermal drug. [...] It provides warmth and functions as a counterirritant, meaning that it stimulates nerve endings in the skin and thereby distracts the body from deeper-seated pain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (AITC) is the {{organosulfur}} compound {{with the}} formula CH2CHCH2NCS. This colorless oil {{is responsible for}} the pungent taste of mustard, radish, horseradish, and wasabi. This pungency and the lachrymatory effect of AITC are mediated through the TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels. It is slightly soluble in water, but more soluble in most organic solvents.|$|E
50|$|Isothiocyanate is the {{chemical}} group -N=C=S, formed by substituting the {{oxygen in the}} isocyanate group with a sulfur. Many natural isothiocyanates from plants are produced by enzymatic conversion of metabolites called glucosinolates. These natural isothiocyanates, such as <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate,</b> are also known as mustard oils. An artificial isothiocyanate, phenyl isothiocyanate, is used for amino acid sequencing in the Edman degradation.|$|E
5000|$|Russian mustard is a sharp, strong hot mustard, {{prepared}} from an Indian {{mustard seed}} and high acid (~6-9%) distilled white vinegar, with salt, sugar, and vegetable oil. Mustard flour is diluted {{with hot water}} in Russia, resulting in more efficient <b>allyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> production and thus a sharper taste. Indian mustard has less heat-sensitive glucosinolates, so hot water does not reduce the pungency.|$|E
