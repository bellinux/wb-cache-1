5|$|In the 19th century, a politico-economic {{discourse}} emerged. It concerned {{itself with}} distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying {{the place of}} Greek slavery. The influence of Marx is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery as <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production. The Positivists represented by the historian Eduard Meyer (Slavery in Antiquity, 1898) were soon to oppose the Marxist theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomenon, and not economic.|$|E

40|$|Seven prenylated 6 a-hydroxy-pterocapans {{and five}} prenylated 6 a, 11 a-pterocarpenes with {{different}} kinds of prenylation were purified from an ethanolic extract of fungus-treated soybean sprouts. The activity of these compounds toward both human estrogen receptors (hERα and hERβ) was determined in a yeast bioassay and the activity toward hERα was additionally tested in an U 2 -OS based hERα CALUX bioassay. In the yeast bioassay, compounds with chain prenylation showed in general <b>an</b> agonistic <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> action toward hERα, whereas furan and pyran prenylation led to <b>an</b> antagonistic <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> action. Five of these antagonistic compounds had <b>an</b> agonistic <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> action in the U 2 -OS based hERα CALUX bioassay, implying that these compounds can act as SERMs. The yeast bioassay also identified 8 ER subtype-selective compounds, with either <b>an</b> antagonistic <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> action or no response toward hERα and <b>an</b> agonistic <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> action toward hERβ. The ER subtype-selective compounds were characterized by 6 a-hydroxy-pterocarpan or 6 a, 11 a-pterocarpene backbone structure. It is suggested that either the extra D-ring or the increase in length to 12 - 13. 5 Å of these compounds is responsible for <b>an</b> agonistic <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> action toward hERβ and, thereby, inducing ER subtype-selective behavior. </p...|$|R

That year, Castro married Mirta Díaz Balart, a student from a wealthy family through whom he was exposed to the lifestyle of the Cuban elite. The relationship was a love match, disapproved of by both families. Mirta’s father gave them {{tens of thousands of}} dollars to spend in a three-month honeymoon in New York City, and the couple also received a U.S. $1,000 wedding gift from the military general and former president Fulgencio Batista, a friend of Mirta’s family. That same year, Grau decided not to stand for re-election, which was instead won by his Partido Auténticos new candidate, Carlos Prío Socarrás. Prío faced widespread protests when members of the MSR, now allied to the police force, assassinated Justo Fuentes, a self-educated black Cuban who was a prominent UIR member and friend of Castro's. In response, Prío agreed to quell the gangs, but found them too powerful to control.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{theories}} have emerged {{to explain the}} formation and evolution of the Jupiter trojans. The first suggests that the Jupiter trojans formed in the same part of the Solar System as Jupiter and entered their orbits while it was forming. The last stage of Jupiter's formation involved runaway growth of its mass through the accretion of large amounts of hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk; during this growth, which lasted for only about 10,000 years, the mass of Jupiter increased {{by a factor of}} ten. The planetesimals that had approximately the same orbits as Jupiter were caught by the increased gravity of the planet. The capture mechanism was very efficient—about 50% of all remaining planetesimals were trapped. This hypothesis has two major problems: the number of trapped bodies exceeds the observed population of Jupiter trojans by four orders of magnitude, and the present Jupiter trojan asteroids have larger orbital inclinations than are predicted by the capture model. Simulations of this scenario show that such <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> formation also would inhibit the creation of similar trojans for Saturn, and this has been borne out by observation: to date no trojans have been found near Saturn.|$|E
