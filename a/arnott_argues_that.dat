40|$|The debate {{surrounding}} oil and {{gas reserves}} estimates has been addressed by two new briefing papers jointly issued by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and the Sustainable Development Programme at Chatham House. The papers, Petroleum Reserves in Question by John Mitchell and Oil and Gas Reserves: Communication with the Financial Sector by Rob <b>Arnott,</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> a consistent framework for generating {{oil and gas}} oil reserves should be implemented to allow for better estimation, increased accuracy and therefore improved production and income potential. This paper was developed following an expert discussion workshop organized by Chatham House and the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies in June 2004. A companion paper (SDP BP 04 / 03) by John Mitchell, Petroleum Reserves in Question, was also developed from this workshop and {{is available on the}} Chatham House website www. chathamhouse. org. uk/sustainabledevelopment and the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies website www. oxfordenergy. or...|$|R
500|$|In {{a feature}} for 1UP.com, Jeremy Parish states that many Metroid fans were {{disappointed}} by the game's story, power-up restrictions and its [...] "awkward handling of its leading lady". Video game scholar Luke <b>Arnott</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> players were dissatisfied with Other M {{because it did not}} consistently balance gameplay constraints with player agency, and because it failed at what he calls “imperative” storytelling. Arnott suggested that studying how games like Other M create meaning in virtual spaces may help design better games and situate them within wider theories of postmodern subjectivity. Clyde Mandelin of Legends of Localization noted that the game received mixed-to-positive reactions from Japanese fans. Kotakus Luke Plunkett wrote that Team Ninja was blamed by [...] "many people" [...] for the game's story; Hayashi later clarified that Sakamoto wrote the story himself. Nintendo Treehouse producer Nate Bihldorff stated that the scene depicting Samus' encounter with Ridley [...] "is not a sign of weakness, but of strength. People who call out that scene as anything but empowering are kind of missing the point". He added that Samus' story [...] "has largely been a matter of individual perception, especially in the US, where people haven't read any of the official manga related to her childhood." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{technology}} use in early childhood: how we define new technologies; how technologies are shaping childhoods; {{and what we}} mean by play with technologies. We describe the contemporary landscapes, that have the potential to enrich children’s early experiences. We build on ecological explorations of technology use in the early years (Arnott, 2016); broadening understandings of technologies (Bers and Horn, 2010; Livingstone et al., 2015) and a decade-long progression of work on play in the digital age (Yelland, 1999; 2011). We adopt a framework of cultural capital (Bourdieu 1993, 1998) which postulates that educational centres play a critical and increasingly pervasive role in perpetuating the advantage of specific knowledge and skills that are valued by society across generations. The empirical elements of the paper used participant observation to create narratives of everyday practice (Mikos cited in Struppert 2011). Appropriate ethical consents were obtain and data disseminated in line with the EECERA Ethical Code (2015). The paper present three findings. We suggest that definitions of ‘new technologies’ must move beyond screen-based media to authentically capture their place in children’s lives (<b>Arnott,</b> 2017). We <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the multifaceted nature of technologies is altering the ways in which children learn (Karagiannidou 2017). We conclude with empirical examples of this shift in the learning process to describe how the nature of children’s play has become multimodal (Yelland and Gilbert 2017). The paper provides a theoretical foundation within which to position explorations of children’s use of new technologies as part of digital childhoods...|$|R
