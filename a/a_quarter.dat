5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> suspended or hanging, <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> climbing, and <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time.|$|E

5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third {{of his body}} and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over almost <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of his body and {{a small portion of}} his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E

The scattered disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material. A third of the scattered disc's population is likely to end up in the Oort cloud after 2.5billion years.|$|E
