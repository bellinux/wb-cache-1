5|$|From the {{conflicting}} {{accounts of the}} sources, historians have tried to reconstruct the most likely sequence of {{events leading up to}} the battle. It is probable that Olaf Tryggvason was indeed sailing from Wendland to Norway when he was ambushed, though the kings' sagas probably play up the importance of Thyri and her marriages. While it is possible that Olaf was collecting dowry, it seems more probable that he was expecting war <b>and</b> <b>seeking</b> allies in Wendland, but met with little success.
