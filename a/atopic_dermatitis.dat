5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It {{remains to be seen whether}} selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E

An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions {{are more likely to}} occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E
5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E

40|$|Hand {{dermatitis}} is {{a common}} condition seen in the primary care setting. Occupational exposures and frequent hand washing often lead to symptoms that are irritating and may cause discomfort. Irritant <b>dermatitis,</b> <b>atopic</b> hand <b>dermatitis</b> and contact hand dermatitis account for at least 70 % of all diagnoses. A unifying feature in most cases is an underlying disruption in the stratum corneum, altering its barrier function. Transepidermal water loss increases with barrier disruption and is exacerbated by additional exposure to water. Precise diagnosis and subsequent treatment present a considerable challenge, and hand dermatitis often becomes chronic. Initial treatment should be aimed at controlling inflammation and restoring the skin’s natural barrier. Common management recommendations include the avoidance of irritants and potential allergens along {{with the use of}} emollients and topical corticosteroids to de-crease inflammation. Simple petroleum-based emollients are very effective at restoring hydration and repairing the stratum corneum. Referral to a Dermatologist or an Allergist may be necessary for pa-tients who require patch testing or those with refractory symptoms. (J Am Board Fam Med 2009; 22 : 325 – 30.)

5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E

40|$|Ginseng roots (Panax ginseng CA Meyer) {{have been}} used {{traditionally}} for the treatment, especially prevention, of various diseases in China, Korea, and Japan. Both experimental and clinical studies suggest ginseng roots to have pharmacological effects in patients with life-style-related diseases such as non-insulin-dependent diabetic mellitus, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The topical use of ginseng roots to treat skin complaints including <b>atopic</b> suppurative <b>dermatitis,</b> wounds, and inflammation is also described in ancient Chinese texts; however, there have been relatively few studies in this area.

40|$|The vulvar skin in {{the adult}} {{comprises}} about {{one percent of the}} body surface and it is a highly specialised and adaptable skin. The competency of the vulvar and vaginal skin to withstand injury and infection is a remarkable feat of humankind. However, a number of allergic conditions may affect this region of the female body. The major symptomatology of vulvar disease can be summarised as pain, pruritus, swelling, local masses and dyspareunia and most of these are common in allergic diseases in this area. Symptoms of contact dermatitis include severe pruritus, swelling and usually a date of onset. Several causes of contact dermatitis are known, including allergy to condom contents. <b>Atopic</b> vulvar <b>dermatitis</b> is the vulvar component of systemic atopy and the vulva displays the symptoms of pruritus and burning.

40|$|Infective {{dermatitis}} {{associated with}} HTLV-I (IDH) is a chronic, recurrent, exudative eczema occurring in childhood {{which is considered}} to be a risk factor for the development of lymphoma and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. Skin biopsies from 19 patients with IDH were studied histologically and immunohistochemically using the following antibodies: anti-CD 3, CD 45 RO, CD 20, CD 79 a, CD 4, CD 8, CD 56, CD 57, TIA- 1, granzyme-B, and perforin. A chronic <b>dermatitis</b> similar to <b>atopic</b> and seborrheic <b>dermatitis</b> was observed in 15 cases, whereas architectural aspects mimicking mycosis fungoides were observed in the remaining four. The infiltrate consisted predominantly of CD 8 + lymphocytes and of CD 57 + cells in the dermis and epidermis. TIA- 1 and granzyme-B were expressed in 15 / 18 cases and 5 / 19 cases at the proportion of < or = 15 % and < or = 3 %, respectively. All cases were negative for perforin and CD 56. Like other dermatites, histologically IDH may represent a benign simulator of mycosis fungoides. IDH shows a predominance of CD 8 + cells and a low percentage of cells with cytotoxic granules, indicating that most CD 8 + lymphocytes are not activated. These findings differ from the immunohistochemical pattern of <b>atopic</b> and seborrheic <b>dermatitis,</b> possibly representing additional means of differentiation between IDH and these dermatites.

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} 10 years, whey {{proteins}} have received considerable {{attention in the}} area of functional foods and nutraceuticals. In this paper, a novel fermented whey protein-based product described as a gel-like Malleable Protein Matrix (MPM) has been tested for its anti-inflammatory activity. Preliminary in vitro results have already indicated that MPM could exert such an anti-inflammatory activity. Methods The systemic anti-inflammatory activity of the MPM was explored using the oxazolone-induced <b>atopic</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> mouse model (ACD). Parameters including ear thickness, side effects as well as neutrophil extravasation were monitored. Results In the ACD model, the MPM exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect comparable to that of hydrocortisone (positive control). Mice fed with MPM showed strong reduction of the ear inflammation while no side effects, as compared to hydrocortisone, were observed. The MPM seemed to reduce neutrophil extravasation in tissue as evidenced by blood polymorphonuclear cells and ear myeloperoxidase content. Conclusion The anti-inflammatory activity demonstrated in the ACD model suggests that the mechanism of action of the MPM is different than that of hydrocortisone and could become a relevant product for people suffering from dermatological manifestations associated with immune dysfunctions such as allergies, eczema, dermatitis, and autoimmune diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Most of the hypogammaglobulinemic {{patients}} have a clinical history {{in favor of}} allergic respiratory disease. Nevertheless, in these patients the importance and prevalence of atopic disorders have not been completely explained. Objectives: This study was aimed to evaluate <b>atopic</b> manifestations (<b>dermatitis,</b> allergic rhinitis and asthma) and pulmonary function in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients and Methods: We used the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire in forty-five patients diagnosed with hypogammaglobulinemia and spirometry was done in 41 patients older than 5 years. Results: Spirometry results were normal in 21 (51 %), and showed obstructive in 15 (37 %) and restrictive pattern in 5 (12 %) of the 41 patients who were evaluated. By {{the end of the}} study, asthma was diagnosed in nine (20 %) patients and other atopies (rhinitis and dermatitis) identified in 10 (22 %), and four (9 %), respectively. Conclusions: Atopic conditions should be investigated in the hypogammaglobulinemic patients and the prevalence in these patients may be higher than in normal population. Also, it is recommended to perform a pulmonary function test as a routine procedure in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and atopy should be assessed in these patients...|$|R
