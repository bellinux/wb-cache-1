5|$|In 1876, Chekhov's {{father was}} {{declared}} bankrupt after overextending his finances {{building a new}} house, having been cheated by a contractor called Mironov. To avoid debtor's prison he fled to Moscow, where his two eldest sons, Alexander and Nikolay, were attending university. The family lived in poverty in Moscow, Chekhov's mother physically <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> broken by the experience.

5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, far-reaching {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> focused therapy.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between achievement motivation and academic achievement with externalizing (i. e., aggressive, acting-out) and Internalizing (i. e., Immature withdrawal) <b>emotionally</b> <b>and</b> behaviorally handicapped children. Furthermore, the mean difference in academic achievement of externalizers and Internalizers was examined. Analysis of variance, regression analysis, and t-test procedures were employed to analyze the data. Eighty-two subjects, in grades two through six, currently enrolled In special education programs for <b>emotionally</b> <b>and</b> behaviorally handicapped children, participated in this study. The Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher's Report Form (TRF), and the resultant Child Behavior Profile (CBP) were used to differentiate between externalizing <b>and</b> internalizing <b>emotionally</b> <b>and</b> behaviorally handicapped children. Furthermore, the TRF yielded information on school performance and adaptive functioning. The Thematic Apperception Test of Need for Achievement (TAT), and the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R) were administered by the researcher to gather data on achievement motivation and academic achievement, respectively. In general, the children in this study showed little or no motivation for achievement. An analysis of variance, comparing externalizers and internalizers in achievement motivation was not significant. A regression analysis, controlling for Intelligence, showed no difference in achievement motivation between externalizers and internalizers. Knowledge of group membership (i. e., externalizing or internalizing) added little to the explained variance of academic achievement. After controlling for intelligence and achievement motivation, externalizers and internalizers showed no difference in mean academic achievement. On the basis of teacher ratings of adaptive functioning skills considered necessary for success In the classroom, more than 75 % of <b>emotionally</b> <b>and</b> behaviorally handicapped children were rated in the clinical range. More than two-thirds of the children were rated below average in school performance. T-tests revealed no difference between externalizers and internalizers in adaptive functioning skills or school performance. ConclusionsBased on the results of this study, the following conclusions were drawn:Emotionally and behaviorally handicapped children are generally lacking in motivation for achievement. Externalizing <b>emotionally</b> <b>and</b> behaviorally handicapped children, <b>and</b> Internalizing <b>emotionally</b> <b>and</b> behaviorally handicapped children do not differ in motivation for achievement. Achievement motivation and academic achievement are not significantly related with <b>emotionally</b> <b>and</b> behaviorally handicapped children. Externalizing <b>emotionally</b> <b>and</b> behaviorally handicapped children, <b>and</b> internalizing <b>emotionally</b> <b>and</b> behaviorally handicapped children show no difference in mean academic achievement. 5. <b>Emotionally</b> <b>and</b> behaviorally handicapped children are generally deficient in the adaptive functioning skills judged necessary for school success.

5|$|Process {{theology}} {{argues that}} God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels {{the pain of the}} world (both physically <b>and</b> <b>emotionally)</b> and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world. Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.|$|E

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1945 several hundred {{veterans}} of the battle were detached from operations in Norway and returned to Arnhem {{to take part in}} filming for the war movie Theirs Is the Glory. While there they attended the first commemorative event at the cemetery. This event continued every year, and was attended by veterans, local residents and over 1000 school children who laid flowers on the graves of the dead. After the 25th anniversary in 1969, the Parachute Regiment approached Dutch organisers to suggest ending the ceremony, believing the battle to have passed sufficiently into history. The Dutch were vehemently <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> opposed to the idea and thus the ceremony continues to be held annually.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, and suggests that all the victims are both psychologically <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E

A secondary staging {{in the video}} presents Madonna standing or sitting near a television set in a room (lit by a single light source from above), while a third staging depicts Madonna writhing around on a bed in her underwear as she watches Muñoz on the television. In the bullring, the torero kills the bull and then comes home and physically <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> abuses Madonna. The video {{can be viewed as}} a statement on classicism, supposing the bullfighter feels threatened and angered by the aristocrat's station, resulting in his physically abusing and then coldly abandoning her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 20th century Janáček {{composed}} choral church music including Otčenáš (Our Father, 1901), Constitutes (1903) and Ave Maria (1904). In 1901 the first part of his piano cycle On an Overgrown Path was published, and gradually became one of his most frequently performed works. In 1902 Janáček visited Russia twice. On the first occasion he took his daughter Olga to St.Petersburg, where she stayed to study Russian. Only three months later, he returned to St. Petersburg with his wife because Olga had become very ill. They took her back to Brno, but her health worsened. Janáček expressed his painful feelings for his daughter in a new work, his opera Jenůfa, in which the suffering of his daughter had transfigured into Jenůfa's. When Olga died in February 1903, Janáček dedicated Jenůfa to her memory. The opera was performed in Brno in 1904, with reasonable success, but Janáček felt this was no more than a provincial achievement. He aspired to recognition by the more influential Prague opera, but Jenůfa was refused there (twelve years passed before its first performance in Prague). Dejected <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> exhausted, Janáček went to Luhačovice spa to recover. There he met Kamila Urválková, whose love story supplied the theme for his next opera, Osud (Destiny).|$|E
5|$|Torres forms a {{friendship}} with Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), the hospital's new chief of cardiothoracic surgery. The two embark on a relationship when Hahn jokingly kisses Torres in an elevator to tease Sloan. Neither has been with another woman before, and Torres struggles with her bisexuality, and cheats on her with Sloan. She is initially forgiven, but after an argument about work, Hahn resigns from Seattle Grace, ending their relationship. New pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) kisses her, and they begin dating. Their relationship is tested when Torres comes out to her father, Carlos, who disowns her, cutting her off both financially <b>and</b> <b>emotionally.</b> When she is not granted a position as an attending, she publicly berates the chief, Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), and resigns from her post. She begins working at the neighboring Mercy West hospital, and when the two hospitals merge, she is promoted to an attending surgeon. Torres' father returns yet again, to condemn her, but ultimately accepts her sexuality. When Torres explains her desire to bear children, Robbins expresses disappointment, and their differing stances on the matter lead them to break up. Soon thereafter, a gunman commits mass murder at the hospital, and, relieved to have survived, Torres and Robbins reconcile, with Robbins agreeing {{that they should have}} children together.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, deHavilland {{appeared}} in William Wyler's period drama The Heiress (1949), the fourth {{in a string}} of critically acclaimed performances. After seeing the play on Broadway, deHavilland called Wyler and urged him to fly to New York to see what she felt would be a perfect role for her. Wyler obliged, loved the play, and with deHavilland's help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights. Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel Washington Square by Henry James, the film is about a young naïve woman who {{falls in love with a}} young man, over the objections of her cruel <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> abusive father, who suspects the young man of being a fortune seeker. As she had done in Hold Back the Dawn, deHavilland portrayed her character's transformation from a shy, trusting innocent to a guarded, mature woman over a period of years. Her delineation of Catherine Sloper is developed through carefully crafted movements, gestures, and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman. Her timid voice, nervous hands, downcast eyes, and careful movements all communicate what the character is too shy to verbalize. Throughout the production, Wyler pressed deHavilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character. When Catherine returns home after being jilted, the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books up the stairs to convey the weight of Catherine's trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script. The Heiress was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics. For her performance, she received the New York Film Critics Award, the Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actressher second Oscar.|$|E
