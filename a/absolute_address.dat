6000|$|I am ravished by {{your letter}} {{after reading the}} play (keep it locked up, safe and secret, though there are three or four copies in existence) which makes me feel as {{if there had been}} a triumphant premi√®re and I had {{received}} overtures from every managerial quarter and had only to count my gold. At any rate I am delighted that you have been struck with it exactly as I have tried to strike, and that the pure practical character of the effort has worked its calculated spell upon you. For what encourages me in the whole business is that, as the piece stands, there is not, in its felicitous form, the ghost of a [...] "fluke" [...] or a mere chance: it is all [...] "art" [...] and an <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> of means to the end--the end, viz., of meeting exactly the immediate, actual, intense British conditions, both subjective and objective, and of acting in (to a minute, including entr'actes) 2 hours and 3/4. Ergo, I can do a dozen more infinitely better; and I am excited to think how much, since the writing of this one piece has been an education to me, a little further experience will do for me. Also I am sustained by the sense, on the whole, that though really superior acting would help it immensely, yet mediocrity of handling (which is all, at the best, I am pretty sure, that it will get) won't and can't kill it, and that there may be even something sufficiently general and human about it, to make it (given its eminent actability) [...] "keep the stage," [...] even after any first vogue it may have had has passed away. That fate--in the poverty-stricken condition of the English repertory--would mean profit indeed, and an income to my descendants. But one mustn't talk of this kind of thing yet. However, since you have been already so deeply initiated, I think I will enclose (keep it sacredly for me) an admirable letter I have just received from the precious Balestier in whose hands, as I wrote you, I placed the settlement of the money-question, the terms of the writing agreement with Compton. Compton saw him on Monday last--and I send the letter mainly to illustrate the capital intelligence and competence of Balestier and show you in what good hands I am. He will probably strike you, as he strikes me, as the perfection of an [...] "agent"--especially when you consider that he has undertaken this particular job out of pure friendship. Everything, evidently, will be well settled--on the basis, of course, which can't be helped, of production in London only about the middle of next year. But by that time I hope to have done a good bit more work--and I shall be beguiled by beginning to follow, in the autumn, the rehearsals for the country production. Keep Balestier's letter till I come back--I shall get another one from him in a day or two with the agreement to sign.... These castles in Spain are at least exhilarating: in a certain sense I should like you very much to communicate to William your good impression of the drama--but on the whole I think you had better not, for the simple reason that it is very important it shouldn't be talked about (especially so long) in advance--and it wouldn't be safe, inasmuch as every whisper gets into the papers--and in some fearfully vulgarized and perverted form. You might hint to William that you have read the piece under seal of secresy to me and think so-and-so of it--but are so bound (to me) not to give a sign that he must bury what you tell him in tenfold mystery. But I doubt if even this would be secure--it would be in the Transcript the next week.|$|E
5000|$|JMP: all 13 bits {{are used}} as an <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> in program memory.|$|E
50|$|The link field {{contains}} a pointer to the previously defined word. The pointer {{may be a}} relative displacement or an <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> that points to the next oldest sibling.|$|E
50|$|This {{addressing}} mode {{is closely related}} to the indexed <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing</b> mode.|$|R
5000|$|Cell names {{beginning}} with a letter are regional, and are <b>absolute</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In the Amiga, {{the only}} <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> {{in the system}} is hex $0000 0004 (memory {{location}} 4), which contains the start location called SysBase, a pointer to exec.library, the so-called kernel of Amiga.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{relative}} addressing scheme, {{to obtain an}} <b>absolute</b> <b>address,</b> the relevant base address is taken and offset (aka displacement) is added to it. Under this type of scheme, the base address is the lowest numbered address within a prescribed range, to facilitate adding related positive-valued offsets.|$|E
50|$|Bit 9, Change Fields, {{inhibits}} the <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> from referencing {{a different}} field thanthe one containing the instruction. When bit 8 is 1, the upper accumulator K is used withthe instruction, otherwise the lower accumulator J is used. When bit 7 is 1, indirectaddressing is used, otherwise direct addressing is used.|$|E
50|$|The most {{significant}} bit of all relative and <b>absolute</b> <b>addresses</b> is used to indicate indirection.|$|R
5000|$|BCFR and BCFA: branch on {{condition}} False (zero, greater-than or less-than) with relative or <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing.</b>|$|R

50|$|In simple layouts, {{programs}} {{begin their}} execution at the beginning, which {{is common in}} scripting languages, simple binary executable formats, and boot loaders. In other cases, the entry point is at some other fixed point, which is some memory address than can be an <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> or relative address (offset).|$|E
50|$|A one byte offset, {{such as the}} {{hexadecimal}} ASCII {{value of}} a character (e.g. X'29') {{can be used to}} point to an alternative integer value (or index) in an array (e.g. X'01'). In this way, characters can be very efficiently translated from 'raw data' to a usable sequential index and then to an <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> without a lookup table.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} engineering and low-level programming (such as assembly language), an offset usually denotes {{the number of}} address locations added to a base address {{in order to get}} to a specific <b>absolute</b> <b>address.</b> In this (original) meaning of offset, only the basic address unit, usually the 8-bit byte, is used to specify the offset's size. In this context an offset is sometimes called a relative address.|$|E

5000|$|... 's bit {{format is}} like the register-relative loads and stores. Like them, [...] {{can be used with}} the {{instructions}} which set the upper 20 bits of a base register in order to make 32-bit branches, either to an <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> (using [...] ) or a PC-relative one (using [...] for position-independent code). (Using a constant zero base address allows single-instruction calls to a small (the offset), fixed positive or negative address.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> {{addressing}} mode {{can only be}} used with static variables, {{because those are the}} only kinds of variables whose location is known by the compiler at compile time. When the program (executable or library) is loaded into memory, static variables are stored in the data segment of the program's [...] address space (if initialized), or the BSS segment (if uninitialized), and are stored in corresponding sections of object files prior to loading.|$|E
5000|$|A two-byte {{instruction}} specialized {{for program}} looping {{is new to}} the Z80. DJNZ (Decrement Jump if Non-Zero) takes a signed 8-bit displacement as an immediate operand. The B register is decremented. If the result is nonzero then program execution jumps relative to {{the address of the}} PC plus the displacement. The flags remain unaltered. To perform an equivalent loop on an 8080 would require separate decrement and jump (to a two-byte <b>absolute</b> <b>address)</b> instructions, and the flag register would be altered.|$|E

50|$|The {{language}} {{provides for}} (limited) single-processor concurrency (monitors, coroutines and explicit transfer of control) and for hardware access (<b>absolute</b> <b>addresses,</b> bit manipulation, and interrupts). It uses a nominal type system.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} example {{describes an}} indirect {{way to address}} to a memory location in the format of segment:offset. For example, assume we want to refer to memory location 0xF867. One way {{this can be accomplished}} is by first defining a segment with beginning address 0xF000, and then defining an offset of 0x0867. Further, we are also allowed to shift the hexadecimal segment to reach the final absolute memory address. One thing to note here is that we can reach our final <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> in many ways.|$|E
50|$|Each jump {{operation}} has three different forms, {{depending on the}} size of the operand. A short jump uses an 8-bit signed operand, which is a relative offset from the current instruction. A near jump is similar to a short jump but uses a 16-bit signed operand (in real or protected mode) or a 32-bit signed operand (in 32-bit protected mode only). A far jump is one that uses the full segment base:offset value as an <b>absolute</b> <b>address.</b> There are also indirect and indexed forms of each of these.|$|E
50|$|This {{of course}} is not {{possible}} for distributed systems since an (<b>absolute)</b> <b>address</b> - in the caller's address space - is normally meaningless to the remote program (however, a relative address might in fact be usable if the receiver had an exact copy of, at least some of, the sender's memory in advance). Web browsers and web servers are examples of processes that communicate by message passing. A URL {{is an example of}} a way of referencing resources that does not depend on exposing the internals of a process.|$|E
50|$|On many RISC machines, {{register}} 0 {{is fixed}} at the value zero. If register 0 {{is used as}} the base register, this becomes an example of <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing.</b> However, {{only a small portion}} of memory can be accessed (64 kilobytes, if the offset is 16 bits).|$|R
50|$|While {{embedded}} instruction sets such as Thumb {{suffer from}} extremely high register pressure {{because they have}} small register sets, general-purpose RISC ISAs like MIPS and Alpha enjoy low register pressure. CISC ISAs like x86-64 offer low register pressure despite having smaller register sets. This {{is due to the}} many addressing modes and optimizations (such as sub-register addressing, memory operands in ALU instructions, <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing,</b> PC-relative addressing, and register-to-register spills) that CISC ISAs offer.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the branch}} {{instructions}} using <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing</b> used all 15 {{bits of the}} address field as address. Using such a branch instruction was, therefore, {{the only way to}} set the two bits in the page register (controlling bits 14 and 13 of the address bus) and changing the current 8 KB page.|$|R
5000|$|Far {{pointers}} are 32 bit pointer {{containing a}} segment and an offset. To use them the segment register ES {{is used by}} using the instruction [...] They may reference up to 1024 KB or 1088 KB of memory. Note that pointer arithmetic (addition and subtraction) does not modify the segment portion of the pointer, only its offset. Operations which exceed the bounds of zero or 65535 (0xFFFF) will undergo modulo 64K operation just as any normal 16 bit operation. The moment counter becomes (0x10000), the resulting <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> will roll over to 0x5000:0000.|$|E
50|$|In computing, position-independent code (PIC) or position-independent {{executable}} (PIE) {{is a body}} {{of machine}} code that, being placed somewhere in the primary memory, executes properly regardless of its <b>absolute</b> <b>address.</b> PIC is commonly used for shared libraries, so that the same library code can be loaded in a location in each program address space where it will not overlap any other uses of memory (for example, other shared libraries). PIC was also used on older computer systems lacking an MMU, so that the operating system could keep applications {{away from each other}} even within the single address space of an MMU-less system.|$|E
50|$|Position {{independent}} functions accessing {{global data}} start by determining the <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> of the GOT given their own current program counter value. This often {{takes the form}} of a fake function call in order to obtain the return value on stack (x86) or in a special register (PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, probably at least some other RISC processors, ESA/390), which can then be stored in a predefined standard register. Some processor architectures, such as the Motorola 68000, Motorola 6809, WDC 65C816, Knuth's MMIX, ARM and x86-64 allow referencing data by offset from the program counter. This is specifically targeted at making position-independent code smaller, less register demanding and hence more efficient.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, ZPAQ {{will use}} an E8E9 {{transform}} {{to improve the}} compression of x86 code typically found in [...]exe and [...]dll files. An E8E9 transform scans for CALL and JMP instructions (opcodes E8 and E9 hex) and replaces their relative <b>addresses</b> with <b>absolute</b> <b>addresses.</b> Then it inserts code into the PCOMP section to perform the inverse transform.|$|R
50|$|The 8061 had a 240-byte {{internal}} register file, from address 0010H to 00FFH.I/O addresses {{were from}} 0002H to 000FH. Throughout the 8061 family, address 0000H {{was reserved for}} a constant ZERO register. This permitted use of relative <b>addressing</b> to access <b>absolute</b> <b>addresses.</b> The stack pointer was at 00010H.8061 could address 64K of memory.Reset was to 2000H.Interrupt vectors were at 2010H.|$|R
50|$|The {{effective}} <b>address</b> for an <b>absolute</b> instruction <b>address</b> is {{the address}} parameter itself with no modifications.|$|R
