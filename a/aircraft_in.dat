5|$|To {{perform the}} inspection, the robot has to {{navigate}} around the aircraft {{and get to}} the checkpoints called up in the aircraft virtual model.

To do this, the robot is able to locate itself, either with the laser data from its laser range finders, or with image data from its cameras.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} special paint {{jobs have been}} carried out. In the mid-1990s, SAS started a scheme to cover MD-80 in single colors {{overlaid}} with small, white aircraft silhouettes, but the project was abandoned after two aircraft.

Similarly a Copenhagen '96 scheme was pained for Copenhagen's term as the European Capital of Culture. Since 2002, SAS has painted selected <b>aircraft</b> <b>in</b> a Star Alliance livery.

5|$|Also {{aiding the}} B-1's {{survivability}} is its relatively low radar cross-section (RCS).

40|$|For {{the problem}} that the airport video {{monitoring}} could only provide the image information while the label information including the flight number is not provided, a new method for automatically labeling <b>aircrafts</b> <b>in</b> airport video through the fusion of video and ADS-B data has been proposed. First, the image coordinates of aircrafts will be obtained through the image tracking of video. Then, the homography matrix between two projection planes will be calculated with the four and above point and line correspondences selected from the airport map and video image, respectively to the map image coordinates into the map coordinates. Finally, the <b>aircrafts</b> <b>in</b> video can be automatically labeled through the fusion of image tracking data and ADS-B monitoring data. Because an image coordinate measurement error exists {{at the time of}} selecting points from the image, the resulting coordinate conversion error is derived and the impact of point correspondence geometric layout on mesh coordinate mapping error is analyzed. Experiments have been conducted based on the actual data of Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport. The results show that the method can automatically label <b>aircrafts</b> <b>in</b> video in an effective way...|$|R
