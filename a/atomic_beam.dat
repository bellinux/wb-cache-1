[...] The Ewald sphere construction {{will determine the}} diffracted beams {{to be seen and}} the scattering angles at which they will appear.

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} to using helium atoms {{as compared with}} x-rays, neutrons, and electrons to probe a surface and study its structures and phonon dynamics. [...] As mentioned previously, the lightweight helium atoms at thermal energies do not penetrate into {{the bulk of the}} material being studied. [...] This means that in addition to being strictly surface-sensitive they are truly non-destructive to the sample. [...] Their de Broglie wavelength is also on the order of the interatomic spacing of materials, making them ideal probing particles. [...] Since they are neutral, helium atoms are insensitive to surface charges. [...] As a noble gas, the helium atoms are chemically inert. [...] When used at thermal energies, as is the usual scenario, the helium <b>atomic</b> <b>beam</b> is an inert probe (chemically, electrically, magnetically, and mechanically). [...] It is therefore capable of studying the surface structure and dynamics {{of a wide variety of}} materials, including those with reactive or metastable surfaces. [...] A helium atom beam can even probe surfaces in the presence of electromagnetic fields and during ultra-high vacuum surface processing without interfering with the ongoing process. [...] Because of this, helium atoms can be useful to make measurements of sputtering or annealing, and adsorbate layer depositions. [...] Finally, because the thermal helium atom has no rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom and no available electronic transitions, only the translational kinetic energy of the incident and scattered beam need be analyzed in order to extract information about the surface.|$|E

We propose a vibrant factor F to quantitatively describe {{the effects of}} <b>atomic</b> <b>beams</b> vibrations. It shows that: (i) the vibrant factor F depends on the relative vibrant displacements and the initial phases rather than the absolute amplitudes, (ii) the factor F increases with the increase of the initial phases, and (iii) the frequencies can be derived from equal time interval measurement of the mean atomic numbers. These results imply {{that it is possible to}} detect the vibrations of micro amplitudes and low frequencies by measuring the variations of mean atomic numbers.
