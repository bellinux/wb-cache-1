A special blank rifle cartridge was loaded and was triggered by pulling a lanyard, and fired into <b>an</b> <b>igniter</b> {{at the base of}} the mortar chamber, igniting the propellant charge and launching the bomb.|$|E
2500|$|The K 39 used {{a three-part}} bagged charge that weighed {{a total of}} [...] The K 39/41 used a bagged charge with a total weight of [...] The base charge (Kleine Ladung) weighed [...] and had <b>an</b> <b>igniter</b> {{stitched}} to its base. The two increments (Vorkart) were lightly stitched together and enclosed in another bag tied {{at the top and}} with another igniter stitched to the base. The medium charge (Mittlere Ladung) consisted of the base charge and increment 2 while the full charge (Grosse Ladung) consisted of the base charge and both increments. The increments were loaded before the base charge.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem in}} the igniter fuel lines was not {{detected}} during ground testing because a stainless steel mesh covering [...] the fuel line became saturated with liquid air due to the extreme cold of the liquid hydrogen flowing through it. The liquid air damped a vibration mode that became evident when tests were conducted in a vacuum after the Apollo 6 flight. This was also a simple fix, involving replacing the flexible bellows section where the break occurred with a loop of stainless steel pipe. The S-IVB used the same J-2 engine design as the S-II {{and so it was}} decided that <b>an</b> <b>igniter</b> line problem had also stopped the third stage from reigniting in Earth orbit. [...] Ground testing confirmed that the slight underperformance seen in the first S-IVB burn was consistent with damage to the igniter line.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} status of ignition {{system for the}} new cryogenic upper stage engine Vinci is presented. The concept differs from existing upper stage ignition systems as its functioning is engine independent. The system consists of <b>a</b> spark torch <b>igniter,</b> <b>a</b> highpressure <b>igniter</b> feed system and <b>an</b> exciter.

That year they {{performed}} {{the first of four}} sold-out reunion shows that drew a total of 3,000 loyal fans from all over the U.S. Reinvigorated, they reunited on a permanent basis in 2010, and have been playing at festivals, clubs and casinos all over the tri-state region.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> coaxial <b>igniter</b> {{consists}} of <b>a</b> fully insulated conductor, covered by four strips of aluminum foil. All {{of this is}} further insulated in a tube about 1.6 cm in diameter that is perforated with small holes. The idea is to use an electrical flow through the conductor and then exploding the flow into vapor and then breaking it down into plasma. Consequently, the plasma escapes through the constant perforations throughout the insulating tube and initiates the surrounding propellant. <b>A</b> TCPI <b>igniter</b> is fitted in individual propellant cases for each piece of ammunition. However, TCPI is no longer considered a viable method of propellant ignition because it may damage the fins and does not deliver energy as efficiently as <b>a</b> FLARE <b>igniter.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "stick grenade" [...] {{commonly}} {{refers to}} the German Model 24 Stielhandgranate stick grenade introduced in 1915 and developed throughout World War I. <b>A</b> friction <b>igniter</b> was used; this method was uncommon in other countries but widely used for German grenades.|$|R

5000|$|An arc is the {{discharge}} {{that occurs when}} a gas is ionized. A high voltage is pulsed across the lamp to [...] "ignite" [...] or [...] "strike" [...] the arc, after which {{the discharge}} can be maintained at a lower voltage.

50|$|There {{are three}} methods of combustion: Dry forward, reverse and wet combustion. Dry forward uses <b>an</b> <b>igniter</b> to {{set fire to}} the oil. As the fire {{progresses}} the oil is pushed away from the fire toward the producing well. In reverse the air injection and the ignition occur from opposite directions. In wet combustion water is injected just behind the front and turned into steam by the hot rock. This quenches the fire and spreads the heat more evenly.|$|E
5000|$|In {{practical}} designs {{there is}} no need for a continuous ignition system [...] - [...] the combustion zone is never totally purged of combustion gases and free radicals, so there is enough chemical action in the residue in the combustion zone to act as <b>an</b> <b>igniter</b> for the next blast once the mixture is up to a reasonable density and pressure: the cycle repeats, controlled only by the synchronization of pressure and flow events in the two ducts.|$|E

It utilizes the oxygen consumption principle and is accepted as the most suitable tool for heat release rate measurements.

5000|$|Sandia's {{chemical}} and materials analysis group, headed by James Borders, investigated further the theory about <b>a</b> chemical <b>igniter.</b> Navy technicians {{stated that the}} discovery under the center gun's projectile's rotating band of minute steel-wool fibers that were encrusted with calcium and chlorine, a fragment of polyethylene terephthalate (commonly used in plastic bags), and different glycols, including brake fluid, hypochlorite, antifreeze, and Brylcreem together indicated the use of <b>a</b> chemical <b>igniter.</b> The Navy was unable to locate the steel-wool fiber evidence for Borders to examine. No untouched portions of the rotating band remained and Sandia was provided with a section to examine {{that had already been}} examined by the FBI. Borders' team examined the rotating band and did not find any traces of polyethylene terephthalate. The team found that the glycols present actually came from the Break-Free cleaning solution which had been dumped into the center gun's barrel to help free the projectile after the explosion. The team also found that calcium and chlorine were present in Iowas other gun turrets and in the gun turrets of the other Iowa-class battleships, and that this was indicative of routine exposure to a maritime environment. Borders concluded that ordinary sources accounted for all of the [...] "foreign materials" [...] found by the Navy on the center gun projectile, and that the theory that <b>a</b> chemical <b>igniter</b> had been used to cause the explosion was extremely doubtful.|$|R
