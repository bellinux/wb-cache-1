50|$|Substance abuse {{can be a}} major {{contributing}} factor to child abuse. One U.S. study found that parents with documented substance abuse, most commonly alcohol, cocaine, and heroin, {{were much more likely}} to mistreat their children, and were also much more likely to reject court-ordered services and treatments. Another study found that over two-thirds of cases of child maltreatment involved parents with substance abuse problems. This study specifically found relationships between alcohol and physical abuse, and between cocaine and sexual abuse. Also parental stress caused by substance increases the likelihood of the minor exhibiting internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Although the abuse victim does not always realize the abuse is wrong, the internal confusion can lead to chaos. Inner anger turns to outer frustration. Once aged 17/18, drink and drugs are used to numb the hurt feelings, nightmares and daytime flashbacks. <b>Acquisitive</b> <b>crimes</b> to pay for the chemicals are inevitable if the victim is unable to find employment.|$|R

Whilst it is recognised that <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime</b> is often related to drug use, {{this is the first}} capture-recapture study to incorporate <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime</b> data. In further sensitivity analyses the proportion of <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime</b> assumed to be drug-related was varied from 25 – 60 %. The main analysis provided an estimated prevalence of problem drug use in Norfolk of 2. 05 % (95 % confidence interval: 1. 66 %– 2. 56 %) for ages 15 – 54 years, considerably higher than the 1. 1 % currently suggested for the UK. Sensitivity analyses based on varied matching and postcode criteria produced estimates ranging from 2. 41 %– 3. 37 %, suggesting our estimate may be conservative. Sensitivity analyses assuming that 25 – 60 % of acquisitive crimes were drug-related, produced estimates ranging from 2. 02 % to 5. 73 %, further supporting our main analysis.

Media reports both inform and enhance public attitudes toward a host of social issues - particularly criminal justice. From ‘name and shame’ to ‘holiday camp prisons’, newspaper reports about {{the criminal justice system}} are increasingly setting the course of public debate, impacting upon societal responses to crime, political discourse of crime control, and penal policy. Data were extracted from a database search of British national press reports about convicted cases of sexual, violent, and <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime.</b> Newspaper articles about convicted cases of sexual, violent, and acquisitive crimes were sourced through the LexisNexis Library from August-November 2013.

A nine-times over-representation of sexual crime, a two-and-a-half-times over-representation of violent crime, and a four-and-a-half-times under-representation of <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime</b> was found in the article sample compared with official crime statistics. These over- and under-representations were accompanied by significantly higher levels of negativity and anger in the sexual crime article subsample compared to articles about both violent and <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime.</b> Tabloid headlines about sexual crime were more offensive than those from broadsheets.

40|$|Many {{people today}} believe {{the concept of}} gender {{inequality}} is outmoded, irrelevant and unnecessary in Western societies that are deemed egalitarian. As a consequence, feminism as a movement with gender equality at its core has often been proclaimed ‘dead’,a relic of the past. Feminist perspectives, nevertheless, have produced differing points of view about the sources of gender inequality affecting crime rates and criminal behaviour. For the last 50 years or so, women and girls {{have been the subject}} of criminological research that has largely evolved from sociological perspectives and specifically from feminism. Although gender intersects with other social realities and disadvantages, it is a crucial factor in relation to offending behaviour. A substantial body of feminist literature confirmed that marginality and poverty are factors leading to female criminality. Using a sequential explanatory mixed methods design, this research explores the consequences of gender inequalities affecting older indigent Australian women convicted of <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crimes.</b> This thesis argues that the term ‘feminism’, and feminist discourse and communications, ought to be abandoned in favour of advancing the human rights framework in the 21 st century. Stigma associated with the feminist label has been detrimental. The most significant finding in this research is that financial need rather than greed was a precursor to older women’s involvement in <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crimes.</b> Having primary custody of children after divorce and relying on welfare support were factors contributing to their impoverished status. The feminisation of poverty, the segregation of women into low-paid feminine occupations and an accumulation of disadvantages over the life course often contribute to women’s impoverishment in their later years. Potentially, law-abiding older women are put at risk of transgressing the law for the first time later in their lives to alleviate their poverty. From a human rights perspective, violations of the women’s rights were factors contributing to their offending behaviour. Gender inequality, a condition that disadvantages women, however, is alive and well in Australia as confirmed here and is an unrelenting feature of many male-dominated social structures throughout the world today. Since a great deal of negativity surrounds the feminist label, it would be more pragmatic to abandon the feminist label and adopt a human rights approach...|$|R
40|$|Foreword Despite {{significant}} {{reductions in}} recent years, <b>acquisitive</b> property <b>crime</b> remains {{the single largest}} crime category, with over 700, 000 offences recorded annually by police in Australia. There is potential to further reduce the scale of such offending and the subsequent costs to society by focusing attention {{on the design of}} frequently stolen consumer products in order to reduce their vulnerability to theft. While there is a variety of ways of engaging with manufacturers, government regulation may ultimately be required if other approaches prove unsuccessful. This paper examines the lessons that can be learned {{as a result of the}} regulation of motor manufacturers to install electronic immobilisers on all new cars from July 2001, which has contributed to significant reductions in vehicle crime over the past decade. Eight generic lessons for future regulation of crime prevention design in consumer products are outlined. These lessons should assist policymakers to identify how the costs incurred by the criminal justice system in dealing with <b>acquisitive</b> property <b>crime</b> could be shifted to manufacturers, who arguably contribute to the problem by the way they design and market their consumer products...|$|R

40|$|Substance use has {{an effect}} on an individual's {{propensity}} to commit <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime</b> with recent studies showing substance users more likely to leave forensic material at a crime scene. An examination of <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime</b> solved in Northamptonshire, U. K., during 2006 enabled 70 crime scene behavior characteristics to be analyzed for substance and nonsubstance use offenders. Logistical regression analyses have identified statistically significant crime scene behavior predictors that were found to be either present at or absent from the crime scene when the offender was a substance user. Most significant predictors present were indicative of a lack of preparation by the offender, irrational behavior, and a desire to steal high value, easily disposed of, property. Most significant predictors absent from the crime scene were indicative of more planning, preparation, and execution by the offender. Consideration is given to how this crime scene behavior might be used by police investigators to identify offenders...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the patterns of}} <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime</b> during methadone maintenance treatment among chronic, treatment-resistant heroin users eligible for heroin assisted treatment in the Netherlands. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the type and number of illegal activities during 1 month of standard methadone maintenance treatment in 51 patients {{prior to the start}} of heroin assisted treatment. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview focussed on crime with special emphasis on property crime. Volume analyses consisted of frequencies and descriptives of mean numbers of offences per day and per type. RESULTS: In a Dutch population of problematic drug users eligible for and prior to commencing heroin assisted treatment, 70 % reported criminal activities and 50 % reported acquisitive crimes. Offending took place on 20. 5 days per month with on average 3. 1 offences a day. <b>Acquisitive</b> <b>crime</b> consisted mainly of shoplifting (mean 12. 8 days, 2. 2 times/day) and theft of bicycles (mean 5. 8 days, 2. 4 times/day); theft from a vehicle and burglaries were committed less frequently. The majority of these patients (63 %) reported to have started offending in order to acquire illicit drugs and alcohol. CONCLUSION: During methadone maintenance treatment, 50 % of criminally active, problematic heroin users eligible for heroin assisted treatment reported <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime.</b> Shoplifting, thefts and/or other property crimes were committed on average two to three times on a crime day. This study discusses that the detail provided by self-reported crime data can improve cost estimates in economic evaluations of heroin assisted treatmen...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAimTo {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between testing positive for opiates and/or cocaine and prior offending. Methods 139, 925 persons (107, 573 men) identified from a saliva test for opiate and cocaine metabolites following arrest in England and Wales, 1 April 2005 – 31 March 2009, were case-linked with 2 -year recorded offending history. The prior offending rate, accounting for estimated incarceration periods, was calculated by: drug-test outcome; gender; four main <b>crime</b> categories (<b>acquisitive,</b> non-acquisitive, serious acquisitive, and non-serious acquisitive) and 16 sub-categories. Rate ratio (RR) compared opiate and/or cocaine positive to dual-negative testers. Adjusted rate ratio (aRR) controlled for age at drug test. ResultsThe relationship between testing positive for opiates and cocaine and prior 2 -year offending was greater for women than men (aRR men 1. 77; 95 % CI: 1. 75 – 1. 79 : women 3. 51; 3. 45 – 3. 58). The association was weaker for those testing positive for opiates only (aRR: men: 1. 66, 1. 64 – 1. 68; women 2. 73, 2. 66 – 2. 80). Men testing positive for cocaine only had a lower rate of prior offending (aRR: 0. 93, 0. 92 – 0. 94), women had a higher rate (aRR: 1. 69, 1. 64 – 1. 74). The strongest associations were for non-serious <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crimes</b> (e. g. dually-positive: prostitution (women-only) : aRR 24. 9, 20. 9 – 29. 7; shoplifting: aRR men 4. 05, 3. 95 – 4. 16; women 6. 16, 5. 92 – 6. 41). Testing positive for opiates and cocaine was associated with violent offences among women (aRR: 1. 54, 1. 40 – 1. 69) but not men (aRR: 0. 98, 0. 93 – 1. 02). ConclusionsAmong drug-tested offenders, opiate use is associated with elevated prior offending and the association is stronger for women than men. Cocaine use is associated with prior offending only among women...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To determine: (a) whether Scottish {{drug users}} on {{methadone}} maintenance use heroin less frequently {{than their peers}} following other forms of drug treatment; and (b) to what extent those on methadone maintenance ‘top up’ with heroin. Design A cohort study followed-up for 33 months from 2001 to 2004. Methods Four hundred and ten interviewees who responded at all four interview sweeps, recruited as new treatment entrants from 28 drug treatment agencies across Scotland. Results Sixty-eight of the 401 interviewees had commenced an episode of methadone-maintenance treatment {{at the start of}} the study. There was no significant difference between the methadone-maintained sample and the other interviewees in their propensity to abstain from heroin use, nor was there any difference between the two groups in the mean reduction over time in their self-reported dependence on drugs. However, if the outcome measure used is the change (between baseline and 33 months) in the number of days that the interviewee reported having used heroin in the previous 3 months, the reduction in the number of days that heroin was used was significantly greater (52 days) in the methadone-maintained group than in the rest of the sample (36. 4 days). This fall in the number of days of heroin use was greater still if the comparison was restricted to those who had continued on methadone-maintenance treatment, although 67. 4 &# 37; of those still on methadone maintenance had ‘topped up’ with heroin at some point in the 3 months prior to 33 -month follow-up. Those on higher maintenance doses were not significantly more likely to have reduced the number of days on which they used heroin compared with those on lower doses, and those still on methadone maintenance were not more likely to have reduced their criminality (measured by the number of days on which they committed <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crimes</b> in the previous 3 months) compared with the rest of the sample. Conclusions Methadone-maintained drug users are not more likely to achieve abstinence than drug users receiving other forms of treatment, but they are significantly more likely to achieve a reduction in the frequency of their illicit drug use; they ‘top up’ on methadone, but the frequency of their illicit drug use is less than that of drug users in other treatment modalities. These data confirm the value of methadone-maintenance services as part of a ‘mixed economy’ of services for the treatment of drug use. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the media, public attitudes and crime are complex. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} public interaction with press reports about sexual crime may have some effect on wider societal attitudes. With this in mind, 543 articles from eight of the ten most-read British national newspapers were examined in terms of (a) their representativeness about crime rates, and (b) their linguistic properties. A control sample of articles about immigrant groups was included in this analysis in order to establish how offender populations were described in comparison to another negatively-stereotyped population. Key results include a nine- and two-and-a-half-times over-representation of sexual and violent crime, respectively, and a four-and-a-half-times under-representation of <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime</b> within press articles compared to official crime statistics. Linguistically, sexual crime articles comprised angrier and more emotionally negative tones than stories on violent crime, <b>acquisitive</b> <b>crime,</b> and immigrant groups, respectively, and this trend was observed in both tabloid and broadsheet newspapers. An analysis of the headlines of sexual crime articles found clear differences between tabloids and broadsheets with regard to the descriptors of those perpetrating sexual crimes. These findings are analysed within the social, political, and legal contexts of news reporting, with cognitive dissonance theory being offered as one social psychological framework for understanding the purpose of sexual crime reporting. The implications of such misrepresentative news reporting on sex offender reintegration and desistance from crime are discussed, and possible avenues for future research are suggested...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of patterns of income genera-tion among 202 active heroin users in South West Sydney. We explore both sources of income and the relative contribution of different types of income generating activities, including drug sales and related activities, property crime, prostitution, legitimate income and avoided expenditures. Despite claims that heroin use leads inevitably to property crime, drug market activities accounted for a greater proportion of drug user income in this sample. Results indicate that law enforcement crack-downs that reduce opportunities for generating income from the drug market may increase property crime by heroin users. <b>Acquisitive</b> property <b>crime</b> has significant social and economic costs. A recent estimate suggests that between two and three billion dollars worth of property is stolen from homes, shops, cars, factories and warehouses in Australia each year (Freiberg, 1997, p. 237). Very little of this property is recovered and a large amount presumably finds its way onto the stolen property market in various ways (Allen, 2000).
