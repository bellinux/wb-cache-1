5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E
25|$|The {{secret garden}} at Misselthwaite Manor {{is the site}} of both the near-destruction and the {{subsequent}} regeneration of a family. Also the theme is, when <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> neglected it withers and dies, but when it is worked on and cared for thrives, like Mary and Colin.|$|E
25|$|For {{that for}} the sake of which <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> is its principle, and the {{becoming}} is {{for the sake of}} the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.|$|E

60|$|Yes, my friends, {{this was}} the secret of Elijah's power. This is the lesson which Elijah has to teach us. Not to halt between two opinions. If <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>be</b> true, {{to stand up for}} it; if <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>be</b> right, to do it, {{whatsoever}} it may cost us. Make up your minds then, my friends, to be honest men like Elijah the prophet of old.|$|R
25|$|Presence-at-hand {{is not the}} {{way things}} in the world are usually encountered, and it is only {{revealed}} as a deficient or secondary mode, e.g., when a hammer breaks it loses its usefulness and appears as merely there, present-at-hand. When <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> revealed as present-at-hand, it stands apart from any useful set of equipment but soon loses this mode of being present-at-hand and becomes something, for example, that which must be repaired or replaced.|$|E
25|$|Referring to potentiality, {{this is what}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{capable of}} doing, or being acted upon, if the {{conditions}} are right {{and it is not}} prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (poiein) or 'be acted upon' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise– acting).|$|E
25|$|The formal {{cause is}} its form, i.e., the {{arrangement}} of that matter. It tells us what <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> that any thing {{is determined by the}} definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar {{in the mind of the}} sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.|$|E

25|$|Barth's {{doctrine}} of election involves a firm rejection {{of the notion of}} an eternal, hidden decree. In keeping with his Christo-centric methodology, Barth argues that to ascribe the salvation or damnation of humanity to an abstract absolute decree is to make some part of God more final and definitive than God's saving act in Jesus Christ. God's absolute decree, if one may speak of such <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>is</b> God's gracious decision to be for humanity in the person of Jesus Christ. Drawing from the earlier Reformed tradition, Barth retains the notion of double predestination but makes Jesus himself the object of both divine election and reprobation simultaneously; Jesus embodies both God's election of humanity and God's rejection of human sin. While some regard this revision of the {{doctrine of}} election as an improvement on the Augustinian-Calvinist doctrine of the predestination of individuals, critics, namely Brunner, have charged that Barth's view amounts to a soft universalism, thereby departing from Augustinian-Calvinism.|$|E
25|$|The Gaidhil in {{this context}} are the Gaelic Irish of Ulster and perhaps beyond. Whether he {{purchased}} his lands himself (one tradition) or was granted them by the English Crown (another) is also unknown, and {{his relationship with the}} leading English and other Scottish magnates of the region was probably complex. The first Earl of Ulster (1st creation), Hugh de Lacy, was dead by 1242/3 and his authority, namely the Earldom of Ulster, over the eastern quarter of the modern province of Ulster, this region being then called Ulidia, was incomplete. It is possible that the Bissetts aided de Lacy against his Scottish rival Donnchad, Earl of Carrick and received some of the latter's lands for their assistance, but while attractive no account of such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> preserved. Following de Lacy's death, Brian Ua Néill rose to become the most powerful king in all the north of Ireland and in the 1250s was busy smashing the young earldom to pieces, killing many of the English (presumably Scots also) and destroying their castles, and the Bissetts may have been among the sufferers. However, the report of John Byset's death in 1257 shows that the family were viable and may have found themselves possibly even the most prominent British family remaining in Ulidia for a period, since no others are mentioned in the annals. O'Neill was elected High King of Ireland in 1258 by the O'Conors and O'Briens but his death only two years later in the Battle of Druim Dearg came too soon for a major Gaelic overlordship to be established and Walter de Burgh, the Lord of Connacht, was created Earl of Ulster four years after the conflict to preserve England's interests there. Possibly the Bissetts were forced to become his subordinates, but {{it has been argued that}} theirs was understood to be, in any case, a palatine lordship from its creation, whenever that may have been.|$|E

500|$|In fact, Whitehead {{describes}} any entity as in {{some sense}} nothing more and {{nothing less than the}} sum of its relations to other entities – its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it. [...] A real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it; that is to say, if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e. it was not related to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist. [...] Relations are not secondary to what <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> they are what the thing is.|$|E
500|$|Sadra {{put forward}} a new {{argument}}, known as Seddiqin Argument or Argument of the Righteous.

While explaining that everybody steals ideas from other people, Tom points out the 2003 comedy film Love Don't Cost <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>is</b> based on the 1987 comedy film Can't Buy Me Love.

500|$|Early in {{the autumn}} of 1908, Potter wrote her {{publisher}} Harold Warne that she had several ideas for new books. She sent him the text of The Faithful Dove, a tale set in Rye she had composed years earlier and for which she had produced a group of sketches. With it, she included a sequel to The Tale of Benjamin Bunny starring Benjamin's offspring, The Flopsy Bunnies. Though she had complained at times that the rabbit characters had become [...] "wearisome", she had written a young fan, William Warner, that children liked her rabbits best and that she ought to write another rabbit book. The third tale she sent Warne was about the village shop in Sawrey. [...] "I should like to get rid of one of them," [...] she wrote Warne about her story ideas, [...] "When <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> once printed I dismiss it from my dreams! & don't care what becomes of the reviewers. But an accumulation of half finished ideas is bothersome." [...] The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and the story about the shop (eventually The Tale of Ginger and Pickles) were chosen for publication in 1909. [...] The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies was finished in March 1909 and published in July of the same year.|$|E
