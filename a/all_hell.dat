In Mortal Kombat II (1993), Scorpion learns that Sub-Zero has somehow returned, and plans to compete in the second tournament held in the otherworldly dimension of Outworld and hosted by the realm's emperor Shao Kahn. He tracks his nemesis down but notices, in the process, Sub-Zero sparing the life of an opponent in battle. Scorpion realizes {{that this is not the}} original Sub-Zero but instead his younger brother, who was sent to complete the elder Sub-Zero's failed mission of assassinating Shang Tsung. As a result, Scorpion vows to serve as the new Sub-Zero's guardian in atonement for killing his older brother.|$|E

500|$|The actor, {{who once}} {{received}} {{an award for}} being the hardest working member of his profession in Hollywood, still had approximately a dozen films in [...] "post-production" [...] {{at the time of}} his death in 2009. Most of these roles were cameos or small parts in independent, direct to DVD productions. Among them, a horror film, Dark Fields (2009); an action film, Bad Cop (2009); and a western, <b>All</b> <b>Hell</b> Broke Loose (2009).|$|E
500|$|Since Doofenshmirtz and Perry's actions tend {{to affect}} {{those of the}} boys, the choice to have future Candace's {{interference}} in the past greatly affect those of Doofenshmirtz and Perry's was considered the logical choice. Povenmire explained, [...] "They affect each other in ways that we never fully understand, but if you throw off that little balance of power of their [...] activities, <b>all</b> <b>hell</b> could break loose." [...] The song Doofenshmirtz sings, entitled [...] "It's Been a Charmed Life," [...] was well-praised by the production crew, who {{felt that it was}} considerably well-handled. The song centralized the irony surrounding Doofenshmirtz having everything go well for him, a theme completely different from that which is generally touched upon in the series.|$|E
500|$|Phil Allely, a pro wrestling section {{writer for}} The Sun commented about {{the main event}} saying, [...] "The finish was a shock for many reasons as, after the many near falls, moonsaults, {{finishing}} moves and obligatory ref bump, the title went to the unpredictable Hardy" [...] and added, [...] "The fans were obviously stunned as Hardy went on to deck his [...] "friend" [...] RVD and join Hogan, Bischoff, Abyss and Jarrett, subsequently revealing them to be the mysterious [...] "They" [...] as the PPV went off the air". About the pre-main event Lethal Lockdown match, Allely said, [...] "Lethal Lockdown was everything it should be, a full-throttle cage match where <b>all</b> <b>hell</b> breaks loose and the opposing teams finally {{get the chance to}} work through their differences with the cage and weapons as added extras". Overall he commented, “Bound for Glory was perhaps TNA's best offering of 2010”.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to its social implications, the musical integration of soul and country into popular format by Charles changed and revolutionized racial boundaries and restraints in music, {{and contributed to the}} historical Civil Rights Movement. Robert Fontenot of About.com was one of several writers to praise the album's musical and social implications, stating [...] "Arguably one of the most brilliant interpretive albums ever released, it did more to integrate modern American music than almost any other LP in history." [...] In paying tribute to the magazine's selection of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, which had selected Charles at #2, singer-songwriter Billy Joel noted the album's racial and social impact in an article for Rolling Stone, stating [...] "here is a black man giving you the whitest possible music in the blackest possible way, while <b>all</b> <b>hell</b> is breaking loose with the civil rights movement." [...] Another article for Rolling Stone, written in honor of Charles and his achievements, later stated that through his Modern Sounds recordings, Ray Charles [...] "made it acceptable for black people to sing country & western music, in the process doing almost as much to break down racial barriers as did the civil-rights movement." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} day Lieutenant Chris Pearce's 13 Troop, 3 Commando, on patrol with a platoon of Rhodesian African Rifles under Lieutenant Ron Marillier, was fired upon {{on the bank of}} the Maura River in {{northern}} Mashonaland by about 70 ZIPRA, encamped in a strong defensive position on the side of a hill feature. [...] "We were going on up the bank and <b>all</b> <b>hell</b> broke loose," [...] recalled Pearce. [...] "How we didn't take casualties I didn't quite know." [...] Pearce's 12 men were pinned down by heavy machine-gun fire and outnumbered by around six to one. Lance-Corporal Dennis Croukamp [...] "on his own initiative and with complete disregard for his own safety" [...] in the words of the official report, twice crawled forward to throw grenades at the enemy position to allow the troop to redeploy into better cover. Pearce unsuccessfully attempted to assault the enemy position, then gave covering fire to an abortive flank attack by Marillier's RAR men. The security forces then attempted one final assault just before nightfall, but this also failed due to the superior numbers of ZIPRA fighters. The cadres dispersed and evacuated the area during the night and were gone when a Rhodesian sweep took place the next morning.|$|E

2500|$|Grant {{was shocked}} {{when he saw the}} Union troops {{climbing}} the ridge. He asked first Thomas then Granger who had given the orders. Neither general claimed responsibility, but Granger replied, [...] "When those fellows get started <b>all</b> <b>hell</b> can't stop them." [...] Granger then sent a courier to Wood allowing him permission to take the ridge top, if he thought it possible. Several messengers went out at about this time with differing orders, leading to more confusion.|$|E
2500|$|Ted Guzda recalled, [...] "The {{resistance}} to the landing was heavy. The beach was not secured till 2:30 in the afternoon...we lost over 3,000... then finally our planes did the job. I couldn’t count the number (of) planes that went over. We couldn’t sleep. <b>All</b> <b>hell</b> had broken loose. Once the beach was secure we made an imitation harbor by sinking the Liberty ships that brought stuff over. When they got the stuff on the beach they made a breakwater.

From His body the Divine proceeded forth as the Holy Spirit, by which He can directly operate through each person's will for reformation, so that each person can become conjoined directly with the Lord.|$|R

2500|$|Allatoona was a {{relatively}} small, but bloody battle with high percentages of casualties: 706 Union (including about 200 prisoners) and 897 Confederate. Nonetheless, in his autobiography, General and President U.S. Grant praised the stand made by Corse and his men. Corse was wounded during the battle and {{on the following day}} sent a message to Sherman: [...] "I am short a cheek bone and one ear, but am able to whip <b>all</b> <b>hell</b> yet." [...] French was unsuccessful in seizing the railroad cut and Federal garrison, regretting in particular that he was unable to seize the one million rations stored there, or to burn them before he retreated.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the Australian team arrived to tour England in May 1977, {{thirteen}} of the seventeen members of the squad had committed to Packer. News of the WSC plans were inadvertently leaked to Australian journalists, who broke the story on 9 May. Immediately, <b>all</b> <b>hell</b> broke loose in the hitherto conservative world of cricket. Not unexpectedly, the English were critical of what they quickly dubbed the [...] "Packer Circus" [...] and reserved particular vitriol for the English captain Tony Greig, for his central role in organising the break-away. Greig retained his position in the team, but was stripped of the captaincy and ostracised by everyone in the cricket establishment, most {{of whom had been}} singing his praises just weeks before.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{spoke to}} Alex Ferguson and {{the deal was}} close to being done.

Lawrence Luster of the Daily Star took the picture and put in the library. Soon after, their sister paper, the Daily Express, were looking for a picture of me playing for West Ham, and found the one of me in the United shirt in the pile. They published it and <b>all</b> <b>hell</b> broke loose. [...] "I came back from holiday to discover West Ham fans were going mad. It wasn't really my fault. I was only a kid, I did what my agent told me to do, then took all the crap for it." ...|$|E

Wolfsbane's second release, an EP titled <b>All</b> <b>Hell's</b> Breaking Loose Down at Little Kathy Wilson's Place, was released the same year.

60|$|The {{richness}} of mercy {{is seen in}} several things. It can save from sin, from great sin, from all sin (Titus 3:5; Matt 15:22,28). It can save a soul from the devil, from all devils (Matt 17:15,18). It can save a soul from <b>hell,</b> from <b>all</b> <b>hells</b> (Psa 116:3,5,6). It can hold us up {{in the midst of}} all weaknesses (Psa 94:18). It can deliver from eternal judgment (Rom 9:23). Yea, what is it that we have, or shall need, that this virtuous mercy cannot do for us: 'Let Israel hope in the Lord: for which the Lord is RICH mercy,' mercy full of virtue, and that can do great things.|$|R
