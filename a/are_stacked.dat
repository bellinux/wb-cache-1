5|$|Carbon is ordinarily {{classified}} as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally {{classified as}} a metalloid. Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers <b>are</b> <b>stacked</b> together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes <b>are</b> <b>stacked</b> in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} <b>are</b> <b>stacked</b> with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E

5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets <b>are</b> <b>stacked</b> and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{firmware}} 4.2.0.4 {{and later}} available from December 2011, the Powerconnect 8024(-F) and the blade-versions PCM8024-k (thus NOT the discontinued PCM8024) can <b>be</b> <b>stacked.</b> <b>Stacking</b> <b>is</b> done by assigning (multiple) 10Gb ethernet ports as stacking-ports. Up to six 80xx series switches can <b>be</b> <b>stacked.</b> Note that <b>stacking</b> <b>is</b> not supported using the 10GBASE-T combo ports on PCT8024F. You can mix PCT8024 and PCT8024-F in one stack, but it can't {{be combined with}} a PCM8024-k blade. The original PCM8024 did not support stacking ...|$|R
