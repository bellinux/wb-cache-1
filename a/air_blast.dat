40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} whether <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> or rinsing particle remnants {{with water}} would impair adhesion of resin composite to metal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Commercially pure titanium plates (1 mm x 25 mm x 50 mm) were wet polished down to 1200 -grit silicone carbide abrasive and ultrasonically cleaned. They were then embedded in auto-polymerizing acrylic with the bonding surfaces exposed. Specimens {{were randomly assigned}} to one of the following particle deposition protocols (N = 60, n = 10 per group) : group 1 : particle deposition with aluminum trioxide (50 µm Al 2 O 3) (AL) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane (ESPE-Sil); group 2 : particle deposition with 30 µm SiO 2 (CoJet) (CSC) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane; group 3 : particle deposition with Rocatec Pre 110 µm Al 2 O 3 +Rocatec Plus 110 µm SiO 2 (LSC) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane. In groups 4 (AL-W), 5 (CSC-W) and 6 (LSC-W), the same protocols were used, but instead of <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> only, particle-deposited specimen surfaces were rinsed with water and <b>air</b> <b>blasted.</b> Adhesive resin (VisioBond) was applied and resin composite (Quadrant Posterior, Cavex) was bonded using polyethylene molds and photopolymerized. The specimens were then submitted to thermocycling (6000 cycles, 5 °C- 55 °C, dwell time: 30 s, transfer time: 5 s). Pre-test failures during thermocycling were assigned a value of 0 MPa. Failure modes were identified using an optical microscope. SEM images of particles were obtained. Bond strength data (MPa) were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests (a = 0. 05). RESULTS: Particle type significantly affected the bond results (p 0. 05). While AL groups showed exclusively adhesive failure between the resin composite and the substrate, the incidence of cohesive failures in the composite was more frequent in groups CSC and LSC after either <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> or rinsing. SEM images of particles showed sharp morphology of the particles in AL compared to CSC and LSC. Conclusion: Rinsing and <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> following particle deposition methods did not impair adhesion of resin composite to titanium. Particle deposition with silica particles provided better adhesion of resin composite to this substrate compared to the use of alumina particles...|$|R

25|$|On December 28, 1950, the Board of Transportation {{issued a}} report {{concerning}} the construction of bomb shelters in the subway system. Five deep stations in Washington Heights, including the 190th Street station, {{were considered to be}} ideal for being used as bomb-proof shelters. The program was expected to cost $104,000,000. These shelters were expected to provide limited protection against conventional bombs, while providing protection against shock waves and <b>air</b> <b>blast,</b> {{as well as from the}} heat and radiation from an atomic bomb. To become suitable as shelters, the stations would require water-supply facilities, first-aid rooms, and additional bathrooms.|$|E
25|$|The {{vaporizing}} fuel injector, {{the third}} type, {{is similar to}} the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> injector in that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the combustion zone. However, the fuel-air mixture travels through a tube within the combustion zone. Heat from the combustion zone is transferred to the fuel-air mixture, vaporizing some of the fuel (mixing it better) before it is combusted. This method allows the fuel to be combusted with less thermal radiation, which helps protect the liner. However, the vaporizer tube may have serious durability problems with low fuel flow within it (the fuel inside of the tube protects the tube from the combustion heat).|$|E
25|$|The Greenside smelt mill {{was built}} in 182728, down in the Glenridding valley {{at the bottom of}} the Swart Beck, where there was a good water supply and where fuel could be brought up the valley without too much difficulty. Inside the mill there was {{probably}} a furnace to prepare the ore and a single ore hearth. The <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> was produced by bellows powered by a water wheel. Further buildings were erected in the 1830s, to house a slag hearth furnace, and a silver refinery. There was no extended chimney: clouds of toxic lead oxides and acid sulphurous fumes would have made the valley an unhealthy place. The flue {{was built in}} 1841 to a chimney 150m up the hillside; in 1855 it was extended to a chimney on the ridge above. Later, loops were added to increase its length. This long flue not only removed the noxious fumes, it also enabled the lead-rich dust to be recovered and returned to the smelter. The flue was built as a stone-arched cutting, following or cut into the bedrock. This served as a giant prospecting cross-cut and proved there was no extension to the Greenside Vein to the south.|$|E
5000|$|The Shocker wears {{a pair of}} gauntlets he {{designed}} with vibro-shock units known as [...] "vibro-smashers" [...] that, when activated by a pump-action thumb trigger, can project a concentrated <b>blast</b> of compressed <b>air</b> that vibrates at an intense frequency. This creates a series of rapid-succession high-pressure <b>air</b> <b>blasts</b> that result {{in a series of}} powerful impacts. This allows Shocker to both effectively throw long range vibrational punches from a distance, creating destructive vibrations that can crumble solid concrete and cause extensive damage to the human body and its internal organs, as well as throw shock waves which vibrate the structure of something in order to weaken or destroy it. A lesser known ability of the gaunlets allows Shocker to make incredible leaps, by directing the <b>air</b> <b>blasts</b> toward {{the ground in front of}} him. Holding the thumb triggers down for an extended period of time increases the intensity, speed, and even spread of the <b>air</b> <b>blasts.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{second type}} of fuel {{injector}} is the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> injector.

40|$|During {{rehabilitation}} of 16 km {{at the road}} 563 between Sjulsmark and Ersnäs Norrbotten County, Sweden in 2006, a 800 m long test road was constructed. Three different fractions of <b>Air</b> Cooled <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slag were used. The fractions were 0 / 63, 0 / 125 and unsorted material. In addition normal crushed stone was used in one section as a reference. The test road was built by SSAB Tunnplåt AB, SSAB Merox, the Swedish Road Administration Northern region and BDX AB.

A Percostation, {{which is used to}} measure and visualize measured parameters like dielectric constant (Dielectricity), Electrical Conductivity and Temperature, was installed in the studied part to collect data from 5 different depths (15 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm, 80 cm and 110 cm) in the road section. It is normally used in detecting critical bearing capacity of road materials and to assess the frost and water effects on the road materials. Data obtained from the percostation in the test road was analyzed and compared with data obtained from two other stations in Finland. The purpose was to investigate the differences between the behaviors of <b>Air</b> Cooled <b>Blast</b> Furnace Slag, which was used to construct the test road, with the behavior of natural geological road materials, which were used in the two Finnish stations.
