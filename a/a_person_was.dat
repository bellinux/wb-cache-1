After {{the dissolution of the}} third batch of uranium slugs, the liquid in the dissolver tank did not completely cover the slugs for about 29 hours, which overheated due to decay heat. When the acid was added for the fourth batch, the violent reaction with the hot metal produced gases and forced the solution up the slug loading chute and the pipes. The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building. Radiation levels {{on the third floor of}} the building reached 100roentgen per hour (R/h), and were reduced to 100mR/h by 7 am the next day.

25|$|During sleep, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> in <b>an</b> altered {{state of}} mind. Aristotle compares <b>a</b> {{sleeping}} <b>person</b> to <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who <b>is</b> overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who has <b>a</b> strong infatuation with someone {{may begin to}} think they see that person everywhere {{because they are so}} overtaken by their feelings. When <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who <b>is</b> influenced by strong feelings. Since <b>a</b> <b>person</b> sleeping <b>is</b> in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|R

Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec.

5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay.

50|$|The Hypnotic Induction Profile (HIP) or the eye roll test, first {{proposed}} by Herbert Spiegel, {{is a simple}} test to loosely determine if <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> susceptible to hypnosis. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> asked to roll his or her eyes upward.

The less of these parts of the eye observed, the more hypnotically susceptible <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is.</b> Research has shown that the scale does not carry as strong a relationship with other hypnotic scales as originally thought, with correlations ranging from 0.1 to 0.15 (Orne et al. 1979).|$|R
