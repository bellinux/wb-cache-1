5|$|The Jarls Eirik and Svein proved strong, {{competent}} rulers, {{and their}} reign was prosperous. Most {{sources say that}} they adopted Christianity but allowed the people religious freedom, leading to <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> Christianity which undid much of Olaf Tryggvason's missionary work.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the {{external}} environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic movement. Famines continued to sweep the globe through the 20th century. Through the effects of climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E
5|$|Glam metal lost {{mainstream}} {{interest in}} the early 1990s as the perceived excesses of glam metal created <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the genre. A factor in the decline of glam metal was the rise of grunge in the early 1990s, which had a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style. Glam metal has enjoyed a revival since the late 1990s with reunions of many popular acts from the genre's 1980s heyday, {{as well as the}} retro styling of newer bands including The Darkness from Lowestoft, the United Kingdom, Santa Cruz from Helsinki, Finland, and Steel Panther from Los Angeles, America.|$|E
5|$|The 1890s were {{a period}} of {{remarkable}} creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published The Division of Labour in Society, his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement {{of the nature of}} human society and its development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall of the regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.|$|E
25|$|Within a week {{of retail}} reform announcement, Indian {{government}} has faced <b>a</b> political <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> its decision to allow competition and 51% ownership of multi-brand organised retail in India.|$|R
50|$|Rock and Roll Revival was a back-to-basics musical {{trend of}} the late 1960s and early 1970s, in <b>a</b> sort-of <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the heavier and {{psychedelic}} rock sounds then in vogue.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> severe <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> Iranians in the United States developed. One Iranian American later complained, “I {{had to hide}} my Iranian {{identity}} not to get beaten up, even at university.” ...|$|R
5|$|During the interwar {{period of}} the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist {{historian}} Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed {{that it was a}} subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the statism and {{compressive}} nature of modernist architecture. Instead {{there was a}} move towards a form of post-modernism that looked to a clash of styles with a renewed emphasis on visual aesthetics that invoked classicism. There was also {{a combination of the}} private and the public. This movement against modernism also included renewed influence by the Scots baronial and Mackintosh-inspired designs; these can be seen respectively in the Scandic Crown Hotel (1988–89) in the Old Town in Edinburgh and the National Library Causewayside Building (1985–87, extended 1993–94). The most significant figure in the development of architecture in Scotland from the 1980s was the academic Charles McKean. He was secretary and treasurer of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) from 1979 to 1995. He argued against motorway expansion and the production of grey, colourless monoliths. Early private works influenced by these ideas included the D. & D. Warehouse, Centre Street and the Bank of Pakistan in Sauchiehall Street, both in Glasgow. Public structures included the building to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow (1981) and the Glasgow Sheriff Court (1980–86).|$|E
5|$|Street & Smith, one of {{the longest}} {{established}} and most respected publishers, shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, partially {{as a result of the}} success of paperbacks. Standard continued with Startling and Thrilling, but the end came only a few years later. In 1954, Fredric Wertham published Seduction of the Innocent, a book in which he asserted that comics were inciting children to violence. A subsequent Senate subcommittee hearing led to <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> comics, and the publishers dropped titles in response. The financial impact spread to pulp magazines, since often a publisher would publish both. A 1955 strike by American News Corporation, the main distributor in the U.S., meant that magazines remained in warehouses and never made it to the newsstands; the unsold copies represented a significant financial blow and contributed to publishers' decisions to cancel magazines. Startling was {{one of the}} casualties. The schedule had already returned from monthly to bimonthly in 1953, and it became a quarterly in early 1954. Thrilling Wonder published its last issue in early 1955, and was then merged with Startling, as was Fantastic Story Magazine, another companion publication, but the combined magazine lasted only three more issues. Mines left the magazine at the end of 1954; he was succeeded for two issues by Theron Raines, who was followed by Herbert D. Kastle for the last two. The final issue was dated Fall 1955.|$|E
50|$|Several {{commentators}} {{compared the}} raid with the Short Creek raid of 1953, {{which was also}} a government raid on an FLDS community, and which led to <b>a</b> popular <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the raid.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>a</b> further <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> educated Africans, African civil {{servants}} were condemned {{for their part}} {{in defiance of the}} colonial authority and discriminated against, with the promotion of Africans, declining noticeably after 1926.|$|R
25|$|The Russian {{government}} pressured {{retailers to}} freeze food prices before key elections {{for fear of}} <b>a</b> public <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> {{the rising cost of}} food in October 2007. The freeze ended on 1 May 2008.|$|R
25|$|The Jarls Eirik and Svein proved strong, {{competent}} rulers, {{and their}} reign was prosperous.

25|$|Years after Long's assassination, many of {{the changes}} he made to the band and to the University were {{reversed}} as part of <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> his control over LSU and the associated scandals; for instance, Carazo was fired and the military uniforms were reinstated.|$|E
25|$|Lenihan {{delivered}} the 2009 Budget on 14 October 2008– the budget {{had been called}} early due to the worsening economic conditions. The controversial measure of removing Medical Cards from most over 70 year olds (by means testing) caused a massive public outcry. This caused <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the government and backbench unease; one Fianna Fáil TD, Joe Behan, left the party in protest.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{during a time}} where there was <b>a</b> public <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> role playing games. Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) games were accused of promoting Satanism {{and other forms of}} occult activities among young people.|$|R
50|$|There was <b>an</b> {{extended}} <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> {{the speech}} {{from the right}} of the Conservative Party, which wished Britain to retain its imperial possessions. The speech led directly to the formation of the Conservative Monday Club pressure group.|$|R
40|$|Some {{studies of}} {{negative}} campaign advertising's impact argue that <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> or "boomerang effect" exists. However, the appropriate conceptualization of a boomerang effect {{might not be}} <b>an</b> immediate <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the sponsor but a delayed response that comes after repeated exposure to negative campaign advertisements.

25|$|In {{response}} to <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the Treaty, politician Winston Peters, the 13th Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand (and {{founder of the}} New Zealand First Party), and others have campaigned to remove vague references to the Treaty from New Zealand law. However, the New Zealand Māori Council case of 1990 indicated that even if references to the Treaty were removed from legislation, the Treaty may still be legally relevant.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{a number}} of FR Co. {{employees}} became concerned about impact of possible competition from a rebuilt WHR and passed this view on to the FR management. In 1987, {{this resulted in a}} confidential offer to buy the WHR track bed from the official receiver for £16,000 in order to prevent the WHR being developed. In 1989, the offer became public, causing <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the FR Co.|$|E
25|$|After news of {{the seizure}} became public, there was <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the {{government}} for apparent abuse {{of power and the}} family ties between Fombah Sirleaf and the President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. GNN Liberia, a local news publication, in a September 2017 article quoted analysts who felt the counterfeiting charge by the NSA was likely bogus because the cash seized had been withdrawn from the bank right before seizure.|$|E
25|$|In {{hopes of}} extorting a rescue of the bank, Biddle induced a {{short-lived}} financial crisis that was initially blamed on Jackson's executive action. By 1834, <b>a</b> general <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> Biddle's tactics developed, ending the panic and all recharter efforts were abandoned.|$|R
50|$|However, at the 2004 election, <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> {{occurred}} <b>against</b> C&R Now in some wards, seeing {{control of}} the city go to the left-wing City Vision ticket, {{as well as the}} election of a new mayor, Dick Hubbard.|$|R
50|$|Seni's {{final term}} {{was a time}} of crisis in the nation. <b>A</b> right-wing <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> leftist student demonstrators culminated in the Thammasat University {{massacre}} on 6 October 1976, the military forced him out of office and installed hard-line royalist Tanin Kraivixien as premier.|$|R
25|$|Grapes was controversial. Steinbeck's New Deal {{political}} views, negative {{portrayal of}} aspects of capitalism, and {{sympathy for the}} plight of workers, led to <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the author, especially close to home. Claiming the book was both obscene and misrepresented conditions in the county, the Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county's publicly funded schools and libraries in August 1939. This ban lasted until January 1941.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{has urged}} Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In theory, free trade enables economies {{to focus on}} those {{products}} where they have comparative advantage, making both economies better off. While trade maximizes the overall outcome, specific groups are helped or hurt by trade. Due to <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> globalization in both the U.S. and Europe by working-class voters, several politicians in the 2016 U.S. election expressed {{their opposition to the}} deal.|$|E
25|$|After {{independence}} of India, there was <b>a</b> <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> Western fashions {{due to their}} association with the previous colonialist regime. Instead, professional Indian men began wearing the five button Nehru suit, made from khadi to support the local textile industry. During the 1960s, these suits became fashionable among the British mod subculture due to their use by The Beatles. These made a brief comeback during the mid 2000s, but since 2010 they {{have been out of}} fashion in the West.|$|E
50|$|The Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO; Resistência Nacional Moçambicana) is {{a militant}} {{organization}} and political movement in Mozambique.
