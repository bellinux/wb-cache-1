Sixty-three Italian civilians and military personnel were killed in the bombardment. By the time Italian ships from Taranto and Brindisi <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in Pola.|$|E

50|$|The rescuers {{were slow}} to react. The first rescue ship to <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> was <b>the</b> SS Andrea F. Luckenbach. Two other ships—the SS Monarch of Bermuda and the SS City of Savannah—were slow in taking action after {{receiving}} the SOS but eventually did <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> <b>The</b> fourth ship {{to participate in the}} rescue operations was the , which launched a motor boat that made a cursory circuit around the Morro Castle and, upon seeing nobody in the water along her route, retrieved her motor boat and left <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|R
5|$|Willis/Dupre feigns death, {{and when}} Phillips drops her wedding ring on him, {{he grabs her}} gun and kills her. He dies seconds later {{due to the lack}} of insulin.

Later Scully retrieves Willis' possessions from the morgue, including a watch she gave him for his thirty-fifth birthday. The watch stopped at 6:47, the moment Willis died after the bank shooting.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force {{and all of his}} artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|As {{luck would}} have it, the local king <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> and proved to be Olaf's alleged {{grandfather}} Myrkjartan. Olaf remained with Myrkjartan for a time, and the king, according to Laxdaela Saga, even offered to make Olaf his heir. Olaf, however, ultimately returned to Norway, afraid of provoking Myrkjartan's sons. Olaf returned {{to the court of}} King Harald, where he was greatly honored by both the king and his mother Gunnhild.|$|E

5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> Although {{the troops}} {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival {{was also a}} reaction of the authorities to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Howe landed {{his army}} in an amphibious {{operation}} at Kip's Bay, {{on the eastern}} shore of Manhattan, along the East River. After a bombardment of the American positions on the shore, 4,000 British and Hessian troops landed, and they fought the Battle of Kip's Bay. The American troops began to flee {{at the sight of the}} enemy, and even after Washington <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> and took immediate command, demanding that his soldiers fight, they refused to obey orders and continued to flee.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of May 9, Benedict Arnold quite unexpectedly <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> Flourishing a commission from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, he asserted his right to command the expedition. The assembled men refused to acknowledge his authority, insisting they would only follow Allen's lead. In a private discussion, Allen and Arnold reached an accommodation, the essence of which was that Arnold and Allen would both be {{at the front of}} the troops when the attack on the fort was made.|$|E

5|$|One major {{demonstration}} {{took place}} in the Shi'a island of Sitra, where several thousand men, women, and children took to the streets. According to witnesses interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights, hundreds of fully armed riot police <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> and immediately began firing tear gas and sound grenades into the crowds. They then fired rubber bullets into the unarmed crowd, aiming at people in the front line who had sat down in the street in protest.|$|E
5|$|The castles {{guarding}} the northern border were in such bad condition that the Knights easily captured those at Złotoryja, Dobrzyń and Bobrowniki, {{the capital of}} Dobrzyń Land, while German burghers invited them into Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg). Władysław <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> in late September, retook Bydgoszcz within a week, and came {{to terms with the}} Order on 8 October. During the winter, the two armies prepared for a major confrontation. Władysław installed a strategic supply depot at Płock in Masovia and had a pontoon bridge constructed and transported north down the Vistula.|$|E
5|$|Exeter {{had been}} badly damaged {{in the battle}} with Admiral Graf Spee, and Dorsetshire escorted her back to Britain in January 1940, before {{returning}} to South American waters to search for German supply ships. On 11 February, her reconnaissance aircraft spotted the German supply freighter Wakama twelve {{miles off the coast}} of Brazil, which was promptly scuttled by her crew. Dorsetshire <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> shortly thereafter, picked up ten officers and thirty-five crewmen and sank Wakama to prevent her from being a navigational hazard. The following month, the President of Panama, Augusto Samuel Boyd, sent a formal complaint to the British government protesting against Dorsetshires violation of the Pan-American Security Zone in the Wakama incident.|$|E

Area contractors had sent all their men to assist, and many other people came to the scene in response to the pleas for help. Eventually, 34 firefighters and the Chief of the Lansing Fire Department <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> as did several Michigan State Police officers who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to Sparrow Hospital and St. Lawrence Hospital in Lansing. The construction of the St. Lawrence facility had been financed in large part by Lawrence Price, Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of Oldsmobile's Lansing Car Assembly.|$|E

On 1 August, while {{steaming}} out to meet an inbound convoy, she received word that the group's escort, the , had been torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. The American destroyer soon <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> and helped to save {{the survivors of the}} stricken French warship from the waters of the Bay of Biscay. Tuckers efforts, and those of the five other American destroyers who were also present, were rewarded by a commendation from the Préfet Maritime, on behalf of the French Ministry of Marine.|$|E
5|$|After the breakout, the Austro-Hungarian navy saw {{very little}} action, {{spending}} {{much of its}} time in its base at Pola (now Pula, Croatia). The navy's general inactivity was partly caused {{by a lack of}} coal, which became a problem as the war progressed, and partly by a fear of mines in the Adriatic (which also kept the Italian navy in port for most of the war). They did, however, leave Pola to bombard Ancona in May 1915. On 23 May 1915, four hours after the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola, the members of the Tegetthoff class {{and the rest of the}} fleet departed to bombard the Italian coast. The Austro-Hungarian ships bombarded the important naval base at Ancona, and later the coast of Montenegro, without opposition; by the time Italian ships <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in Pola.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the details}} of Hendrix's last day and death are widely disputed, {{he spent much of}} September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she {{prepared}} a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, sometime around 11 p.m., when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45a.m., where he remained for about an hour before she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m., when they went to sleep. She awoke around 11 a.m., and found Hendrix breathing, but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., which <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> at 11:27a.m. Paramedics then transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where Dr. John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45p.m. on September 18, 1970.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September 1983 Druze forces massed on the {{threshold}} of Suk El Gharb, a village defended by the Lebanese Army. Suk El Gharb was a village with strategic importance: the militias coming up from the south had to traverse Suk El Gharb to get to the Beirut–Aley road. Moreover, Suk El Gharb controlled a ridge that overlooked Baabda, Yarze, which was the location of the Ministry of Defence, and East Beirut. From that ridge, the Militia gunners could shoot directly downhill at those locations with artillery. United States Navy warships shelled Druze positions and helped the Lebanese Army hold the town of Suk El Gharb until a cease-fire was declared on 25 September, on which day the battleship New Jersey <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> The arrival of New Jersey was one of several factors contributing to a {{reduction in the number of}} attacks on the Marines.|$|E
5|$|The {{first call}} from the scene to {{emergency}} services was received at 10:11a.m. While waiting for help to arrive, Giffords' intern Daniel Hernández Jr. applied pressure to the gunshot wound on her forehead, and made sure she did not choke on her blood. Hernández was credited with saving Giffords' life. David and Nancy Bowman, a married doctor and nurse who were shopping in the store, immediately set up triage and attended to nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Police <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> at 10:15a.m., with paramedics arriving at 10:16a.m. Badger observed the assailant attempting to discard a small bag containing money and identification, which was recovered by the officers. Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding the shopping center {{until late in the}} day. The intersection was cordoned off and most of the businesses in the shopping center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week later, with a makeshift memorial erected near the front of the store.|$|E
