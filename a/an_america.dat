In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that [...] "he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to <b>an</b> <b>America</b> you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look." [...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E
500|$|William Ford Gibson {{was born}} in the coastal city of Conway, South Carolina, and {{he spent most of his}} {{childhood}} in Wytheville, Virginia, a small town in the Appalachians where his parents had been born and raised. His family moved frequently during Gibson's youth owing to his father's position as manager of a large construction company. In Norfolk, Virginia, Gibson attended Pines Elementary School, where the teachers' lack of encouragement for him to read was a cause of dismay for his parents. While Gibson was still a young child, a little over a year into his stay at Pines Elementary, his father choked to death in a restaurant while on a business trip. His mother, unable to tell William the bad news, had someone else inform him of the death. Tom Maddox has commented that Gibson [...] "grew up in <b>an</b> <b>America</b> as disturbing and surreal as anything J. G. Ballard ever dreamed".|$|E
500|$|Borah's biographer, McKenna, deemed him [...] "an idealist, even a romantic.

[...] John Chalmers Vinson, in his volume on Borah's involvement with the war outlawry movement, believed that the senator [...] "spoke for {{a large part of the}} American public. He was the archetype of absolute insistence on unfettered national will that has been loosely described as isolationism. Further, he represented the struggle to preserve in full the traditions of a small republic remote from strong neighbors against the inroads of recurring crises faced by a world power." [...] According to LeRoy Ashby in his book on Borah, he [...] "emerged as one of the major figures in American reform politics [...] reached the peak of his prestige and influence during the Twenties". Maddox noted that [...] "almost as suspicious of U.S. presidents as he was of foreign nations, Borah perceived threats everywhere." ...|$|E

500|$|Politics {{is present}} as an {{underlying}} theme in Spook Country {{to a greater}} extent than in any of the author's previous novels. The novel can be read as an exploration of the fear, uncertainty and pervasive paranoia of <b>an</b> <b>America</b> riven by the unending and divisive Iraq War. Although he had avoided overtly political themes in his previous work out of a distaste for didacticism, Gibson found that in the Bush era, politics had [...] "jacked itself up to my level of weirdness". Of the climate in Washington, D.C. during that period, he disclosed in a 2007 interview that [...] "I like the sheer sort of neo-Stalinist denial of reality. That's what makes it work. It's interesting." [...] Mike Duffy in Scotland on Sunday characterized the novel as a [...] "startling, effective guidebook to post-9/11 America"; Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times elaborated, proposing that it was [...] "arguably the first example of the post-post-9/11 novel, whose characters are tired of being pushed around by forces larger than they are – bureaucracy, history and, always, technology – and are at long last ready to start pushing back".|$|E
500|$|Sorkin's nearly decade-long {{collaboration}} in television with director Thomas Schlamme began in early 1998 {{when they found}} they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced Sports Night. Their successful partnership in television {{is one in which}} Sorkin focuses on writing the scripts while Schlamme executive produces and occasionally directs; they have worked together on Sports Night, The West Wing, and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing. In response to what he perceived as unfair criticism of The Newsroom, Jacob Drum of Digital Americana wrote, [...] "The essential truth that the critics miss is that The Newsroom is Sorkin being Sorkin as he always has been and always will be: one part pioneer; one part self-conscious romantic; two parts actual Lewis & Clark-style pioneer, trapping his way across an old, old idea of <b>an</b> <b>America</b> that can always stand to raise its game—but most importantly, spinning a good yarn while he does so." ...|$|E
500|$|The taunt {{hit home}} in <b>an</b> <b>America</b> where {{the log cabin}} was {{seen as part of}} the {{national}} heritage; though [...] relatively few lived in one by 1840, many had resided in one earlier in life, or had parents who had. Alexis de Tocqueville, the French diplomat who toured America in the 1830s, chronicled them as the pioneer's first dwelling. Hard cider was seen as a drink of the common man. [...] The Whigs decided to take pride in the cabin and cider the Democrats had derided. The origins of how this came to be are uncertain, though the most commonly rendered version of events has, in January 1840, Pennsylvania Whig operative Thomas Elder coming {{up with the idea of}} making log cabins a symbol of the Harrison/Tyler campaign. Robert Gray Gunderson, in his account of the 1840 election, described how one was displayed at a Harrisburg ratification meeting on January 20, [...] and [...] "within the month, cabins, coons, and cider became symbols of resurgent Whiggery". John Gasaway, in his doctoral thesis on the communications in the 1840 campaign, noted that Harrison was called the [...] "log cabin and hard cider candidate" [...] in one paper as early as December 20, 1839, and that images of Harrison and humble abodes he was deemed to have protected date as far back as the War of 1812.|$|E

[...] "Although he is often considered a champion of democracy and equality, Whitman constructs a hierarchy with himself at the head, America below, {{and the rest of the}} world in a subordinate position." [...] In his study, [...] "The Pragmatic Whitman: Reimagining American Democracy", Stephen John Mack suggests that critics, who tend to ignore it, should look again at Whitman’s nationalism: “Whitman’s seemingly mawkish celebrations of the United States … [...] one of those problematic features of his works that teachers and critics read past or explain away” (xv-xvi). Nathanael O’Reilly in an essay on [...] "Walt Whitman’s Nationalism in the First Edition of Leaves of Grass" [...] claims that [...] "Whitman’s imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such <b>an</b> <b>America</b> is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights." [...] Whitman's imaginative [...] "mawkish" [...] nationalism avoided issues concerning the genocide of Native Americans.
