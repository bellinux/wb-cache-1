5|$|A nondeterministic {{algorithm}} {{for determining}} whether a 2-satisfiability instance is not satisfiable, using only a logarithmic amount of writable memory, is easy to describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable v <b>and</b> <b>search</b> (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications leading from v to its negation {{and then back to}} v. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, it is also possible in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.|$|E

In some police-force areas, there were more stop <b>and</b> <b>searches</b> per head of population of white people than of black people.

5|$|A {{suitable}} environment {{had developed}} to question scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) {{were found to}} not always match everyday observations. As the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).

5|$|By December 1966 some Australian officers, {{including}} Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, the 5 RAR commanding officer, {{had begun}} to reassess their operational aims. Warr argued that they should move away from conventional operations and instead focus on population control and disrupting communist supply lines and freedom of movement. Assessing that with just two infantry battalions 1 ATF {{did not have the}} strength to destroy the Viet Cong forces then in Phuoc Tuy, Warr favoured cordon <b>and</b> <b>search</b> operations to eliminate cadres and block the supply of rice from the villages. On 7 January 1967, Brigadier David Jackson was replaced as Commander 1 ATF by Brigadier Stuart Graham, and he subsequently approved Warr's proposed concept of operations. Two days later 5 RAR conducted a successful cordon <b>and</b> <b>search</b> of the village of Binh Ba as part of Operation Caloundra, screening 1,500 villagers and interrogating 591. Nine confirmed members of the Viet Cong were captured, while five draft dodgers were also detained. By mid-afternoon the operation had concluded without a shot being fired.|$|E

40|$|Data {{published}} by the United Kingdom's Ministry for Justice clearly shows that, compared to persons who were White, members of racial minorities in England, particularly Blacks, were {{far more likely to}} be stopped <b>and</b> <b>searched</b> by the police. The question is whether such racial disparity in stops <b>and</b> <b>searches</b> could be justified by racial disparities in offending? Or whether the disparity in stop <b>and</b> <b>searches</b> exceeded the disparity in offending? This paper proposes a method for measuring the amount of excess in racial disparity in police stop <b>and</b> <b>searches.</b> Using the most recently published Ministry of Justice data (for 2007 / 08) for Police Areas in England and Wales it concludes that while in several Areas there was no excess to racial disparity in police stop <b>and</b> <b>searches,</b> there was, {{on the basis of the}} methodology proposed in the paper, evidence of such excess in some Police Areas of England and Wales. ...|$|R

5|$|In February 1967 1 ATF {{focused on}} the Dat Do area and the {{south-east}} of Phuoc Tuy province, initiating a program of conventional operations and pacification, with 5 RAR concentrating on cordon <b>and</b> <b>search</b> and civic action against Viet Cong cadres in the villages, while 6 RAR was tasked with search and destroy missions targeting the Viet Cong D445 Battalion. During the first week 6 RAR conducted ambushes along Route 23 between Dat Do and the Suoi Tre river, pre-empting Viet Cong attacks in the area during the Tet holiday. The results of this operation were modest, and the Australians suffered a number of casualties from a misplaced fire mission from the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery which killed four and wounded 13, including Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, who had earlier received the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions at Long Tan, and was among the dead. Meanwhile, 5 RAR continued its cordon <b>and</b> <b>search</b> operations. On 13–14 February the battalion completed a cordon <b>and</b> <b>search</b> of An Nhut, just west of Dat Do, with South Vietnamese forces, apprehending 14 Viet Cong suspects, five communist sympathisers, two South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) deserters and a draft dodger. The Australians again suffered heavy casualties after the officer commanding C Company, his second-in-command, and a New Zealand artillery forward observer were killed by an unrecorded ARVN mine. Regardless, these operations met with some success, and over a six-day period the battalion captured 40 Viet Cong. Yet even as Graham continued to refine his strategy the Viet Cong struck, and this sudden initiative would force the Australians into the type of conventional engagement that Westmoreland had been advocating.|$|E
