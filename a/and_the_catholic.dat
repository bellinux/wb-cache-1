5|$|The Catholic Church {{attained}} increasing {{political influence}} in the 1930s, and used its influence to promote censorship of movies, and to discourage publication of birth control information.

5|$|The {{concept of}} Żydokomuna was widely {{illustrated}} in Polish interwar politics, including publications by the National Democrats <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church that expressed anti-Jewish views.

5|$|A {{nephew of}} the last Emperor, Constantine XI, Andreas Palaiologos claimed to have {{inherited}} the title of Byzantine Emperor. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived {{under the protection of}} the Papal States for the remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both Charles VIII of France <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators of morality and that morality is a priori. They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E

5|$|Despite his fervour, Saglio's {{negotiations}} with the local people were unsuccessful. Niomoune and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages. The project was eventually abandoned, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> missions house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.|$|E

Support {{from the city of}} Cologne itself was also secure. To oust Gebhard, though, Ernst ultimately had to appeal for aid to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who commanded Spanish forces in the Netherlands.|$|E

Another $46,000 was provided by the Government of Norway <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Relief Services donated $50,000. The Government of Japan provided $300,000 and the Government of the United States donated $25,000 in response to the overall effects of Elsie and the three preceding storms. Two other non-governmental organizations, the Lutheran World Federation and World Council of Churches allocated $10,000 and $30,000, respectively, for the Philippines.|$|E

This culminated in outright war between the Swiss cantons that accepted Protestantism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Catholics</b> were victorious, <b>and</b> Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531. <b>The</b> <b>Catholic</b> cantons were magnanimous in victory.|$|R

It followed his break from the Pope <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E
5|$|Soegijapranata {{was unable}} to prevent Japanese torture of prisoners of war, {{including}} the clergy, but was himself well-treated by the Japanese forces; he was often invited to Japanese ceremonies, but never attended, sending bouquets in his stead. He used this position of respect to lobby for fair treatment of those interned. He successfully petitioned the Japanese overlords to exempt nuns from the paramilitary draft {{and allow them to}} work at hospitals. He <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> populace also gathered food and other supplies for interned clergy, and Soegijapranata kept in contact with the prisoners, supplying and receiving news, such as recent deaths, and other information.|$|E
5|$|Territories {{that had}} been conquered since the early 15th century were governed as condominiums by the cantons. Reeves for these territories were {{assigned}} by the Tagsatzung {{for a period of}} two years; the posts changed bi-annually between the cantons. The Aargau had been annexed in 1415. The western part belonged to Bern, while the eastern part comprised the two condominiums of the former County of Baden in the north and the Freie Ämter ("Free Districts") in the south. The Free Districts had been forcibly recatholized after the Reformation in Switzerland, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> cantons, especially Lucerne, Zug, and Uri considered these districts part of their sphere of influence and the reeves typically came from these cantons. The Thurgau, which had been annexed in 1460, was also a condominium of the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|The 16th-century English Reformation, {{during which}} the Church of England {{broke away from the}} {{authority}} of the pope <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church, split the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family, was a leading recusant who had been arrested several times for refusing to abandon his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did convert to the Church of England, for which he was disinherited, {{but the rest of the}} family remained staunchly Catholic.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation led to {{clashes between}} the Protestant Schmalkaldic League <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Emperor Charles V and his allies. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 with the Peace of Augsburg but {{continued}} tensions produced a far graver conflict—the Thirty Years' War—which {{broke out in}} 1618. In France, a series of conflicts termed the French Wars of Religion was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the Huguenots (French Calvinists) and {{the forces of the}} French Catholic League. A series of popes sided with and became financial supporters of the Catholic League. This ended under Pope Clement VIII, who hesitantly accepted King Henry IV's 1598 Edict of Nantes, which granted civil and religious toleration to French Protestants.|$|E
5|$|These events led {{rapidly to}} Mary's defeat and {{imprisonment}} in Loch Leven Castle. The Scottish lords {{forced her to}} abdicate in favour of her son James, who {{had been born in}} June 1566. James was taken to Stirling Castle to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from Loch Leven in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch; but she and her council instead chose to play safe. Rather than risk returning Mary to Scotland with an English army or sending her to France <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> enemies of England, they detained her in England, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.|$|E
