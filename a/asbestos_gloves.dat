50|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} {{to using the}} MG 42 was that {{the high rate of}} fire lead to the barrel overheating frequently. After around 150 rounds of continuous fire, the gun operator would open a side hatch (leading to the barrel) and replace the overheated barrel with a new one. The machine gun crew member responsible for a hot barrel change was issued protective <b>asbestos</b> <b>gloves</b> to prevent getting burned.|$|E
50|$|The MG 34 {{was issued}} with 6 {{additional}} interchangeable barrels. The three-man crew that served each weapon was also issued <b>asbestos</b> <b>gloves</b> {{to use when}} changing the barrel. As a result, the sustained rate of fire was very high. The MG 34 was so accurate that it was often mounted on a tripod with a telescopic sight for sniping at very long distances. It was chambered in the standard 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge (often called 8mm).|$|E
5000|$|Roy Lincoln was {{originally}} a scientist {{working with his}} father on a special explosive chemical called [...] "27-QRX." [...] However, when Nazi spies invaded his lab and killed his father, he resorted to ingesting the chemical {{to prevent it from}} falling into their hands. As a result, Lincoln gained the ability to cause explosions in any object he came into contact with, particularly through his hands; the only way to control it was to always wear special <b>asbestos</b> <b>gloves</b> (which were subsequently retconned into [...] "Fibro-wax" [...] gloves after the human health hazards of asbestos were discovered). Donning a containment suit to prevent any accidental explosions, Lincoln became the [...] "Human Bomb," [...] removing his gloves only to expose his explosive powers against Nazi and Japanese enemies, as well as ordinary criminals. He later gained enough control over his powers to be able to remove the containment suit, though the gloves were always necessary.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{convoluted}} and unnecessarily complex {{aspect of the}} M60 was the quick-barrel-change procedure, a critical aspect to any machine gun used for suppressive fire. Although equipped with the same quick-change lever as the MG-42, each barrel on the M60 had a permanently mounted bipod and no carrying handle to grasp during combat barrel changes. The gunner was thus forced {{to come out of}} his prone supported firing position, retract the bipod, lay the entire weapon on the ground and don a large <b>asbestos</b> <b>glove</b> before he could even begin to handle the red-hot barrel to remove it. No other machine gun in history used such a cumbersome system; this system caused the M60 to take far longer to change barrels than other comparable GPMGs. The predictable loss of the glove under combat conditions was also a consistent problem.|$|R
50|$|The foundry {{initially}} used a {{crucible steel}} melting process. Scrap steel metal was melted in crucibles in oil furnaces. The furnace {{was lined with}} fire brick and had a steel cover which was removed for a melter to take a crucible with molten steel from the furnace. The melter was protected by an <b>asbestos</b> suit and <b>gloves</b> as he had to stand right over the intense heat to carefully grab the crucibles with tongs without breaking them. With several employees the two brothers handled the melting and molding. Many a night Walther slept in a hammock in the foundry because he couldn’t leave the work.|$|R
5000|$|Wynne’s {{short story}} {{collection}} The Other World {{was hailed as}} “one of the best books of the decade” by The James White Review. [...] Peopled with circus performers, sociopaths, cross dressing teenagers and God-fearing families, these stories have a hallucinatory edge that makes the everyday seem like another world. Details wrote, “Wynne’s prose is chiseled and precise. And in pages that tremble with beauty, Wynne gracefully reveals {{the darker side of}} human possibilities.”. [...] Booklist called it “startling, outrageous, frightening and sometimes even funny." [...] National Book Award-winner Paul Monette wrote, “With so much tepid and sentimental fiction coming out, Wynne’s stories are like a plunge in cold water with a near-Brechtian intensity of focus and an infallible ear for dialogue, Wynne casts a laser eye on the things we say, so different from what we mean. A book to handle with <b>asbestos</b> <b>gloves,</b> but well worth the walk through fire.” [...] Lambda Award-winner Rebecca Brown called it “an incredibly powerful book.” ...|$|E
40|$|New firefighter's gloves {{are more}} {{flexible}} and comfortable than previous designs. Since some firefighters prefer gloves made of composite materials while others prefer dip-coated gloves, both types were developed. New gloves also find uses in foundries, steelmills, {{and other plants}} where they are substituted for <b>asbestos</b> <b>gloves...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Very {{high fibre}} {{inhalation}} exposure has been measured while people were wearing {{personal protective equipment}} manufactured from chrysotile asbestos. However, there is little data that relates specifically to wearing <b>asbestos</b> <b>gloves</b> or mitts, particularly when used in hot environments such as those found in glass manufacturing. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the likely personal exposure to asbestos fibres when asbestos mitts were used. Results Three types of work activity were simulated in a small test room with unused mitts and artificially aged mitts. Neither pair of mitts were treated to suppress the dust emission. The measured respirable fibre exposure levels ranged from Conclusion People who wore asbestos mitts were likely to have been exposed to relatively low levels of airborne chrysotile asbestos fibres, certainly much lower than the standards that were accepted in the 1960 's and 70 's. The cancer risks from this type of use are likely to be very low. </p...|$|E
