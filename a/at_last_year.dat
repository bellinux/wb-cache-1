40|$|The Air Quality Monitor (AQM) {{was flown}} to the International Space Station (ISS) as an {{experiment}} to evaluate its potential to replace the aging Volatile Organic Analyzer (VOA), which ceased operations in August 2009. The AQM (Figure 1) is a small gas chromatography/differential mobility spectrometer (GC/DMS) manufactured by Sionex. Data was presented <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> s ISIMS conference that detailed {{the preparation of the}} AQM for flight, including instrument calibration. Furthermore, initial AQM data was compared to VOA results from simultaneous runs of the two instruments. Although comparison with VOA data provided a measure of confidence in the AQM performance, it is the comparison with results from simultaneously acquired air samples (grab sample containers-GSCs) that will define the success (or failure) of the AQM performance. This paper will update the progress in the AQM investigation by comparing AQM data to results from the analyses of GSC samples, returned from ISS. Additionally, a couple of example will illustrate the AQM s ability to detect disruptions in the spacecraft s air quality. Discussion will also focus upon a few unexpected issues that have arisen and how these will be a addressed in the final operational unit now being built...|$|E

The risks and design challenges are addressed through a rigorous technology development process that culminates with an integrated thermal control system test. The resulting hardware typically has a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of six. This paper summarizes the development efforts being performed by the technology development project. The development efforts involve heat acquisition and heat rejection hardware including radiators, heat exchangers, and evaporators.

40|$|Mining query {{recommendation}} from query logs {{has attracted a}} lot of attention in recent years. We propose to use query recommendations extracted from the logs of a web search engine to solve the session track tasks. The runs are obtained by using the Search Shortcuts recommender system. The Search Shortcuts technique uses an inverted index and the concept of "successful sessions" present in a web search engine 2 ̆ 7 s query log to produce effective recommendations for both frequent and rare/unseen queries. We adapt the above technique as a query expansion tool and use it to expand the given queries for Session Track at TREC 2011. The expansion is generated by using a method which aims to consider all past queries in the session. The expansion terms obtained are then used to build a global, uniformly weighted, representation of the user session (RL 2). Furthermore, the expansion terms are then combined with a ranked list of results in order to boost terms appearing more frequently in the final results lists (RL 3). Finally, we also integrate dwell times and the weighting method obtained taking both result lists and clicks into account for assigning weights to the terms to expand the final query of the session. In addition to that, we submitted a baseline run. It is based on the observation that using the term "wikipedia" to expand the query resulted in a better retrieval performance for the tasks <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> 2 ̆ 7 s session track at TREC 2010...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the effect of the UVN on disability status and quality of life in stroke patients. Methods: This study was undertaken in the outpatient of the neurological clinic. There were 34 ischemic stroke patients (mean age 60. 5 ± 10. 6 years) in the study. Nineteen of this patients were diagnosed with UVN by using the Line Bisection Test, Letter Cancellation Test and Catherine Bergego Scale. Information was collected on disability status [Barthel Index (BI) and the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) ] and the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) [(SF- 36) ]. Results: It was determinated that the BI and RMI scores in UVN patients were lower than the non-UVN patients (p< 0. 01). In patients with UVN, the SF- 36 subgroups physical functioning (PF), general health, vitality, and emotional role (ER) were negatively influenced and the difference was statistically significant compared with those patients without UVN (p< 0. 05). There was a strong correlation between the BI and the general health perception <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> and a statistically significant correlation between the RMI and physical role (PR) in the UVN group(p< 0. 05). Conclusion: It was found that the disability status was poorer in the stroke patients with UVN which has effected many subgroups of HRQOL negatively. As a consequence, it is required to develop appropriate treatment modalities for this complex, multifactorial syndrome in further studies...|$|E
