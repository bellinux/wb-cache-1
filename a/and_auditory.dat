5|$|Communication among North American river otters is {{accomplished}} mainly by olfactory <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> signals. Scent marking is imperative for intergroup communication. The river otter scent-marks with feces, urine, and possibly anal sac secretions. Musk from the scent glands {{may also be}} secreted when otters are frightened or angry.|$|E
5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.|$|E

5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. The bony facial crest is an obvious candidate, and nasal diverticula may also have been present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> signals.|$|E
5|$|The medial {{zone of the}} {{anterior}} and posterior lobes constitutes the spinocerebellum, also known as paleocerebellum. This sector of the cerebellum functions mainly to fine-tune body and limb movements. It receives proprioceptive input from the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (including the spinocerebellar tract) and from the cranial trigeminal nerve, {{as well as from}} visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> systems. It sends fibers to deep cerebellar nuclei that, in turn, project to both the cerebral cortex and the brain stem, thus providing modulation of descending motor systems.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} hadrosaurids, Edmontosaurus lacked a bony crest. It {{may have had}} soft-tissue display {{structures}} in the skull, though: the bones around the nasal openings had deep indentations surrounding the openings, and this pair of recesses are postulated to have held inflatable air sacs, perhaps allowing for both visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> signaling. Edmontosaurus may have been dimorphic, with more robust and more lightly built forms, {{but it has not}} been established if this is related to sexual dimorphism.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how format of instructional material (auditory-only, visual-only, or combined <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> visual) and participants 2 ̆ 7 learning style preference combinations (low <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> low visual, high <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> low visual, low <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> high visual, or high <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> high visual) influence posttest performance. The following three predictions were tested. First, participants using both the <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> visual instructional materials achieve significantly higher posttest scores than participants using the visual-only or auditory-only materials. Second, participants from the high <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> high visual learning style preference group achieve significantly higher posttest scores than participants from the high <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> low visual, or the low <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> high visual, or the low <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> low visual learning style preference groups. Third, participants using instructional material either over-matched or matched to their learning style preference achieve significantly higher posttest scores than participants using instructional material unmatched to their learning style preference. ^ A sample of 190 nursing students was assessed for learning style preference using the Nurse Entrance Test and for previous knowledge using a pretest. Participants were blocked into one of the four learning style preference groups and assigned randomly to one of three instructional material treatment groups. The treatment lasted 30 minutes and was followed immediately by post-testing. ^ ANOVA and ANCOVA with pretest as covariate results indicated that there were no significant interactions between learning style preference and instructional material on posttest performance. Participants using both the <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> visual instructional material or the visual-only material achieved significantly higher posttest scores than those using the auditory-only material. Learning style preference group did not significantly affect posttest performance. The degree of match between learning style preference and instructional material did not significantly affect posttest performance. ...|$|R

5|$|Bat {{echolocation}} is a perceptual {{system where}} ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, the brain <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> nervous system can produce detailed {{images of the}} bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localize, and even classify their prey in complete darkness. Bat calls {{are some of the}} most intense, airborne animal sounds, and can range in intensity from between 60 and 140 decibels. Microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit the sound through their mouth and sometimes their nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Microbat calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000Hz, extending beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000Hz).|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} nasal arch of Gryposaurus, {{like other}} cranial modifications in duckbills, {{may have been}} used for a variety of social functions, such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking. It could also have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social contests, and there may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> signaling. The top of the arch is roughened in some specimens, suggesting that it was covered by thick, keratinized skin, or that there was a cartilaginous extension.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> tube develop from {{the first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Lincoln Center campus {{and some of the}} Upper West Side community residents have been strained, over campus development. In 2010 the New York State Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against Fordham brought by the Alfred Condominium Complex. The suit was filed in response to the University's expansion plans at Lincoln Center and their expected visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> impact on the surrounding community. The Lincoln Center campus does, however, have a lively connection to the artistic scene in Manhattan through its dance and theater productions and visual art exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{birds are}} known to {{communicate}} using visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology. Reconstruction of the plumage color of Anchiornis huxleyi, suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs. The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the larynx and the latter through the unique syrinx, suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of paranoia and hallucinations {{in old age}} have been related to both <b>auditory</b> <b>and</b> visual impairment, and individuals with paraphrenia often present with {{one or both of}} these impairments.

5|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Bouba/Kiki phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia. Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba. It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> cortices. For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al. have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.|$|E
5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} {{behavioural}} {{theory is that}} the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal, and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size.|$|E

5|$|The player {{needs to}} make moral {{decisions}} at certain points during the game, including making choices that can determine the fate of both soldiers and civilians. These decisions affect the relationship between Walker and his squadmates, and will cause them to react differently. The game has several subtle effects as the team starts being broken mentally and physically, including the degradation of their combat uniforms. Walker has visual <b>and</b> <b>auditory</b> hallucinations later into the game, and his executions of enemies become more violent. The orders and shouts to his team become increasingly angry and ragged in contrast to his original stern command voice. His kill confirmations of enemies corrupts from professional in the beginning to psychotic. Similarly, loading screens initially display helpful gameplay hints for the player, but as the game progresses, the text becomes increasingly hostile towards Walker's actions, and sometimes breaks the fourth wall by addressing the player directly. The game features collectibles known as Intel, which are audio logs that provide additional backstory for players.|$|E
