50|$|A {{baseband}} channel or lowpass channel (or system, or network) is {{a communication}} channel that can transfer frequencies {{that are very}} near zero. Examples are serial cables and local area networks (LANs), as opposed to passband channels such as radio frequency channels and passband filtered wires of the <b>analog</b> <b>telephone</b> network. Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) allows an <b>analog</b> <b>telephone</b> wire to carry a baseband telephone call, concurrently as one or several carrier-modulated telephone calls.|$|R

40|$|ICSLP 1998 : the 5 th International Conference on Spoken Language Processing, November 30 - December 4, 1998, Sydney, Australia. In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{performance of}} model adaptation by the previously proposed HMM decomposition method on telephone speech recognition. The HMM decomposition method separates a composed HMM into a known phoneme HMM and an unknown noise and channel HMM by maximum likelihood (ML) {{estimation of the}} HMM parameters. A transfer function (telephone channel) HMM is estimated using adaptation speech data by applying the HMM decomposition twice in the linear spectral domain for noise and in the cepstral domain for channel. The telephone speech data for evaluation are recorded through 10 kinds of ordinary <b>analog</b> <b>telephone</b> handsets and cordless telephone handsets. The test {{results show that the}} average phrase accuracy with the clean speech HMMs is 60. 9 % for the ordinary <b>analog</b> <b>telephone</b> handsets, and 19. 6 % for the cordless telephone handsets. By the HMM decomposition method, the average phrase accuracy is improved to 78. 1 % for the ordinary <b>analog</b> <b>telephone</b> handsets, and 50. 5 % for the cordless telephone handsets...|$|R

50|$|The {{defining}} {{example of}} a circuit-switched network is the early <b>analog</b> <b>telephone</b> network.
