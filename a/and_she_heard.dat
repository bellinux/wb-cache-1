25|$|In February 2014, Rosie Perez {{published}} an autobiography titled Handbook for an Unpredictable Life: How I Survived Sister Renata and My Crazy Mother, and Still Came Out Smiling... She {{is also the}} reader of the audio CD of this book. Perez said that she didn't initially set out to write an autobiography, but rather a book that analyzes the causes and effects of child abuse. She said it wasn't until about 6 months after the book was published <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> responses from others that she found the experience cathartic.|$|E
25|$|Dillinger and Van Meter resided at Probasco's {{home until}} {{the last week of}} June 1934; that on some {{occasions}} they would be away for a day or two, sometimes leaving separately, and on other occasions together; that at this time Van Meter usually parked his car in the rear of Probasco's residence outside the back fence; that she gathered that Dillinger was keeping company with a young woman who lived {{on the north side of}} Chicago, inasmuch as he would state upon leaving Probasco's home that he was going in the direction of Diversey Boulevard; that Van Meter apparently was not acquainted with Dillinger's friend, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> him warning Dillinger to be careful about striking up acquaintances with girls he knew nothing about; that Dillinger and Van Meter usually kept a machine gun in an open case under the piano in the parlor; that they also kept a shotgun under the parlor table.|$|E
500|$|The {{stress and}} {{uncertainty}} of captivity took {{their toll on}} Anastasia {{as well as her}} family. [...] "Goodby [...] ", she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917. [...] "Don't forget us." [...] At Tobolsk, she wrote a melancholy theme for her English tutor, filled with spelling mistakes, about [...] "Evelyn Hope", a poem by Robert Browning about a young girl: [...] "When she died she was only sixteen years old ... Ther(e) was a man who loved her without having seen her but (k)new her very well. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>he(a)rd</b> of him also. He never could tell her that he loved her, and now she was dead. But still he thought that when he and she will live [...] next life whenever it will be that...", she wrote.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas was filmed between August 20 and August 21, 2012 in Los Angeles. A cut from the video premiered on NBC's The Voice on September 17. A video teaser was released on Aguilera's YouTube channel on September 17, 2012. The official music video premiered on Vevo on September 28, 2012. Aguilera commented about the collaboration with Matsoukas, [...] "Once we started talking with each other <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> 'Your Body,' she spun {{it in a way}} that you wouldn't expect at all. And I get to play this character that, yeah, she may be a little bit of a badass, she's very confident, self-assured, but she's super playful and super tongue-in-cheek. She laughs the whole way through the video. She's watching cartoons, and you know she doesn't take herself too seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Yoko Shimomura {{would later}} become a {{well-established}} video game composer through her work on the Kingdom Hearts series. Additional arrangements were done by Shigeo Tamaru. Despite her previous work as lead composer on Super Mario RPG, Parasite Eve became her breakout project and garnered her international fame. During her work on Parasite Eve, Shimomura spent time in America, which was {{where much of the}} game's staff came from. Because of this, Shimomura remembered the game as her most challenging project. She wanted the music to be experimental, not falling into ambient or techno classifications. One of her main goals was to create something [...] "inorganic" [...] and recognizable as a product of Square. Until Parasite Eve, Shimomura had written music in a straightforward manner that reflected her then-current state of mind, but this time she restrained herself and took a more [...] "emotionless" [...] approach. She felt that this would best represent the game's atmosphere and Aya's stoic attitude. Ultimately, she felt that Parasite Eve was an experimental work in many ways. Due to its prevalence in the story, Shimomura used opera music, but as typical opera music did not translate well into battle themes, Shimomura added different rhythms: these rhythms were inspired when some of the game's American staff took her to a nightclub <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the background music there. The music recording took place at the Andora Studios in Los Angeles.|$|E

60|$|He {{went out}} of the room, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> him walking about his room in the L, putting {{together}} his few belongings.

60|$|At that he wavered, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> {{his teeth}} sliding against each other, {{as if he}} could no longer clench them.|$|E
