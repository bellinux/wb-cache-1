5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

25|$|I <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> {{to be able}} {{to inform}} you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E

500|$|Following his {{departure}} from the Grand Fleet, the king had a message sent to the officers and men of the ships he had just left. It began with a warm reference to the American squadron: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to have found myself once more with the Grand Fleet, and this pleasure has been increased by the opportunity I have had of seeing the splendid ships of the United States in line with our own, and of meeting Admiral Rodman together with the officers and men under him.

500|$|Allan Bakke, [...] "America's {{best known}} freshman", {{enrolled}} at the UC Davis medical school on September 25, 1978. [...] Seemingly oblivious to the questions {{of the press and}} the shouts of protesters, he stated only [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to be here" [...] before entering to register. When the university declined to pay his legal fees, Bakke went to court, and on January 15, 1980, was awarded $183,089. Graduating from the UC Davis medical school in 1982 at age 42, he went on to a career as an anesthesiologist at the Mayo Clinic and at the Olmsted Medical Group in Rochester, Minnesota.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to San Clemente, California, in 1974 and settling into the Nixons' home, La Casa Pacifica, Pat Nixon rarely appeared {{in public and}} only granted occasional interviews to the press. In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood town of Artesia to dedicate the Patricia Nixon Elementary School. In her remarks, she said, [...] "I'm proud to have the school carry my name.

500|$|A {{period of}} hard work for Verdi—with the {{creation}} of twenty operas (excluding revisions and translations)—followed over the next sixteen years, culminating in Un ballo in maschera. This period was not without its frustrations and setbacks for the young composer, and he was frequently demoralised. In April 1845, in connection with I due Foscari, he wrote: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>happy,</b> no matter what reception it gets, and I am utterly indifferent to everything. I cannot wait for these next three years to pass. I have to write six operas, then addio to everything." [...] In 1858 Verdi complained: [...] "Since Nabucco, you may say, I have never had one hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys." ...|$|E
500|$|Discrimination also {{extended}} to those {{killed during the}} war.

Then-U.S. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson and Hector P. Garcia, the Mexican-American World War II veteran who founded the American G.I. Forum, intervened on Longoria's behalf. Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson, Congressman John Lyle, and President Truman's military aide Gen. Harry H. Vaughan joined the Longoria family for a full military burial with honors at Arlington National Cemetery on February 16, 1949. Johnson stated of the incident, [...] "This injustice and prejudice is deplorable.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Times of India, Karan Johar explained that he harboured intentions of remaking the original Agneepath ever since the film released in 1990. Though the film had received critical acclaim over the years, its commercial failure had devastated his father, producer Yash Johar. The idea of a possible remake materialised on the sets of Johar's directorial My Name Is Khan, in which Karan Malhotra was an assistant director. Johar told Malhotra of his desire to remake the original film {{and asked him to}} revisit it again. On not directing the film himself, Johar commented, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> directing films on love, romance and drama. That's what I do best. I don't think I will be good at an action film. So I am not taking the reins of the film in my hand".|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|Carradine {{knew nothing}} of the {{practice}} of kung fu {{at the time he was}} cast in the role of Kwai Chang Caine; instead, he relied on his experience as a dancer for the part. He also had experience in sword fighting, boxing, and street fighting on which to draw. For the first half of the original series, David Chow provided technical assistance with kung fu. He never considered himself a master of the art, but rather an [...] "evangelist" [...] of kung fu. By 2003 he had acquired enough expertise in martial arts to produce and star in several instructional videos on T'ai chi and Qigong. In 2005, Carradine visited the Shaolin Monastery in Henan, China as part of the extra features for the third season of the Kung Fu DVDs. During his visit, the abbot, Shi Yǒngxìn, said that he recognized Carradine's important contribution to the promotion of the Shaolin Monastery and kung fu culture, to which Carradine replied, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to serve." ...|$|E

On each occasion, Raonic won the first set before losing the next two. After the Halle Open match, Federer remarked: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to have beaten him now because by the end of my career, he’ll be serving at 300km/h." [...] He defeated world No. 4 Murray in straight sets in the quarterfinals at the Barcelona Open. This marked his first victory over a member of the Big Four.

During his renewal, he said, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> at Juventus and we are competitive. I want to keep playing {{for as long as}} I can and I'm certain that for at least two more years I will be at the top level." [...] On 14 February 2010, Del Piero marked his 445th Serie A appearance, breaking the all-time club record previously held by Boniperti, with a brace in a 3–2 win against Genoa.

500|$|At the Giants Pérez {{hoped for}} a fresh start; rumors had swirled in Kansas City about {{problems}} in the clubhouse, {{and it was no}} secret that the trade had been deeply unpopular in both Denver and Kansas City.

[...] Pérez hit [...]256 {{over the course of the}} 2003 season; an improvement on his previous season but a far cry from the Colorado days. Pérez returned for the 2004 season, but the situation in San Francisco had become uncomfortable. Although signed as a starter at second base, he quickly became backup to José Cruz, Jr., while he lost out at shortstop to Deivi Cruz. His batting average slumped to [...]232. He had a staunch defender in manager Felipe Alou, but in the end he was the [...] "odd man out" [...] and the Giants released him on August 14, 2004.
