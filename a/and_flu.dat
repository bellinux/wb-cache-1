New Zealand Customs and police officers continued to make large interceptions of precursor substances believed to be destined for methamphetamine production. On 9 October 2009, Prime Minister John Key announced pseudoephedrine-based cold <b>and</b> <b>flu</b> tablets would become prescription-only drugs and reclassified as a class B2 drug. The law was amended by The Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill 2010, which passed in August 2011.|$|E

After the initial surprise, three supporters (one of whom had already fortified himself with two pints and a pork pie) volunteered. Registration formalities were completed just in time, and the match (later to be dubbed [...] "The Pie and Pints Match") went ahead.

40|$|Flu viruses have mainly {{affected}} humans, {{birds and}} pigs worldwide. During the past 10 years these viruses are in limelight at {{a global level}} due to pandemic threats of Avian / Bird <b>Flu</b> <b>and</b> Swine <b>Flu</b> <b>and</b> their public health impacts, with added pandemic of swine flu virus recently. The current ongoing episodes of bird <b>flu</b> <b>and</b> swine <b>flu</b> are beyond the control, when and where or which country they start with nobody can predict. The continuous evolution and emergence of new strains indicate that the flu viruses {{are becoming more and more}} dangerous and this situation has posed a challenge to researchers to discover effective vaccines and therapeutics. Moreover, the role of pig as ‘mixing bowl’ for the virus to get reassorted has added to the complicated epidemiological scenario. The swine flu H 1 N 1 reassorted subtype caused the first global pandemic in last 40 years, resulting in substantial illness, hospitalizations of millions of peoples and thousands of deaths throughout the world. A pace is there within these novel <b>and</b> emerging <b>flu</b> viruses <b>and</b> the scientific community, where the scientific community has to win the race so as to save the mankind. In this review, a brief overview on swine flu is presented highlighting the characteristics of the causative virus, the disease and its public health consequences, advances made in its diagnosis, vaccine and control, precautionary measures to be adapted in the wake of an outbreak...|$|R
