5|$|In 2016, Nintendo {{released}} , {{the first}} title in six years. Nintendo were widely criticized for releasing a multiplayer and soccer focussed spin-off, {{rather than a}} core series title <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> long interim. The following year saw the release of , a side-scrolling remake of the , with Metroid Prime 4 announced for the Nintendo Switch in future.|$|E
5|$|The {{drilling}} {{project has}} been opposed by some environmental groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact. The main {{concern is that the}} lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from refreezing. Scientists of the United States National Research Council have taken the position that it should be assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.|$|E
5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Fertig {{spent four}} years as the {{officer-in-charge}} of ROTC at the Colorado School of Mines, a surprisingly low-level post <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> distinguished war time career.|$|E
25|$|The grand final against Newtown was {{a fitting}} finale <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> season. Newtown led 11-7 with six minutes to go. But the never-say-die Souths {{scrambled}} a try to halfback, Col Donohoe and converted it through Purcell {{to complete the}} fairytale with a 12-11 last gasp victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} Zionism {{has meant that}} the {{percentage}} of the world's Jewish population who live in Israel has steadily grown over the years and today 40% of the world's Jews live in Israel. There is no other example in human history of a nation being reestablished <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> long period of existence as a diaspora.|$|E

25|$|However, Boyd showed few {{signs of}} {{adapting}} to Championship football, leaving many Luton fans frustrated with Boyd's lack of form <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> big money move for a club of Luton's financial situation. Boyd ended an unhappy spell with the Hatters by {{being released from}} his contract, after Town were relegated to League One. Boyd spent one year at Luton Town, scoring only two goals in twenty-three first team games.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Laudrup {{completed}} a controversial move from Barça to Real Madrid after he fell-out with Johan Cruyff. On this, Laudrup stated {{he did not}} have a hidden agenda. It was the year before the 1994 FIFA World Cup and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> major international tournament, he correctly predicted that Barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{appearance}} of the new moon earlier than was expected was regarded as unfavourable - prognosticating in one case defeat, in another death among cattle, in a third bad crops - not necessarily because these events actually took place <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> phenomenon, but by an application of the general principle resting upon association of ideas whereby anything premature would suggest an unfavourable occurrence.|$|E

25|$|There is {{speculation}} by {{some historians}} that Suleiman's main objective in 1529 was actually to assert Ottoman {{control over the}} whole of Hungary, {{the western part of}} which (known as Royal Hungary) was under Habsburg control. The decision to attack Vienna <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> long interval in Suleiman's European campaign is viewed as an opportunistic manoeuvre after his decisive victory in Hungary. Other scholars theorise that the suppression of Hungary simply marked the prologue to a later, premeditated invasion of Europe.|$|E
25|$|This episode's {{original}} ending {{involved the}} Doctor, following {{the final scene}} where he is alone in the TARDIS, being alerted to something on the monitor and as he checks two Cybermen rise up behind him. This was supposed to lead directly into The Next Doctor, but Davies was convinced by Benjamin Cook (who was corresponding with Davies for the book Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale) to drop the scene, as he felt that a cliffhanger was not appropriate <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> sad ending.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> performance, Carr {{was chosen}} for two more matches that season, one of them against a Nottinghamshire team captained by his namesake Arthur Carr and the other against Lancashire. He could manage only 4, 28 and 2 in his three innings, however, and was no more {{successful}} (making 7, 4 and 2) in the couple of games he played in 1922. He was to play only one more first-class match, three years later against Somerset, but again he failed, making 0 and 4 in an innings defeat.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{stepping}} {{across the}} open space before the bar, he drew the leathern gauntlet off his hand and threw it straight into Morella's face, thinking that <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> insult he could not choose but fight.|$|R

25|$|Σ is of codimension one, {{and so one}} may cut M along Σ. <b>After</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> cutting M will be a {{manifold}} with boundary and {{in particular}} classically the dynamics of Σ will be described by a WZW model. Witten has shown that this correspondence holds even quantum mechanically. More precisely, he demonstrated that the Hilbert space of states is always finite-dimensional and can be canonically identified with the space of conformal blocks of the G WZW model at level k. Conformal blocks are locally holomorphic and antiholomorphic factors whose products sum to the correlation functions of a 2-dimensional conformal field theory.|$|E
25|$|EU law only applies {{fully to}} {{the part of the}} island that is {{effectively}} controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus. EU law is suspended in the northern third of the island (the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, whose independence is recognised only by Turkey) by article1(1) of the Cyprus Protocol. If the island is reunified, the Council of the European Union will repeal the suspension by a decision. Four months <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> decision has been adopted, new elections to the European Parliament will be held on the island to elect Cypriot representatives from the whole of the island.|$|E
25|$|By lunch {{the score}} had gone past 150, with both openers passing their half-centuries. After a well earned break, they resumed {{where they had}} left off, scoring freely {{throughout}} the afternoon. By tea they had gone past 200, Taylor the first to bring up his century, followed soon after by Marsh. The pair, {{as might be expected}} <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> long day, had slowed down in the final session, but by stumps Australia's score stood at 301 for 0. Taylor was not out on 141 and Marsh not out on 125. It was the first time ever in history that no wicket had fallen {{on the first day of}} a test match in England.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} decades {{were relatively}} quiet <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> dominant era during the 1920s. Stade Toulousain {{would not make}} it to any grand finals during the 1930s, {{and it would not}} be until the late 1940s when they would return. However they did contest the Challenge Yves du Manoir with RC Toulon in 1934, though it ended in a nil-all tie and both teams were winners. The club made it to the final of the 1947 championship, and claimed the premiership, beating SU Agen, 10 to 3. However, no such championships followed, the club was again relatively quiet on the championship. It was 22 years in the waiting; Toulouse made it to the final, but were defeated by the CA Bègles club.|$|E
25|$|Maegashira ranked five {{or below}} {{are likely to}} only fight amongst {{themselves}} (unless their winning record {{in the middle of}} a tournament prompts their scheduling with higher-ranked wrestlers) while those ranked maegashira four or above are likely to have several matches against san'yaku wrestlers, including ōzeki and yokozuna. When a maegashira defeats a yokozuna, it is called a gold star or kinboshi and he is rewarded monetarily for the victory for the remainder of his career. A bout where a wrestler earns a kinboshi defeat of a yokozuna generally causes great excitement at a sumo venue and it is common and expected for audience members to throw their seat cushions into the ring (and onto the wrestlers) <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> bout, though this is technically prohibited.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{detection}} experiments aim {{to observe}} low-energy recoils (typically a few keVs) of nuclei induced by interactions with particles of dark matter, which (in theory) are {{passing through the}} Earth. <b>After</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> recoil the nucleus will emit energy as e.g. scintillation light or phonons, which is then detected by sensitive apparatus. In order to do this effectively {{it is crucial to}} maintain a low background, and so such experiments operate deep underground to reduce the interference from cosmic rays. Examples of underground laboratories which house direct detection experiments include the Stawell mine, the Soudan mine, the SNOLAB underground laboratory at Sudbury, the Gran Sasso National Laboratory, the Canfranc Underground Laboratory, the Boulby Underground Laboratory, the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory and the China Jinping Underground Laboratory.|$|E

50|$|Instead of {{settling}} down <b>after</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> ordeal, Couture {{decided to go}} straight back to Huron Country. In 1646 he was reported as working in the Huron missions with Father Pijart. He only did this for only two years between 1645 and 1647.|$|R
