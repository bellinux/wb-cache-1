5|$|The boys of South Park Elementary School are anxiously {{awaiting}} the night's episode of Terrance and Phillip, {{which ended in}} a cliffhanger last season, while the girls at the school express disgust over the show and the boys' obsession with fart jokes. Cartman retaliates by farting in a little girl's face, which causes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> to laugh. After school, the boys gather in Cartman's house to watch the episode. To their horror, it is then revealed that, as an April Fools Day joke, the channel is airing a new show called the Queef Sisters, about Canadian sisters Katherine (voiced by Trey Parker) and Katie Queef (voiced by Matt Stone). They {{are very similar to}} Terrance and Phillip, but instead of fart jokes, they make queef jokes. The show starts a queefing movement across the country, and men everywhere get upset and disgusted by the queefs, although the women do not understand what the problem is. Though the women of South Park argue that there is no difference between queefing and farting, the men are revolted by queefs, while still finding their own fart jokes amusing.|$|E

25|$|Speculating on why Weir did {{not receive}} a medal during the Olympics {{even though he had}} good {{technical}} scores, Claude Mailhot of RDS network said, “This may not be politically correct, but do you think he lost points due to his costume and his body language?” Alain Goldberg replied ”They’ll think <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> who skate will end up like him. It sets a bad example.” Goldberg and Mailhot then made bigoted jokes about how Weir should 'compete in the women’s division'.|$|E

As a student, he became friends with the actor Leonid Limontov, {{although}} in his memoirs Limontov recalls his reluctance to become friends with Scriabin, who was the smallest and weakest among <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> and was sometimes teased due to his stature. However, Scriabin won his peers' approval at a concert where he performed on the piano. He ranked generally first in his class academically, but was exempt from drilling due to his physique and was given time each day to practise at the piano.|$|E

However, once the battle begins, the griefer summons giant {{scorpions}} and easily dispatches the boys' characters. Cartman convinces Stan, Kyle, and Kenny to keep playing. For the next two months, the boys play the game for 21 hours a day, killing low-level boars in the game's forests to gain experience points. In the process, the boys become lazy, long-haired, obese and acne-ridden. The boys' characters grow so quickly that the Blizzard executives, who have also been monitoring the griefer, take notice.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{had many}} goals. Stewart had sole medical charge of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> and girls at Lovedale, {{but he also}} {{wanted to create a}} {{hospital}} there. His first attempt did not work, however {{with the help of the}} Colonial Government he opened the Victoria hospital. He gained the respect of natives by charging a small amount for the medicine and treatment he gave them. This made them value his care more. The hospital was opened in 1898 and after a few obstacles had an annual attendance of five thousand. Stewart also wanted to create a medical college, and planned to eventually expand the hospital at Lovedale into a medical school. He wanted the people of Ethiopia to have access to a full medical education.|$|E

When describing Kyle, Stone states that both he and the character are [...] "reactionary", and susceptible to irritability and impatience. In some instances, Kyle is the only child in his class to not initially indulge in a fad or fall victim to a ploy. This has resulted in both his eagerness to fit in, and his resentment and frustration.|$|E

500|$|Early Christian traditions {{describe}} Jesus {{as being}} born in Bethlehem: in one, a verse in the Book of Micah is {{interpreted as a}} prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. The New Testament has two different accounts of the birth. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus' parents live in Nazareth and travel for the Census of Quirinius to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born, after which they return home. The Gospel of Matthew [...] mentions Bethlehem but not the census. Told that a 'King of the Jews' has been born in the town, Herod orders the killing of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> aged two and under in the town and surrounding area. Joseph, warned of by an angel of the Lord, flees to Egypt with his family; the Holy Family later settles in Nazareth.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] {{talks about}} Aguilera {{adopting}} a new persona and new musical experiments. At the beginning, Aguilera admits that [...] "Tonight I'm {{feeling a little}} out of control". At the pre-chorus, she sings [...] "The old me's gone and I feel brand new, and if you don't like it, fuck you", which takes aim at anyone who dismisses her new style; meanwhile, she declares her musical departure from her previous 1940s and 1950s inspired album Back to Basics (2006) at the chorus with the line, [...] "I'm not myself tonight, tonight I'm not the same girl". The song also evokes sexual theme, with lyrics such as [...] "I'm dancin' a lot, I'm takin' shots and I'm feelin' fine/ I'm kissin' <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> and girls". Writing for Billboard magazine, Michael Menachem opined that Aguilera channeled a [...] "more 'Euro-glamorous' version" [...] of her previous alter ego [...] "Xtina", featured in her 2002 hit [...] "Dirrty" [...] from Stripped.|$|E

In order to bring Kaliokalani back to school, kahu John Papa ʻĪʻī openly confronted the high chiefess, stepped on her lap and seized the boy from her hands. ʻĪʻī told the chiefess: [...] "Not only is it asked of your moʻopuna [...] but of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> of me, and of their teachers. This strengthens the body like all other kinds of exercise, to the benefit of the child.

500|$|... "Slow" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by music critics. Ethan Brown from New York praised {{the production of}} the song and commented [...] "Everything {{at the top of the}} pops should sound as good as Kylie Minogue's [...] "Slow"". He further felt that most of the songs on Body Language [...] "mimic its sound, [...] none of the other songs on Body Language come close to the achievement of [...] "Slow" [...] and concluded that [...] ""Slow" [...] should be a template for pop singers who fancy themselves aesthetes". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters commented that the song was [...] "one of the strongest singles" [...] of Minogue’s career, praising her minimalistic approach on the song and its simple arrangement. The Spin magazine review of the song complimented Minogue's vocals, saying that they will [...] "bring <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> to the yard". Eric Seguy from Stylus Magazine favoured Minogue's demanding vocals, saying that the listener [...] "is open to Kylie’s demands, and willing to resort to any means necessary to impress her".

500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E
