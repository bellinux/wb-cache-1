5|$|Sources give differing {{reports of}} what {{happened}} next. Wiesenthal's autobiographies contradict each other on many points; he also over-dramatised and mythologised events. One version has Wiesenthal opening an <b>architectural</b> <b>office</b> and finally being admitted to the Lwów Polytechnic for an advanced degree. He designed a tuberculosis sanatorium, along with some residential buildings {{during the course of}} his studies and was active in a student Zionist organisation. He wrote for the Omnibus, a satirical student newspaper, and graduated in 1939. Author Guy Walters states that Wiesenthal's earliest autobiography does not mention studies at Lwów. Walters quotes a curriculum vitae Wiesenthal prepared after World War II as stating he worked as a supervisor at a factory until 1939 and then worked as a mechanic in a different factory until the Nazis invaded in 1941. Wiesenthal's 1961 book Ich Jagte Eichmann ("I Hunted Eichmann") states that he worked in Odessa as an engineer from 1940 to 1941. Walters says that there is no record of Wiesenthal attending the university at Lwów, and that he does not appear in the Katalog Architektów i Budowniczych (Catalogue of Architects and Builders) for the appropriate period.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{architectural}} students’ ‘year-out’ {{learning experiences}} in <b>architectural</b> <b>offices</b> after completing RIBA Part I study within a UK university. By interviewing and analysing their {{reflections on the}} experience, the study examines how individual architecture students perceive and value their learning experience in <b>architectural</b> <b>offices</b> and how students understand and integrate {{what they have learned}} through two distinct elements of their training: in university and in <b>offices.</b> The <b>architectural</b> <b>offices</b> that students worked with vary in terms of workforce size and projects undertaken. The students’ training experience is not unified. The processes of engaging with concrete situations in real projects may permit students to follow opportunities that most inspire them and to develop their differing expertise, but their development in offices can also be restricted by the vicissitudes of market economics. This study has demonstrated that architectural students’ learning and development in <b>architectural</b> <b>offices</b> continued through ‘learning by doing’ and used drawings as primary design and communicative media. Working in offices gave weight to both explicit and tacit knowledge and used subjective judgments. A further understanding was also achieved about what architects are and what they do in practice. The realities of their architectural practice experience discouraged some Part I students from progressing into the next stage of architectural education, Part II, but for others it demonstrated that a career in architecture was ‘achievable’. This study argues that creative design, practical and technical abilities are not separate skill-sets that are developed in the university and in <b>architectural</b> <b>offices</b> respectively. They are linked and united in the learning process required to become a professional architect. The study also suggests that education in the university should do more to prepare students for their training in practice.

After earning a PhD from the University of Edinburgh in 1998, she practiced architecture in Bristol. Her research has explored teaching and learning in architectural education.

25|$|The {{paradox of}} the early Bauhaus was that, {{although}} its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building, the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919–1927), {{he and his partner}} Adolf Meyer observed no real distinction between the output of his <b>architectural</b> <b>office</b> and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in Jena, and the competition design for the Chicago Tribune Tower, which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 Haus am Horn, student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, she {{enrolled}} {{for further}} graduate studies at Cornell University but fell seriously ill {{and had to}} drop out. During her recovery, she dreamt of building her own house and was encouraged by her friend, architect Bernard Maybeck, to sketch her ideas. After buying a small property near her beloved Blackberry Canyon in Berkeley with an inheritance, she hired an architect, William Knowles, to prepare the construction drawings. The House focuses on natural light and views of the San Francisco Bay. The home's exterior is clad with brown shingles as typical for First Bay Tradition houses. The interior featured local unpainted redwood paneling and built-in window seats that could be transformed into beds for visitors. In 1908 she added a studio on {{the upper part of}} the property which would later serve as her <b>architectural</b> <b>office.</b> For many years, Lillian Bridgman lived with her sister, Irene, a nurse, sometimes staying in the studio and renting out the front house to boarders.|$|E
25|$|Sharon spent a {{month in}} Berlin and arrived at the Bauhaus in Dessau, where he was {{admitted}} to the preliminary course – the famous Bauhaus Vorkurs – by Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus. Sharon studied under Josef Albers, whose teachings were based on letting the student experience different materials, trying them out, and making experiments. Sharon’s exercises – turning two-dimensional sheets of paper and metal into three-dimensional shapes – were shown in a Bauhaus exhibition. In April 1927, Hannes Meyer was appointed head of the building department and Sharon was to be greatly influenced by his teacher’s pragmatical and functional approach to architecture. In 1928 he and two other Bauhäusler, Gunta Stölzl, head of the Bauhaus weaving workshop and the student Peer Bücking visited the Vkhutemas Academy in Moscow, an avant garde art school with similar aims as the Bauhaus. In 1929, some time after their return, Sharon and Stölzl were married and their daughter Yael was born. In the same year, he received his Bauhaus diploma and was immediately put in charge of Hannes Meyer’s <b>architectural</b> <b>office</b> in Berlin, to supervise the construction of the Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (ADGB Trade Union School) in Bernau bei Berlin,.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} company was founded, {{production}} started in the SAT factory in Vallila, Helsinki. The Yhteissisu vehicles were built separately from SAT vehicles.

Yhteissisu bought [...] of land on 14 March 1944. A contract for factory construction was signed with a contractor on 30 March. The Railway Administration accepted Yhteissisu's plan to build a railway connection in the area. Quarrying work for the underground workshop began in July 1944. The expense and a shortage of time meant the plan had to be amended, and the entire production area was built above ground. The factory buildings were completed in early November 1944.
