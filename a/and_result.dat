5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs.

5|$|August 28, 1998- Strong {{waves and}} rip {{currents}} {{are caused by}} Hurricane Bonnie over the western Atlantic Ocean.

5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of the die cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from the die.

5|$|Foreign comics, {{especially}} Japanese, {{became quite}} successful in Canada, and stood out for gaining {{large numbers of}} female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books. They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as child pornography <b>and</b> <b>result</b> in jail terms.|$|E
5|$|In August, the Japanese {{government}} refused surrender demands as specifically {{outlined in}} the Potsdam Declaration. With the invasion of mainland Japan imminent, Truman approved the schedule for dropping the two available bombs. Truman always said that attacking Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides; military estimates for the invasion of mainland Japan were that it could take a year <b>and</b> <b>result</b> in 250,000 to 500,000 American casualties. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later, leaving 105,000 dead. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 9 and invaded Manchuria. Japan agreed to surrender the following day.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{poisoning}} {{incidents are}} unintentional <b>and</b> <b>result</b> from errors in identification.

In an episode in Oregon, four members of a Korean family required liver transplants.

5|$|In glycolysis, glucose and {{glycerol}} are metabolized to pyruvate. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, PGK and pyruvate kinase. Two equivalents of NADH {{are also}} produced, {{which can be}} oxidized via the electron transport chain <b>and</b> <b>result</b> in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle.|$|E
5|$|In mid-October, {{the comet}} {{developed}} a notable antitail, pointing towards the Sun.

5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, hospice care {{may be difficult}} to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having most of their care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can be complicated <b>and</b> <b>result</b> in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies {{took over}} at their 39-yard line, and {{immediately}} found success. Randall connected on two 10-yard passes {{to take the}} Hokies into Air Force territory. The two passes were followed by a 16-yard run by Tech fullback Doug Easlick for another first down at the Air Force 24-yard line. From there, the Tech ground game continued to eat up yards <b>and</b> <b>result</b> in first downs. Kevin Jones ran the ball twice for 11yards, then Lee Suggs ran the ball three times for 13yards, the last carry also resulting in a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point gave Tech its first lead of the game, 17–10, with 4:45 remaining.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake breeds from Britain and Ireland east through Europe {{to central}} Siberia. Although it has {{vanished}} from {{much of its}} historic range, this bird was once found in suitable habitats in Eurasia everywhere between latitudes 41°N and 62°N. There is also a sizable population in western China, but this species nests only rarely in northern Spain and in Turkey. Old claims of breeding in South Africa are incorrect, <b>and</b> <b>result</b> from misidentification of eggs in a museum collection which are actually those of the African rail.|$|E
5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure.

Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E

5|$|Viral {{infections in}} animals provoke an immune {{response}} that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses {{can also be}} produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. However, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses <b>and</b> <b>result</b> in chronic infections. Antibiotics {{have no effect on}} viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed.|$|E
5|$|Weak {{attacks from}} uke {{allow for a}} {{conditioned}} response from tori, <b>and</b> <b>result</b> in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that {{there is no need to}} adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E
5|$|While copper IUDs may {{increase}} menstrual bleeding <b>and</b> <b>result</b> in more painful cramps hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether.
