2500|$|Eric Zorn, {{writing for}} the Chicago Tribune, criticized Encinia for his {{handling}} of the traffic stop, calling him a [...] "petty tyrant" [...] and referring to his [...] "Are you done?" [...] as [...] "snippy condescension familiar to anyone experienced in the bickering arts". However, he also said Bland was unnecessarily argumentative. [...] "...ou must always defer meekly to the police. Even when they're acting like bullies, goading you or issuing you preposterous orders like to put out your cigarette <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> in your own car, don't challenge their authority....Comply. And if you feel your rights are being violated, take it up later with a judge," [...] Zorn wrote.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{feel quite}} sure what I'm saying yet. I don't care, so long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> up and listen patiently. I'm feeling very low and lonely this morning, Monday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is gammon,--running {{away with}} ideas like them, {{just as if}} you {{was one of the}} public. When they two opened that box at Carlisle, which they did as certain <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> there, they {{believed}} as the diamonds were there. They were not there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But after you've rested {{you must}} be active," [...] said Dale, seriously. [...] "You must do things. It doesn't matter what, just <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>sit</b> idle." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this she}} {{reassured}} me {{as to the}} beauty of her teeth. [...] "As long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> out here," [...] said I, to myself, [...] "there will be no in-doors for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you mad Westerman," [...] said he; [...] "do {{you wish}} to fight here in the Mayor's house? I tell you, you were wrong, in taunting him <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did; <b>sit</b> quiet till I make peace between you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know I always {{believed}} in you," [...] he began again. [...] "You know I did. Well. I never believed in {{you so much}} as I do now, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> there, just as you are, and with hardly enough light to make you out by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Enough,' said young Duroc. 'If I were to pass my sabre {{through you}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> in that chair, I {{should do what}} is just and right. I dishonour my blade by {{crossing}} it with yours. And yet you are a Frenchman, and have even held a commission under the same flag as myself. Rise, then, and defend yourself!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can you be," [...] she sweetly asked, [...] "so hideously hypocritical? You {{know as well}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> {{there that}} my fine {{instincts}} are the {{thing in the world}} you're most in terror of. 'Be myself?'" [...] she echoed. [...] "What you'd LIKE to say is: 'Be somebody else--that's your only chance.' Well, I'll try--I'll try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be informal--do what <b>you</b> like, dress <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like, <b>sit</b> where <b>you</b> like, {{eat what}} you like, drink tea or coffee, but----" [...] Each glance of his eyes, each {{sentence}} of his sparing, semi-genial talk, seemed to repeat that [...] "but".|$|R
6000|$|... "The old man shouldn't {{have been}} allowed to have his way. I am in an awful state of alarm about Sam. Much as I like him,--or at any rate did like him,--I fear he is going, or perhaps has gone, to the dogs. That those two men were housebreakers is as certain <b>as</b> that <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> there; and I cannot doubt but that he has been with them over at Lavington or Devizes, or somewhere in that country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, man! If I be who I am, I {{know enough}} {{of men to}} know that I need not be ashamed of having <b>you</b> <b>as</b> bench-fellow. <b>Sit</b> down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Rotherby," [...] he said, [...] "you do {{not seem}} to {{appreciate}} the position in which you stand. You are young, and life is hot in your veins, and yet to-day, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> there, your liberty is forfeit,--perhaps even, if Tapilow should die, your life! Have you ever heard any stories, I wonder," [...] he added, leaning a little toward me, [...] "about French prisons?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Gunga Dass," [...] I replied; [...] "to {{the first}} terms I cheerfully agree, but, {{as there is}} nothing on earth to prevent my killing you <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> here and taking {{everything}} that you have" [...] (I thought of the two invaluable crows at the time), [...] "I flatly refuse to give you my boots and shall take whichever den I please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'A man!' said I. 'Well, I'm glad to {{have your}} friend's {{assurance}} of it, for no one would suspect it to see you like a boarding-school missy. I don't suppose in all this country {{there is a more}} contemptible-looking creature than you are <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> there with that Dolly pinafore upon you.' He coloured up at that, for he was a vain man, and he winced from ridicule.|$|E
6000|$|... "What will ye with me, Ignosi?" [...] she piped. [...] "Ye {{dare not}} touch me. If ye touch me I will slay <b>you</b> <b>as</b> ye <b>sit.</b> Beware of my magic." ...|$|R
50|$|Customers {{who visit}} the tiny space {{experience}} {{something that is}} not duplicated anywhere else in Minneapolis. Guests must first stand in line along the building's back wall as they wait for others to finish their meals. It is commonplace to be instructed to move down the counter to allow newly seated customers to be seated together. Veterans of Al's are used to the instruction and keep their attitude extremely flexible <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>sit</b> on 2 to 3 different stools during the duration of a standard breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you!" [...] said Sir Patrick, dryly. [...] "Mr. Arnold Brinkworth, may <b>you</b> {{always be}} <b>as</b> {{ready to take}} Time by the forelock <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are now! <b>Sit</b> down again; and don't talk nonsense. It is just possible--if Blanche {{consents}} (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> say), {{and if we can}} hurry the lawyers--that you may be married in three weeks' or a month's time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] said Macnab, who was apt {{to become}} {{speculative}} and philosophical over his pipe after supper, [...] "I wonder if dogs ever envy us our pipes? You look so comfortable, Big Otter, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> there with half-shut eyes letting the smoke trickle from {{your mouth and}} nose, that I can't help thinking they must feel envious. I'm sure that I should if I were not smoking!" ...|$|E
6000|$|L. Ha.—Nay, good sister, {{you may as}} {{well talk}} to me [looking at [...] herself as she speaks] <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> staring at a book which I know [...] you can’t attend.—Good Dr. Lucas may have writ there what he [...] pleases, but there’s no putting Francis, Lord Hardy, now Earl of [...] Brumpton, out of your head, or making him absent from your eyes. Do [...] but look on me, now, and deny it if you can.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're not {{a hopeless}} invalid," [...] he assured her, earnestly. [...] "No {{one would ever}} know, {{to look at you}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> there, that there was {{anything}} whatever the matter. Don't you remember our money-box for the doctor? Even that will come, Ruth. The day will come, I am sure, when we shall carry you off to Vienna, or one of those great cities, and the cure will be quite easy. I believe in it, really." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know not, I know not," [...] {{returned}} the deliberate old man; [...] "the vermin and reptiles, which you bear about you, were intended by the Lord for the prairies, and I see no good in sending them into regions {{that may not}} suit their natur's. And, moreover, you may be of great and particular use <b>as</b> <b>you</b> now <b>sit</b> on the ass, though it creates no wonder in my mind to perceive that you are ignorant of it, seeing that usefulness is altogether a new calling to so bookish a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wrong in {{breaking}} with her!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "You {{would be doing}} wrong if you didn't,--wrong to yourself; wrong to your family; wrong, if I may venture to say so, to Daphne; wrong even {{in the long run}} to the girl herself; for she is not fitted for you, and she IS fitted for Reggie Nettlecraft. Now, do <b>as</b> I bid <b>you.</b> <b>Sit</b> down at once and write her a letter from my dictation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ravi's first storyline was his bisexuality. The {{character}} was first revealed as bisexual during an episode {{in which he}} tried to kiss Russ Owen. Speaking of the character's masculinity and non-stereotypical bisexual, Stephan Uppal stated, [...] "I think they've dealt with it really well. When it's something as big <b>as</b> this, <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down with the writers and the directors and you discuss everything. I {{thought that it was}} about time that a soap portrayed a bisexual or gay character who isn't overtly feminine or camp. You get them in every other soap — you see Coronation Street, EastEnders and even Hollyoaks with John Paul McQueen [...] — he was quite camp in the way he was playing the part because that's how the {{character was}} meant to be played. But with Ravi, he's just this very masculine lad." ...|$|R
60|$|Hold up {{your hand}} {{with the edge of}} it towards you, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> now with your side to the window, so that the flat of your hand is turned to the window. You will see one side of your hand {{distinctly}} lighted, the other distinctly in shade. Here are light side and dark side, with no seen shadow; the shadow being detached, perhaps on the table, perhaps {{on the other side of}} the room; you need not look for it at present.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, my lord, {{you must}} give me leave to {{conclude}} my picture.--Sussex governs England--the Queen's health fails--the succession {{is to be}} settled--a road is opened to ambition more splendid than ambition ever dreamed of. You hear all this <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> by the hob, {{under the shade of}} your hall-chimney. You then begin to think what hopes you have fallen from, and what insignificance you have embraced; and all that you might look babies in the eyes of your fair wife oftener than once a fortnight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You go {{as fast as}} horses {{can take}} you to the railway without having held any {{previous}} communication with this house, either personally or by letter. You leave Mrs. Lecount behind to pack up your curiosities, to settle with the tradespeople, and to follow you to St. Crux the next morning. The next morning is the tenth morning. On the tenth morning she receives the letter from Zurich; and if you only carry out my instructions, Mr. Vanstone, as sure <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> there, to Zurich she goes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm much {{obliged to}} you; of course not. I {{thought you had}} one of our chairs, and I didn't like to ask you. It looks exactly like one of ours; not so much now <b>as</b> when <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> in it. Please sit down again. I don't want to trouble you. We've lost one of ours, and I've been looking for it everywhere. They look so much alike; you can't tell till you see the back. Of course I see {{there will be no}} mistake about yours," [...] the young lady went on with a smile of which the {{serenity}} matched her other abundance. [...] "But we've got such a small name--you can scarcely see it," [...] she added with the same friendly intention. [...] "Our name's just Day--you mightn't think it WAS a name, might you? if we didn't make the most of it. If you see that on anything, I'd be so obliged if you'd tell me. It isn't for myself, it's for my mother; she's so dependent on her chair, and that one I'm looking for pulls out so beautifully. Now that <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down again and hide the lower part it does look just like ours. Well, it must be somewhere. You must excuse me; I wouldn't disturb you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And there <b>you</b> <b>sit,</b> sir,' pursued Wegg {{with an air}} of {{thoughtful}} admiration, 'as if you {{had never}} left off! There <b>you</b> <b>sit,</b> sir, <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> had an unlimited capacity of assimilating the flagrant article! There <b>you</b> <b>sit,</b> sir, in the midst of your works, looking as if you'd been called upon for Home, Sweet Home, and was obleeging the company! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you endanger other people's {{life and}} liberty in your pursuit of happiness, I {{shall have to}} {{confiscate}} your arms, boys. Take the orchard for your archery ground; that is safe, {{and we can see}} <b>you</b> <b>as</b> we <b>sit</b> here. I wish I had two hands, so that I could paint you a fine, gay target;" [...] and Miss Celia looked regretfully at the injured arm, which as yet was of little use.|$|R
6000|$|... "Inspector Shields will {{no doubt}} insist upon coming in," [...] Wingate replied. [...] "I gather from his visit that {{he is on the}} right track at last. But listen. If I am going to be arrested on a charge of {{abduction}} and manslaughter, as seems exceedingly probable, I am not going to leave my job half done. An English jury may call it murder if I shoot you two <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit.</b> I'll risk that. If I am going to get into trouble for one of you, I'll make sure of the lot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! By my word! {{there is}} {{something}} singular about you," [...] said he: [...] "you have {{the air of a}} little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque. What do you mean by it?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> back half dreaming in the car, {{you keep}} {{wondering}} {{why it is}} that you never came up before in all these years. Ever so many times you planned that just as soon as the rush and strain of business eased up a little, you would take the train {{and go back to the}} little town to see what it was like now, and if things had changed much since your day. But each time when your holidays came, somehow you changed your mind and went down to Naragansett or Nagahuckett or Nagasomething, and left over the visit to Mariposa for another time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here! <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down," [...] he said, {{pushing her}} into a chair. [...] "I know your game well enough. You think you have me safe <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have the child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I want {{to consult}} you professionally,' she went on. 'I {{have been much}} {{impressed}} by your great knowledge of castellated architecture. Will <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> in that leather chair at the table, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may have to take notes?' ...|$|R
60|$|In a word, {{it arrived}} that evening at a {{wonderful}} small cottage in a street {{leading from the}} Fulham Road--one of those streets which have the finest romantic names--(this was called St. Adelaide Villas, Anna-Maria Road West), where the houses look like baby-houses; where the people, looking out of the first-floor windows, must infallibly, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> think, <b>sit</b> with their feet in the parlours; where the shrubs in the little gardens in front bloom with a perennial display of little children's pinafores, little red socks, caps, &c. (polyandria polygynia); whence you {{hear the sound of}} jingling spinets and women singing; where little porter pots hang on the railings sunning themselves; whither of evenings you see City clerks padding wearily: here it was that Mr. Clapp, the clerk of Mr. Sedley, had his domicile, and in this asylum the good old gentleman hid his head with his wife and daughter when the crash came.|$|R
