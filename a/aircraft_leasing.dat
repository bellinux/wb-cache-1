5|$|Polaris <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Leasing,</b> a {{subsidiary}} of General Electric Capital, entered into agreement in 1993 to suspend lease payments on the airline's three Boeing 747-100SFs in return for an option to buy up to 49 percent of the airline in January 1995. However, Cathay Pacific acquired 75 percent of the airline's shares for HK$200 million in June 1994 and the option was cancelled. Facing weak demands and heavy financial losses, the airline was forced to terminate the lease on its Boeing 707-320C {{and one of its}} Boeing 747-100SF on November 1994 and January 1995, respectively, with only two Boeing 747-100SFs remaining. By 2000, the airline had a fleet of three Boeing 747-200Fs with scheduled cargo services to Brussels, Dubai, Manchester and Osaka.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1999, Color Air {{terminated}} all {{flights and}} ceased operations. Sunde {{stated that he}} regretted having started the airline, {{and said that he}} had overestimated the synergies between his ferry company and the airline, but also underestimated the price elasticity for business travel. In particular, the frequent flyer programs that SAS and Braathens had made it difficult to convince corporate travelers to switch to Color Air. Sunde believed that the company would continue to lose money in 2000. 220 employees lost their jobs, while Color Group estimated it lost NOK400 million on the airline. There were discussions concerning cooperation with, or a take-over by, British Airways, but these discussions did not lead to an agreement. In total, Color Air flew 430,000 passengers, effectively subsidizing each passenger with almost NOK1000. The company was not declared bankrupt, as Sunde wanted to insure his good reputation by paying everyone he owed money. While this was about NOK10 million in airport fees and smaller sums to other parties, the largest creditors were the two <b>aircraft</b> <b>leasing</b> companies, to whom NOK270 million was owed {{for the rest of the}} rental period. The 20,000 people who had tickets with Color Air were all rebooked onto Braathens flights. After NOK170 million in debt was registered by the company, and assets were only worth NOK17 million, Color Air was declared bankrupt on 10 November 1999.|$|E

25|$|Following revelations at the Moriarty Tribunal on 16 February 1999, in {{relation}} to Charles Haughey and his relationship with AIB, former Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald confirmed that AIB and Ansbacher wrote off debts of almost £200,000 that he owed in 1993, {{when he was in}} financial difficulties because of the collapse of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>leasing</b> company, GPA, in which he was a shareholder.

Chairman of AIB at the time, Peter Sutherland, was also a former director of GPA and had served as Attorney General under FitzGerald, prior to FitzGerald appointing him as Ireland's member of the European Commission. The Moriarty Tribunal investigated this matter, and compared the treatment by AIB of FitzGerald with their treatment of Charles Haughey. They found no evidence of any wrongdoing, indeed the Tribunal heard evidence as to the considerable hardship that FitzGerald went to – to the extent of selling of his family home – to repay the debt to the best of his ability.|$|E

On , the company was rebranded as Nigeria Airways. At this time the airline used <b>aircraft</b> <b>leasing</b> as a common practice: Boeing 707s that flew the Lagos–London route were leased from Laker Airways and Ethiopian Airlines until a new Boeing 707-320C was incorporated into the fleet and deployed on the route in August 1971, and in October 1971 a Boeing 737 was leased from Aer Lingus. Another Boeing 707-320C was ordered in 1972, along with two Boeing 737-200s. A Boeing 707 was leased from Aer Lingus in April 1972 for deployment mainly on the Lagos–London route, with the provision of crew and maintenance. [...] In October 1972, a Fokker F28 entered the fleet on a lease agreement with Fokker, and later on aircraft of this type were ordered. In late 1972, a contract for management assistance was signed with TWA, with the American carrier providing specialists in different managerial, commercial, and financial fields for five years, but the contract was never excersised. Nigeria Airways took delivery of three Boeing 707s in February 1973; they were put into service on the Lagos–London run immediately. Two Boeing 737s, with registrations 5N-ANC and 5N-AND, were delivered in the early 1970s.|$|E
