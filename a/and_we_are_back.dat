60|$|At least, {{if there}} be {{anything}} valid {{in my own}} vision of these things, we have returned to an origin <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>back</b> in the war with the barbarians. It falls as naturally for me that the Englishman and the Frenchman {{should be on the}} same side as that Alfred and Abbo should be on the same side, in that black century when the barbarians wasted Wessex and besieged Paris. But there are now, perhaps, less certain tests of the spiritual as distinct from the material victory of civilization. Ideas are more mixed, are complicated by fine shades or covered by fine names. And whether the retreating savage leaves behind him the soul of savagery, like a sickness in the air, I myself should judge primarily by one political and moral test. The soul of savagery is slavery. Under all its mask of machinery and instruction, the German regimentation of the poor was the relapse of barbarians into slavery. I can see no escape from it for ourselves in the ruts of our present reforms, but only by doing what the mediævals did after the other barbarian defeat: beginning, by guilds and small independent groups, gradually to restore the personal property of the poor and the personal freedom of the family. If the English really attempt that, the English have at least shown in the war, to any one who doubted it, that they have not lost the courage and capacity of their fathers, and can carry it through if they will. If they do not do so, if they continue to move only with the dead momentum of the social discipline which we learnt from Germany, there is nothing before us but what Mr. Belloc, the discoverer of this great sociological drift, has called the Servile State. And there are moods in which a man, considering that conclusion of our story, is half inclined to wish that the wave of Teutonic barbarism had washed out us and our armies together; and that the world should never know anything more of the last of the English, except that they died for liberty.|$|E
50|$|At some point, {{there is}} a {{sustained}} increase in some type of spending for some reason. (One reason may simply be that, once inventories sink to their desired level, there stops being negative intended inventory investment, which goes up from negative to zero; but again {{there may be other}} reasons as well.) At this point there is negative unintended inventory investment as firms are caught by surprise by the external increase in demand and they fail to simultaneously raise their production. Now inventories are too low, again for two reasons, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>back</b> where we started in the cycle. The recession has bottomed out, sustained spending is once again high, target inventory levels are higher than actual inventory levels, and intended inventory investment is positive.|$|E

5000|$|Dreamwaltzes quotes three such waltzes in {{successive}} episodes. The first waltz referenced {{is one of}} Johannes Brahms's Liebeslieder Waltzes, Op. 52, No. 6. The second waltz is one of Brahms's Sixteen Waltzes, Op. 39, No. 8. The third waltz is from Richard Strauss's {{comic opera}} Der Rosenkavalier. The composer wrote, [...] "From time to time these originals float briefly to the surface. The three waltz episodes are surrounded by slower music forming an introduction, interludes, and a coda; this slower music, too, sometimes alludes to Rosenkavalier." [...] Stucky continued: But in Dreamwaltzes the past proves elusive; the waltz music is always slipping away {{almost as soon as}} it has begun. The point is clearest in the crucial third episode. Here, after a gradually evolving, accelerating development, the orchestra seems just on the point of reentering fully the late nineteenth century in some grand, unrestrained waltz music—when suddenly the whole affair collapses, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>back</b> in our own time.

5000|$|Filming {{started from}} 10 March 2012 in Chennai and the {{director}} revealed on 12 March 2012 {{that he is going}} to croon a song and the movie contains only 3 songs. The unit of Haridas had a narrow escape as their boat capsized in the high seas of Dhanushkodi, during a shoot on 27-June-2012. After shooting in the sea one of the boats that they were traveling capsized due to the high tide around the area. Director Kumarvelan said, [...] "I was filming a song sequence on the lead pair when there was a sudden rise in tide. A killer tide hit our boat and it capsized. We immediately sent Sneha safely to the shores in another life boat. My cameraman R. Rathnavelu started swimming, but I don't know how to swim. So, I was forced to hold on to the boat for a while till some local fishermen rescued us.

5000|$|July 13: — Today I {{meet the}} Thibetan Boy in Coes Book Store. [...] "We are both rather aimlessly {{turning over the}} magazines, and, after I have {{observed}} his idleness awhile, I take him {{out for a walk}} and say: [...] "Why do you look at me when you pass, with your eyes a story untold? All the while I have walked the streets of this New Springfield, you have looked at me so. He answers slowly, almost whispering: — [...] "Your fathers came from the ancient Christian world. My fathers came from the more ancient Buddhist world. Christ is my master but I cannot deny that Buddha is my friend. This is the hour for friends. Come with me. We walk north on Mulberry Boulevard, past the House of the Man from Singapore, and then west on Carpenter toward a little highway that finally joins the great Northwest Road. But we have not gone far on the Great Northwest Road till we flash past the Gothic double walls of our city. The Thibetan Boy takes me, in one instant, to the far edge of Space and Time, way beyond the North Star and its dandelions. And as we stand on the shaking shore of Space and Time we see and hear, rolling in from Chaos, endless smoke and glory and darkness and dissolving foam. Standing be side us, like a superb Gandhara sculpture that has taken on life is that Prince Siddartha who was the founder of Buddhism. He stands in that aspect he had, while still a citizen and householder, and twenty-four centuries before his green glass libel cursed mankind. Before us is, indeed, a vision of Buddha the dreamer, superb, thoroughbred, in all the jewels of his tribe. It is the hour before he took chariot and drove forth from home. We are back in that hour when he looked upon all things, and saw them as a dissolving foam, the hour before he set forth for his victory over this crumbling universe. His eyes are fixed upon those waves that roll in forever, that keep their forms an instant, and are gone for all time: some of men, some of wraiths and gods, some of planets and comets and suns. He turns around and beckons and over the sand comes Channa, the superb charioteer, and the horses of that chariot are nobler than the horses of the sun. Prince Siddartha is in the chariot in an instant and they drive out into that sea and the wheels of that chariot ride the waves. Those horses are like lightning, climbing waves that are like hills and mountains, till chariot, horses, and men all are veiled by the endless smoke and glory and darkness and dissolving foam. The Thibetan boy says to me: [...] "It is the Great Going Forth from Home, and thus Buddha becomes a conquerer, and Chaos and the Universe are put beneath him." [...] But the star chimes behind us are ringing new tunes <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>back</b> in our city again, leaving Prince Siddartha to conquer what he will.|$|E

40|$|All human {{languages}} are ambiguous. Ambiguity is {{not restricted to}} some special constructions that linguists are fond of discussing, but is quite ubiquitous. It is hard, in fact, to find a sentence that is not ambiguous. This fact is all too familiar to computational linguists: “One often hears in computational linguistics about completely unremarkable sentences with hundreds of parses, and that is in fact no exaggeration ” (Abney, 1996). The question is, simply, why? Why is language ambiguous? Krifka (2002) raises a similar question concerning vagueness. He shows that {{there are good reasons}} for language to allow, and even encourage vagueness. Vagueness, however, is not ambiguity. When we are told that the theater is far from here, we may be unsure as to the precise distance; but we know what the speaker intends, and we can draw inferences based on this, e. g., that we should take a cab instead of walking to the theater. But with an ambiguous term, the intended meaning is not merely insufficiently specified; it is not known, until the term is disambiguated. When we hear that John has a kid, we draw very different inferences if John is a father or if he owns a young goat. Thus, the advantages of vagueness do not seem to apply to ambiguity, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>back</b> to th...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a meta-theory {{concerning}} {{the relation between}} the general and the specific in science. This issue was recently called back to attention by Hodgson (2001). A heuristic of discovery, developed in earlier work (Nooteboom 1992, 1996, 1999 b, 2000 a), is used in an attempt to contribute to an understanding and a resolution of the tension between generality and specificity. That tension can be resolved if we look at general theory and specific conditions (or data, experience) not as separate entities or approaches that one has to choose from, in a static perspective, thus choosing to be a generalist or an empiricist, but as complementary, in a dynamic, dialectical process of theory development, in the process of discovery. The paper argues that there is an alternation of the general and the specific, in an ongoing cycle of formation and application of theory. Generalisation and abstraction are necessary to lift experience from specific contexts and carry it into new contexts with their own specificity. That, in turn, is needed for the theory to face failure and collect the experience that will lead to new generalisation. In the face of failure, adaptations are made to the specific context, in differentiation, and hints are found for novel specific elements to be absorbed, which yields hybridisation. This exerts pressure, and provides the material and the directions, to develop a new unity out of novel combinations, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>back</b> {{at the beginning of the}} cycle. learning;discovery;generality;specificity...|$|E
40|$|Unlike Professors Fernandez, Banner, and Donahue, I {{am not a}} legal historian; like them, however, I am much {{interested}} in {{the comings and goings}} of the famous old case about the fox. It figures significantly in my course on property and in my co-authored book on the subject. The background of the case is noted in the book and will be updated in the next edition to take account of Fernandez 2 ̆ 7 s discovery of the hitherto lost judgment roll in the case. I Her find yields many facts, but, in my judgment, virtually no information. Facts are necessary to information, but not sufficient. A fact without purpose is useless; coupled with purpose, it becomes information. The information itself might be trivial, as it is in trivia games. Suppose you are playing a game, a trivia game, where stating the right fact wins you points. Suppose the name of William Blackstone 2 ̆ 7 s tailor was Jonas Maybird, and this is a fact you happen to know. Suppose you are asked, What was the name of William Blackstone 2 ̆ 7 s tailor? You answer correctly and win points. Outside the game, the name of Blackstone 2 ̆ 7 s tailor is just a fact; inside the game, it is information. Change the game to a scholarly one concerned with illuminating Blackstone 2 ̆ 7 s Commentaries on the Laws of England, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>back</b> to the name of Blackstone 2 ̆ 7 s tailor being just a worthless fact. For purposes of understanding Blackstone, I presume that to know the name of his tailor is to know a fact that carries no information; it has no purpose in the enterprise. Change the game again, to a study of famous tailors in eighteenth-century England, and then once again the Maybird-Blackstone connection is not just a fact, but a piece of information.
