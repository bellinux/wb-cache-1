The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.|$|E

25|$|Arbitration {{was common}} in the early United States, with George Washington serving as an arbiter on an occasion. The United States had a notable {{difference}} from England, however, in that unlike England, its courts generally did not enforce executory agreements (binding predispute agreements) to arbitrate. This meant that prior to an award, a claimant could sue in court {{even if they had}} contractually agreed to settle disputes by arbitration. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>award,</b> courts reviewed the judgment, but generally deferred to the arbitration, although the practice was not consistent.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{energetic}} {{reforms and}} personal popularity among the midshipmen, Holloway's three-year tour as superintendent ultimately was too brief {{to reverse the}} Naval Academy's entrenched cultural bias against academic achievement. A more durable legacy was the series of yawl races Holloway initiated to promote seamanship and competitive sailing, dubbed the Holloway trophy races <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>award</b> for the winning midshipman skipper. Holloway also addressed the dismal living conditions of the enlisted men based at the Academy by upgrading their quarters from trailer parks to a village of Wherry housing units {{on the north shore}} of the Severn River. He declared that a midshipman's first lesson must be concern for enlisted men's welfare and that Annapolis of all places must set the example.|$|E
25|$|The company's new cahier des charges (license) was liberal. It {{called for}} new French operas with spoken {{dialogue}} (opéra comique) or sung recitative, prose or verse librettos, and {{with or without}} ballets. No single composer could have more than six new acts presented in one season (acts were counted rather than works). Preference was {{to be given to}} Prix de Rome winners up to two years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>award.</b> In addition, up to two translated foreign works were permitted, as well as French works ten years after their premiere, and any number of public domain works, so long as these did not exceed 33% of the number of new acts presented over a two-year period. The company had the right to revive any works it had already produced, to encourage the company to establish its own repertory. As the company did not receive any state subsidy before 1864, revivals of popular, established works were critical to its financial survival.|$|E

25|$|The First Vienna Award led to {{worsening}} anti-Hungarian sentiments in Slovakia. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>award</b> {{had been}} announced, János Esterházy, {{a leader of}} the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, proposed that Hungary return to Slovakia 1000km² of the territory that Hungary had received (predominantly Slovak lands between Šurany (Nagysurány) and Palárikovo (Tótmegyer)) in order to ensure long-term peaceful coexistence between the two nations. His proposal was not accepted by the Hungarian government. The obvious violation of the ethnic balance between the two countries' minorities that had repeatedly been endorsed years before by Hungary, as well as the short period between the award and a Hungarian attack against Slovakia in March 1939, caused the anti-Hungarian mood and social mobilizations against Hungarians to become a significant unifying element in Slovaks during World War II. Anti-Hungarian demonstrations were held on each anniversary of the award. During demonstrations, anti-Hungarian slogans were shouted and Hungarian houses or cultural institutions were damaged. On the third anniversary, a mob furious because of the shooting of Slovaks by Hungarian police in Komját destroyed the Hungarian Cultural House.|$|E

Elsewhere, performances of a Norwegian musical starring Alexander Rybak scheduled for the following month also fell victim to the diplomatic fallout, according to the composer. In early December, Norway said its bilateral trade talks with China had been delayed indefinitely. Haakon Hjelde, Norway's negotiator, reported that the postponement was not directly linked to the award, but Henning Kristofferson, director of international relations of the BI Norwegian School of Management, said it was fairly obvious that the PRC government would [...] "never hold a high-level meeting with Norway shortly before or <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>award</b> ceremony", having made it plain that the award to Liu was [...] "a big mistake." ...|$|E
