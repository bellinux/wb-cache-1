'O Frank, {{it is such}} {{a pretty}} dress, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you liked it, and you have to pay for a good cut, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{yourself}} that a wife must not become dowdy after marriage, and it would have cost double as much in Regent Street.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, old bean. Make an effort. You must {{remember}} that sausage episode? It was just outside St. Mihiel, about five in the evening. Your little lot were lying next to my little lot, and we happened to meet, and I said 'What ho!' <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'Halloa!' and I said 'What ho! What ho!' <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'Have a bit of sausage?' and I said 'What ho! What ho! What HO!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{first saw}} you," [...] he began, [...] "I {{thought you were}} like a {{creature}} who'd lived all its life among pearls and old bones. Your hands were wet, d'you remember, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> never <b>said</b> a word until I gave you a bit of bread, <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> 'Human Beings!'" ...|$|R
60|$|MARGARET. <b>And</b> when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'snap' I {{caught the}} biscuit in my mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Understand this, then. You {{are not to}} {{continue}} your operations as a money-lender. Two <b>and</b> fourpence, <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> Corkran?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stopped it? I {{suppose she}} said 'Now, Eustace, you mustn't!' <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'Very well, mother!' and {{scratched}} the fixture?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You bragged {{to those}} ladies about our dining-cars; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that our {{railroad}} restaurants were {{quite as good}} as the European." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drunk again, {{after all}} your {{promises}} to the minister! <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> yoursel' {{that he had}} pulled you out o' hell by the root." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Did Mr. Armadale seem surprised,' I asked, 'when {{you told}} him of our engagement, <b>and</b> when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{it was to be}} kept a secret from everybody?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but we pay too much. That's what I can't bear. <b>And</b> as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> yesterday, I don't think Mr. Ferris's manners {{are quite}} respectful to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{but look}} here," [...] said John; [...] "it's this house, it's such a pig-sty, it's so dreary <b>and</b> damp. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> {{yourself}} {{that it was}} damp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{stood with}} the candle, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you liked company, if 'twas only {{a dog or}} cat--maning me; and the chair wouldn't do nohow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please, Jamie, tell us," [...] she said. [...] "We {{only saw}} the {{shortest}} {{account in the}} papers, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> nothing about it in your letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{daughter}} {{called you}} a god <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{that you knew}} we were coming to wake you up, which is reading the future," [...] answered Bastin.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Damn Private Dormer <b>and</b> <b>you</b> too!' <b>said</b> Bobby Wick, {{running the}} blotter over the half-finished letter. 'Tell him I'll {{come in the}} morning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'but I {{was afraid}} it might {{distress}} him; <b>and</b> as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> {{would be here}} again soon, Mama, and are the mistress of everything, I determined to take courage and ask you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You cannot {{think that}} I will accept a compromise. Do you suppose that because I {{am a woman}} I am not made of flesh <b>and</b> blood? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> wished to be frank." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I said, you know, that I {{should make}} you an {{antidote}} to those black humours; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you hoped I would consign them to the flames.’ ...|$|E

6000|$|ANNA--You said [...] "ain't right" [...] <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> it funny. Say, listen here, you ain't {{trying to}} insinuate that there's {{something}} wrong between us, are you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I do {{not know}} {{anything}} about it,' she answered, 'except {{what you told me}} yourself; <b>and</b> what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> was my reason for agreeing so quickly to your proposition.' ...|$|R
60|$|SMITH. You {{know quite}} well why not. You are an honest man; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> it yourself. Because {{he would not}} believe it.|$|R
60|$|ANN. [suddenly {{losing her}} courage, with an anguish {{that she does}} not conceal] No. We are awake; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> no: that is all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. O Frank--you think me forward, I am afraid! Don't, dear Frank--will you--for I {{love you}} so. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{lots of times}} you would marry me, and--and--I--I--I--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, there's Nell-- <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> this Gale {{was a young}} American. My {{wife will}} be scared to death for fear Nell will {{fall in love with}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'What {{have you}} seen?' she cried; and then, as I only pointed to her bonnet, {{she turned to}} you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> 'Was it the black dog, father?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was Corinthians," [...] said Paula. [...] "I {{ought to}} have recollected, but the lectures are very dull <b>and</b> disjointed; <b>you</b> <b>said</b> so yourself, Nag, and the Rector is very low church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not long ago," [...] she said, [...] "you left me in anger, {{partly because}} of this {{exchange}} of identities between Annabel <b>and</b> myself. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that it would bring trouble. It has." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still," [...] persisted Violet, [...] "she nursed {{you when}} you were very ill, <b>and,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> set <b>you</b> on your feet again. That would {{probably}} count for a good deal with her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Percy said I {{could hang}} up the account if I didn't {{want to change the}} bill, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you didn't want to trust any of the young fellows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You had best {{take a bite}} {{before you}} go," [...] she said. [...] "It's noon now, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you started at daybreak. Always get a meal when you can, say I." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{just the}} same it's the Portuguese that gave it its price, and they make things go on it--send their {{children}} to school... and have them; <b>and,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> yourself, they're as fat as butterballs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] laughed Ida, [...] "was {{probably}} {{the result of}} wearing a smart English skirt. Do you remember the day <b>you</b> fell down <b>and</b> broke her parasol, <b>and</b> what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> immediately afterward about women's fripperies?" ...|$|R
