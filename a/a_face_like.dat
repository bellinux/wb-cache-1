25|$|Both Suther and Régine Tessier, {{the latter}} in a sketch of Sage in Notable American Women: The Modern Period, note key {{features}} of Sage’s mature work. Most of Sage’s paintings focus on free-standing architectural structures, including walls, towers, and latticework, which could represent buildings either under construction or ruined and decaying. Some contain figures that {{might or might not}} be human, hidden by flowing drapery. (Le Passage, one of Sage’s last paintings, is perhaps the only one containing a definite human figure; even Small Portrait, thought by many to be a self-portrait, is hardly recognizable as <b>a</b> <b>face.)</b> <b>Like</b> Tanguy, Sage often sets her objects on deserts or plains that recede to immeasurably distant horizons. She renders her forms in meticulous, photographic detail, using a gray-green-ochre palette that Tessier describes as “reminiscent of the sulphurous light before a thunderstorm”. Critics frequently called Sage’s work disturbing or depressing, even when they praised her painterly skill.|$|E
500|$|The video, which {{debuted in}} May 1996, {{begins with a}} group of people celebrating the launch of a {{zeppelin}} to the moon. Tom Kenny's character kisses Jill Talley's character's hand as the two enter the zeppelin, which was being held to the ground by people dressed as sailors using rope. The zeppelin approaches the Moon, which has <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> the Moon's face in A Trip to the Moon. Shots of the band performing in similar, turn-of-the-century attire using older, acoustic instruments are interspersed. The two characters jump off the zeppelin and fall onto the Moon's surface. Suddenly, several hostile humanoid aliens appear, surrounding the couple. Tom Kenny's character is restrained from a fist fight with the creatures, and Jill Talley's character defends herself by hitting a few of creatures with her umbrella, which vaporizes them, but the two are trapped and tied. The two form a plan, and then break free of the ropes and attack the aliens with their umbrellas. The couple escapes on a rocket similar to the one in A Trip to the Moon and land in the sea, where a merman resembling the sea-god Poseidon puts on a performance for them, including an octopus, singing mermaids, and starfish, before sending them back to the surface in a bubble. In the end they are rescued by a ship called [...] "S.S. Méliès", in reference to the movie director.|$|E

2500|$|The {{publicity}} {{associated with}} Charlotte's Web has inspired {{a number of}} legislative bills, {{some of which are}} in the planning stages, and others which have been proposed or actually passed. Children, as [...] "uniquely powerful advocates for medicinal pot across the country," [...] have inspired [...] "the movement to legalize medicinal marijuana," [...] a movement which [...] "has <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> Charlotte’s–and it’s a young one that’s hard to ignore. Lawmakers across the country are pushing legislation to legalize marijuana oil as a treatment for children with epilepsy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Abbahu {{taught that}} a cherub (as in [...] ) had <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a child (keravya), for in Babylonia {{they called a}} child ravya. Rav Papa asked Abaye that if this is so, {{then there is a}} {{difficulty}} interpreting , which says of Ezekiel's vision, [...] "the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle." [...] Would not the face of the cherub and the face of a man be the same? The Gemara answered that one was a big face, and the other was a small face.|$|E
2500|$|Barrett Browning's sister Henrietta died in November 1860. The couple {{spent the}} winter of 1860–61 in Rome where Barrett Browning's health further {{deteriorated}} and they returned to Florence in early June 1861. She became gradually weaker, using morphine to ease her pain. She died on 29 June 1861 in her husband's arms. Browning said that she died [...] "smilingly, happily, and with <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a girl's.... Her last word was... Beautiful". She {{was buried in the}} Protestant English Cemetery of Florence. [...] "On Monday July 1 the shops in the area around Casa Guidi were closed, while Elizabeth was mourned with unusual demonstrations." [...] The nature of her illness is still unclear. Some modern scientists speculate her illness may have been hypokalemic periodic paralysis, a genetic disorder that causes weakness and many of the other symptoms she described.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-ground below on a sea, which Ridderbos likens to glass crystal, are the apparitions {{released}} as the seals are broken; the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse gallop across the flat islands, [...] "scattering, spoiling, and slaying". These riders, which manifest {{as the first}} four seals are broken, are set at a diagonal in the pictorial space. The white horse of victory carries an archer, the red horse of war a swordsman, the black horse of famine a man with scales, and {{from the mouth of}} hell emerges the pale horse of death. Stars fall from the sky, mountains and islands move, ships sink, and people hide in caverns. According to Ridderbos, [...] "We see hail and fire burning trees and grass, a burning mountain cast into the sea destroying ships, a falling star that poisons the waters, a wailing eagle, a second falling star that opens a bottomless pit from which monstrous locusts arise, and four angels and their horsemen sent out to kill". Behind the armored angels on land, with one leg in the sea, the other on land, [...] "stands a colossal figure: the angel described as clothed with a cloud, with a rainbow upon his head, <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> the sun and legs like pillars of fire", who brings down seven thunders {{as can be seen in}} the dark clouds above.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Morgenstern, {{film critic}} for The Wall Street Journal, opened his review by asking: [...] "Is After Earth the worst movie ever made?" [...] His answer was [...] "Maybe not; there's always Battlefield Earth {{to remind us}} how low the bar can go." [...] Like Morgenstern, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times made note of the film's use of central themes in Scientology before {{concluding}} the film {{was nothing more than}} a [...] "big-screen vanity project". Los Angeles Times reviewer Betsy Sharkey wondered how the elder Smith could have gone from the charismatic performance in the serious film The Pursuit of Happyness, also co-starring his son, to the performance in After Earth. She also saw compounding problems in the creative process leading to a lack of subtlety and nuance: [...] "The script has no nuance, none. And when Shyamalan moves into the director's chair, the script problems are magnified." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety opined that the film was further proof that Shyamalan had become a [...] "director-for-hire", with [...] "his disinterest palpable from first frame to last". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film one star out of five, calling it [...] "another uncompromisingly terrible film ... featuring a triple-whammy of abysmal acting, directing and story" [...] and saying that Jaden Smith [...] "plays the role throughout with <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a smacked bum" [...] and [...] "Kitai [...] must be like his dad: show no fear. Or any emotion. Or any acting talent of any sort." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Australians out {{for their}} third low score {{in a row and}} with no rain in sight England had every chance of making a large total on a good wicket and {{equalising}} the series. It was an opportunity they did not take as Ian Johnson caught Reg Simpson (4) off Keith Miller (2/39), who then took a magnificent driving catch to take John Dewes (8) off Bill Johnston (2/28). Cyril Washbrook was joined by Len Hutton – still batting in the middle order – to re-establish their old partnership and set about restoring the innings. Washbrook (21) made some charming cover-drives before he was given out lbw to Ray Lindwall (2/46), although only he and Don Tallon appealed and the other nine fielders remained silent. Jack Iverson was brought on and saw a ball flick off Hutton's pads as he checked a sweep (it was the over before lunch). Iverson yelled [...] "Catch it", Tallon dived forwards to take the ball an inch off the ground and the bewildered opener was given out for 12. Only Iverson appealed and [...] "Not even Tallon, {{one of the most notorious}} appealers of all time, asked for a catch". and Miller, standing four feet away at silly-leg [...] "stood there with his arms folded, feet wide apart, completely uninterested" [...] Hutton returned to the pavilion with <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>like</b> thunder and [...] Umpire Cooper was obviously upset that he so obviously disagreed with the decision and ended the over after only seven balls. One Yorkshireman was soon followed by another as Brian Close swished a ball to Sam Loxton and England went into lunch on 54/5. Captain Freddie Brown and Gilbert Parkhouse returned to the crease after lunch and made the best of things, but the Welshman's stilt-like footwork was his undoing and he was caught by Hassett off Miller. He was replaced by Trevor Bailey who steadfastly defended at one end while his captain brought the crowd to its feet hitting Johnson straight down the ground for six and through the covers for four. He hit three more boundaries in his 62 and they added 65 for the seventh wicket. Bailey was out first, bowled by Lindwall and Brown was caught by Johnson off Iverson. Godfrey Evans hit Lindwall straight to the boundary and took 8 runs off Miller, which resulted in a bouncer, which the keeper dodged like a boxer, and the bowler being booed. Evans cracked another four past point off Miller, who was removed from the attack, and passed 1,000 runs in Tests, but was [...] "c Johnson, b Iverson" [...] for 49 and was cheered by the crowd when he left. Alec Bedser (5 not out) had batted for nearly an hour helping Evans, but Doug Wright (2) only lasted five minutes and England were out for 197, exceeding Australia's First Innings by only 3 runs. This was both a failure and a relief, given how the innings had progressed.|$|E
