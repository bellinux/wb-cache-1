5|$|The jury retired {{at noon on}} Saturday 28 February, and {{returned}} to the court within 30 minutes. Their verdict declared that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne, that he had not seduced Katherine Doughty, and that he was indeed Arthur Orton. He was thus convicted of perjury. The jury added a condemnation of Kenealy's conduct during the trial. After the judges refused his request to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>court,</b> the Claimant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of seven years' imprisonment. Kenealy's behaviour ended his legal career; he was expelled from the Oxford circuit mess and from Gray's Inn, so that he could no longer practise. On 2 December 1874 the Lord Chancellor revoked Kenealy's patent as a Queen's Counsel.|$|E

500|$|His trial defense called no witnesses, {{asking that}} Debs {{be allowed to}} <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> in his defense. That unusual request was granted, and Debs spoke for two hours. He was found guilty on September 12. At his {{sentencing}} hearing on September 14, he again addressed the court, and his speech has become a classic. Heywood Broun, a liberal journalist and not a Debs partisan, said it was [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} and moving passages in the English language. He was for that one afternoon touched with inspiration. If anyone told me that tongues of fire danced upon his shoulders as he spoke, I would believe it." ...|$|E

500|$|The fresh trial, {{scheduled}} for 20 May, was postponed when the prosecutor {{announced that he}} was not ready. The delay gave MacGregor and Merilhou time to prepare an elaborate, largely fictional 5,000-word statement purporting to describe the Scotsman's background, activities in the Americas, and total innocence of any endeavour to defraud. When the trial finally began on 10 July 1826, Merilhou was present not as MacGregor's defence counsel but as a witness for the prosecution, having been called as such because of his links with the Nouvelle Neustrie company. Merilhou entrusted MacGregor's defence to a colleague called Berville, who read the 5,000-word submission in full before the court. [...] "Maître Merilhou, as the author of the <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> had heard, and Maître Berville, as the actor who read the script, had done their work extremely well," [...] Sinclair writes; Lehuby was convicted of making false representations regarding the sale of shares, and sentenced to 13 months' imprisonment, but the Cazique was found not guilty on all charges, while the imputations against Hippisley and Irving were stricken from the record.|$|E
500|$|Guandique faced {{a minimum}} penalty of 30 {{years to a}} maximum of life {{imprisonment}} without the possibility of parole. In seeking the maximum possible sentence, the prosecutors stated that Guandique [...] "is unable to control himself and thus, will always remain a danger to women". A memo submitted by the prosecution in February 2011 cited Guandique's harassment of female staff in prison, including soliciting a nurse and masturbating in front of guards. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez disclosed that he had traveled to El Salvador with a detective to investigate allegations that Guandique had fled his native country because of suspected attacks against local women dating back to 1999. During the sentencing hearing on February 11, Guandique said to Levy's family, [...] "I am sorry for what happened to your daughter", and insisted on his innocence. Before Judge Gerald Fisher reminded Susan Levy to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> instead of the defendant, Levy said to him, [...] "Did you really take her life? Look me in my eyes and tell me." [...] Fisher denied Guandique's motion for retrial and handed down a sentence of 60 years in prison, stating that Guandique [...] "will be a danger for some time. He's a sexual predator." ...|$|E

Formal sentencing was scheduled for 8:30a.m. August 28. On this date, Collins was formally sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. Prior to his passing sentence, Judge Conlin asked Collins if he wished to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> before mandatory life sentencing was imposed. In response, Collins rose {{from his chair and}} made the following speech: ...|$|E
2500|$|In India, {{judges of}} the Supreme Court and the High Courts were {{addressed}} as Your Lordship or My Lord and Your Ladyship or My Lady, a tradition directly attributable to England. The Bar Council of India had adopted a resolution in April 2006 {{and added a}} new Rule 49 (1) (j) in the Advocates Act. As per the rule, lawyers can <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> as Your Honour and {{refer to it as}} Honourable Court. If it is a subordinate court, lawyers can use terms such as sir or any equivalent phrase in the regional language concerned. Explaining the rationale behind the move, the Bar Council had held that the words such as My Lord and Your Lordship were [...] "relics of the colonial past". The resolution has since been circulated to all state councils and the Supreme Court for adoption but over five years now, the resolution largely remained on paper.|$|E
2500|$|The {{court held}} that the HHS {{contraception}} mandate substantially burdens the exercise of religion, rejecting an argument that the $2,000-per-employee penalty for dropping insurance coverage is less than the average cost of health insurance. Responding to HHS's argument that the provision of coverage does not itself result in destruction of embryos, the Court asserted that the argument dodges the substantial burden question that the Court is supposed to <b>address.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> added, citing Jesuit moral manuals, that the argument is also the religious question of the morality of enabling the immoral acts of others, to which HHS had provided [...] "a binding national answer". The Court argued that federal courts should not answer religious questions because they would in effect be deciding whether certain beliefs are flawed. [...] The court argued that [...] "companies would face a competitive disadvantage in retaining and attracting skilled workers," [...] that increased wages for employees to buy individual coverage would be more costly than group health insurance, that any raise in wages would have to take income taxes into account, and that employers cannot deduct the penalty.|$|E

60|$|Several {{witnesses}} were called {{who had known}} her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred {{of the crime of}} which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward.

60|$|Captain Tremayne rose {{slowly to}} <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> in {{reply to the}} prosecution. As he faced his, judges now he met the {{smouldering}} eyes of Sir Terence considering him with such malevolence that he was shocked and bewildered. Was he prejudged already, and by his best friend? If so, what must be {{the attitude of the}} others? But the kindly, florid countenance of the president was friendly and encouraging; there was eager anxiety for him in the gaze of his friend Caruthers. He glanced at Lord Wellington sitting at the table's end sternly inscrutable, a mere spectator, yet one whose habit of command gave him an air that was authoritative and judicial.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Myburgh then <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court,</b> {{summing up}} <b>the</b> evidence, and {{referring}} to decided cases {{in support of}} the case which he contended had been made out on behalf of the owners of the Satanella.|$|R

60|$|There {{were several}} cases coming on; but {{the captain and}} girl were first tried together. They were mixing freely with the crowd; and as it {{afterwards}} turned out that everyone--no matter who--had a right to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>court,</b> for aught we knew {{they might have been}} arguing their own case. At what precise moment the trial began {{it would be hard to}} say. There was no swearing of witnesses, and no regular jury. Now and then somebody leaped up and shouted out something which might have been evidence; the rest, meanwhile, keeping up an incessant jabbering. Presently the old judge himself began to get excited; and springing to his feet, ran in among the crowd, wagging his tongue as hard as anybody.|$|E
60|$|He was {{accounted}} {{something of}} a scamp throughout Europe, and particularly in England, {{where he had been}} associated with his brother in the killing of Mr. Thynne. But the seventeenth century did not look for excessively nice scruples in a soldier of fortune; and so it condoned the lack of virtue in Count Philip Christof Königsmark {{for the sake of his}} personal beauty, his elegance, his ready wit, and his magnificent <b>address.</b> <b>The</b> <b>court</b> of Hanover made him warmly welcome, counting itself the richer for his presence; whilst he, on his side, was retained there by the Colonelcy in the Electoral Guard to which he had been appointed, and by his deep and ill-starred affection for the Princess Sophia Dorothea, the wife of the Electoral Prince, who later was to reign in England as King George I.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} morning {{it was observed that}} before the judges took their seats Mr. Chaffanbrass entered the Court with a manner much more brisk than was expected from him now that his own work was done. As a matter of course he would be there to hear the charge, but, almost equally as a matter of course, he would be languid, silent, cross, and unenergetic. They who knew him were sure, when they saw his bearing on this morning, that he intended to do something more before the charge was given. The judges entered the Court nearly half an hour later than usual, and it was observed with surprise that they were followed by the Duke of Omnium. Mr. Chaffanbrass was on his feet before the Chief Justice had taken his seat, but the judge was the first to speak. It was observed that he held a scrap of paper in his hand, and that the barrister held a similar scrap. Then every man in the Court knew that some message had come suddenly by the wires. [...] "I am informed, Mr. Chaffanbrass, that you wish to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> before I begin my charge." ...|$|E
60|$|The case {{having been}} called on, Waterbuck, Q.C., pushing back his papers, hitched his gown on his shoulder, and, with a {{semi-circular}} look around him, {{like a man}} who is going to bat, arose and <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|R

60|$|There was silence, {{broken only}} by the rustle of the president's notes as he briefly looked them over as a {{preliminary}} to <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> And then suddenly, grating harshly upon that silence, came the voice of O'Moy.|$|R
