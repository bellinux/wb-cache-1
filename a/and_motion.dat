5|$|A PlayStation 2 port of the game, retitled Deus Ex: The Conspiracy {{outside of}} Europe, was {{released}} on March 26, 2002. Along with pre-rendered introductory and ending cinematics that replaced the original versions, it features a simplified interface with optional auto-aim <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> captured character models. There are many minor changes in level design, some {{for the purpose of}} balancing gameplay, but most to accommodate loading transition areas, due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation 2. The PlayStation 2 version was rereleased in Europe on the PlayStation 3 as a PlayStation 2 Classic on May 16, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist has platform-specific features, {{including}} voice {{integration with}} Xbox 360's Kinect peripheral which allows players to distract enemies before attacking.

The Wii U version was not shipped with the game's cooperative mode.|$|E

5|$|In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton {{published}} his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, {{in which he}} outlined his laws of gravity <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b> His work on comets was decidedly incomplete. Although he had suspected that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet), {{he was unable to}} completely reconcile comets into his model.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to promoting physical exercise, Isamu Kurosawa {{was open to}} Western traditions and considered theater <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> pictures to have educational merit. He encouraged his children to watch films; young Akira viewed his first movies {{at the age of}} six. An important formative influence was his elementary school teacher Mr Tachikawa, whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general. During this time, the boy also studied calligraphy and Kendo swordsmanship.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the telerecorded material, some early 1970s material survives only, or in colour only, on NTSC videotapes produced for North American transmission (e.g., TV Ontario and CKVU in Vancouver). NTSC runs at a different framerate than PAL video, and has a different number of scanlines. The conversion process used in the 1970s was primitive by modern standards, resulting in a noticeable amount of picture <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> loss. Converting the NTSC tapes back to PAL introduces more artifacts, creating a blurry picture and juddering motion. To rectify the problem, in 2005 a new Reverse Standards Conversion process, which attempts to unpick the original video conversion, was introduced for the DVD release of The Claws of Axos.|$|E
5|$|Jameson {{appears in}} Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. He is voiced <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> {{captured}} by Brandon Scott, {{and is the}} owner of a salvage company and Nate's boss.
