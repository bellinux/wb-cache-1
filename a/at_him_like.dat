25|$|Locke's {{ideology}} and leadership even had impact in Europe. In France, people were looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> {{a figure that}} brought the black population together in the racist era that America was facing at the time. They compared that movement to how the Jewish population in Europe was staying tight together, especially after World War II.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{enormous}} labor involved in sewing each ostrich feather to the dress, Astaire — who normally approved his partner's gowns and suggested modifications if necessary during rehearsals — saw the dress {{for the first time}} on the day of the shoot, and was horrified at the way it shed clouds of feathers at every twist and turn, recalling later: [...] "It was like a chicken attacked by a coyote, I never saw so many feathers in my life." [...] According to choreographer Hermes Pan, Astaire lost his temper and yelled at Rogers, who promptly burst into tears, whereupon her mother, Lela, [...] "came charging <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a mother rhinoceros protecting her young." ...|$|E
500|$|Recruitment posters {{in general}} {{have often been}} seen as a driving force helping to bring more than a million men into the Army. September 1914, {{coincident}} with publication of Leete's image, saw the highest number of volunteers enlisted. The Times recorded the scene in London on 3 January 1915; [...] "Posters appealing to recruits are to be seen on every hoarding, in most windows, in omnibuses, tramcars and commercial vans. The great base of Nelson's Column is covered with them. Their number and variety are remarkable. Everywhere Lord Kitchener sternly points a monstrously big finger, exclaiming 'I Want You'". One contemporaneous publication decried the use of advertising methods to enlist soldiers: [...] "the cold, basilisk eye of a gaudily-lithographed Kitchener rivets itself upon the possible recruit and the outstretched finger of the British Minister of War is levelled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> some revolver, with the words, 'I want you.' The idea is stolen from the advertisement of a 5c. American cigar." [...] Although it {{became one of the most}} famous posters in history, its widespread circulation did not halt the decline in recruiting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I live alone, because I can't help myself. What {{is a man}} to do, Mr. Bingham, {{when the}} woman he loves will not marry <b>him,</b> won't look <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> treats <b>him</b> <b>like</b> dirt?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{she looked}} up <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> frightened, <b>like</b> a thing that is afraid of death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brayvo! old feller," [...] cried Bluenose, [...] "give us your flipper. Water, cold, for ever! say I, as {{the whale}} remarked to the porpoise. But let's {{go under the}} lee o' the boat-'ouse an' talk it out, for we shan't nab Long Orrick this night, if we doesn't go <b>at</b> <b>'im</b> <b>like</b> a cat <b>at</b> a mouse." ...|$|R
2500|$|Soon after {{a meeting}} of 2007 with Democratic State Senator Mike Jacobs, meant to {{convince}} Jacobs to vote for Blagojevich's health insurance proposals, Jacobs emerged telling reporters that the Governor [...] "blew up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a 10-year-old child", Blagojevich {{would not comment on}} the alleged incident. Jacobs said during 2008: [...] "This is a governor who I don't think has a single ally, except for Senate president Emil Jones — and that's tenuous at best." [...] Jones and Blagojevich sometimes collaborated, while at other times they disagreed on funding for education.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that the punch was thrown {{by a member of}} Raekwon's entourage named Hanz. Hanz stated that he [...] "did not appreciate Budden speaking disrespectfully about Inspectah Deck and Method Man in interviews over the summer." [...] He further commented [...] "I punched him in the face because he was outta line. I look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like,</b> not the school yard bully, but the motherfucker that's always picking on a motherfucker that don't fuck with nobody. To say something about a nigga like Meth is crazy, Meth don't fuck with nobody. I'm not gonna sit here and say Rae made me do it, that was a spontaneous decision on my own. I'm glad I did it, 'cause he got a big mouth...It wasn't actually planned, he could have actually changed that whole situation as it unfolded, as it went on".|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head without looking <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>like</b> an abashed child.|$|E
60|$|But Aunt Emma only drew back, wrung {{her hands}} again in {{impotent}} despair, and stared <b>at</b> <b>him</b> blankly <b>like</b> a wounded creature.|$|R
60|$|The youth sprang <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> however, <b>like</b> lightning, and, {{hitting him}} a violent blow on the forehead, leapt {{back out of}} his reach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Skene, disparagingly. [...] "But ain't HE the gentleman! Just look <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> It's <b>like</b> the Prince of Wales {{walking down}} Pall Mall." ...|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{blinked and}} almost ducked. The words had come <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a projectile.|$|E
60|$|Mr Carker grinned <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a shark, {{but in an}} absent, {{thoughtful}} manner.|$|E
60|$|His {{unexpected}} presence {{seemed to}} deprive me almost of my wits. I simply gaped <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> the others.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Emperor Yao. Inscription reads: [...] "The god Yao, Fang Xun, was humane like Heaven itself, {{and wise}} like a divine being; {{to be near}} <b>him</b> was <b>like</b> {{approaching}} the sun, to look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> was <b>like</b> gazing into clouds".|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{something}} <b>like</b> horror in her soft full eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am afraid}} I press you,' he said, smiling in his gentle, chivalric German fashion. Helena glanced swiftly <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> She <b>liked</b> his grey eyes, {{she liked the}} {{agreeable}} intonation, and the pleasant sound of his words.|$|R
60|$|She {{gazed up}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a dumb beast at its butcher; {{she could not}} speak, her voice had gone.|$|E
60|$|She sat looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a woman {{turned to}} stone. There was incredulity in her eyes, incredulity and horror.|$|E
60|$|But {{the next}} moment Maggie {{snatched}} it from him, and glared <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a wounded war-goddess, quivering with rage and humiliation.|$|E
60|$|Sylvia {{smiled as}} she looked <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> She <b>liked</b> the man; she {{thought that he had}} a good deal she valued to offer her; but as yet she desired only his captivation. She must not allow him to go too far.|$|R
6000|$|It {{fell upon}} the table. Peter {{covered it with}} his hand and then slowly withdrew the fingers. A little shiver ran through his veins. The {{harmless}} head that looked up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> was <b>like</b> the figure of death. It was for him to strike the blow! ...|$|R
60|$|Philippa looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in {{something}} <b>like</b> dismay, {{rather like a}} child who has started an engine which she has no idea how to stop.|$|R
60|$|JUDITH. I {{want you}} to stay; but (suddenly raging <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> an angry child) it is not because I like you.|$|E
60|$|This time Mildmay was angry. He {{showed it}} alike {{in his speech}} and expression. Virginia looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a terrified child.|$|E
6000|$|... "`Spotted blinds, I {{think we}} said,' remarked Smith with a rogueish ruthlessness, and wagging the pistol-barrel <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a long {{metallic}} finger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't he just beautiful?" [...] {{she burst}} out. [...] "Oh, look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> spit! Just <b>like</b> a cat! Dale, he looks afraid he might fall off." ...|$|R
60|$|He swam off, sounded, came up, rolled around, {{went down}} again. But {{we did not}} get a look <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He fought <b>like</b> any other heavy swordfish.|$|R
6000|$|... "So this is Panhandle Smith?" [...] she interrupted, {{looking up}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with eyes <b>like</b> dark stars. [...] "No! No! No! I wouldn't degrade even a {{worthless}} cowboy." ...|$|R
6000|$|She seized his arm, {{made him}} stop, stood looking up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a frightened little girl. [...] "What's the matter, Godfrey?--what IS the matter?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was still}} kneeling, and now rested {{her hands on}} his knee, looking up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> one of Fra Lippo Lippi's round-cheeked adoring angels.|$|E
60|$|Sir James gave a small grunt, {{which was}} less respectful than his usual mode of {{answering}} his mother. Celia looked up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a thoughtful kitten.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{write to}} you about Georgy," [...] she said. [...] "Dear' William, how good you have been to him and to me. Look <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Isn't he <b>like</b> an angel?" ...|$|R
5000|$|To me, when I look <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> he's <b>like,</b> he's like, Eric Koston, {{but just}} with this, like ... take away all the, all the perfection, and everything, and add, like, this, like, lazy {{attitude}} problem, or something, you know, like, he's just, like, that good, but it's just like, [...] "Well, whatever". He's like, he's really that good.|$|R

He groks over that ..." ...|$|R
