5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as <b>a</b> <b>careless</b> downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E
5|$|The Palace of Westminster, {{the medieval}} royal palace {{used as the}} home of the British parliament, was largely {{destroyed}} by fire on 16 October 1834. The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks which had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed of in <b>a</b> <b>careless</b> manner in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.|$|E

Since 1979, the tower's interior is empty again. It is only accessed for maintenance {{and in the course}} of regular guided tours.|$|E

5|$|The Palace of Whitehall, to {{the east}} of the road, was {{originally}} named York Palace, but was renamed during the reign of Henry VIII. The palace was redesigned in 1531–32 and became the King's main residence later in the decade. He married Anne Boleyn here in 1533, followed by Jane Seymour in 1536, and died at the palace in 1547. Charles I owned an extensive art collection at the palace and several of William Shakespeare's plays had their first performances here. It ceased to be a royal residence after 1689, when William III moved to Kensington Palace. The palace was damaged by fire in 1691, following which the front entrance was redesigned by Sir Christopher Wren. In 1698, most of the palace burned to the ground accidentally after a fire started by <b>a</b> <b>careless</b> washerwoman.|$|E
5|$|Karthik Sivakumar (born 25 May 1977), {{better known}} by his stage name Karthi, is an Indian film actor {{who works in}} the Tamil film industry. The younger brother of actor Suriya, Karthi holds a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and master of {{business}} administration in Industrial Engineering. Since he had always wanted to become a film director, he returned to India and joined Mani Ratnam as an assistant director. He was offered acting roles and made his acting debut in Paruthiveeran in 2007 as the title character, <b>a</b> <b>careless</b> village ruffian, winning critical acclaim and several accolades including the Filmfare Award for Best Actor and a Tamil Nadu State Film Award. His next role was that of a coolie in Aayirathil Oruvan (2010), an adventure film directed by Selvaraghavan.He achieved consecutive commercial successes with his subsequent releases– Paiyaa (2010), Naan Mahaan Alla (2010) and Siruthai (2011). After appearing in a series of box office flops, he starred in successful films such as Biriyani (2013), Madras (2014) Oopiri (2016), and Kaatru Veliyidai (2017) which established him in Tamil cinema.|$|E

25|$|Here, {{one should}} also {{understand}} that an evil suggestion is {{the starting point of}} evil act. When it affects <b>a</b> <b>careless</b> or heedless person, it creates in him a desire for evil. Then, further whisperings change the evil desire into an evil intention and evil purpose. When the evil suggestion grows in intensity, the intention becomes a resolution, which then culminates in the evil act. Therefore, the meaning of seeking God's refuge from the evil of the whisperer is that God should nip the evil in the bud.|$|E

Cropp's campaign began running negative attack ads during the month before the primary, painting Fenty as unfit for the job and as <b>a</b> <b>careless</b> lawyer who had been admonished by the D.C. Bar, (in 2005, he received an informal admonition from the Bar for his role in a probate case in 1999). The attacks backfired. Fenty won all 142 city precincts in the Democratic Primary—a feat unparalleled in earlier mayoral elections—defeating Cropp by a 57 to 31 percent margin. He received 89 {{percent of the vote in}} the general election and became the District's sixth elected mayor since the establishment of home rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notorious}} murder {{was that of}} Walter Liggett, the founder and editor of a weekly paper called The Midwest American. He had been {{threatened}} and offered bribes to stay quiet, but he persisted in reporting on links he found between organized crime figures and Minnesota's ruling Farmer-Labor Party. Liggett was beaten up, prosecuted for a non-existent rape incident, and finally died after being machine gunned in the alley behind his home on December 9, 1935. His wife and daughter witnessed the assassination as did several neighbors. All identified Kid Cann as the shooter. Kid Cann was indicted by a grand jury, but poor investigative work and <b>a</b> <b>careless</b> trial meant that he was acquitted. Liggett's widow would always believe that Minnesota Governor Floyd Olson was deeply implicated in the murder. Her husband had repeatedly accused the governor of corruption.|$|E
25|$|The seed of {{the myth}} of Stuart Jacobite {{influence}} on the higher degrees may have been <b>a</b> <b>careless</b> and unsubstantiated remark made by John Noorthouk in the 1784 Book of Constitutions of the Premier Grand Lodge of London. It was stated, without support, that King Charles II (older brother and predecessor to James II) was made a Freemason in the Netherlands {{during the years of}} his exile (1649–60). However, there were no documented lodges of Freemasons on the continent during those years. The statement may have been made to flatter the fraternity by claiming membership for a previous monarch. This folly was then embellished by John Robison (1739–1805), a professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, in an anti-Masonic work published in 1797. The lack of scholarship exhibited by Robison in that work caused the Encyclopædia Britannica to denounce it.|$|E

Mention is made of two decorative panels Diana leaving the Bath, and a Young Nubian as almost the first fruits of his genius; but these did not attract public attention until much later, and the painting by which he practically opened his artistic career was the Apocalyptic Vision of St John, sent to the Salon of 1840.This was followed in 1843 by Evening, which received a medal of the second class, and afterwards became widely popular under the title Lost Illusions. It depicts a poet seated on the bank of a river, with his head drooping and a wearied posture, letting his lyre slip from <b>a</b> <b>careless</b> hand, and gazing sadly at a bright company of maidens whose song is slowly dying from his ear as their boat is borne slowly from his sight.|$|E

The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: [...] "Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; {{but there is something}} not very satisfactory about her.

500|$|From {{the sixth}} century {{to the end of}} the 19th century, historians had {{recognized}} that the Historia Augusta was a flawed and not a particularly reliable source, and since the 20th century modern scholars have tended to treat it with extreme caution. Older historians, such as Edward Gibbon, not fully aware of its problems with respect to the fictitious elements contained within it, generally treated the information preserved within it as authentic. For instance, in Gibbon's account of the reign of Gallienus, he uncritically reproduces the Historia Augusta's biased and largely fictional account of that reign. So when Gibbon states [...] "The repeated intelligence of invasions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with <b>a</b> <b>careless</b> smile; and singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production of the lost province, he carelessly asked, whether Rome must be ruined, unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt, and arras cloth from Gaul", he is reworking the passage in The Two Gallieni: ...|$|E

[...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song four stars out of five, commenting that although the song was [...] "formulaic," [...] the formula was executed convincingly. Chrissie Dickinson of the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "Mine" [...] is an epitome of Swift's classic song-craft, calling it [...] "simple but honest expressions of emotion."
