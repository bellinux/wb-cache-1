500|$|Actor {{and activist}} Jesse Williams has contrasted {{accuracy}} of the racist language used in the film with {{what he sees as}} the film's lack of accuracy about the general lives of slaves, too often portrayed as [...] "well-dressed Negresses in flowing gowns, frolicking on swings and enjoying leisurely strolls through the grounds, as if the setting is Versailles, mixed in with occasional acts of barbarism against slaves...

[...] Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of Grimm that [...] "there are moments– just a few stand out– {{when you realize that}} these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always." [...] Similarly, writing for BroadwayWorld, Elaina Lenertz stated, [...] "Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts.

500|$|Conversely, {{reflecting}} the transformation from script to screen, Dana Stevens of Slate disagrees with Gleiberman's {{suggestion that the}} [...] "film makes you think" [...] and argues that the film's [...] "eagerness" [...] to [...] "drag" [...] the audience [...] "through the lower depths of human experience" [...] leaves little space for independent [...] "conclusions". Stevens noted that while the film is about improvement and self-actualization, [...] "it wields <b>an</b> <b>awfully</b> large cudgel" [...] in contrast to Scott's view of balance: [...] "unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail)". Perhaps sharing Mathews' view regarding the daunting challenge of adapting the harsh story of Push, Stevens' observes that [...] "Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice {{to the kind of}} protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, black, overweight single mother from the inner city." ...|$|E

TV Guide contributor Matt Roush, in review of season four, said that without guest appearances from actors such as Douglas, the season [...] "would be <b>an</b> <b>awfully</b> sad misfire."

500|$|Connie Smith's {{sound is}} defined by the Nashville Sound musical style, {{primarily}} during her breakthrough years in the 1960s. While most Nashville Sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras, Smith's sound remained more traditional with its use of steel guitar and her twangy vocals, while still featuring some pop-influenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal. Critics have largely praised Smith's use of the steel guitar, which have often been described as [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "prominent". Smith's steel guitar player Weldon Myrick is often credited with creating what Smith has called [...] "The Connie Smith Sound". In an interview with Colin Escott in his book Born to Sing, Myrick recalls how Smith's producer (Bob Ferguson) wanted the guitar to sound, [...] "He came out and said he wanted a bright sound, and he adjusted my controls. I thought it was <b>an</b> <b>awfully</b> thin sound, but it wound up being very popular." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the release}} of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Grant reunited with its director, Mike Newell, for the tragicomedy <b>An</b> <b>Awfully</b> Big Adventure that was {{labelled}} a [...] "determinedly off-beat film" [...] by The New York Times. Grant portrayed a bitchy, supercilious director of a repertory company in post-World War II Liverpool. Critic Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "It shows that he has range as an actor," [...] but the San Francisco Chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film [...] "plays like a vanity production for Grant." [...] Janet Maslin, praising Grant as [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "a dashing cad under any circumstances," [...] commented, [...] "For him this film represents the road not taken. Made before Four Weddings and a Funeral was released, it captures Mr. Grant as the clever, versatile character actor he was then becoming, rather than the international dreamboat he is today." [...] Grant made his debut as a film producer with the 1996 thriller Extreme Measures. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel each gave the film {{three out of four}} stars with Siskel writing [...] "Hugh Grant's work in 'Extreme Measures' is a refreshing standout." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics praised Damon's {{performance}} in the episode. A television reviewer from The Sacramento Bee noted that Damon [...] "did a well-publicized (and very good) gig" [...] on the show. [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented that Damon was [...] "incredibly charming" [...] and funny. Matt Roush of TV Guide, in review of season four, said: [...] "If it weren't for some inspired guest stars — Matt Damon as a straight guy bluffing his way into a gay chorus, Michael Douglas as a gay detective clowning {{it up on the}} dance floor, Glenn Close as a lusty photographer groping both Will and Grace during a shoot — this season would be <b>an</b> <b>awfully</b> sad misfire." [...] Wales on Sundays Wil Marlow called Damon's performance {{one of the most memorable}} guest appearances in the history of the show, and commented that he [...] "held his own well against serial scene-stealer Sean Hayes." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald said the episode [...] "flies with jokes predicated on stereotypes and sexual innuendo", but [...] "Damon is a good sport with all the silliness, though, and seems more at ease here in the sitcom than he has in his last three films." [...] Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, said Damon was [...] "magnificent" [...] in the episode and a [...] "great experience" [...] for the cast of the show. Sean Hayes cites [...] "A Chorus Lie" [...] as one of his favorite episodes. In March 2006, Entertainment Weekly named Damon's guest spot as their number two most memorable guest appearance on Will & Grace.|$|E
500|$|While {{the film}} was not {{initially}} a box-office success, it gained popularity through numerous re-releases and was even voted as [...] "the best anime in history" [...] by the readers of Animage. Following a July 1992 release by Streamline Pictures, Janet Maslin said she thought the film [...] "should fare nearly as well [...] with animation fans of any age, provided they are unwavering in their devotion to the form and do not think 100 minutes is <b>an</b> <b>awfully</b> long time." [...] According to Maslin, the film is an [...] "interestingly wild hybrid of visual styles and cultural references" [...] whose [...] "animation is weak {{when it comes to}} fluid body movements, but outstanding in its attention to detail." [...] According to Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle, [...] "C of C refrains from the Technicolor ultra-violence that helped make films like , Akira, and Vampire Hunter D such audience favorites, and instead focuses on broad, almost slapstick humor and chaos to keep viewers riveted. Sometimes it works, and unfortunately, sometimes it doesn't." [...] review aggregator RottenTomatoes gies the film a 90% approval rating based on reviews from 10 critics. Some fans maintain {{that it is not a}} [...] "true" [...] Lupin title, due to Miyazaki's altering of the titular character into a bumbling hero, rather than his original ruthless criminal self. Monkey Punch, creator of Lupin III, called Castle of Cagliostro an [...] "excellent" [...] movie, but agreed Miyazaki's vision of Lupin differs from his own. He said, [...] "I wouldn't have had him rescue the girl, I would have had him rape her!" ...|$|E

[...] However, in the 1970s former basketball coach Bob Knight and football coach Lee Corso started using uniforms {{that were more}} scarlet or bright red. During the same time, cream gave way almost universally to white. But those colors reverted mostly to cream and crimson in the early 2000s, after then-athletics director Michael McNeely decided that the team uniforms needed to reflect the school's official colors of cream and crimson. Indiana cheerleaders still chant [...] "Go Big Red".

Ultimately, 54% of viewers voted in favour of burning the money, which was presented in a video set to Ellie Goulding's song [...] "Burn". Reaction to the stunt was negative; local charities complained that the money could have been donated instead of burned (and in turn, encouraged listeners to donate themselves), a listener started a petition demanding that CKMP {{be taken off the}} air, and others questioned the legality of the stunt—however, Canadian law only bans the burning of coins, and not paper currency. Morning show host Katie Summers defended the stunt, stating that [...] "Part of me is glad we burned the money. A week ago, all of the same people and all of the same charities in this city were just as in need.
