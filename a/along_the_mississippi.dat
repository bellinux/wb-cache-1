5|$|During the {{conflict}} over the Toledo Strip, the Erie Canal was built, linking New York City and the Eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes at Buffalo. The canal, finished in 1825, immediately became a major route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the Midwest) could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into boomtowns.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century, the Sauk and Meskwaki (or Fox) Native American tribes lived <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River {{in what is}} now the U.S. {{states of}} Illinois and Iowa. The two tribes had become closely {{connected}} after having been displaced from the Great Lakes region in conflicts with New France and other Native American tribes, particularly after the so-called Fox Wars ended in the 1730s. By the time of the Black Hawk War, the population of the two tribes was about 6,000 people.|$|E
5|$|New Orleans {{was settled}} on a natural high ground <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. Later {{developments}} that eventually extended to nearby Lake Pontchartrain were built on fill to bring them above the average lake level. Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake into {{the interior of the}} city to promote waterborne commerce. After the construction of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1940, the state closed these waterways causing the town's water table to lower drastically.|$|E
5|$|The Union counteroffensive never came; the Army of the Potomac was {{exhausted}} and nearly as damaged {{at the end}} of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was content to hold the field. On July 4, the armies observed an informal truce and collected their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant accepted the surrender of the Vicksburg garrison <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River, splitting the Confederacy in two. These two Union victories are generally considered the turning point of the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} in {{the middle}} of September affected some of the same areas along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico as the August hurricane. It was first detected on the evening of September 10 in the southeastern Gulf, although its track may be far off from the actual storms movement {{due to a lack of}} available information. Its first data point in the hurricane database lists it as possessing sustained winds of , placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm followed a broad northward curve through the central Gulf of Mexico, making landfall <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River Delta of Louisiana on the night of September 14. It continued toward the north-northeast, dissipating on September 16.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{months after}} {{the signing of the}} Jay Treaty, the United States and Spain agreed to the Treaty of San Lorenzo, also known as Pinckney's Treaty. Signed on October 27, 1795, the treaty {{established}} intentions of peace and friendship between the U.S. and Spain; established the southern boundary of the U.S. with the Spanish colonies of East Florida and West Florida, with Spain relinquishing its claim on the portion of West Florida north of the 31st parallel; and established the western U.S. border as being <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River from the northern U.S. to the 31st parallel.|$|E
5|$|The Milwaukee-class {{monitors}} were a {{class of}} four riverine ironclad monitors built during the American Civil War. Several supported Union forces <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River in mid-1864 before participating in the Battle of Mobile Bay in August. Chickasaw and Winnebago bombarded Confederate coastal fortifications during the battle and during subsequent operations as well as engaging the ironclad Tennessee II. The other two ships arrived at Mobile Bay after the battle and all four supported the land attacks on Mobile in March–April 1865. Milwaukee struck a torpedo during this time and sank. The surviving three ships were sold in 1874; Chickasaw was converted into a ferry and survived until 1944 when she was scuttled. Her wreck was discovered in 2004.|$|E

5|$|The false {{story of}} the {{execution}} of the Ho-Chunk prisoners, along with the incessant American trespassing, convinced some Ho-Chunks to take up arms against the United States. The timing seemed right, since the evacuation of Fort Crawford appeared to be a sign of American weakness. Another grievance was the news that some Ho-Chunk women had been sexually assaulted by American riverboat crews <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River, although this story, like the one about the executions, may have been a false rumor. The Ho-Chunks broke off diplomatic relations with the United States by not showing up for a scheduled treaty conference, and prepared for war.|$|E
5|$|Transportation in Minnesota is {{overseen by}} the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT for short and used in the local news media). Principal {{transportation}} corridors radiate from the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area and Duluth. The major Interstate highways are Interstate35 (I-35), I-90, and I-94, with I-35 and I-94 passing through the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area, and I-90 traveling east-west along {{the southern edge of}} the state. In 2006, a constitutional amendment was passed that required sales and use taxes on motor vehicles to fund transportation, with at least 40 percent dedicated to public transit. There are nearly two dozen rail corridors in Minnesota, most of which go through Minneapolis–St. Paul or Duluth. There is water transportation <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River system and from the ports of Lake Superior.|$|E
5|$|After Spain sent Columbus on {{his first}} voyage to the New World in 1492, other explorers followed. The first Europeans to arrive in {{territory}} of the modern United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made {{his first visit to}} Florida in 1513; however, if unincorporated territories are accounted for, then credit would go to Christopher Columbus who landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage. Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine and Santa Fe. The French established their own as well <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.|$|E

5|$|After moving ashore, {{the storm}} quickly {{weakened}} into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula. Late on July19, it emerged into the Bay of Campeche. It {{turned to the}} northwest due to a ridge moving eastward, and the system re-intensified into a tropical storm on July 21. At around 0800 UTC on July 23, the storm moved ashore on Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas with winds of about 45 mph (75 km/h). The storm again weakened to a tropical depression shortly after landfall, before turning {{to the north and}} north-northeast. On July 24, the cyclone began interacting with a cold front, and became extratropical. It tracked slowly eastward across eastern Texas and northern Louisiana due to a high pressure area to the north. It later moved <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River, and early on July 27, the front absorbed the depression along the border of Arkansas and Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane. In addition to the death of the three at the lighthouse, it was noted that the schooner Daisy had been dismantled there, with one person killed. A person who was climbing a small tree was thrown away by the wind and drowned. Several people were trapped in their homes after a creek topped its banks. A warehouse and four other buildings were destroyed, while a bank's roof was blown off. A train near Brookhaven was washed away along the tracks of the Mississippi Central Railroad, resulting in the injury of five people. 25 schooners <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> coastline were completely destroyed. Two barks, the Nurnberg and Hercules were destroyed during the hurricane. Mandeline, owned by Norway, was filled with water, while Sigrav suffered severe damage, completely torn apart. A boat known as the Florine was washed ashore. A total of 78fatalities occurred.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of recorded American history, the Harrisburg area was inhabited by several Algonquian tribes, including the Shawnee and Piankashaw, {{who lived in the}} dense inland forests. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the Piankashaw tribe was driven out by the more aggressive Shawnee. European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750, mainly <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. American settlers arrived in 1790. The French came as merchants and missionaries, with farming supplementing the need for trade. The result had benefited both the settlers and the Native Americans. The American migration, however, followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through American Law, ignoring previous indigenous rights. Encroachment ensued and caused hard feelings between the Indians and the settlers who moved into the interior and along migration routes. Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist, though trade with the Americans was an important reason why the Native Americans remained largely peaceful.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the line was {{finished}} there were public calls from {{inside and outside the}} company for Helm to resign, mostly because of his support for a proposed Memphis branch of the railroad. To complete the branch, the Louisville and Nashville would have to complete a line from Bowling Green to Guthrie, Kentucky. There it would join a line owned by the Memphis and Ohio Railroad that began across the state line at Clarksville, Tennessee and extended to Memphis. Supporters believed the branch would economically help both Louisville and Memphis and would lessen their dependence on trade <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> and Ohio Rivers. Opponents argued that the project was simply a ploy to whip up new support for the struggling railroad. Helm endorsed the Memphis branch in his annual report in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Drawn by the city's prosperous economy, the Blackburns {{relocated}} to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1847. Luke Blackburn quickly became {{an active member}} of the community, helping found a temperance society, joining a militia group, and becoming the administrator of a local hospital. He became a close associate of Jefferson Davis and William Johnson. In 1848, Blackburn served as the city's health officer and implemented the first successful quarantine against a yellow fever outbreak in the Mississippi River valley. Using his own personal funds, he established a hospital for boatmen who navigated the Mississippi River. He also successfully lobbied the Congress to establish a hospital in Natchez; upon its completion in 1852, he was appointed surgeon there. In 1854, he implemented another successful quarantine against yellow fever. The Mississippi Legislature commissioned Blackburn to lobby the Louisiana State Legislature to establish a quarantine at New Orleans to protect cities <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River; Louisiana authorized him to organize such a system.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, efforts {{began to}} turn a city dump into a landmark. The project was to {{construct}} a municipal stadium (now called Modern Woodmen Park). The project was financed by bonds, and cost more than $150,000. Special features included reserved seats, box seats, and night lighting. The stadium was home to the Saint Ambrose University football games, and boxing matches. Today the stadium {{is home to the}} Quad Cities River Bandits baseball team. By 1932, thousands of Davenporters were on public relief due to the Great Depression. A shantytown grew in the west end of the city <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. Sickness, hunger, and unsanitary living conditions plagued the area. Through county and municipal government, the federal Civil Works Administration gave employment to thousands of men. They worked to extend the seawall along the riverfront. More than 200 jobs were created by the construction of Lock and Dam 15 project, in 1932. Hundreds of state employees worked on completing the Kimberly Road Outerbelt Bypass in 1936.|$|E
