5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked me in <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over {{what had once been}} her face.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Umaga and Jeff Hardy for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Hardy started the match attacking Umaga with moves such as dropkicks, {{inverted}} mule kicks and <b>a</b> <b>Whisper</b> in the Wind. Hardy {{had a chance}} to make the cover, but instead attempted to perform a Swanton Bomb. Umaga avoided the move and charged Hardy in the corner. Umaga then performed a Samoan Spike and pinned Hardy after to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Another candidate, Harold See, {{ran against}} Mark Kennedy, an {{incumbent}} Democratic {{justice and the}} son-in-law of George Wallace. The race included charges that Kennedy was mingling campaign funds with those of a non-profit children's foundation he was involved with. A former Rove staffer reported that some within the See camp initiated <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> campaign that Kennedy was a pedophile. Kennedy won by less than one percentage point.|$|E

25|$|In 1882, Alger's father died. Alger {{continued}} to produce stories of honest boys outwitting evil, greedy squires and malicious youths. His work appeared in hardcover and paperback, and decades-old poems {{were published in}} anthologies. He led a busy life with street boys, Harvard classmates, and the social elite. In Massachusetts, he was regarded with the same reverence as Harriet Beecher Stowe. He tutored with never <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> of scandal.|$|E
25|$|Richards was a {{topic in}} the film Bush's Brain (by Joseph Mealey and Michael Shoob), in a long segment {{regarding}} her defeat in the 1994 election for Texas governor. The film presents {{the case that the}} defeat of Richards involved <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> campaign that the governor (mother of four children) was a lesbian because she had allegedly hired many gays and lesbians to work on her re-election campaign.|$|E
25|$|In most congregations, the oleh {{does not}} himself read the Torah aloud. Rather, he stands near it while a practiced expert, called a ba'al k'ri'ah ("one {{in charge of}} reading"; {{sometimes}} ba'al ko're), reads the Torah, with cantillation, for the congregation. In some congregations the oleh follows along with the expert, reading in <b>a</b> <b>whisper.</b> In Yemenite communities, the oleh reads the portion himself, while another person, usually a young boy, recites the Targum after each verse.|$|E

25|$|Filming {{began in}} November 1997. On {{the first day}} of {{principal}} photography, Anderson delivered his directions to Murray in <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> so {{that he would not be}} embarrassed if the actor shot him down. However, the actor publicly deferred to Anderson, hauled equipment, and when Disney denied the director a $75,000 shot of Max and Mr. Blume riding in a helicopter, Murray gave Anderson a blank check to cover the cost, although ultimately the scene was never shot.|$|E
25|$|In April of {{that same}} year, he married Sarah Hall Boardman, widow of fellow missionary George Boardman. They had eight children, five of whom survived to adulthood. Sarah's health began failing and {{physicians}} recommended a return to America. Sarah died en route at St. Helena on September 1, 1845. He continued home, where he was greeted as a celebrity and toured the eastern seaboard raising the profile of and money for missionary activity. Because he could barely speak above <b>a</b> <b>whisper,</b> due to pulmonary illness, his public addresses were made by speaking to an assistant, who would then address the audience.|$|E
25|$|Higher wind {{pressures}} {{increased the}} speaking volume of theatre organ pipes, {{and they were}} placed in chambers, usually high in the auditorium. The fronts of these chambers were covered {{with a set of}} swell shades which opened and closed like venetian blinds. When closed, the sound of the organ was reduced to <b>a</b> <b>whisper.</b> With a foot pedal, the organist could gradually open the shutters to produce louder and louder sounds from the same pipes. Although this type of swell chamber was not new, theatre organ developments permitted a much broader dynamic range than ever before.|$|E

Muir died at home in Devon, Alberta on March 14, 2016.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} between the Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy and Randy Orton for Orton's WWE Championship. Early in the match, Hardy {{performed}} a Baseball Slide on Orton who hit head-first into the barricade outside due to the impact. Knowing he couldn't win the WWE Championship via a countout victory, Hardy brought the knocked-out Orton into the ring. Later, Orton took advantage in the match, as he applied a Body Scissors on Hardy, followed by a choke-hold. Some of the other main highlights of the match were Hardy performing <b>a</b> <b>Whisper</b> in the Wind on Orton; and, laterexecuting a Moonsault from the top-rope to Orton outside the ring. When Hardy brought Orton back in the ring and tried to deliver a Twist of Fate, Orton suddenly reversed it into an RKO and pinned Hardy to retain his WWE title.|$|E
25|$|Goddard's serious {{bout with}} {{tuberculosis}} weakened his lungs, affecting {{his ability to}} work, and was one reason he liked to work alone, {{in order to avoid}} argument, and confrontation with others and use his time fruitfully. He labored with the prospect of a shorter than average life span. After arriving in Roswell, Goddard applied for life insurance, but when the company doctor examined him he said that Goddard belonged in a bed in Switzerland (where he could get the best care). Goddard's health began to deteriorate further after moving to the humid climate of Maryland to work for the Navy. He was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1945. He continued to work, able to speak only in <b>a</b> <b>whisper,</b> until surgery was required, and he died in August of that year in Baltimore, Maryland. He was buried in Hope Cemetery in his home town of Worcester, Massachusetts.|$|E

25|$|On {{the eve of}} the 18th birthday, a half-fairy half-mortal {{girl named}} Lyra had a strange dream. All her friends and family were there tonight to {{celebrate}} that special event, and Lyra's grandfather Tangle had prepared an amazing gift for her. But then Lyra heard <b>a</b> <b>whisper,</b> and everyone quickly disappeared. Waking up from that dream, Lyra finds herself alone in her beloved Town of Wish as she is being trapped in a parallel dimension which is very similar to her original one. Guided by the messages left by Tangle plus using her father's magically hidden airship, Lyra breaks out to find Tangle's odd fairy friend simply called the Clockmaker, who is the only stranger could help her get back home, and reunite with family and friends. She finds the Clockmaker in his hideout and thankfully, he agrees to help. Lyra have to find three magical keys in three separately hidden areas; Treehouse Village, Wind Music Island, and Water Collector; to re-activate the Clockmaker's Time Synchronization Machine.|$|E
25|$|In September 1916, Christie {{enlisted in}} the army; he was called up in April 1917 to join the 52nd Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment, {{to serve as an}} infantryman. In April 1918, the {{regiment}} was despatched to France, where Christie was seconded to the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment as a signalman. That June, he was injured in a mustard gas attack and spent a month in a military hospital in Calais. Christie claimed this attack left him permanently unable to speak loudly. Later in life, he also claimed the attack had rendered him blind and mute {{for three and a half}} years. His period of muteness was, he claimed, the reason for his inability to talk much louder than <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> for the rest of his life. Ludovic Kennedy points out that no record of his blindness has been traced and that, while Christie may have lost his voice when he was admitted to hospital, he would not have been discharged as fit for duty had he remained a mute. His inability to talk loudly, Kennedy argues, was a psychological reaction to the gassing rather than a lasting toxic effect of the gas. That reaction, and Christie's exaggeration of the effects of the attack, stemmed from an underlying personality disorder that caused him to exaggerate or feign illness as a ploy to get attention and sympathy.|$|E

Patton's spoken narration is delivered in Italian, although taped samples feature Sanguineti speaking in English. From <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> to a shout, the words carry {{a variety of}} emotional tones as the work progresses. The choral parts respond to the narration both with unified chanting and with disjointed arguing, the latter serving to increase the tension.
