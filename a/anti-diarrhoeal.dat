40|$|Background: Diarrhoea {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of infant mortality. This article {{analyzes}} its contribution towards the realization of millennium development goal number 4 (MDG- 4). Methods: A PubMed search using keywords acute infant diarrhea together with prevalence, management, or prevention 23 of the 634 generated articles were reviewed for inclusion. Results: WHO first expressed concern about diarrhoeal mortality in 1979. Two decades later it reported diarrhoea as the second leading cause of infant mortality worldwide. The annual death toll of 1. 5 million is greater than AIDS, malaria and measles combined. Short term repercussions (dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition, shock, death) plus long-term diminished fitness index, cognitive function, and school performance have major impact on society. Ever since its 1971 success, Oral Rehydration Therapy has been the cornerstone treatment of diarrhoea. Decreased compliance has been recorded worldwide with Kenya ranking first. Intravenous therapy is useful in preventing complications while <b>anti-diarrhoeals</b> and anti-microbials, are indicated in severe cases. Zinc supplementation has also proven effective, and is recommended along with rehydration. Furthermore, immunization and good hygiene prevent faecal-oral transmissions. Conclusion: MDG- 4 aims to reduce childhood mortality by 2 / 3 by 2015. Studies, however, show minimal progress, and the target is likely to be missed.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 29). Opsonin Pharma Limited is a private limited company. Opsonin is committed to improve its position continuously as a Leading Pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh and strengthen its global presence. Opsonin creates value for its customers and other stakeholders by providing highest quality health care solutions through appropriate application and development of resources and processes.. Its main market is in Southeast Asia Africa Eastern Asia. It is involved with manufacturing, distributing and wholesaling. Main products of Opsonin Pharma includes Antihistamines, vitamins and minerals, NSAIDS, Antispasmodics, Corticosteroids, Laxatives, Expectorants, Analgesics, Antiprotozoals, and <b>Anti-diarrhoeals.</b> Opsonin Pharma Limited is renowned for its outstanding product quality, world class manufacturing facilities, product development capabilities and unparalleled services.

As a pharmaceutical company, they improve health not only through the production and distribution of medicine to our consumers, but also through our commitment to protect the environment, health and safety of our co workers and the communities where they operate. My internship report on Opsonin Pharma Limited is to study performance evaluation practice of the company finding lacking and corrective actions. In this consideration I have presented the existing practice. Base on Key result area performance of employees is evaluated by the departmental heads. Performance evaluation form is circulated at the end of the year. Form is filled up both the apprise and appraiser. There is a scoring where A (90 and above) stands for outstanding performance. All functional head forward performance appraisal form to HRD. Then HRD summaries the evaluation and make a promotion and upgradation committee. The committee decides the employees entitled for promotion and upgradation. In the performance evaluation of Opsonin Pharma Ltd. I have the following findings:  Though Opsonin Pharma Limited has well-structured policies and procedures for performance evaluation but there are some lacking in the area of setting KRA (Key result area) and properly evaluating employees by the departmental heads.  Though there is a provision for weightage in key performance areas but it is not being implemented due to lack of coordination. Say for example, commercial departments tasks is delayed by non-cooperation of other functional areas. As a result they are not interested to set fix any time frame base on which performance can be evaluated.  Within the fixed time frame performance evaluation is not done due to lack of coordination from other departments that should be improved.  Opsonin Pharma has no formal (written) vision, mission and goals and Organizational Objectives that is a serious issue to be defined. In this regard I have the following recommendation: For evaluating performance properly Opsonin Pharma Should take initiative to redesign job structure as well as Job description, Specification. Opsonin should introduce vision, mission, goals and organization objectives of the organization. After setting organizational objectives we should introduce departmental objectives which will help us to define Key result area. After setting KRA weight should be given and then proper monitoring of an incumbents responsibility should be done through the departmental Heads. Departmental Head should properly introduce with the performance evaluation, setting KPI aligned with the organizational objectives. Md. Samauz ZohaM. Business Administratio...|$|R

Clinical signs were observed regularly. Sera were analyzed for enzymatic activities of AST, ALT and metabolic indicators such as total protein, albumin, sodium, potassium and calcium. Also, changes in values xi of RBCS, Hb, PCV, MCV and MCHC were recorded. The weight of faeces was recorded too for assessment of diarrhoeal inhibition. In both experiments, clinically no signs of toxicity were observed, no deaths or gross changes in the examined vital organs. Metabolic indicators; total protein, potassium and calcium demonstrated significant increase while sodium and albumin showed no significant changes at dose 400 mg/kg. In haematological parameters there were significant decrease in values of RBCs, PCV and MCHC while Hbconcentration showed significant increase. MCV values indicated no changes. Plant extract’s safety showed no {{significant change in the}} serum (ALT) activity while in (AST) activitythere was significant increase. In serum metabolites, there were no changes in the concentration of total protein and albumin when compared with the un-dosed control group {{at the end of the}} experiment. The concentration of sodium and potassium showed significant increase. There were significant decrease in the concentration of haematological parameters tested; RBCS, Hb and PCV. MCHC showed significant increase, while MCV values demonstrated no changes. The results were discussed with suggestions for future studies...|$|E
40|$|Intestinal {{diseases}} {{are one of}} the main causes of death in infants, particularly in developing countries. It is therefore impor-tant to identify and evaluate commonly available natural drugs as an alternative to currently-used <b>anti-diarrhoeal</b> drugs. The current protocol outlined in the literature is used to characterize and identify many natural products. The effects of food deprivation in rats, employed for evaluating gastric motility, have been reviewed (Vermeulen et al. 1997, AWIC 1999, Mälkki & Virtanen 2001). Several recent research papers deal with motility effects using food deprivation for 18 h or overnight in mice or rats (Das et al...|$|E
40|$|Ethanol {{extracts}} of {{the fresh}} aerial parts of various Epilobium species were tested to elucidate the mechanism of their gastrointestinal activity in animals. The methods of charcoal meal, castor oil-induced diarrhoea, and enteropooling assay were used to evaluate their effect on mouse gut at various dose levels. The extracts {{were found to have}} a significant activity in all models. Moreover, the extracts resulted to possess very little toxicity. Thus, it can be concluded that Epilobium possesses <b>anti-diarrhoeal,</b> anti-motility, and anti-secretory activities and can prove beneficial in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.

40|$|The diverse {{physiological}} {{actions of}} somatostatin are mediated {{by a family}} of G-protein coupled receptors (SSTRs). Several peptide analogues of somatostatin such as octreotide {{have been developed for}} therapeutic use, including treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as secretory diarrhoea. However, their development as <b>anti-diarrhoeal</b> agents has been limited by poor oral bioavailability, necessitating parenteral administration. This in vitro study investigated the anti-secretory potential of a group of novel, non-peptide, somatostatin-receptor agonists that selectively activate specific SSTR subtypes to assess their potential for oral administration. The ability of the agonists to inhibit forskolin-stimulated chloride secretion was measured using a sensitive bioassay system in isolated rat colonic mucosa. The SSTR- 2 selective agonist, L- 779, 976 was 10 -times more potent than octreotide as an inhibitor of secretion when added to the basolateral surface of rat colon. Non-peptide agonists selective for SSTR 1 (L- 797, 591), SSTR 3 (L- 796, 778), SSTR 4 (L- 803, 087) or SSTR 5 (L- 817, 818) showed little or no anti-secretory activity in this preparation. L- 779, 976 was able to inhibit secretion when applied to the luminal surface at sub-micromolar concentrations suggesting that it can cross the colonic epithelium. The anti-secretory potency of luminal L- 779, 976 was increased 3 fold in the presence of GF 120918, a known inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Non-peptide somatostatin receptor agonists may provide a basis for the development of new, orally available <b>anti-diarrhoeal</b> therapies...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the anti-diarrheal activity of leaf of Melastoma malabathricum in rats. Anti-diarrheal effects of the ethanol extracts at 100, 200 and 400 mg/Kg were evaluated in rats using castor oil induced models. Results showed that the ethanol extract exhibited significant and dose dependent <b>anti-diarrhoeal</b> activity in the model used. A percentage diarrheal inhibition of extract at 400 mg/Kg was 93. 67 %. Diarrheal protection in the model used by the extract is dose dependent and the diarrhoeal inhibitory effects of the extract are comparable to loperemide. Therefore, a result of present study suggests that the ethanol extract of Melastoma malabathricum possesses anti-diarrheal activity...|$|E

30|$|Aluminium is {{the third}} most {{abundant}} element in the earth's crust and is therefore a natural component of drinking water and foodstuffs and is a component of many manufactured materials. Exposure {{of the human body}} to aluminium may be by food [1 – 8] including drinking water, fruit juices wine and beer [9 – 11], articles of daily use that are made of aluminium, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals such as local therapeutic agents, <b>anti-diarrhoeal</b> drugs or antacids. Increased aluminium exposure can be compensated for by excretion via intestines and normal, healthy kidneys. Kidney insufficiency was shown to result in increased aluminium concentrations in the kidneys of dialysis patients, possibly resulting from dialysis fluids that may contain substantial concentrations of aluminium [12].|$|E
