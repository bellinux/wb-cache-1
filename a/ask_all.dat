25|$|The DM also {{includes}} the ability to save partially complete DSN's, with code and logic to ask the user for any missing information at runtime. For instance, a DSN can be created without a required password. When an ODBC application attempts to connect to the DBMS using this DSN, the system will pause and ask the user to provide the password before continuing. This frees the application developer from having to create this sort of code, as well as having to know which questions to <b>ask.</b> <b>All</b> of this {{is included in the}} driver and the DSNs.|$|E
500|$|After the {{election}} was called in April 1957 for 10 June, Howe raised sufficient money to enable the Liberals to heavily outspend their opponents. [...] As there were few Liberal ministers from western Canada, Howe was called upon to make appearances throughout the region. He found that the Manitoba Farmers Union was organizing opposition to the Liberals; at some meetings Howe had difficulty getting heard at all. At other meetings, Howe engaged in well publicised conflicts with audience members. On 19 May in Morris, Manitoba, Howe told one man demanding to speak that when his own party held a meeting, he could <b>ask</b> <b>all</b> the questions he wanted. The man, Bruce Mackenzie, {{proved to be the}} head of a local Liberal association. As Howe left, another man asked why he had not answered his question, posed earlier. Howe replied, [...] "Look here, my good man, when {{the election}} comes, why don't you go away and vote for the party you support? [...] In fact, why don't you just go away?" [...] At another meeting a few days later, Howe was asked why he did not care about the farmers's economic plight. [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government", Howe replied, poking the questioner in the midsection.|$|E

2500|$|Bartlett's last {{published}} book of poetry, Around the Clock, {{appeared in}} 1989. Maxine Kumin commended {{the book with}} these words: [...] "Elizabeth Bartlett enumerates the eternal questions that preoccupy us 'while we try to sleep / on the rough floor of our hearts.' In the strictest of forms , she examines the human condition; the poetry is pitiless, yet redemptive." [...] Similarly, Josephine Jacobsen praised this work: [...] "Elizabeth Bartlett understands that the very large and the very small are siblings. Perceptive and emotionally vital, her poems <b>ask</b> <b>all</b> our own questions, poems in an original and lucid form." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 7, 2006, Webb {{released}} his first television advertisement, which included footage of a 1985 speech by Ronald Reagan that praised Webb's {{service as a}} Marine. The next day, the Chief of Staff for the Reagan Library wrote Webb's campaign on behalf of former first lady Nancy Reagan, urging them not to air the advertisement saying it was neither fair nor respectful because it {{gave the impression of}} an endorsement. The Webb campaign disagreed, saying, [...] "What Reagan said about Jim Webb, that belongs to Jim Webb, frankly." [...] The library said they <b>ask</b> <b>all</b> candidates to refrain from using the former president's image but declined to say if they would request the Allen campaign to remove the image of Reagan used on his campaign website.|$|E
2500|$|Raeder's last speech {{occurred}} as Commander-in-Chief occurred on 30 January 1943 before the Reichstag, where {{he asserted that}} he had brought the Navy [...] "smoothly and completely" [...] into {{the service of the}} Führer in 1933. Raeder argued that: [...] "This was possible only because, despite all outside efforts to influence it, the training of the Navy [...] derived from an inner attitude that was itself truly National Socialist. For this reason, we did not have to change, but could become followers of the Führer with open hearts. I find it particularly satisfying that the Führer has always attributed this to me, and I would like to <b>ask</b> <b>all</b> of you {{to see to it that}} the Navy remains a strong and reliable support of the Führer in this regard". Though Hitler had cordial relations with Raeder, the two had never been close, and there was nothing like the mutual admiration that Hitler and Dönitz shared.|$|E
2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will <b>ask</b> <b>all</b> of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E
