40|$|The {{presence}} of excess ^ 40 Ar in (ultra-) high pressure ((U) HP) metamorphic rocks {{shows that the}} assumption of open system argon exchange between the source mineral and the grain boundary is not valid. Typically, phengites from (U) HP metasediments have apparent ^ 40 Ar/^ 39 Ar ages < 50 % {{in excess of the}} age of peak (U) HP conditions, whereas cogenetic mafic eclogites yield ages up to 700 % older, despite lower bulk-rock K_ 2 O concentrations. Given the highly incompatible behaviour of argon, the fraction of protolith-derived ^ 40 Ar that is retained by mica on equilibration under (U) HP conditions reflects {{the extent to which the}} rock has behaved as an open or closed system to volatile-loss during subduction. This has not previously been quantified for (U) HP rocks A model is developed that calculates excess <b>argon</b> <b>age</b> fractions as a function of variable mica—fluid K_D, bulk K_ 2 O and porosity under closed system conditions. Using two recently-published single-grain ^ 40 Ar/^ 39 Ar datasets from the Tauern Window [1] and Oman [2] HP terranes, measured excess argon concentrations in mafic eclogites are reproduced only when porosities are 10 ^- 3, reflecting loss of significant volumes of lattice-bound H_ 2 O relative to mafic rocks during subduction. These results are supported by phase equilibria calculations of H_ 2 O loss during progade metamorphism of a MORB and pelitic rock composition: pelites lose H_ 2 O continuously along subduction geotherms, whereas MORB compositions require hydration, or, liberate small quantities of structurally bound H_ 2 O. Violation of the model assumptions by loss of argon, or transiently higher porosities will lower the excess <b>argon</b> <b>age.</b> Accordingly, the porosity estimates provide a limiting case to examine the effects of fluid availability, permeability and argon diffusivity on the accumulation of excess argon under (U) HP conditions. The model highlights how argon can be used as a tracer for the time-integrated effects of metamorphic devolatisation and as a means to understand the mechanisms by which volatiles are transported to mantle-depths...|$|E

The large basalt fragments give reasonable Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 release patterns and yield well defined crystallization ages of 3. 89 - 3. 95 aeons. Correlation of the Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 release patterns with Ar- 39 /Ar- 37 patterns showed that the low temperature fractions with high radiogenic argon loss came from K-rich phases. A highly shocked sample and fragments included in the breccia yield complex release patterns with a low temperature peak. The total <b>argon</b> <b>age</b> of these fragments is 3. 95 aeons.

40|$|Goonbarrow, a China Clay pit {{situated}} {{within the}} St. Austell granite China Clay region, {{is the subject}} of a varied geochemical and isotopic study to determine the mode of genesis of the kaolinite and associated tin/tungsten mineralisation. Detailed geological mapping in conjunction with a geochemical study of the micas indicated that Goonbarrow is situated at the junction of the petrographically distinct phases of the St. Austell granite. An unusual assymmetric curved-feldspar-crystal pegmatite is found at the junction. Elvans at Goonbarrow and three other locations within the St. Austell granite are shown to be intruded during hydrothermal activity and in some cases after major vein formation. Three main types of vein were recognised in Goonbarrow, the major ones being spatially associated with zones of kaolinised granite. A potassium/ <b>argon</b> <b>age</b> study showed that the granites, pegmatite and greisens (and by inference tin/tungsten mineralisation) were formed at about 280 ± 10 m. y. Four elvans, including Goonbarrow, were dated at around 272 m. y. Three of these elvans crosscut major vein, swarms. Age determinations on fine grained muscovite produced predominantly during kaolinisation and several kaolinised potassium feldspars also gave Hercynian eges. Scanning electron microscopy studies on daughter minerals in fluid inclusions indicated the presence of Al, As, Ca, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Kg, Mn, Na, S, Sn and Zn although many of these elements were not present in minerals in the pit. Temperatures, pressures and salinities of vein fluids were determined by conventional fluid inclusion studies, which also indicated that the veins vere boiling. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope studies on vein quartz and greisen muscovites coupled with a re-interpretation of previous work and the fluid inclusion study produced a new model for the genesis of Cornish China Clay. Kaolinite genesis from the vapour phase of hot boiling fluids intimately associated with greisen bordered quartz/tourmaline veins of Hercynian age is favoured. </p...|$|E

40|$|We report 40 Ar/ 39 Ar {{data for}} zoned micas from three {{sampling}} {{sites in the}} Lake Lewis leucogranite in the South Mountain batholith (SMB) of Nova Scotia. Individual grains of mica contain oscillatory zones of Msss, the main white mica, and IMP, a weakly pleochroic intermediate mica phase, in sufficiently large volumes to provide good targets for laser dating. The mean age of Msss from the three sampling sites is 380 – 2 Ma; the maximum age recorded is ca. 382 Ma. Data from IMP define a population that has about this same upper limit in age but a significantly younger lower limit. We observe only slight intragrain variations in age at all three sites, but detect significant (i. e., ~ 2 – 3 %) intergrain variations at two sites. We conclude that these primary micas cooled through the Ar closure temperature (nominally, 350 C) at 381 – 1 Ma. Comparison with other geochronological data suggests that, within analytical uncertainty, {{this is the time}} of crystallization of the SMB. The younger <b>argon</b> <b>ages,</b> mainly from IMP, may reflect post-emplacement loss of argon resulting from pervasive ca. 370 Ma (and possibly later) magmatic or hydro-thermal activity in the SMB.

40|$|Homo erectus was {{the first}} human lineage to {{disperse}} widely throughout the Old World, the only hominin in Asia {{through much of the}} Pleistocene, and was likely ancestral to H. sapiens. The demise of this taxon remains obscure because of uncertainties regarding the geological age of its youngest populations. In 1996, some of us co-published electron spin resonance (ESR) and uranium series (U-series) results indicating an age as young as 35 - 50 ka for the late H. erectus sites of Ngandong and Sambungmacan and the faunal site of Jigar (Indonesia). If correct, these ages favor an African origin for recent humans who would overlap with H. erectus in time and space. Here, we report (40) Ar/(39) Ar incremental heating analyses and new ESR/U-series age estimates from the " 20 m terrace" at Ngandong and Jigar. Both data sets are internally consistent and provide no evidence for reworking, yet they are inconsistent with one another. The (40) Ar/(39) Ar analyses give an average age of 546 ± 12 ka (sd± 5 se) for both sites, the first reliable radiometric indications of a middle Pleistocene component for the terrace. Given the technical accuracy and consistency of the analyses, the <b>argon</b> <b>ages</b> represent either the actual age or the maximum age for the terrace and are significantly older than previous estimates. Most of the ESR/U-series results are older as well, but the oldest that meets all modeling criteria is 143 ka+ 20 /- 17. Most samples indicated leaching of uranium and likely represent either the actual or the minimum age of the terrace. Given known sources of error, the U-series results could be consistent with a middle Pleistocene age. However, the ESR and (40) Ar/(39) Ar ages preclude one another.

40|$|Abstract [...] To {{test the}} ability of illitic clay {{minerals}} to retain <b>argon,</b> K/Ar <b>ages</b> were measured on grain-size separates from the Cretaceous Mancos Shale and associated bentonites that have been transformed into K-bentonite near the contact with a large Tertiary igneous tock. The ages of size separates of illite/ smectite from the K-bentonite nearest the contact were internally concordant and matched the hornblende K/Ar age of the stock. In contrast, K/Ar data from day size fractions from shales adjacent to each K-bentonite were internally discordant with measured ages that were {{much greater than the}} age of the intrusion. Thus, significant radiogenic argon was retained by fine-grained etrital illite, even in shale samples very near the igneous contact.

[URL] audienceRb/Sr, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar, and Sm/Nd isotopic {{data are}} {{reported}} in Caledonian eclogites from the Lindås Nappe, Bergen Arcs, Norway, in order to investigate processes controlling isotopic equilibrium at mineral scale in polymetamorphic rocks. The Bergen Arcs exposes Sveconorwegian ∼ 950 – 930 Ma granulites, partially overprinted by Caledonian eclogite-facies metamorphism at ∼ 425 Ma and amphibolite-facies metamorphism at ∼ 410 Ma. Geochemical and Rb-Sr data from more than 10 phengite fractions separated from one sample reflect {{the composition of the}} microdomain (a few hundred microns in size) in which phengite crystallized. Phengite crystallized after garnet or plagioclase by dissolution-precipitation processes yield apparent age between 700 and 600 Ma. At the time of their crystallization, these phengites inherited the isotopic composition of their precursor minerals, at a microdomain scale. Phengite from quartz veins, which crystallized from elements mobilized by the circulating fluid, yield an age closer to the eclogite-facies metamorphic age. The closed system evolution of the eclogitizing fluid, the segregation of textural and reactional microdomains, the high Sr content of the studied phengite, and the short duration of the recrystallization processes (< 1 Ma) are interpreted as the main factors responsible for the lack of a Rb/Sr isotopic equilibrium, at the scale of hand samples. Such equilibrium is nevertheless reached in quartz veins where the crystallization of minerals implies that the fluid circulation acted as a factor of isotopic homogenization. The in situ single mineral Ar/Ar datings revealed that both eclogite- and amphibolite-facies minerals are characterized by an excess of radiogenic <b>argon</b> (<b>ages</b> between 425 and 520 Ma). The excess of argon has been inherited from the previous granulite and has been only partially evacuated from the system by the circulating fluid. The apparent Sm/Nd ages from garnets inherited from the granulite-facies metamorphism (c. 930 Ma) are in agreement with previous estimates. This result confirms that the diffusion of Nd in garnet does not occur at temperatures lower than 700 °C. This study highlights the complexity of radiochronometer behavior during HP metamorphism and demonstrates that coupling different radiochronometers, such as Ar/Ar and Rb/Sr, does not always guarantee the validity of the geochronological results...|$|R

They contain variable proportions of fragments of volcanic rock groundmass (mostly {{in the range of}} 100 - 150 µm) with textures ranging from microcrystalline to ipocrystalline. Their rounded shapes indicate mechanical reworking. Fresh groundmass glasses, recognized only in grains from samples of Site 1103, show mainly a subalkaline affinity on the basis of total alkali-silica variations. However, they are characterized by relatively high TiO 2 and P 2 O 5 contents (1. 4 - 2. 8 and 0. 1 - 0. 9 wt%, respectively). Because of the small size of homogeneous grains (100 - 150 µm), they were not suitable for single-grain total fusion 40 Ar- 39 Ar analyses. The incremental laser-heating technique was applied to milligram-sized samples (only for Samples 178 - 1097 A- 27 R- 1, 35 - 58 cm, and 178 - 1103 A- 36 R- 3, 4 - 8 cm) and to various small fractions (each consisting of 10 grains for the sample from Site 1097 and 30 grains for samples from Site 1103). The latter approach resulted in more effective resolution of sample heterogeneity. <b>Argon</b> <b>ages</b> from the small fractions show significantly different ranges in the three samples: 75 - 173 Ma for Sample 178 - 1097 A- 27 R- 1, 35 - 58 cm, 18 - 57 Ma for Sample 178 - 1103 A- 31 R- 2, 0 - 4 cm, and 7. 6 - 50 Ma for Sample 178 - 1103 A- 36 R- 3, 4 - 8 cm. Ca/K ratios derived from argon isotopes at Site 1103 suggest that the data mainly refer to outgassing of groundmass glass. At Site 1103, we observe an overall apparent age increase with decreasing sample depth. This is compatible with glacial erosion that affected with time deeper levels of a volcanic sequence previously deposited on the continent. The youngest apparent age of 7. 6 ± 0. 7 Ma detected close to the bottom of Hole 1103 A (340 meters below seafloor [mbsf]) is compatible with the age range of the diatom Actinocyclus ingens v. ovalis Zone (6. 3 - 8. 0 Ma) determined for the interval 320 - 355 mbsf and with the maximum ages derived from strontium isotope composition of barnacle fragments obtained at 262 - 263 mbsf at the same site.

The Chiang Mai basaltic samples from the Chiang Dao, Fang, Lamphun and Ban Sahakorn sections are divisible into two groups of high-iron basalt. Group 1 has SiO 2 of 38. 30 – 49. 18 wt. %, FeOt of 13. 09 – 25. 37 wt. %, MgO of 8. 38 – 1. 60 wt. %, TiO 2 of 3. 92 – 6. 30 wt. %, which is rarely observed in nature. Group 2 shows SiO 2 = 44. 71 – 49. 21 wt. %, FeOt = 10. 88 – 14. 34 wt. %, MgO = 5. 24 – 16. 11 wt. %, TiO 2 = 2. 22 – 3. 07 wt. % and mg# = 44 – 70. Olivine and pyroxene are responsible for the fractionation of the Group 2 magma whereas low oxygen fugacity during the late-stage differentiation of the Group 1 magma prolonged fractionation of ilmenite and magnetite. The onset of ilmenite and magnetite fractionations controls the distinct differentiation commencing at MgO = ~ 7 wt. %. Both groups show similar REE and primitive mantle-normalized patterns with insignificant Eu, Nb-Ta and Zr-Hf anomalies. They have similar Nd isotopic compositions with εNd(t) values ranging from + 2. 8 to + 3. 7 and similar Nb/La, Nb/U, Th/La, Zr/Nb, Th/Ta, La/Yb, Nb/Th, Nb/Y and Zr/Y, resembling those of OIB-like rocks.

40|$|Isolating the climatic {{mechanisms}} driving Holocene geomorphic {{change and}} deciphering {{the role of}} landscape change in prehistoric cultural processes both require well-dated and relatively continuous alluvial chronologies. This study presents a centennial-scale, latest Pleistocene and Holocene chronology based on alluvial fan, floodplain, groundwater-discharge, and volcanic deposits for the Carrizo Wash watershed, a Little Colorado River headwater drainage on the southeastern Colorado Plateau. More than 200 radiocarbon dates provide chronometric control. The age of Zuni Salt Lake volcanic eruptions was re-evaluated using radiocarbon and luminescence dating. Two eruptive phases ~ 13. 3 ka and ~ 11. 8 ka suggest closely spaced, monogenetic events. These terminal Pleistocene ages for the eruptions are significantly younger and substantially more precise than previous <b>argon</b> method <b>ages.</b> Sediment exposed in modern arroyos is dominated by middle Holocene (~ 7. 1 – 4. 9 ka) alluvium in valley contexts, whereas piedmont alluvium dates primarily to the late Holocene (~ 4. 3 – 2. 7 ka). Extensive prehistoric channel entrenchment occurred ~ 4. 9 and 0. 8 ka. Localized incision occurred ~ 1. 9 and 1. 2 ka, and possibly ~ 7. 5 and 2. 7 ka. Extended drought typically preceded arroyo cutting, and entrenchment was associated with increased climate variability, major shifts in precipitation amount or seasonality, and reduced flooding. Accelerated valley and piedmont aggradation appears related to increased flooding and runoff associated with reduced vegetation cover during periods of low effective moisture resulting from enhanced North American Monsoon circulation and weak ENSO conditions. Conversely, slow or stalled deposition appears connected to reduced flooding and runoff fostered by denser vegetation during times of increased effective moisture caused by enhanced El Niños and increased winter precipitation. Ground-water discharge deposits at Cienega Amarilla indicate that spring discharge was greatest and water tables most elevated ~ 2. 3 – 1. 6 ka. Spring discharge appears to reflect variations in El Niño frequency and intensity and the resultant variations in winter precipitation. Study results suggest that predicted increased drought and enhanced or delayed monsoons associated with modern climate change could initiate accelerated erosion of upland areas and increased flooding in southern Colorado Plateau headwater tributaries.

The remaining low-MgO group samples have a broader range with higher Sr and lower Nd isotope values and higher incompatible trace element ratios (e. g., Th/Ta N 5. 3 and La/Smn N 1. 7) similar to the crustally-contaminated Nadezhdinsky and Morongovsky suite basalts of the Noril'sk region. The major and trace element data for both groups are consistent with a process of fractional crystallisation coupled with small degrees of assimilation of incompatible-element-enriched lower crust involving different contaminants. Trace element model calculations indicate a process of magma formation at large degrees of partial melting and at pressures of less than 3 GPa, probably within the garnet–spinel transition zone or the spinel stability field of the asthenospheric mantle. We obtained an <b>argon</b> plateau <b>age</b> of ~ 252 (252. 7 ± 1. 5) Ma and a ~ 239 Ma total fusion age from a Taimyr lava and intrusive sample, respectively, confirming that volcanism is only partly contemporaneous with the activity of the Siberian LIP. Although this is in agreement with previous interpretations, we argue that the age difference between both events is only ~ 13 Ma and probably less (~ 5 Ma) although further investigation of the relationship is required. Our data allow correlation with distinct Noril'sk members and most importantly to the ore-bearing (Ni–Cu) intrusions implying that whole rock chemistry could have value as a prospecting tool in Taimyr...|$|R
40|$|Molybdenite {{mineralization}} occurs {{within the}} Bald Hill Prospect (West Nelson) in brecciated and hornfelsed Greenland Group slates and metagreywackes and associated quartz trondhjemite porphyry minor intrusions (Lyell Porphyry). Potassium <b>argon</b> (K-Ar) <b>ages</b> of the Lyell Porphyry, several granites forming {{part of the}} adjacent Karamea Granite batholith (Bald Hill Granites) and mineralized hornfelsic country rocks fall in the range 102 - 120 Ma (mid-Cretaceous). Adjacent lower Ordovician Greenland Group slates yielded four K-Ar ages in the range 112 - 226 Ma indicating partial argon outgassing of these older metasediments. The Bald Hill Granites and the Lyell Porphyry granitic rocks belong to separate petrogenic provinces. Bald Hill Granites forming the western margin of the Karamea Granite batholith occur as a suite of foliated, medium-grained, muscovite-bearing leucogranites, pink microgranites and biotite-granites. Chemically these rocks are peraluminous-potash granites with 72 - 75 % SiO 2, MgO Na 2 O with Rb > Sr and always contain more than 30 % normative quartz and 3 % normative corundum. In contrast, the Lyell Porphyry rocks intruding both Greenland Group and Bald Hill Granite country rocks, form a series of small, high-level plutons and cross-cutting dykes of quartz trondhjemite, granodiorite, quartz diorite, lamprophyre and quartz-bearing gabbroporphyry. Chemically the Lyell Porphyry intrusive rocks are soda-rich calc-alkaline granitoids containing 46 - 70 % SiO 2, > 1 % MgO, > 2. 2 % CaO, with Na 2 O>K 2 O and Sr>Rb with less than 28 % normative quartz and less than 2 % normative corundum. From their studies of granite batholiths in southeastern Australia, Chappell and White (1974) recognise two contrasting granitoid types called I-type and S-type granites. The Lyell Porphyry and several other intrusive stocks associated with molybdenum mineralization in West Nelson and North Westland are shown to correspond to I-type granites, {{in contrast to the}} Karamea batholith granites (including Bald Hill Granites) which conform to S-type granites. Sulphur isotopic analyses of mineralization for ten molybdenum prospects in West Nelson indicate uniformly high temperatures of mineralization in the range 400 ° to 500 °C, with a probable magmatic source for sulphur. The Bald Hill and other S-type granites forming the Karamea batholith were probably formed by the ultrametamorphism of crustal sedimentary material. The Lyell Porphyry and other molybdenum-bearing calc-alkaline intrusive stocks represent melt phases of deeper origin intruding the overlying granites and sediments. The emplacement of these stocks appears to equate with north-south lineaments and large scale circular features in the granite terranes of West Nelson. The geological setting, age, petrological characteristics and molybdenite mineralization of the Lyell Porphyry and Bald Hill Granites are similar to that of other West Nelson occurrences. All are associated with mid-Cretaceous minor granitic porphyry intrusions, emplaced in Paleozoic metasediments, close to the margins of the Karamea and Separation Point batholiths...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The Manicouagan-Mushalagan Lakes structure {{is an area}} of anomalous geological features in the Grenville Province terrain of northeastern Canada. Three features of this structure have been revealed by geological studies: (1) The Grenville gneisses and anorthosites which outcrop in the area between the arcuate lakes have been shock metamorphosed. (2) The shocked Grenville gneisses are covered by a thin, discontinuous layer of shock breccia and thin outcrops of Ordovician limestone. (3) An annular-shaped body of Permo-Triassic, igneous, andesitic rock, which shows no signs of shock metamorphism, overlies the shocked gneisses, the shock breccia and the Ordovician limestone. This rock (monzonite) is 800 feet thick at a maximum. The shocked basement rocks in the structure were most probably caused by the impact of an extraterrestrial body, but the origin of the igneous rock unit is not completely understood. This latter unit has been hypothesized to be either (1) a shock-melted breccia or (2) a later, secondary igneous event occurring at the crater site due to disruptions of the earth's thermal regime around the impact site. A geochronological study of this structure was made to determine which, if either, of the above modes of formation for the igneous material is likely. 		 [ [...] . ] data for the igneous material and rock units related to it yield a well-defined crystallization age of [ [...] . ]. [ [...] . ] data for this unit indicate that it has experienced no subsequent metamorphism. <b>Argon</b> isotopic <b>ages</b> obtained for a series of shock-sequence anorthosites do not indicate a well-defined time of shock metamorphism; the ages could characterize a system shocked at anytime between 320 and 210 m. y. ago which then suffered a secondary gas loss. It is shown that anorthosites yielding ages between 280 and 320 m. y. probably underwent complete or nearly complete outgassing at the time of shock. These latter ages should therefore yield a good impact age. The time interval within which the impact took place is thought to be 280 - 320 m. y. ago. The [ [...] . ] data show unexpected evidence for the occurrence of a secondary event at about 100 - 110 m. y. which affected the anorthosites in the crater but not the igneous monzonite. Since {{it is not possible to}} say with certainty when the meteoritic impact took place, the difference between the monzonite formation time and the impact time is unclear. The suggested impact time is, however, significantly earlier than the crystallization time of the igneous material. This suggests that a secondary formation mode for this material is more likely than an impact melt formation mode. A secondary mode is also compatible with evidence that the monzonite formed in a subsurface environment with [ [...] . ]...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of post-Jurassic arc and plateau rocks in Jamaica has helped constrain the tectonic {{evolution of the}} Caribbean plate by identifying when, where and how the different volcanic rocks formed. This research therefore not only evaluates the existing models of Caribbean plate evolution, it also presents for the first time, a detailed gcochcmical and geochronolgical analysis of the igneous rocks on Jamaica. This study has focussed on the igneous rocks of the Blue Mountains, Central, Above Rocks and Benbow Cretaceous Inliers and the Tertiary Wagwater belt. Major and trace element data, Sr, Nd, Pb and Hf isotope analysis and <b>argon</b> radiometric <b>ages</b> have confirmed {{the presence of a}} Cretaceous oceanic plateau section within the Blue Mountains inlier and a number of primitive and evolved Cretaceous island arc sequences in the remaining inliers. Rare high-Nb basalts (HNB) and adakites have also been discovered in the Tertiary Wagwater belt. Many elements have been mobilised because of intense tropical weathering, and so the tectonic setting and petrogenesis of most of the analysed samples were interpreted using immobile trace elements which has {{led to the development of}} the Co- Th, Th/Zr-La/Yb. Cc/Lu-Sm/Yb, La'Hf-Sm/Y and Th/Hf-Sm/Yb discrimination diagrams. These diagrams have been used to classify the Jamaican volcanic arc rocks and thus identity their extent of fractionation and incompatible trace element enrichment. Immobile trace element and isotope geochemistry has identified at least 5 mantle wedge components and 8 slab components in the Jamaican island arc rocks. Additionally, the Bath-Dunrobin plateau lavas, the adakites and the HNBs represent at least three other chemically distinct source regions. The Bath-Dunrobin plateau lavas are derived from a - 90 Ma heterogeneous mantle plume source region which is distinct from the source regions for other Caribbean oceanic plateau lavas as it contains a larger HIMU component giving it more radiogenic Pb isotope ratios. The adakites have been derived from the combination of complex post-eruptive alteration, partial melting, fractional crystallisation and hybridisation processes. Rather than being related to a melt from a subducting slab, the Jamaican adakites appear to be derived from a melt of lower crustal garnet amphibolite with inter-bedded sedimentary material. The HNBs are derived from a HIMU-type source, which contained garnet and amphibole and so is distinct from the source region of the oceanic plateau. Using the new geochemical and geochronological data, together with the stratigraphic information and temporal location of the Jamaican igneous rocks, it is possible to place Jamaica in the Pacific model of Caribbean plate evolution. From 120 - 75 Ma Jamaica formed the northernmost part of the Great Arc of the Antilles and erupted bimodal tholeiitic and calcalkaline magmas, which eventually evolved into calcalkaline and shoshonitic lavas after the collision of the Caribbean oceanic plateau - 90 Ma. From - 55 Ma Jamaica collided with the Yucatan peninsula and was subsequently tectonically transported to the east by transtensional opening of the Cayman Trough. This extension enabled decompression melting of the underlying asthenosphere to form the HNBs and adakites...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{chemical}} element mobility during high-pressure metamorphism is paramount {{to the knowledge}} of eclogite transformation. In particular, the role of deformation and fluid circulations appears essential. In order to better decipher this role, we investigated eclogitic samples from the Lindås Nappe in the Bergen arcs (Norwegian Caledonides) which are related to a fluid/deformation metamorphic event. This study, based on detailed microtextural investigations, coupled with extensive in-situ (EMPA and LA-ICP-MS) and mineral fraction (ICP-MS) major and trace element analyses, demonstrates a contrasting behaviour during the eclogite and the amphibolite transformations. A single mineral species from the eclogite facies (i. e. phengite and epidote) depicts various chemical features depending on its textural location at thin section scale. The correlation with the mineralogical reaction occurring in each textural site demonstrates that the variations in composition are inherited from the chemistry of precursor minerals. Thus, the composition of eclogitic minerals is locally controlled by the composition of few hundred-micron microdomains. On the contrary, alteration phases of the amphibolite facies (symplectite and calcic amphibole) display clear enrichment in LILE, Pb, Sr and LREE compared to their precursor minerals (omphacite and garnet). This supports that the transport of elements at hand-sample scale was enhanced during the retrogression and elements were efficiently delocalised from one textural site to another. The contrasting behaviour for element mobility between peak eclogitic metamorphism and retrogression can be explained in term of rate process and fluid/deformation activity. During eclogitisation, deformation allows the formation of textural and mineralogical microdomains. Contemporaneously the fluid circulation favours the development of heterogeneities by transport of elements in excess towards areas protected from deformation where quartz lenses crystallise including phengites. This, together with very fast recrystallisation of eclogitic minerals, results in a heterogeneous redistribution of elements at a sample scale and to a chemical disequilibrium between different microdomains of hundred-micron size. During retrogression in the amphibolite facies coeval with long term ductile deformation, the fluids act as an efficient vector to redistribute the elements from a given textural site to another and, therefore, permit to reach a new chemical equilibrium between the crystallising phases at a hand-sample scale. Rb/Sr, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and Sm/Nd isotopic data are reported in Caledonian eclogites from the Lindås Nappe, Bergen Arcs, Norway, in order to investigate processes controlling isotopic equilibrium at mineral scale in polymetamorphic rocks. The Bergen Arcs exposes Sveconorwegian c. 950 - 930 Ma granulites, partially overprinted by Caledonian eclogite-facies metamorphism at c. 425 Ma and amphibolite-facies metamorphism at c. 410 Ma. Geochemical and Rb-Sr data from more than ten phengite fractions separated from one sample reflect {{the composition of the}} microdomain (a few hundred-microns in size) in which phengite crystallized. Phengite crystallized after garnet or plagioclase by dissolution-precipitation processes yield apparent age between 700 and 600 Ma. At the time of their crystallization, these phengites inherited the isotopic composition of their precursor minerals, at a microdomain scale. Phengite from quartz veins, which crystallized from elements mobilized by the circulating fluid, yield an age closer to the eclogite-facies metamorphic age. The closed system evolution of the eclogitizing fluid, the segregation of textural and reactional microdomains, the high Sr content of the studied phengite and the short duration of the recrystallization processes (< 1 Ma) are interpreted as the main factors responsible for the lack of a Rb/Sr isotopic equilibrium, at the scale of hand-samples. Such equilibrium is nevertheless reached in quartz veins where the crystallization of minerals implies that the fluid circulation acted as a factor of isotopic homogenization. The “in-situ” single mineral Ar/Ar datings revealed that both eclogite- and amphibolite-facies minerals are characterized by an excess of radiogenic <b>argon</b> (<b>ages</b> between 425 and 520 Ma). The excess of argon has been inherited from the previous granulite and has been only partially evacuated from the system by the circulating fluid. The apparent Sm/Nd ages from garnets inherited from the granulite-facies metamorphism (c. 930 Ma) are in agreement with previous estimates. This result confirms that the diffusion of Nd in garnet does not occur at temperatures lower than 700 °C. This study highlights the complexity of radiochronometer behavior during HP metamorphism and demonstrates that coupling different radiochronometers, such as Ar/Ar and Rb/Sr, does not always guarantee the validity of the geochronological results. Une bonne compréhension du comportement des radiochronomètres est essentielle pour mener des études de thermochronologie visant à contraindre des processus géodynamiques. Cependant, le comportement des radiochronomètres est complexe car dicté par un grand nombre de facteurs intrinsèques et extrinsèques au système étudié. Au cours de cette thèse, nous avons cherché à déterminer quels étaient les facteurs critiques lors des processus de rééquilibrage isotopique survenant durant un événement métamorphique de haut grade. Ainsi, nous avons étudié le comportement des systèmes isotopiques Rb/Sr, Ar/Ar et Sm/Nd lors de l'éclogitisation partielle (contrôlée par la déformation et la circulation de fluides) au Calédonien de roches granulitiques grenvilliennes dans l'Arc de Bergen en Norvège. Nous montrons, grâce à une étude géochronologique fine associée à différentes observations (pétrologiques, géochimiques in situ et sur fractions minérales, diffraction X et isotopes de l'oxygène) permettant de contraindre avec précision le flux des éléments d'un site textural vers un autre au cours des réactions d'éclogitisation, que le facteur principal garantissant un rééquilibrage isotopique complet pour les systèmes Rb/Sr et Sm/Nd lors d'un événement métamorphique de haut grade est la redistribution homogène des éléments à l'échelle de l'échantillon. Cependant, la circulation de fluides et la déformation qui peuvent être associées aux processus de recristallisation ne sont pas nécessairement suffisant pour garantir une telle réhomogénéisation. La mise en solution des éléments d'un système ou la fusion partielle apparaissent comme deux mécanismes de réhomogénéisation bien plus efficaces. Pour le système Ar/Ar, le facteur critique est l'évacuation totale de l'argon radiogénique précédemment accumulé dans le système. Cette évacuation est favorisée, mais non garantie, par la circulation de fluides en raison de la plus forte solubilité de l'argon dans les fluides. Cependant un grand nombre de facteurs vont contrôler ce processus : quantité d'argon radiogénique initialement présente (fonction de la composition chimique de la roche et de son âge), composition chimique du fluide, et circulation en système ouvert ou fermé...|$|R
40|$|Spatially {{resolved}} argon isotope measurements {{have been}} performed on neutron-irradiated samples of NW Africa (NWA) 4797. Shock heating of NWA 4797 completely melted and vesiculated precursor igneous plagioclase, which cooled to an assemblage of plagioclase crystals with interstitial glasses of variable composition (Ca/K ratios). Using a focused ultraviolet laser beam, is has been possible to distinguish between argon isotopic signatures from groundmass minerals (igneous olivine + pyroxene), plagioclase and a shock vein. This study focuses on the potential for this meteorite {{to shed light on}} shock ages of shergottites. Apparent 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of groundmass minerals show that there are large amounts of excess argon in this phase, yielding a wide range of calculated ages from 690 ± 30 Ma to several apparent ages older than 4. 5 Ga. A traverse of laser-probe extractions across the 1 mm-diameter shock vein in NWA 4797 yielded apparent 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages younger than the groundmass. A signature of the Martian atmosphere, identified by 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratios of 1600 - 1900, was not found in the NWA 4797 shock vein. This is distinct from other shergottites where the products of shock melting contain a nearly pure sample of Martian atmosphere. We attribute this to a distinct formation mechanism, and hence gas-trapping mechanism, of the NWA 4797 shock vein. We undertook 44 analyses of plagioclase areas identified by SEM analysis. Ages ranged from 45 ± 27 to 3771 ± 109 Ma and yield an average age of 375 ± 77 Ma, considerably younger than ages obtained in this study from either the groundmass or the shock vein. A plot of age v. 37 Ar/ 39 Ar for plagioclase showed a continuum of ages from the oldest to youngest ages measured. Older ages are correlated with higher Ca/K ratios of plagioclase, indicating contamination from groundmass minerals rich in excess <b>argon.</b> The youngest <b>ages</b> correlate to plagioclase extractions with the lowest Ca/K ratios, interpreted to have crystallized from a nearly pure plagioclase melt with contributions from a K-rich mesostasis. We see no evidence for multiple shock events in NWA 4797. Rather, we favour the interpretation that the cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) age of 3. 0 ± 0. 5 Ma, obtained on NWA 4797 in this study using cosmogenic 38 Ar, approximates the timing of shock melting in this meteorite...|$|R
40|$|Apatite is {{a common}} U- and Th-bearing {{accessory}} mineral in igneous and metamorphic rocks, and a minor but widespread detrital component in clastic sedimentary rocks. U-Pb and Th-Pb dating of apatite has potential application in sedimentary provenance studies, as it likely represents first cycle detritus compared to the polycyclic behaviour of zircon. However, low U, Th and radiogenic Pb concentrations, elevated common Pb {{and the lack of}} a U-Th-Pb apatite standard remain significant challenges in dating apatite by LA-ICPMS, and consequently in developing the chronometer as a provenance tool. This study has determined U-Pb and Th-Pb ages for seven well known apatite occurrences (Durango, Emerald Lake, Kovdor, Mineville, Mudtank, Otter Lake and Slyudyanka) by LA-ICPMS. Analytical procedures involved rastering a 10 ?m spot over a 40 ? 40 ?m square to a depth of 10 ?m using a Geolas 193 nm ArF excimer laser coupled to a Thermo ElementXR single-collector ICPMS. These raster conditions minimized laser-induced inter-element fractionation which was corrected for using the back-calculated intercept of the time-resolved signal. A Tl?U?Bi?Np tracer solution was aspirated with the sample into the plasma to correct for instrument mass bias. External standards (Plesovice and 91500 zircon, NIST SRM 610 and 612 silicate glasses and STDP 5 phosphate glass) along with Kovdor apatite were analysed to monitor U-Pb, Th-Pb and Pb-Pb ratios. Common Pb correction employed the 207 Pb method, and also a 208 Pb correction method for samples with low Th/U. The 207 Pb and 208 Pb corrections employed either the initial Pb isotopic composition where known or the Stacey and Kramers model, and propagated conservative uncertainties in the initial Pb isotopic composition. Common Pb correction using the Stacey and Kramers (1975) model employed an initial Pb isotopic composition calculated from either the estimated U-Pb age of the sample or an iterative approach. The age difference between these two methods is typically less than 2 %, suggesting that the iterative approach works well for samples where there are no constraints on the initial Pb composition, such as a detrital sample. No 204 Pb correction was undertaken because of low 204 Pb counts on single collector instruments and 204 Pb interference by 204 Hg in the <b>argon</b> gas supply. <b>Age</b> calculations employed between 11 and 33 analyses per sample and used a weighted average of the common Pb-corrected ages, a Tera-Wasserburg Concordia intercept age and a Tera?Wasserburg Concordia intercept age anchored through common Pb. The samples in general yield ages consistent (at the 2 ? level) with independent estimates of the U-Pb apatite age, which demonstrates the suitability of the analytical protocol employed. Weighted mean age uncertainties are as low as 1 - 2 % for U- and / or Th-rich Palaeozoic-Neoproterozoic samples; the uncertainty on the youngest sample, the Cenozoic (31. 44 Ma) Durango apatite, ranges from 3. 7 ? 7. 6 % according to the common Pb-correction method employed. The accurate and relatively precise common Pb-corrected ages demonstrate the U-Pb and Th-Pb apatite chronometers are suitable as sedimentary provenance tools. The Kovdor carbonatite apatite is recommended as a potential U-Pb and Th-Pb apatite standard as it yields precise and reproducible 207 Pb-corrected, 232 Th- 208 Pb, and common Pb-anchored Tera-Wasserburg Concordia intercept ages...|$|R
