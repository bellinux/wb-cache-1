A large fire was lit <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E

[...] According to developer Christian Senn, <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> story lines were considered during the three-year development timeframe. While originally based on the Saturday morning cartoon series, the main storyline used in promotion of the final game in magazines involved a Professor Gazebo Boobowski and his daughter, Tiara. [...] The two were the guardians of the six magical Rings of Order, {{as well as the}} ancient art of ring-smithing. [...] Gazebo and Tiara feared that Dr. Robotnik was after the six Rings of Order, and called on Sonic to get the Rings before Robotnik could. Dr. Robotnik kidnapped Gazebo after he requested Sonic's help, making it so Sonic had to retrieve both him and the Rings of Order. [...] At one point in the development process, there was a possibility for 4 playable characters: Knuckles the Echidna, Tiara Boobowski, Miles [...] "Tails" [...] Prower, and Sonic the Hedgehog. [...] Other characters intended {{to be included in the}} game were Fang the Sniper and Metal Sonic, who would have been a boss character in the final level. [...] Various moves were added to the characters, such as a ring toss move for Sonic, which was left out of development.|$|E

Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me."

[...] Gessler has summoned Meissen; has not got it, is haggling with it about terms, when, towards sunset of the short day, Old Dessauer himself arrives. Whereupon the Saxon Commandant quits the Bridge (not much {{breaking}} it); and glides off in the dark, clear out of Meissen, towards Dresden,--chased, but successfully defending himself. [See Plan, p. 10.] [...] "Had he but stood out for two days!" [...] say the Saxons,--"Prince Karl had then been up, and much might have been different." [...] Well, Friedrich too would have been up, and it had most likely been the same on a larger scale. But the Saxon Commandant did not stand out; he glided off, safe; joined Rutowski and Grune, who are lying <b>about</b> Wilsdruf, <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> miles on the hither side of Dresden, and eagerly waiting for Prince Karl. [...] "Bridge and Town of Meissen are your Majesty's," [...] reports the Old Dessauer that night: upon which Friedrich instantly rises, hastening thitherward. Lehwald comes across Meissen Bridge, effects the desired junction; and all Monday the Old Dessauer defiles through Meissen town and territory; continually advances towards Dresden, the Saxons harassing the flanks of him a little,--nay in one defile, being sharp strenuous fellows, they threw his rear into some confusion; cut off certain carts and prisoners, {{and the life of}} one brave General, Lieutenant-General Roel, who had charge there.

60|$|The Dutch {{mail steamer}} brought me from Ternate to Sourabaya, the chief town and port {{in the eastern}} part of Java, and after a {{fortnight}} spent in packing up and sending off my last collections, I started on a short journey into the interior. Travelling in Java is very luxurious but very expensive, the only way being to hire or borrow a carriage, and then pay half a crown a mile for post-horses, which are changed at regular posts every six miles, and will carry you at the rate of ten miles an hour from one end of the island to the other. Bullock carts or coolies are required to carry all extra baggage. As this kind of travelling would not suit my means, I determined on making only a short journey to the district at the foot of Mount Arjuna, where I was told there were extensive forests, and where I hoped to be able to make some good collections. The country for many miles behind Sourabaya is perfectly flat and everywhere cultivated; being a delta or alluvial plain, watered by many branching streams. Immediately around the town the evident signs of wealth and of an industrious population were very pleasing; but as we went on, the constant succession of open fields skirted by rows of bamboos, with here and there the white buildings and a tall chimney of a sugar-mill, became monotonous. The roads run in straight lines for several miles at a stretch, and are bordered by rows of dusty tamarind-trees. At each mile there are little guardhouses, where a policeman is stationed; and there is a wooden gong, which by means of concerted signals may be made to convey information over the country with great rapidity. <b>About</b> every <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> miles is the post-house, where the horses are changed as quickly as were those of the mail in the old coaching days in England.|$|R

It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. <b>About</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang.

2500|$|The rattle {{consists}} {{of a series of}} loosely interlocking hollow shells, each of which was at one point the scale covering the tip of the tail. In most other snakes, the tail tip, or terminal spine, is cone-shaped, hardly any thicker {{than the rest of the}} skin, and is shed along with it at each successive molt. In this case, however, the end-scale, or [...] "button", is much thicker and shaped like a bulb, with one or two annular constrictions to prevent it from falling off. Before each molt, a new button will have developed inside the last one and before the skin is shed, the tip of new button shrinks, thereby loosening the shell of the previous one. This process continues so the succession of molts produces an appendage consisting of a number of interlocking segments that make an audible noise when vibrated. Since younger specimens may shed three or four times in a year, every time adding a new segment to the rattle, the number of segments bears no relation to the age of the snake. In theory, the rattle could become very long indeed, but in practice, the older segments tend to wear out and fall off. How quickly this happens depends on the snake's environment, but end segments tend to break off after the rattle becomes <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> segments long; it is uncommon to find specimens with as many as a dozen segments. In captive specimens, however, as many as 29 segments have been found.|$|E
2500|$|Alfred Richardson duly {{started his}} duties at Newcastle-under-Lyme Police Station on 2 September 1901. The Force size {{for the town}} was 18 men. His new {{telephone}} number was '9'. Within a few days there was a ceremony at the Town Hall and Square for the Mayor and the town dignitaries and local citizens to meet their new Chief Constable, which he attended in his Number One uniform. This showed the Chief Constable's badge of rank, worn on the epaulettes, which consisted of crossed tipstaves in a wreath, surmounted by a crown, similar to the insignia of a Lieutenant General in the British Army. The population of the town was about 20,000 people and it was heavily industrialized. The conditions for his men were, [...] "All Officers had to wear helmets for all duties and keep Truncheons. Constables would work twelve hours a day, seven days a week. There would be two shifts, one day and one night." [...] There were no meal breaks. A beat system was such that a Constable {{was taken to the}} start of his beat on foot by a superior. Constables worked on 'shifts', which meant they spent <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> hours during the day or night at their work. Some weeks they did 'nights', others they did 'evenings', others did 'days'. At this period they worked seven days a week with no rest days, which was to become a factor in Richardson's next appointment. As he had in Birmingham previously, the new Chief Constable now appeared by name regularly in the local newspaper in court cases. In these cases Alfred Richardson was the prosecutor, a role he was to continue in his next post. At this time, and later, the Borough had an ongoing problem with smallpox which added to police work with contagion. Newcastle-under-Lyme Fire Service worked, as all fire services did, in conjunction with the local police force, but it was an entirely separate unit. There was a Fire Brigade Captain and Lieutenant, 12 men and two runners in Richardson's time. In 1901 it had a first class steam engine, one manual engine and a new fire escape. It was separated from the police force in the early 1880s.|$|E
