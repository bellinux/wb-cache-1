5|$|By 925, Romanos Lekapenos {{felt himself}} {{strong enough to}} demand the payment of tribute from the Muslim cities {{on the western side}} of the Euphrates. When they refused, in 926, Kourkouas led the army across the border. Aided by his brother Theophilos and an Armenian {{contingent}} under the strategos of Lykandos, Mleh (Melias in Greek sources), Kourkouas targeted Melitene (modern Malatya), the center of an emirate which had long been <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> Byzantium's side. The Byzantine army successfully stormed the lower city, and although the citadel held out, Kourkouas concluded a treaty by which the emir accepted tributary status.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the gardens}} thrived {{in their early}} years, by 1842 Jennison was in {{financial}} difficulties, and on 13December bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Jennison's problems were caused by his failure to sell the Strawberry Gardens property, competition from the recently opened Manchester Zoological Gardens, and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway track cutting through the land Jennison had leased in December 1836, restricting access to the gardens. Jennison twice tried unsuccessfully to sell Belle Vue, after which his creditors allowed him {{time to make a}} success of the gardens; {{by the end of the}} 1843 season Jennison was able to repay his debts. The railway that had been <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> his side eventually proved to be an asset when Longsight railway station was re-sited closer to Belle Vue in 1842, making it easier for visitors to reach the gardens.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln, {{as well as}} {{many other}} leaders and {{citizens}} of the northern states, became increasingly impatient with McClellan's slowness to attack the Confederate forces still massed near Washington. The Union defeat at the minor Battle of Ball's Bluff near Leesburg in October added to the frustration and indirectly damaged McClellan. In December, the Congress formed a Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, which became <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> the side of many generals throughout the war, accusing them of incompetence and, in some cases, treason. McClellan was called as the first witness on December 23, but he contracted typhoid fever and could not attend. Instead, his subordinate officers testified, and their candid admissions that they had no knowledge of specific strategies for advancing against the Confederates raised many calls for McClellan's dismissal.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{problem was not}} solved: Joseph's foreign policy dictated the expansion of Habsburg influence over German-speaking territories, and only this, he believed, would counter Prussia's growing strength in Imperial affairs. In 1785, Joseph again sought to make a territorial deal with Charles Theodore, again offering to trade portions of Bavarian territory for portions of the Austrian Netherlands. This time {{it would be a}} straight trade: territory for territory, not a partition. Although the Austrian Netherlands was a wealthy territory, it was <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> Joseph's side, opposing his administrative and bureaucratic reforms and devouring military and administrative resources he desperately needed elsewhere in his realm. Despite its problems, Joseph could not afford to give up the Netherlands entirely, so his efforts to negotiate a partial territorial exchange guaranteed him some of the financial benefits of both his Netherlands possessions and the Bavarian territories.|$|E
5|$|Montfort's {{success was}} illusory, however. The {{terms of the}} Peace of Canterbury were {{rejected}} by a papal legate in negotiations at Boulogne. Meanwhile, the Marcher lords did not leave the country, and remained <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> {{the side of the}} regime. The triumvirate at the head of government broke up when the Earl of Gloucester defected to the royalist side. In May, Edward was able to escape captivity, with Gloucester's help. Edward started on a campaign of re-conquest, while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches. He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn, and then moved east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward, however, routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle. On 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham, forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field. Even with Montfort dead resistance remained, particularly at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle. In October 1266 the Dictum of Kenilworth set down terms by which the rebels could obtain pardons, {{and by the end of}} the year the garrison surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Jill {{begins to}} work for {{cosmetics}} company Jabot and its owner, John Abbott (Jerry Douglas), promotes her to head of merchandising, impressed by her work. They become involved, but she cheated on him with his son, Jack Abbott (Terry Lester). John dumped her and she filed a sexual harassment suit worth $10,000 against Jack when {{he will not be}} with her. She reunites with John and they married in 1982. However, Abbott family housekeeper, Mamie Johnson (Veronica Redd), seemed to be <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> Jill's new marriage. Mamie, who wants to protect John, kept and eye on Jill, who had another affair with Jack. Katherine gets a hold of pictures of Jack and Jill and showed them to John, who has a stroke. Jill divorced John in 1986 and gets 20% of Jabot in their settlement, and a seat {{on the board of directors}} after threatening to sell her story turning it into a novel or film. Jill strives at her business, but is later found in her shower having been shot, just as her son Phillip returned to town after years away at boarding school. The three main suspects in the shooting are John, Jack, and Katherine. Jack confesses so that his affair with her won't become public. The real culprit is Sven, a masseur at the Genoa City Hotel. He had been rejected by Jill earlier in the night and shot her after getting drunk. Sven kidnaped Jill and locked her in a meat freezer. Jack rescued her and Sven escaped. Jill and Katherine fight over her son Phillip, who is now a teenager and had a past of acting out. Phillip turned to alcoholism but quit with help from Jill and Katherine. Phillip has sex with Nina Webster (Tricia Cast) and she ends up pregnant. He later died after driving under the influence, devastating both women. Jill hired a former con man Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker) to seduce Katherine. Rex's real name was Brian Romalotti, father of Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) and Gina Roma (Patty Weaver). He married Katherine, but Jill then wanted Rex for herself and convinced him to divorce Katherine. In reality, Katherine had been replaced by a look alike Marge Cotrooke who pushed Rex away. He divorced her, and married Jill, but the real Katherine finally returned and reunited with Rex. Rex eventually was shot and killed while Jill began romancing John again.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} {{is widely}} recognised for its prominent criticism and lampooning of public {{figures such as}} politicians and media tycoons, and of organisations that it considers incompetent, inefficient, corrupt, pompous or self-important; it has established itself as <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> {{the side of the}} British establishment.

25|$|The {{invasion}} force sailed {{in three}} divisions, and is generally {{believed to have}} landed at Richborough in Kent, although parts may have landed elsewhere (see Site of the Claudian invasion of Britain). The Britons, led by Togodumnus and Caratacus of the Catuvellauni, were reluctant to fight a pitched battle, relying on instead on guerrilla tactics. However, Plautius defeated first Caratacus, then Togodumnus, on the rivers Medway and Thames. Togodumnus died shortly afterwards, although Caratacus survived and continued to be <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> the invaders' side.|$|E

25|$|The {{tensions}} {{between the two sides}} increased through the 1980s and 1990s as the house developed into a centre for radical left-wing activities. The users of the house also became <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> the eye of the police as the users often were involved in clashes with these during demonstrations, evictions of squatted houses, etc. In 1987, the police mounted a raid on Ungdomshuset equipped with machine guns. The raid led to six arrests but since the police did not find anything illegal in the house they all were released without charges.|$|E
25|$|A dysplastic animal has {{probably}} {{lived with the}} condition since {{it was only a}} few months old, and has therefore grown up taking the chronic pain for granted and has learned to live with it. Dogs suffering such pain do not usually exhibit acute signs of pain. Sometimes, they will suddenly and abnormally sit down when walking, or refuse to walk or climb objects which they usually would, but this can equally be a symptom of many other things, including <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> the paw, or a temporary muscle pain. So pain recognition is less common a means of detection than the visible gait and other abnormalities described above.|$|E
25|$|The novel's prologue {{tells of}} Antonio Farria, the Portuguese {{governor}} of a colony in China. Farria's settlement is {{destroyed by the}} Chinese, for which he blames the government back in Portugal, who have neglected the colony. After taking revenge on a Chinese city Farria founds what will become Portuguese Macau, which was to act as <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> {{the side of the}} Portuguese but, in the end, remained loyal. The narrative proper begins with a semi-historical account of Luís de Camões, the 16th-century Portuguese poet who wrote the epic poem Os Lusíadas. In Slauerhoff's novel, Camões flees Portugal after an affair with a woman destined to marry the Portuguese crown prince.|$|E

25|$|The {{combined}} fleet {{carried a}} large number of soldiers, intended by Napoleon to be used to attack British possessions in the Caribbean. Villeneuve felt however that his orders were not clear, and remained at Fort-de-France, hoping to be joined by a fleet under Honoré Ganteaume, which unbeknownst to him had been unable to break the blockade of Brest. For two weeks Villeneuve lingered in the bay, until finally being persuaded by Villaret de Joyeuse to use his forces to capture Diamond Rock, <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> his side for the past seventeen months. Villeneuve gave Captain Julien Cosmao of the 74-gun Pluton command of the expedition. He was to take his ship, the 74-gun , the 36-gun Sirène, a corvette, schooner, eleven gunboats, and between three and four hundred soldiers (in addition to the ships' crews), and retake the rock.|$|E
25|$|This {{liaison with}} Mboya would cause ripples in the Kenyatta Government. In fact, so {{suspicious}} was the regime that despite Khasakhala's seniority in Western Province, Kenyatta opted to give Ministerial slots to Masinde Muliro and James Osogo, {{and the less}} colorful James Otiende fearing that this rising star would be <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> {{the flesh of the}} Cabinet. In 1966 when then Vice President Odinga had fallen out of grace, Mboya organised the famous Limuru Conference which saw eight regional Vice Presidents being elected representing each Province. Mboya's influence would be felt when he ensured the election of his comrades including Khasakhala, Moi, Nyagah, Ngala, Kibaki, Sagini among others. Khasakhala remained a loyal friend and confidant of Tom Mboya. It is noted historically that Khasakhala and Kibaki are remembered as some of the only brave government officials who attended and were welcomed to Mboya's tense Funeral at Rising Island in 1969.|$|E
25|$|He {{sponsored}} {{a court of}} 'opposition' politicians. Frederick and his group supported the Opera of the Nobility in Lincoln's Inn Fields as a rival to Handel's royally sponsored opera at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket. Frederick was a lover of music who played the viola and cello; he is depicted playing a cello in a portrait by Philip Mercier of Frederick and his sisters, {{now part of the}} National Portrait Gallery collection. He enjoyed the natural sciences and the arts, and became <b>a</b> <b>thorn</b> <b>in</b> the side of his parents, making a point of opposing them in everything, according to the court gossip Lord Hervey. At court, the favourite was Frederick's younger brother, Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, {{to the extent that the}} king looked into ways of splitting his domains so that Frederick would succeed only in Britain, while Hanover would go to William.|$|E
