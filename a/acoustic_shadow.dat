With this technique, a drop in signal intensity, known as <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadowing,</b> is usually equated with the presence of calcium in the plaque.

25|$|A {{wind speed}} {{gradient}} of 4 (m/s)/km can produce refraction equal to a typical {{temperature lapse rate}} of 7.5°C/km. Higher values of wind gradient will refract sound downward toward the surface in the downwind direction, eliminating the <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadow</b> on the downwind side. This will increase the audibility of sounds downwind. This downwind refraction effect occurs {{because there is a}} wind gradient; the sound is not being carried along by the wind.|$|E
25|$|When the sun warms the Earth's surface, {{there is}} a {{negative}} temperature gradient in atmosphere. The speed of sound decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient. The sound wave front travels faster near the ground, so the sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadow</b> at {{some distance from the}} source. The radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the velocity gradient.|$|E
25|$|During the shad bake {{lunch at}} Rosser's camp, two of Munford's pickets rode up {{to report that}} Union forces were {{advancing}} on all roads. Fitzhugh Lee and Pickett decided that since they could not hear an attack, due {{as it turned out}} to the thick pine forest and heavy atmosphere between the camp and Five Forks and an <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadow,</b> there was little to worry about. Soon after 4:00p.m., Pickett asked Rosser for a courier to take a message to Five Forks. Not long after that, two couriers were dispatched, the officers heard gunfire and saw the lead courier captured by Union horsemen on Ford's Road just across Hatcher's Run. Then they saw a Union Army battle line coming toward the road.|$|E

25|$|Casey's line, {{manned by}} inexperienced troops, buckled with some men retreating, but fought {{fiercely}} {{for possession of}} their earthworks, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. The Confederates only engaged four brigades of the thirteen on their right flank that day, so they did not hit with the power {{that they could have}} concentrated on this weak point in the Union line. Casey sent for reinforcements but Keyes was slow in responding. Eventually the mass of Confederates broke through, seized a Union redoubt, and Casey's men retreated to the second line of defensive works at Seven Pines. During this period, both of the high commanders were unaware of the severity of the battle. As late as 2:30p.m., Heintzelman reported to McClellan, still sick in bed, that he had received no word from Keyes. Johnston was only 2½ miles from the front, but an <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadow</b> prevented him from hearing the sounds of cannons and musketry and he and his staff did not know the battle had begun until 4 p.m.|$|E
25|$|As Confederate General Braxton Bragg moved {{north from}} Tennessee into Kentucky in September 1862, Union Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell pursued him from Nashville with his Army of the Ohio. Confederate forces under Van Dorn and Price in {{northern}} Mississippi {{were expected to}} advance into Middle Tennessee to support Bragg's effort, but the Confederates also needed to prevent Buell from being reinforced by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee. Since {{the conclusion of the}} Siege of Corinth that summer, Grant's army had been engaged in protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. At the Battle of Iuka on September 19, Maj. Gen. Sterling Price's Confederate Army of the West was defeated by forces under Grant's overall command, but tactically under Rosecrans, the commander of the Army of the Mississippi. (Grant's second column approaching Iuka, commanded by Maj. Gen. Edward Ord, did not participate in the battle as planned. An <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadow</b> apparently prevented Grant and Ord from hearing the sounds of the battle starting.) Price had hoped to combine his small army with Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn's Army of West Tennessee and disrupt Grant's communications, but Rosecrans struck first, causing Price to retreat from Iuka. Rosecrans's pursuit of Price was ineffectual.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of his}} {{preparations}} for the Perryville offensive, General Braxton Bragg divided Mississippi into several commands: Major General Earl Van Dorn was given command of the District of the Mississippi, centered in Vicksburg, and Major General Sterling Price was given the District of the Tennessee, covering northwestern Mississippi and northeastern Alabama. Bragg expected Price to prevent the Union forces of Ulysses S. Grant and William Rosecrans in western Tennessee from reinforceing the Union forces in Kentucky, and expected Van Dorn to cooperate with Price. Price interpreted Bragg's orders as to mean {{that he was to}} attack the Union forces. Van Dorn, however, choose to move against the Union forces threatening Vicksburg and launched an attack on Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which failed; he then proposed a joint attack with Price on Corinth. Price by this time had decided not to wait for Van Dorn but moved against Iuka, capturing the town on September 14. Two Union columns, commanded by Grant and Rosecrans, converged on Iuka on September 19; Price attacked Rosecrans' force and due to poor communications and an <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadow</b> Grant failed to attack in concert. When he discovered that Grant was approaching from the northwest, Price decided to retreat before he was surrounded.|$|E

Results demonstrate that the combined geometrical-statistical technique is more robust and yields better results than the previous statistical technique. Integration of regularization over time further improves robustness. Application of the procedure results in 1) improved 3 D reconstructions with fewer artifacts, and 2) reduced mean registration error of tracked intraoperative brain ultrasound images...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{identify}} {{features on}} B-mode ultrasonography (US) prevalent in symptomatic plaques and correlate these findings with histopathologic markers of plaque instability. MethodsCarotid endarterectomy (CEA) plaques from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with critical stenoses (> 70 %) were qualitatively assessed using preoperative B-mode US for echolucency and calcific <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadowing.</b> US echolucency was quantitated ex vivo using computerized techniques for gray-scale median (GSM) analysis. Histopathologic correlates for US plaque echolucency (percentage of necrotic core area) and <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadowing</b> (percentage of calcification area) were determined. ResultsFifty CEA plaques {{were collected from}} 48 patients (46 unilateral and two bilateral); 26 of these plaques were from symptomatic patients. Age, degree of stenosis, and atherosclerotic risk factors were similar for the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Using preoperative B-mode US, 58 %, 35 %, and 7 % of symptomatic plaques and 18 %, 41 %, and 41 % of asymptomatic plaques {{were found to be}} echolucent, echogenic, and calcific, respectively (P <. 05). Using ex-vivo B-mode US and GSM analysis, symptomatic plaques were more echolucent (41 ± 19) than asymptomatic plaques (60 ± 13), P <. 03. A strong inverse correlation was found between the percent plaque necrotic area core and GSM (R = − 0. 9, P <. 001). Percentage of calcification area in plaques with <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadowing</b> was 66 % and only 27 % in those without <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadowing</b> (P <. 05). ConclusionsUsing B-mode US, symptomatic plaques are more echolucent and less calcified than asymptomatic plaques and are associated with a greater degree of histopathologic plaque necrosis. Such features are indicative of plaque instability and should be considered in the decision-making algorithm when selecting patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis for intervention...|$|R

The goal of this study is triple: -Theoretical; for various reasons, this kind of acoustic situations has not been extensively studied by traditional acoustics and psychoacoustics, therefore, this project demonstrates and supports the pertinence of the Ecology of Perception for the description and explanation of such complex phenomena. -Practical; like echolocation, perception of <b>acoustic</b> <b>shadows</b> can be improved by practice, this project intends to contribute to the acknowledgment of this way of listening and to help individuals placed in noisy environments without the support of vision acquiring a detailed detection of the movements occurring in these environments. -Artistic; this project explores a new artistic expression based on the creation and exploration of complex multisensory environments. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Shadows,</b> a multimedia interactive composition is being developed on the premises of the ecological approach to perception.
