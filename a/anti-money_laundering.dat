25|$|There is no precise {{measurement}} {{of the costs of}} regulation balanced against the harms associated with money laundering, and given the evaluation problems involved in assessing such an issue, {{it is unlikely that the}} effectiveness of terror finance and money laundering laws could be determined with any degree of accuracy. The Economist estimated the annual costs of <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> efforts in Europe and North America at US$5 billion in 2003, an increase from US$700 million in 2000. Government-linked economists have noted the significant negative effects of money laundering on economic development, including undermining domestic capital formation, depressing growth, and diverting capital away from development. Because of the intrinsic uncertainties of the amount of money laundered, changes in the amount of money laundered, and the cost of <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> systems, it is almost impossible to tell which <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> systems work and which are more or less cost effective.|$|E
25|$|To make {{it easier}} for {{authorities}} to regulate and investigate <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> operations Money Services Businesses (MSBs)—those who operate informal value transfer systems outside of the mainstream financial system—were included in the definition of a financial institution.|$|E

25|$|In both 2003 and 2010, U.S. {{regulators}} ordered HSBC {{to strengthen}} its <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> practices. In October 2010, the United States OCC issued a Cease and Desist Order requiring HSBC to strengthen multiple aspects of its <b>Anti-Money</b> <b>Laundering</b> (AML) program. The identified problems included a once massive backlog of over 17,000 alerts identifying suspicious activity, failure to file timely suspicious activity reports with U.S. law enforcement, failure to conduct any due diligence to assess risks to HSBC affiliates before opening correspondent accounts for them, a three-year failure by HBUS from mid-2006 to mid-2009 to conduct any AML of $15 billion in bulk cash transactions from those same HSBC affiliates, failure to monitor $60 trillion in annual wire transfers by customers in countries rated lower risk by HBUS, and inadequate and unqualified AML staffing, resources, and leadership. It was noted that HSBC fully cooperated with the Senate investigation.|$|E
25|$|Structuring: Often {{known as}} smurfing, {{this is a}} method of {{placement}} whereby cash is broken into smaller deposits of money, used to defeat suspicion of money laundering and to avoid <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> reporting requirements. A sub-component {{of this is to}} use smaller amounts of cash to purchase bearer instruments, such as money orders, and then ultimately deposit those, again in small amounts.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the {{difficulty}} in measurement, {{the amount of money}} laundered each year is in the billions of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large scale criminal enterprises. Modern <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> laws have developed along with the modern War on Drugs. In more recent times <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of terrorist financing in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come from, and terrorist financing relating to where the money is going to).|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, Barclays {{was accused}} of violating {{international}} <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> laws. According to the NGO Global Witness, the Paris branch of Barclays held the account of Equatorial Guinean President Teodoro Obiang's son, Teodorin Obiang, even after evidence that Obiang had siphoned oil revenues from government funds emerged in 2004. According to Global Witness, Obiang purchased a Ferrari and maintains a mansion in Malibu with the funds from this account.|$|E
25|$|Bank {{regulation}} in the United States is highly fragmented {{compared to other}} G10 countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both {{the federal and state}} level. The U.S. also {{has one of the most}} highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering,</b> anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.|$|E
25|$|On January 7, 2014, JPMorgan {{agreed to}} pay a total of $2.05 billion in fines and {{penalties}} to settle civil and criminal charges related to {{its role in the}} Madoff scandal.

25|$|The <b>Anti-Money</b> <b>Laundering</b> and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (AML/CTF Act) is the {{principal}} legislative instrument, although there are also offence provisions contained in Division 400 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). Upon its introduction, it was intended that the AML/CTF Act would be further amended by a second tranche of reforms extending to designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) including, inter alia, lawyers, accountants, jewellers and real estate agents; however, those further reforms {{have yet to be}} progressed.|$|E
25|$|Many {{countries}} are obligated by various international instruments and standards, {{such as the}} 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, the 2000 Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the 2003 United Nations Convention against Corruption, and {{the recommendations of the}} 1989 Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) to enact and enforce money laundering laws in an effort to stop narcotics trafficking, international organised crime, and corruption. Mexico, which has faced a significant increase in violent crime, established <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> controls in 2013 to curb the underlying crime issue.|$|E
25|$|FinCEN {{was made}} a bureau of the United States Department of Treasury and the {{creation}} of a secure network to be used by financial institutions to report suspicious transactions and to provide alerts of relevant suspicious activities was ordered. Along with these reporting requirements, a considerable number of provisions relate to the prevention and prosecution of money-laundering. Financial institutions were ordered to establish <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> programs and the BSA was amended to better define <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> strategy. Also increased were civil and criminal penalties for money laundering and the introduction of penalties for violations of geographic targeting orders and certain record-keeping requirements. A number of other amendments to the BSA were made through subtitle B, including granting the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System power to authorize personnel to act as law enforcement officers to protect the premises, grounds, property and personnel of any U.S. National reserve bank and allowing the Board to delegate this authority to U.S. Federal reserve bank. Another measure instructed United States Executive Directors of international financial institutions to use their voice and vote to support any country that has taken action to support the U.S.'s War on Terrorism. Executive Directors are now required to provide ongoing auditing of disbursements made from their institutions to ensure that no funds are paid to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism.|$|E
25|$|In July 2004, the United States Senate {{published}} {{an investigation into}} Riggs Bank, a Washington-based bank into which most of Equatorial Guinea's oil revenues were paid until recently, and which also banked for Chile's Augusto Pinochet. The Senate report, as to Equatorial Guinea, showed that at least $35 million were siphoned off by Obiang, his family and senior officials of his regime. The president has denied any wrongdoing. While Riggs Bank in February 2005 paid $9 million as restitution for its banking for Chile's Augusto Pinochet, no restitution was made with regard to Equatorial Guinea, as reported in detail in an <b>Anti-Money</b> <b>Laundering</b> Report from Inner City Press.|$|E
25|$|Also {{introduced}} into the House was the Financial Anti-Terrorism Act. This bill, which was later incorporated into the final USA PATRIOT Act, {{was introduced in the}} middle of October by Republican Representative Mike Oxley (R-OH), and was passed and then referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. It proposed strengthening financial law enforcement through a number of measures. These included establishing FinCEN as a bureau of the Department of the Treasury, enhancing forfeiture laws and preventing the structuring of transactions to bypass <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> and reporting legislation. It also proposed establishing measures to increase the cooperation between {{the public and private sectors}} when it came to reporting and preventing financial crimes such as money laundering, along with further measures to combat international money laundering.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 2008, The New York Times {{reported}} that Spitzer had patronized a high-priced escort service called Emperors Club VIP and met {{for two hours}} with a $1,000-an-hour call girl. This information originally {{came to the attention}} of authorities from a federal wiretap. During a six month span, Spitzer had at least seven or eight liaisons with women from the agency and paid more than $15,000. According to published reports, investigators alleged that Spitzer paid up to $80,000 for prostitutes over a period of several years while he was attorney general, and later as governor. Spitzer first drew the attention of federal investigators when his bank reported suspicious money transfers under the <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. The resulting investigation was triggered by the belief that Spitzer might have been hiding bribe proceeds and led to the discovery of the prostitution ring.|$|E
25|$|In April 2015, Prime Minister Sharmarke and President Mohamud in {{conjunction}} with the Federal Cabinet officially launched the Special Task Force on Remittances (STFR). The multi-agency initiative is mandated with facilitating the Federal Government of Somalia's new national policy pertaining to the money transfer industry. Its main priority is centered on establishing a comprehensive strategy and a consultative implementation plan for the formalization of the local financial sector. Additionally, the STFR is tasked with helping to foster a business environment and financial infrastructure conducive to growth. It is also empowered to coordinate and speed up the endorsement of financial governance instruments and transparency associated legislation, such as the laws on <b>Anti-Money</b> <b>Laundering</b> (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT). In accordance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)'s recommendations, the STFR is in turn slated to oversee the Somali federal government's campaign to ratify various international treaties. The Task Forces' membership is scheduled to be announced shortly, and will be drawn from government institutions, the remittance industry, banks and other key private sector stakeholders.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Supachai {{was convicted}} and jailed, but more charges of {{embezzlement}} and fraud were still under investigation. Another 370 million baht linked to the temple was discovered as the <b>Anti-Money</b> <b>Laundering</b> Office and DSI investigated further. Donors of the temple donated the remaining 370 million baht to the credit union as well, but apart from the problem of compensation to the credit union, the DSI suspected Luang Por Dhammajayo of having conspired in the embezzlement of Supachai. The department then investigated two charges: conspiring to launder money and receiving stolen goods. The charges were laid by an affected client of the credit union, who felt the money the temple returned had too many strings attached. The temple denied the charges of the department, stating that donations were received in the open in public, and that Supachai had only donated cheques, no cash. They further explained that the temple had a department for financial matters, in which Supachai had no part, and accused the DSI of violating double jeopardy principles.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{retirement}} as a judge, Rajah joined {{the law firm}} Harry Elias & Partners (now known as Harry Elias Partnership LLP) as a consultant.

2500|$|Bank employees, such as tellers and {{customer}} account representatives, {{are trained in}} <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> and are instructed to report activities that they deem suspicious. Additionally, <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> software filters customer data, classifies it according to level of suspicion, and inspects it for anomalies. Such anomalies include any sudden and substantial increase in funds, a large withdrawal, or moving money to a bank secrecy jurisdiction. Smaller transactions that meet certain criteria may also be flagged as suspicious. For example, structuring can lead to flagged transactions. The software also flags names on government [...] "blacklists" [...] and transactions that involve countries hostile to the host nation. Once the software has mined data and flagged suspect transactions, it alerts bank management, who must then determine whether to file a report with the government.|$|E
2500|$|While banks {{operating}} in the same country generally have to follow the same <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> laws and regulations, financial institutions all structure their <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> efforts slightly differently. Today, most financial institutions globally, and many non-financial institutions, are required to identify and report transactions of a suspicious nature to the financial intelligence unit in the respective country. For example, a bank must verify a customer's identity and, if necessary, monitor transactions for suspicious activity. This is often termed as [...] "know your customer". This means knowing {{the identity of the}} customer and understanding the kinds of transactions in which the customer is likely to engage. By knowing one's customers, financial institutions can often identify unusual or suspicious behaviour, termed anomalies, which may be an indication of money laundering.|$|E

The Money Laundering Suppression Act from 1994 required banking agencies to review and enhance training, develop <b>anti-money</b> <b>laundering</b> examination procedures, review and enhance procedures for referring cases to law enforcement agencies, streamlined the Currency transaction report exemption process, required each Money services business (MSB) to be registered by an owner or controlling person, required every MSB to maintain a list of businesses authorized to act as agents {{in connection with the}} financial services offered by the MSB, made operating an unregistered MSB a federal crime, and recommended that states adopt uniform laws applicable to MSBs.
