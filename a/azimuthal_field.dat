40|$|Abriged) The magnetorotational {{instability}} (MRI) {{is believed}} to be an efficient way to transport angular momentum in accretion discs. It has also been suggested as a way to amplify magnetic fields in discs, the instability acting as a nonlinear dynamo. Recent numerical work has shown that a large-scale magnetic field, which is predominantly azimuthal, can be sustained by motions driven by the MRI of this same field. Following this idea, we present an analytical calculation of the MRI in the presence of an <b>azimuthal</b> <b>field</b> with a non-trivial vertical structure. We find that the mean radial EMF associated to MRI modes tends to reduce the magnetic energy, acting like a turbulent resistivity by mixing the non-uniform <b>azimuthal</b> <b>field.</b> Meanwhile, the azimuthal EMF generates a radial field that, in combination with the Keplerian shear, tends to amplify the <b>azimuthal</b> <b>field</b> and can therefore assist in the dynamo process.

Stability diagrams are constructed, indicating critical values of the two fields for instability. We find an additional strong field instability that arises when the azimuthal Alfvén speed exceeds the characteristic rotational speed. This instability, in the case of a freely bounded configuration, has certain similarities to the sausage instability for interpenetrating fields in plasma physics, and may be important for very massive disks or filamentary molecular clouds. An application to the L 1641 region in Orion A is briefly discussed.

Using data from the simulations of Hirose et al.

40|$|Abstract. Current-driven instabilities of force-free screw pinches are {{studied for}} a large variety of {{magnetic}} configurations {{by means of a}} global linear analysis in an ideal MHD framework. The magnetic pitch, P = rBz/Bφ, in particular its value on the axis, P 0, essentially determines the growth rate of the fastest growing kink instability and allows to identify two regimes. In the large pitch regime, representative for the majority of controlled fusion devices, the stability properties are highly sensitive to the radial pitch profile. Astrophysical jets of magnetic origin are likely to have dominantly <b>azimuthal</b> <b>fields.</b> For such configurations the properties of the fastest growing kink instability become nearly independent of the details of the pitch profile. The most unstable mode grows with an e-folding time tg = 7. 52 P 0 /vA and an axial wavelength λ = 8. 43 P 0 in the rest frame of the jet. The magnetic structure of jets with dominantly <b>azimuthal</b> <b>fields</b> will be modified by the fast growing kink instability. An analysis of the eigenfunction shows however that the kink is an internal mode which does not cause a significant sidewise displacement of the jet surface.

The first effect is associated with the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents which result from the sub-corotation of the magnetospheric plasma. This is calculated from empirical models of the plasma flow and magnetic field based on Voyager data, with the effective Pedersen conductivity of Saturn's ionosphere being treated as an essentially free parameter. This mechanism results in a ?lagging' field configuration at all local times. The second effect is due to the day-night asymmetric confinement of the magnetosphere by the solar wind (i. e. the magnetopause and tail current system), which we have estimated empirically by scaling a model of the Earth's magnetosphere to Saturn. This effect produces ?leading' fields in the dusk magnetosphere, and ?lagging' fields at dawn. Our results show that the <b>azimuthal</b> <b>fields</b> observed in the inner regions can be reasonably well accounted for by plasma sub-corotation, given a value of the effective ionospheric Pedersen conductivity of ~ 1 ? 2 mho. This statement applies to field lines mapping to the equator within ~ 8 R S (1 R S is taken to be 60 330 km) of the planet on the dayside inbound passes, where the plasma distribution is dominated by a thin equatorial heavy-ion plasma sheet, and to field lines mapping to the equator within ~ 15 R S on the dawn side outbound passes.

If, however, we assume that the <b>azimuthal</b> <b>fields</b> observed in these regions are not due to sub-corotation but to some other process, then the above effective conductivities define an upper limit, such that values above ~ 2 mho can definitely be ruled out.
