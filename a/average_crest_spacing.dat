40|$|Avian {{neural crest}} cells {{migrating}} along the trunk ventral pathway are {{distributed throughout the}} rostral half of the sclerotome {{with the exception of}} a neural <b>crest</b> cell-free <b>space</b> of approximately 85 μm width surrounding the notochord. To determine if this neural <b>crest</b> cell-free <b>space</b> results from the notochord inhibiting neural crest cell migration, a length of quail notochord was implanted lateral to the neural tube along the neural crest ventral migratory pathway of 2 -day chicken embryos. The subsequent distribution of neural crest cells was analyzed in embryos fixed 2 days after grafting. When the donor notochord was isolated using collagenase, neural crest cells avoided the ectopic notochord and were absent from the area immediately surrounding the implant (mean distance of 43 μm). The neural <b>crest</b> cell-free <b>space</b> was significantly less when notochords were isolated using trypsin or chondroitinase digestion and was completely eliminated when notochords were fixed with paraformaldehyde or methanol prior to implantation.

We use NEXTMap digital surface models and aerial {{photographs}} {{to map the}} distribution of previously unreported fields of Rogen moraine {{in the vicinity of}} Loch Shin, northern Scotland. Existing models of formation are tested against detailed morphological Rogen moraine characteristics obtained from the remote sensing data and field observations. Detailed morphometric analyses combined with their geographical setting lead us to postulate a likely mechanism of formation. Rogen moraine appear to have formed in areas where there were strong basal ice-flow velocity gradients. Thrusting by compression, or fracturing by extension of preexisting partially frozen sediment probably occurred in these areas, resulting in Rogen moraine formation. A general down-ice increase in ridge <b>crest</b> <b>spacing</b> suggests that the latter process may have been dominant, and is consistent with the location of Rogen moraine in the lee of topographic obstructions, in areas that experienced overall extensional ice flow. We also suggest that at least one field of Rogen moraine formed where lateral basal ice-flow velocity gradients were strongest — possibly in a subglacial shear margin setting. Given their location, the landforms may be consistent with formation during headward scavenging of the Moray Firth palaeo-ice stream into a shrinking core of cold-based ice. ...|$|R

The hand-arm vibration measurement was done according to the standards ISO 5349 - 1 and ISO 5349 - 2. The obtained results indicated that the exposure level in three modes of rota-tilling, transportation and idling were equal to 16. 95, 14. 16 and 8. 65 m/s 2, respectively. In all measurement modes, the exposure to vibration in the direction x was greater than that of y and z. Moreover, the <b>average</b> <b>crest</b> factor was calculated less than six. The highest vibration dose values were measured in rota-tilling mode when the tiller was in 2 nd  gear (60. 76 m/s 1. 75) and 1 st gear (56. 83 m/s 1. 75). The results indicated that the permitted working time was only few seconds and there was a risk of musculoskeletal disorders. The present study emphasizes on the need for interventional and control managerial measures to eliminate or reduce hand-arm vibration transmitted to the tiller users' hands for avoiding major problems such as musculoskeletal disorders, discomfort and  premature fatigue.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Saturn's moon Titan {{is home to}} many landforms {{similar to}} those found on Earth. One of Titan's most notable landforms are dune fields, which cover perhaps 20 % of Titan's surface [1 - 5]. These dunes are linear in form and can stretch to {{hundreds}} of kilometers in length [6]. They are located in equatorial regions and can be found between latitudes of ± 30 º [1, 2, 4, 5]. Modeling of dune parameters on Titan, such as dune width, spacing, and length have yielded important results concerning dune field maturity [6 - 8]. The emerging pattern analysis results and the uniformity of dune form across Titan indicate these dunes may be in an equilibrium condition that has persisted for a long time [8]. The duration of aeolian dune processes on Earth is also relatively long lived [9], so how Earth-like processes relate to those on Titan is the subject of current study [7 - 10]. The following are results from a pattern analysis study of Titan's dunes, presented along with a new method for measuring <b>crest</b> <b>spacing</b> of Titan's linear dunes. Methods: New measurements of dune width and spacing have been obtained, using Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in the USGS program ISIS, for two main sand sea regions. The first is in the Fensal Sand Sea, east of Xanadu, with measurements so far from the T 25 swath (20 º S - 20 º N, 32 º W - 49 º W, Fig. 1 a,b) and the second is from the Belet Sand Sea, the 2500 km long collection of sand west of the Xanadu terrain, with measurements so far from the T 8 swath (5 º S - 10 º S, 189 º W - 315 º W). This is a continuation of a previous study, in which dune width and spacing were measured in various locations in six different SAR swaths across Titan [8] and build on similar measurements by Le Gall et al. [4]. The Savage et al. [8] study utilized measurements obtained at approximately 5 km intervals, yielding ~ 7, 000 each width and spacings [8]. Dune widths were measured from one light/dark boundary to the next across SAR-dark areas perpendicular to the long axis of the dunes. After widths were measured, interdune spacing was obtained for each region using the same method, across SAR-bright areas. Crest-to-crest dune spacing was approximated by adding the average dune width for a particular degree of latitude to the average interdune spacing for that same degree of latitude [8]. These methods were used because Cassini SAR resolution (~ 300 m.) is not good enough to distinguish actual dune crests. Current measurement methods differ from those of Savage et al. [8] in that crest-to-crest spacing is now done by measuring from one SAR light/dark boundary to the next SAR light/dark boundary perpendicular to the long axis of the dunes (Fig. 1 c). Dune widths were measured as in [8], across each dark feature (Fig. 1 c), and width and spacing was measured from the same starting point (Fig 1 c). We believe this will provide us with a more accurate measurement for <b>crest</b> <b>spacing,</b> and will enable us to precisely correlate dune width and spacing...|$|R

In this study, the parameters of whole body and hand-arm vibrations such as effective acceleration, overall equivalent acceleration, Vibration Dose Value and crest factor were studied on two Thicknessing planes, two sliding panel saw machines, two orbital sander, and three operators of perforate procedure. Assessments were done by the use of an oscillator and an analyzer of Svantak Co. Evaluating Hand-arm and whole body vibrations were conducted based on ISO 5349 - 1, ISO 5349 - 2 and ISO 2631 - 1 standards, respectively, and the findings/ the evaluated data were analyzed. The mean amount of daily exposure to hand-arm vibration (RMS) in Thicknessing plane, Orbital Sander and Sliding panel saw machine operators are respectively 5. 56, 5. 49 and 3. 37 m/s 2. In addition, the <b>average</b> <b>crest</b> factor of the 3 jobs is higher than 6.

In further measured situations, exposure to hand-arm vibration is more than the standard level, so engineering and management measures are required to reduce the amount of exposure and support the health of the operators and the equipment...|$|R

BACKGROUND CONTEXT In this work we present a method to achieve loudness enhancement of an audio mixture by using relative po-larities in a multi-track context in order to reduce crest factor 1. To our knowledge, this is a novel perspective, 1 It is widely accepted that loudness perception correlates with a signal’s root mean square (RMS) value, while peak value has little bearing. This means that a signal with a lower peak-to-RMS level (usu-ally termed crest factor) will be louder than a counterpart with a larger but there are several approaches that address polarity in a multi-track context (but not for loudness optimization) and many works that focus on crest factor minimization, normally to enhance loudness (but do so based on mixed signals, rather than multi-track content). In this section we will briefly review these past approaches. One should note that the use of polarity during the mix-value, if peak values are made equal...|$|R

40|$|Field {{measurements}} of wave overtopping over a rubble mound breakwater {{have been carried}} out at Zeebrugge, Belgium, during the period 1999 - 2003. The overtopping volumes of water are collected in an overtopping tank located on the breakwater crest behind the access road. A short side of the tank is made of a weir, allowing the collected water to flow out continuously, and allowing measurements to be made for long duration. Calculation of the inflow discharge is based on the outflow discharge over the weir and the volume in the tank. This calculation requires an accurate measurement of the water depth inside the tank. The water depth is measured indirectly using a pressure sensor near the bottom. The measurement setup for wave overtopping at the breakwater is described in detail. Eight-wave records with wave propagation normal to the breakwater have been used in the analysis of the field data. Wave heights range between 2. 6 and 3. 9 in (i. e., up to 63 % of the design wave height) for wave records with a typical duration of 1 - 2 h. The measured average overtopping rate q has been determined for all records using three methods (q< 1 l/s m). Average overtopping rates from the field data have been compared with predicted values from prediction formulae by van der Meer et al. [van der Meer, J. W., Tonjes, P., de Waal, H., 1998. A code for dike height design and examination. In: Proceedings International Conference on Coastlines, Structures and Breakwaters.

40|$|Independent dating {{evidence}} and dune morphology indicate great {{stability of the}} Australian dunefields. Most dunefields have seen only minor superficial modification since they were formed, up to 1 million years ago, despite quite large changes in climate conditions. This stability may be {{partly due to the}} relatively dense vegetation cover on Australian dunes under the marginally arid climate. But new studies, supported by many older observations, suggest that 'sticky' dunes (where sand grains are bonded or cemented) may form under a broader range of wind climates than widely thought and have greater resistance to reworking. New mapping of the Australian continental dunefields from satellite imagery shows a previously unrecognised diversity of dune morphologies. Dune orientation, continuity, connectedness, crest planform, <b>crest</b> sharpness, <b>spacing</b> and setting all show patterns of variation over the continent. These are consistent with the overall low sand supply and variable wind climate that contribute to the dominance of longitudinal dunes but also with only superficial modification of the dunes after their initial formation. The longevity of the dunes is likely also partly due to the stabilisation of dune sand by pedogenesis: the bonding of sand by pedogenic calcium carbonate, gypsum, silica and translocated clays. The extremely low mobility of the sand dunes has led to preservation of dunes of great age, with stacked accretionary units and multiple palaeosols. 17 page(s...|$|R

The vertical spacing between reinforcement layers has {{a significant impact on the}} stability of a reinforced slope when subjected to a vertical load. Less vertical distance between reinforcement layers allows the slope to tolerate much greater loads than layers spaced further apart. Distributions of peak strains in reinforcement layers due to the strip footing placed on the surface of the reinforced slope were found to extend up to mid-height of the slope and thereafter they were found to be negligible. Stability analysis of the centrifuge models was found to be consistent with the observed performance of geotextile-reinforced slopes subjected to loading applied to a strip footing near the crest.

Furthermore we introduce and then compute the so-called crest factor associated with the above solutions. The crest factor provides information on the distortion of the solution away from its space average and therefore, if it is large, gives evidence of strong turbulence.

Secondary outcomes were lung-to-bodyweight ratio (LBWR), tropoelastin expression, density and spatial distribution of elastin, pulmonary/alveolar morphometry, and fetal survival. RESULTS: TO increased Ki- 67 messenger RNA and LBWR. Albumin further increased LBWR and density of Ki- 67 -positive cells but also fetal mortality.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the use of}} a segmental Le Fort I osteotomy for interpositional autogenous iliac bone grafts in 5 patients with severe unilateral atrophy of the maxilla. Unilateral pterygomaxillary disjunction and osteotomy of the lateral and medial walls of the maxillary sinus were performed. The mucosa of the maxillary sinus was preserved and lifted cranially. It was stabilized with autogenous cancellous bone grafts. One side of the maxilla was gently downfractured until it replaced the original morphology of the alveolar <b>crest.</b> The inter-arch <b>space</b> was therefore reduced to the ideal level for placing implants. Lateral widening of the alveolar crest was obtained with on-lay bone grafts. Segmental osteotomy with bone grafting is a modification of Le Fort I swing osteotomy that has several advantages. The in-lay graft was not resorbed because it was rapidly revascularized and implant placement was delayed. This article presents a surgical technique for the reduction of vertical inter-arch space for the correct positioning of osseointegrated implants...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} investigation {{carried out to}} examine the pressure distribution and the relevant crest and trough forces acting on smooth and artificially rough inclined walls under irregular waves. In a previous paper (Gentile e Rebaudengo Landò, 2007) starting from experimental results obtained with slope 1 : 2 {{the distribution of the}} <b>averaged</b> dimensionless <b>crest</b> and trough pressures have been described from a statistical point of view. In the present paper, further experimental results with a different slope (1 : 1) are shown and discussed and comparisons are made between the results obtained in the two configurations. When the slope is lower the run-up extension is more important, giving rise to overtopping conditions, mainly on smooth walls, but the run-down extension is less important. The slope being the same, the roughness limits the run-up and gives rise to a more compact collapsing zone. From the time histories of the pressures those of the forces are deduced and the characteristic crest and trough forces are obtained, which substantially correspond to the run-up and run-down conditions. The roughness feebly reduces the crest and trough forces but the rough wall is more interestig from a technical point of view due to the reduced overtopping. The characteristic significant crest and trough forces are also examined in terms of horizontal and vertical components, showing that the wall slope affects more the horizontal trough component than the horizontal crest one. The results suggest the possibility of adopting trapezoidal caisson breakwaters with an inclined rough wall as the vertical component of the wave forces may be able to counteract the up-lift force more than it happens vith the well-known sloping top caissons...|$|R
30|$|As {{a result}} of daily variation, the EIA is {{centered}} {{in the range of}} 7 ° N– 9 ° N, except at 0030 LT (24.5 LT in Fig.  3) when the center appears at 4 ° N; the northern crest appears in the range of 15 ° N– 21 ° N; and the southern crest appears in the range of 1 ° S– 9 ° S. The average location of the EIA center is near the dip equator, and the average locations of northern crest and southern crest are 19.4 ° N and 6.5 ° S, respectively. By ignoring the crest and center information at 0030 LT, the crest is 2 ° farther from the dip equator in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere. The asymmetry is also shown in Fig.  3 d, as the <b>average</b> of the <b>crest</b> peak latitude ratio is 0.93. The EIA crests are fairly asymmetric after 1230 LT in this period average. The maximum TEC at both hemispheres and at the dip equator appears in the afternoon hours (1630 LT).|$|R
2500|$|Several new {{supplementary}} features have been formally {{recognized by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The feature fluctus can form under conditions of strong atmospheric wind shear and instability when wave-like clouds of the variety undulatus break into regularly <b>spaced</b> <b>crests.</b> This variant is sometimes known informally as a Kelvin–Helmholtz (wave) cloud. [...] This phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets {{and even in the}} sun's atmosphere. [...] Another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave-like cloud feature associated with the undulatus variety has been given the Latin name asperitus. [...] The supplementary feature cavum is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus. [...] Fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. [...] This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A murus feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes. A cauda feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the storm.|$|R
40|$|We begin a {{study of}} {{nonlinear}} wave phenomena in molecular clouds. These clouds exhibit highly nonlinear structure that is often {{described in terms of}} 'clumps' and 'filaments' which are bouncing around, twisting, and colliding within the cloud. These clouds are important because they ultimately produce the initial conditions for the star formation process. Our motivation is to explore the possibility that solitons (i. e., spatially localized, single-hump wave entities which often exhibit remarkable stability) can live in these molecular clouds and produce their observed structure. In this paper we focus on the case of one spatial dimension, and we show that a rich variety of nonlinear waves can exist in molecular cloud fluid systems (where self-gravity is included). We show that in the absence of magnetic fields no true soliton solutions are allowed, although highly nonlinear waves (whose <b>crests</b> become widely <b>spaced</b> and thus soliton-like) do exist. For clouds with embedded magnetic fields, we derive a model equation which describes the behavior of wave phenomena; this model equation allows solutions which correspond to nonlinear waves, solitons, and topological solitons. We briefly consider the stability of these wave entities and discuss the possible role they play in molecular cloud dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Fields of {{sand dunes}} are {{ubiquitous}} {{in the north}} polar region of Mars and provide a record of sand transport processes influenced by Mars? polar climate. Spatial and temporal variations in dunes, ripples, coarse-grained ripples, and exposed dune cross-strata were analyzed in two areas of the Olympia Undae Dune Field {{in order to assess}} the influence of the Martian polar boundary conditions on ripple and dune activity and on pattern development. Two- and three-dimensional parameters, including dune <b>crest</b> length, <b>spacing,</b> width, slope, and height, were statistically assessed using regression analysis and descriptive statistics. Sediment fluxes were calculated using Co-registration of Optically Sensed Imagery and Correlation (COSICorr), a program that precisely co-registers and correlates imagery, and by measuring dune displacement. Two-dimensional pattern analysis indicates the co-existence of two populations of dunes that can be interpreted as two generations or as forming simultaneously under sediment availability limited conditions. Three-dimensional pattern analysis shows an asymmetry in slope profiles of the primary dunes and is consistent with primary dunes forming transversely to constructional winds. Four different types of ripple crestline patterns are identified and likely arise due to differences in grain size and dune-modified wind speeds and secondary flow directions. Maximum measured ripple displacement in the center of Olympia Undae study area is ~ 1. 4 m yr^- 1 ? 0. 13 m. Assuming a mean ripple height of 0. 11 m and a 4 : 1 saltation to reptation ratio, the sediment flux is ~ 0. 42 m? m^- 1 yr^- 1. Adjacent to the polar ice cap, barchan dune crest displacements range between 0. 25 m yr- 1 and 2. 80 m yr- 1 and dune heights between 11 m and 31 m. Mean sediment flux is 3. 5 m? m- 1 yr- 1. Results indicate that there is a spatial decay in sediment transport across the field and that fluxes near the cap are comparable to those found in Nili Patera, Mars and Victoria Valley, Antarctica. Overall the polar boundary conditions seasonally limit sand availability by seasonal frost cover and subsurface ice. The polar boundary conditions are most influential at the dune pattern scale, but appear to have little influence on the ripple pattern or ripple mobility...|$|R
