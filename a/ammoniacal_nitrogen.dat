40|$|The Avon-Heathcote Estuary is {{the largest}} semi-enclosed shallow estuary in Canterbury, New Zealand and {{functions}} as a sink for local industrial and domestic treated sewage. The endemic mudflat snail, Amphibola crenata {{is one of the}} conspicuous members of the estuarine benthos and {{it is likely to be}} a good indicator of changes in contaminant and nutrient conditions within the estuary. This thesis investigated the current densities, distribution, and biomass of A. crenata in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary. A. crenata was widely distributed throughout the estuary. However, no mudsnails were found in samples collected from southern sites close to the causeway and none were present on the sandbanks in the centre of the estuary. There was a positive correlation between A. crenata density and biomass. As the distance from the edge of the estuary and salinity increased, the density and biomass of A. crenata decreased. All of the statistical models showed that mudsnails were found close to the estuary edge. Densities of A. crenata were higher in summer compared to winter. Juveniles inhabited the high-tide level while medium and large A. crenata were common at the mid-tide and low-tide levels. There was a good correlation between the dry weight and shell length of A. crenata for all sites and seasons. Over a six week period, field cage experiments found that shell growth of adult, medium and juvenile A. crenata varied amongst sites based on combination factors including food quality, contaminant levels and sediment conditions. The wet weight of large adults did not change significantly, however, there were differences in weight gain of medium and juveniles from the different sites. Mudsnail condition varied with body size and site. Zinc was the trace metal found in the highest concentrations in the sediment while cadmium was the lowest trace metals detected. Levels of total phosphorus, <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>ammoniacal,</b> kjeldahl <b>nitrogen</b> and dissolved reactive phosphorus in the water were highest at the Oxidation Pond site which was close to the main discharge point from the treatment plant into the Avon-Heathcote Estuary. A. crenata populations in the present research have shown strong correlations with environmental variables and this can be used for management and conservation. The research presented in this thesis provides a starting point in our understanding of the effects and implications of diverting treated waste water on the distribution and abundance of a key gastropod.

40|$|Objective: Nitrogen {{losses from}} manure, {{especially}} from cattle slurry, significantly {{contribute to the}} eutrophication problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to minimize the nitrogen losses from cattle slurry used as a fertilizer of winter wheat. Investigation programme: In multi-factorial field experiments and accompanying laboratory studies techniques for the careful incorporation of slurry were tested together with slurry separation and slurry additives. Results, possible applications: A rapid pH increase due to CO_ 2 volatilization following slurry application is the cause of the high initial NH_ 3 emission rates. To conserve slurry nitrogen, the slurry-borne bases have to be buffered by the acid content of the soil. Only the combination of slurry separation and incorporation (flexible harrow, injector) provides sufficient contact between slurry and soil to reduce NH_ 3 losses to less than 30 % of the <b>ammoniacal</b> slurry <b>nitrogen</b> in all the weather and soil conditions investigated. Banded application of slurry to growing crops (winter wheat) by trail hoses with subsequent careful incorporation by a flexible harrow seems to be the best way to use the slurry as a fertilizer in cereal production. The use of trail hoses allone is not sufficient. Viscous slurry with a high dry matter content may only be used in a N-conserving manner after it has been dry matter-reduced by separation. Possibly the addition of ground gypsum to slurry previous to the application can further reduce the NH_ 3 losses. (orig.)

50|$|In {{some older}} landfills, {{leachate}} {{was directed to}} the sewers, but this can cause a number of problems. Toxic metals from leachate passing through the sewage treatment plant concentrate in the sewage sludge, making it difficult or dangerous {{to dispose of the}} sludge without incurring a risk to the environment. In Europe, regulations and controls have improved in recent decades, and toxic wastes are now no longer permitted to be disposed of in the Municipal Solid Waste landfills, and in most developed countries the metals problem has diminished. Paradoxically, however, as sewage treatment plant discharges are being improved throughout Europe and many other countries, the plant operators are finding that leachates are difficult waste streams to treat. This is because leachates contain very high <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> concentrations, are usually very acidic, are often anoxic and, if received in large volumes relative to the incoming sewage flow, lack the Phosphorus needed to prevent nutrient starvation for the biological communities that perform the sewage treatment processes. The result is that leachates are a difficult-to-treat waste stream. However, within aging municipal solid waste landfills, this may not be a problem as the pH returns close to neutral after the initial stage of acidogenic leachate decomposition. Many sewer undertakers limit maximum <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> concentration in their sewers to 250 mg/l to protect sewer maintenance workers, as the WHO's maximum occupational safety limit would be exceeded at above pH 9 to 10, which is often the highest pH allowed in sewer discharges.|$|E
40|$|Cover crops improve {{soil quality}} through {{increased}} organic matter, biological activity, aggregate stability, water infiltration, and nutrient cycling.

High salinity and/or ammonia, among other components in swine manure, may reduce cover crop seed germination and limit the use of slurry seeding. Ten cover crop species were evaluated to compare the effects of swine manure components on cover crop seed germination. Seed germination percentages and rates were affected by swine manure but not by equivalent salinity levels established with Sodium Chloride. Thus, the salinity component of swine manure is not likely a large contributor to {{the negative effects of}} manure on the germination of some cover crop seeds. Pre-soaking seeds in solution had an effect on germination of cover crops, and thus a mixing period of ≤ 1 hr is suggested for the practice. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>ammoniacal</b> gaseous forms resulting from volatilization after manure applications had an inhibitory effect on germination of cover crop seeds and may be the driving factor reducing germination. Anaerobic like conditions also reduced germination. A rainfall event within the first week after slurry seeding may be critical in order to achieve a good establishment of the crop. Field scale trials showed that surficial slurry seeding may reduce germination by up to 50 %. Surficial slurry seeding in farmer trials showed that cover crop treatments had greater yield than the matching no cover treatments, possibly due to increased nutrient cycling and other benefits from cover crops. Cover crops also reduced the yield differences between low N and high N treatments, possibly due to greater nutrient capture and cycling. Slurry seeding has potential to facilitate cover crop establishment but needs further evaluation to optimize its performance. ...|$|R

5000|$|This type of {{amendment}} creates {{acidic conditions}} (pH less than 7) in the litter, resulting in {{more of the}} <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> being temporarily retained as ammonium rather than ammonia. Ammonium is a highly reactive ion that bonds with sulfates, nitrates and phosphates to form ammonium salts that improve the nutrient value of litter when land applied as fertilizer. The acidity also creates unfavorable environment for urolytic bacteria reducing the production of enzymes that contribute to ammonia formation, resulting in reduced ammonia production. Urolytic bacteria have a pH optimum of approximately 8.3 and litter amendments lower the litter surface pH to below 4.0 {{for a short period}} of time, usually between 3-5 days depending on the litter amendment. There are several different types of acidifiers, such as alum, acidified liquid alum, sodium bisulfate, ferric sulfate, and sulfuric acid, that have been used by the poultry industry. These products vary in effectiveness as the pH is raised by the activity of the poultry within a couple of weeks. The combination of using litter amendments and poultry house ventilation provides a healthy and comfortable rearing environment. Controlling volatilized ammonia in poultry and livestock rearing environments is critical to maintaining a high level of animal health, well-being and efficient live performance.

For each waste, three composting simulations were performed in parallel in three similar reactors (300 L), each one under a constant aeration rate. The aeration flows applied were comprised between 100 and 1100 L/h. The initial waste and the compost were characterized through the measurements of their contents in dry matter, total carbon, Kjeldahl and total <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> nitrite and nitrate. Kjeldahl and total <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and nitrite and nitrate were measured in leachates and in condensates too. Ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions were monitored in continue. The cumulated emissions in ammonia and in nitrous oxide were given for each waste and at each aeration rate. The paper focused on process of ammonification and on transformations and transfer of total <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> The parameters of nitrous oxide emissions were not investigated. The removal rate of total Kjeldahl nitrogen was shown being {{closely tied to}} the ammonification rate. Ammonification was modelled thanks to the calculation of the ratio of biodegradable carbon to organic nitrogen content of the biodegradable fraction. The wastes were shown to differ significantly regarding their ammonification ability. Nitrogen balances were calculated by subtracting nitrogen losses from nitrogen removed from material. Defaults in nitrogen balances were assumed to correspond to conversion of nitrate even nitrite into molecular nitrogen and then to the previous conversion by nitrification of total <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> The pool of total <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> i. e. total <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> initially contained in waste plus total <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> released by ammonification, was calculated for each experiment.

The results of the study show that about 40 % of <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> with concentration of more than 1000 mg L– 1 could be removed either by activated carbon or a mixture of carbon with limestone at mixture ratio of 5 : 35. This result shows that limestone is potentially useful as a cost-effective medium to replace activated carbon for ammo-niacal nitrogen removal at a considerably lower cost...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the suitability of}} natural silica sand as a low-cost adsorbent {{for the removal of}} <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and heavy metals, particularly iron and zinc, from semi-aerobic stabilized landfill leachate. Leachate samples were collected from the Pulau Burung landfill site (PBLS) in Penang, Malaysia. The above-mentioned contaminants are highlighted in this study because of their unsafe concentrations at PBLS. The effects of shaking time, settling time, and silica sand dosage on the study parameter removal efficiencies were investigated to predict the performance of the process. The adsorptions of <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> iron, and zinc were judiciously described by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The optimum removal efficiencies of <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> iron, and zinc obtained were 51 %, 44. 4 %, and 39. 2 %, respectively, with a shaking time of 90 min, a settling time of 60 min, and with a dosage of 60 g (0. 5 kg/L) of silica sand. Based on the coefficient of determination (R 2) values obtained from Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> iron, and zinc adsorption were better fitted to the Freundlich model...|$|E
3000|$|The {{average values}} of nitrate (5.48 [*]±[*] 1.60 NO_ 3 ^ -  mg/L) and <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> of the sampled water (0.32 [*]±[*] 0.07  mg/L of NH 4 +) are, respectively, {{higher than the}} normal values of 3  mg/L for nitrate and 0.1  mg/L for <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and {{translated}} by this organic pollution (Rodier 2009). The high value of nitrate (11.06 [*]±[*] 3.57 NO_ 3 ^ - [...] mg/L) is obtained in LDS at Mvog-betsi, {{by the presence of}} biodegradable organic matter.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical–biological {{pre-treatment}} (MBP) {{of municipal}} solid waste (MSW) has gained evidence as a practice capable of accomplishing the requirements for environmental sustainable landfilling. In particular, MBP is effective in reducing the <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> content in the leachate. However, few data {{are available on the}} modifications of the nitrogen forms occurring during MBP and on the role played by processes such as nitrification and generation of refractory organic compounds. The dynamic transformations of nitrogen were investigated during the MBP. MSW was mechanically and biologically pre-treated; samples were collected at different stages of the process and analysed to investigate the evolution of nitrogen forms; batch and column leaching tests were performed as well. The results indicate that nitrification is negligible and volatilization can only partially explain the low <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> content in the leachate. Incorporation of <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> into a refractory organic form was assessed and is likely to play an important role. The maximum content of refractory organic nitrogen in the solid waste was achieved after about 60 days of aerobic pre-treatment; therefore, the minimal duration of the MBP should be about 8 – 9 weeks in order to optimize the <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> incorporation, unless the waste is characterized by a low C/N ratio...|$|E
40|$|Sanitary {{landfilling}} is {{the most}} common way to dispose solid urban waste; however, improper landfill management may pose serious environmental threats through discharge of high strength polluted wastewater also known as leachate. The treatment of landfill leachate to fully reduce the negative impact on the environment, is nowadays a challenge. In this study, an aerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) was proposed for the treatment of locally obtained real landfill leachate with initial <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of 1800 and 3200 mg/L, respectively. ASBR could remove 65 % of <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and 30 % of COD during seven days of treatment time. Thereafter, an effective adsorbent, i. e., zeolite was used as a secondary treatment step for polishing the <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and COD content that is present in leachate. The results obtained are promising where the adsorption of leachate by zeolite further enhanced the removal of <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and COD up to 96 and 43 %, respectively. Furthermore, this combined biological–physical treatment system was able to remove heavy metals, i. e. aluminium, vanadium, chromium, magnesium, cuprum and plumbum significantly. These results demonstrate that combined ASBR and zeolite adsorption is a feasible technique for the treatment of landfill leachate, even considering this effluent’s high resistance to treatment...|$|E
