By {{the time of his}} killing, he no longer represented the Robin Hood icon that once stirred global fascination. Ten years after the 11 September 2001 attacks, jihadi terrorism has largely lost its juggernaut luster. It now mostly resembles a patchwork of self-radicalising local groups with international contacts but without any central organisational design - akin to the radical left terrorism of the 1970 s and the <b>anarchist</b> fin-de-siècle <b>terrorism.</b> This volume addresses two issues that remain largely unexplored in contemporary terrorism studies. It rehabilitates the historical and comparative analysis as a way to grasp the essence of terrorism, including its jihadi strand. Crucial similarities with earlier forms of radicalisation and terrorism abound and differences appear generally not fundamental. Likewise, the very concept of radicalisation is seldom questioned anymore. Nevertheless it often lacks conceptual clarity and empirical validation. Once considered a quintessential European phenomenon, the United States too experiences how some of its own citizens radicalise into terrorist violence. This collective work compares radicalisation in both continents and the strategies aimed at de-radicalisation. But it also assesses if the concept merits its reputation as the holy grail of terrorism studies...|$|R

On 13 September 1923, Miguel Primo de Rivera, Captain General of Catalonia, orchestrated a coup d'état, after issuing a manifesto blaming the problems of Spain on the parliamentary system. Alfonso XIII backed the General and named him Prime Minister. Primo de Rivera proceeded to suspend the Constitution and assume absolute powers as a dictator. He created the Unión Patriótica Española, which was meant to be the sole legal party, abolishing all other parties. During this time, he greatly increased government spending on business and public services, which caused his government to go bankrupt. He lost the support of the military and faced serious health problems. Opposition to his regime was so great that Alfonso XIII stopped supporting him and forced him to resign in January 1930.|$|E

These acts were justified as the necessary counterpart to state repression. As early as 1911, Leon Trotsky condemned individual acts of violence by anarchists as useful for little more than providing an excuse for state repression. [...] "The anarchist prophets of the 'propaganda by the deed' can argue all they want about the elevating and stimulating influence of terrorist acts on the masses," [...] he wrote in 1911, [...] "Theoretical considerations and political experience prove otherwise."

Czolgosz was convicted on 24 September 1901 after the jury deliberated for only one hour. On 26 September, the jury unanimously recommended the death penalty and was electrocuted by three jolts, each of 1800 volts, in Auburn Prison on 29 October 1901, just 45 days after his victim’s death. Emma Goldman was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the assassination, but was released, due to insufficient evidence. She later incurred a great deal of negative publicity when she published [...] "The Tragedy at Buffalo". In the article, she compared Czolgosz to Marcus Junius Brutus, the killer of Julius Caesar, and called McKinley the [...] "president of the money kings and trust magnates." [...] Other anarchists and radicals were unwilling to support Goldman’s effort to aid Czolgosz, believing that he had harmed the movement.

5000|$|Amongst the Spanish novelists Gabriel Miró is {{a writer}} counted among Generación de 1914; he excelled in [...] "lyrical novels". He is worth noting because some of his novels, e.g. El abuelo del rey (1915), provide a veiled {{discourse}} on tradition and change with Traditionalism present in the background. Moreover, in his later novels some of his Carlist personalities, like Don Alvaro from Nuestro Padre San Daniel (1921) and El obispo leproso (1926) escape the usual scheme and provide an ambiguous and rather mysterious point of reference. Despite scarce Carlist motives, some scholars consider Miró one of key writers forming the Carlist literary thread across almost two centuries. Estanislao Rico Ariza, active under the pen-name [...] "Francisco de Paula Calderón", was a Carlist militant involved in clashes with the Anarchists. Banking on his first-hand experience he released a unique novel on <b>Anarchist</b> <b>terrorism,</b> Memorias de un terrorista: Novela episódica de la tragedia barcelonesa (1924); 12 years later he paid for it with his life. Benedicto Torralba de Damas fathered En los nidos de antaño (1926), a novel which in the Traditionalist realm earned him the prestige of [...] "distinguido literato". Still in Catalonia but {{on the opposite side}} one has to note Pere Coromines and his vehemently anti-Carlist Silèn (1925). Dolores Gortázar, a Carlist militant active as a propagandist in the early 1920s, during the primoderiverista period was very popular as a novelist; however, she penned banal prose deprived of ideological threads. Benjamin Jarnés penned his Zumalacárregui, el caudillo romántico (1931) in a very peculiar way; his protagonist is presented as more than a military hero, a genius embodiment of individuality who could have been an icon of both the Carlists and the Liberals, [...] "artista de la acción". Florentino Soria López released a successful historical novel Los titanes de la raza (1925), featuring exalted patriotism rathen than Carlism. Antonio Pérez de Olaguer commenced his later longtime literary carrer with a somewhat new genre, a grotesque novel La ciudad que no tenía mujeres (1932).|$|E
5000|$|This {{was in an}} {{age when}} hundreds, if not thousands, of {{striking}} workers died at the hands of policemen and armed guards, and in which almost a hundred were killed each day in industrial accidents. While acts of <b>anarchist</b> <b>terrorism</b> were exceptional, however, they played a vital role in how Americans imagined the new world of industrial capitalism, providing early hints that the rise of Morganizationwould not come without violent resistance from below. — Beverly Gage, 2009. Italian anti-organizationalist individualist anarchism was brought to the United States by Italian born individualists such as Giuseppe Ciancabilla and others who advocated for violent propaganda by the deed there. Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports the incident in which the important Italian social anarchist Errico Malatesta became involved [...] "in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of Paterson, who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant." [...] Some anarchists, such as Johann Most, were already advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because [...] "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda." [...] By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, [...] "propaganda of the deed" [...] to refer to individual bombings, regicides, and tyrannicides. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal 'expropriations'." [...] Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it [...] "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("propaganda by the deed") and the anarchist burglars ("individual reappropriation") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society.

40|$|The {{works of}} the {{prolific}} author, William Le Queux, represent the highpoint of the German 'invasion panic' genre {{in the years before}} 1914. Widely read by contemporaries, his novels provided a catalyst for British debates about the economic, military and spiritual exhaustion of the empire in the face of new national and imperial rivals. For Le Queux, the capture of London was integral to German military occupation. Either buttressing the capital’s will to resist, or undermining its capacity to withstand attack, the vigour and vitality of London was always at issue in his novels. Drawing on contemporary fears about the capital and its dissolution, this article considers the moral panics about London and Londoners and their relationship to Britain’s martial decline reflected in his stories. Ranging across anxieties about <b>anarchist</b> and foreign <b>terrorism,</b> attuned to fears of the mob, and suspicious about wealthy spy masters at large in governmental circles, Le Queux’s fiction reflects concerns about London as a decadent ’new Rome’ in process of lengthy and agonising disintegration. Le Queux pursued a populist path in his vision of an embattled London, brought low by a decadent leadership but saved by a population purged of bankers, outsiders, immigrants, its cultural establishment, and defeatists. Analysing these themes in Le Queux’s fiction, this article exposes the vein of anxiety about the defence of London in the invasion panic genre, and raises questions about the degree to which contemporaries believed the nation might turn to the capital for its salvation in its hour of need...|$|R
40|$|From 1919 to 1920 the United States {{carried out}} a massive {{campaign}} against radicals, arresting and deporting thousands of radical immigrants {{in a matter of}} months, raiding and shutting down anarchist printing shops, and preventing anarchists from sending both periodicals and personal communications through the mail. This period is widely known as the First Red Scare, and is framed as a reaction to recent <b>anarchist</b> <b>terrorism,</b> syndicalist unionizing, and the Bolshevik Revolution. Though the 1919 - 20 First Red Scare was certainly unprecedented in its scope, it was made possible through a longer campaign against radicals, throughout which the US government constructed legal, ideological, and institutional apparatuses to combat radicalism and terrorism. This project explores the longer conflict between the US government and anarchists, focusing on the period between 1900 and 1920. It argues that the government sought to suppress radicalism not just due to <b>anarchist</b> <b>terrorism</b> or class antagonism, but also due to a broader ideology of antiradicalism that framed anarchist counterculture and connected ideas like free love and internationalism {{as a threat to the}} nation-state and to traditional American values. In trying to suppress radical counterculture years before the First Red Scare, the US government built its capacity for federal policing.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} reconsiders late-nineteenth-century American {{literary history}} by showing how American writers between 1870 and 1910 developed {{and responded to}} a distinctively literary language of conspiracy. This study provides both {{a new perspective on}} how authors responded to the deep sense of social and economic crisis following the Civil War and a clearer sense of the cultural reception of events, such as the rise of monopoly capitalism, the Haymarket Affair, and even questions surrounding the identity of William Shakespeare. For late-nineteenth-century writers and their audiences, the term “conspiracy” did not simply describe a crime, but became a vehicle through which suspicions about modernization and industrialization were channeled into exhilarating sensations of romance and mystery. A guiding ambition of this project is to develop a critical paradigm for conspiracy fiction that rigorously engages the aesthetic, affective, and cognitive pleasures of conspiracy narratives. Following a theoretical and historical introduction, four case studies reveal the influence of conspiracy thinking across diverse literary and cultural contexts. Analysis of Ignatius Donnelly’s fiction and elaborate conspiracy theories on subjects including <b>anarchist</b> <b>terrorism,</b> Shakespeare’s identity, and suspicions that British bankers had caused the Civil War, I propose that Donnelly’s writings exemplify an aesthetic and philosophical investment in conspiracy in Gilded Age populist culture. Close-readings of Henry James’ non-fiction writings on terrorism, his novel, The Princess Casamassima (1885), and “dynamite novels” elucidate James’ ambitious narrative experiment through which he found something akin to the sublime in speculation on modern terrorism. Explorations of Charles Chesnutt’s The Marrow of Tradition (1900) and The Colonel’s Dream (1904) reveal Chesnutt’s effort to use conspiracy narratives as a corrective to fraudulent histories of the Post-Civil War South {{in the context of a}} debate including W. E. B. DuBois, Albion Tourgée, and Thomas Dixon. Finally, analysis of Maria Ruiz de Burton’s The Squatter and the Don (1885) against the backdrop of “The Colton Scandal” (an incident known as “the Rosetta Stone of bought government”) reveals Ruiz de Burton’s use of conspiracy as a framework for symbolizing the social upheavals, accompanying U. S. imperialist expansion into Californi...|$|E
40|$|This chapter charts {{four decades}} of anarchist {{presence}} in London through the prisms of space and perception. Through its rich history of exile, London had {{by the end of}} the nineteenth century become a connotated space, a palimpsest. The most literate and educated anarchist exiles were certainly conscious of walking in the footsteps of illustrious refugees, as evidenced by regular references to the generations of revolutionaries who had preceded them in London. These nodded primarily to the post- 1848 waves, as journalists noted for instance that the anarchists congregated in one of the rooms of St Martin’s Hall, where the International Working Men’s Association had been set up in 1864, or inscribed themselves in the Communards’ lineage: ‘One street in the French quarter has conquered fame: it is Charlotte Street and, on this road, one house deserves the honours of history: it is that of Victor Richard, the faithful friend of Vallès and Séverine’. This historical perspective also informed the eyes of beholders, although they were more likely to stress the different character of the anarchists, and especially the discontinuity with the previous, morally noble generations of exiles and the peak of French presence in London: How many French [in London]? A lot less than one may think. One should not assume that the streets of Soho and Fitzroy have regained since the recent explosions the very special character which they had after the Commune. A few rare French shop-fronts among the shop-fronts, a few vaguely familiar figures in Charlott-Street [sic] and in Wind-mill-Street [sic] and that’s it. The importance of this historical lineage means that the London years of the French anarchists can be read both in continuity and in contrast with the preceding waves of revolutionary exile, including from the point of view of outside observers who constantly compared the anarchists with their illustrious predecessors. Their growing hostility and the polemics provoked by the anarchists’ presence – suspected as well as seen – turned London into a contested space. The novelty which this presence represented must also be stressed, in order to convey the sense of puzzlement expressed by contemporaries – and by the exiles themselves – upon seeing or even just imagining these hundreds of individuals recreating an anarchist ‘Petite France’ in the streets of Soho and Fitzrovia. Their dismay stemmed from the fear of <b>anarchist</b> <b>terrorism,</b> because of the well-established reputation of the French as dynamitards or bombistes, but also from a culture shock, as these comrades were often described as quintessentially French artisans, settling down in London in the heyday of the Victorian Age; the written testimonies left by the French in London as well as by the British observers of these groups testify to the same impression of strangeness and otherness, often conveyed by a close attention to details revealing cultural differences and idiosyncrasies. This chapter emphasises the physicality of this anarchist presence by examining different scales in turn, from the international level – why, of all places, did the anarchists settle in Britain? – to the very local, investigating anarchist public and private spaces...|$|E
40|$|The book Revolution and Reaction forms {{a chapter}} {{in the history of}} the split between Italia legale and Italia reale. The young Italian state, whose unity was {{confirmed}} with the taking of Rome in 1870, had to contend with many reactionary, revolutionary and criminal groups which threatened this unity and the monarchy. The boot, pieced together with difficulty, was constantly exposed to destructive forces. The Destra (right) government chose to manage the situation by a centralising approach: society had to comply with directives coming from the capital. The forceful implementation of liberal economic policies and strong centralist direction of the royalist political classes increased the differences between the state and the people. In this situation the state and the anarchists acted as full-blown opponents. There were reciprocal reactions and influences in this confrontation. Both presented themselves as doctors wanting to eradicate the sickness of the other party. The central question of this book is to what extent the state and the anarchists had an effect on each other. Apart from the first two chapters, in which the structure of the Italian state is addressed, this book follows the chronological development of Italian anarchism. Each chapter traces the course of affairs of the anarchist movement, the splits, the intrigues of police spies, the Government’s reactions and the attitude of the judiciary. In chapter I the reader is introduced to the political situation of Italy around 1870. The emphasis is on the unstable basis of the monarchy, the political opposition and the gap between state and people. Chapter II addresses the political classes which governed the country between 1860 and 1900 and the means that the Government had available to persecute any opposition. Following this, attention is given to the role of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the judiciary. The right to associate and to meet and the freedom of the (printed) press are closely examined because of their great importance for the functioning of anarchist groups and because they often formed the core of legal cases against anarchists. Special police powers such as the ammonizione (admonishment, personal restrictions and police supervision) and the domicilio coatto (internal deportation, forced residence) severely affected the free movement of anarchists. The use of these measures occurred without interference from the judiciary. The registration system for anarchists and subversive persons (Casellario Politico Centrale) was developed and perfected during the period in question. Later, during the fascist regime, the system was taken over and expanded to include all political opponents. Finally, the chapter analyses the network of political police and police spies. The political police and infiltrators had a major destructive impact on the anarchist movement. The anarchists could not respond to the presence of police spies among their members given that any reaction seemed to work to their disadvantage. Chapter III explores the foundation of the International Workingmen’s Association in Italy. The Naples section of the International is described in depth, since the development of this first association of internationalists clearly shows which factors defined the position and strategy of the Italian Federation of the International: Bakunin’s intellectual heritage on the organisation and actions of government. The chapter shows how the governments of the Destra followed a clear policy with regard to the internationalists. Liberal policies alternated with repression and arbitrary rule. The chapter also shows that governments did not hesitate to use force against other opposition groups such as republicans. However, the political powers required to eradicate the opposition were often blocked by the judiciary. Chapter IV describes the policies of the Sinistra (left) governments with regard to the internationalists. Following a revolutionary attempt in 1874, its repression and subsequent court cases, the internationalists changed course. They organised themselves in a sectarian party and developed a strategy of ‘propaganda of the deed’. Within the framework of these tactics, an armed group of 26 revolutionaries - the Banda del Matese - moved through the Matese mountains in 1877. This led to the complete repression of the International. The state’s response confirmed the internationalists in their strategy. Meanwhile, the government accused the internationalists of an attempt to assassinate the king and of a series of bomb explosions in 1878. These acts of terror led the government to change its attitude towards the International which, from this point on, was seen as a criminal movement. In 1879 the International ceased to exist as a national organisation. The consequences of the internationalists’ sectarian strategy and of the government’s policies are described in chapter V. The 1880 ’s were dominated by the politician Agostino Depretis. It was his policy of trasformismo that led to the political classes operating in unity. The terms Destra and Sinistra lost their meaning. In this period, the anarchist movement could only organise at a local level: there was no longer a national anarchist party or movement. The most remarkable development in the anarchist movement was the conversion of one of the anarchists’ leading figures, Andrea Costa, from anarchism to legal socialism, i. e the establishment of socialism through parliamentarian means. No longer did Costa focus on the revolution to realise socialism. Another important phenomenon was the birth of an apolitical labour party. Like the anarchist movement, this party did not believe in political instruments. At the same time, the apolitical labour party also did not adopt the strategy or the final goals of the anarchists. Most important Italian anarchists lived abroad in the 1880 s, where they started the so-called emigrant-anarchist movement (Chapter VI). The anarchist strategy in the 1880 s was laid down during the International Revolutionary Congress in London in 1881. The decisions taken during this Congress and the assassination of Tsar Alexander II ensured anarchism’s violent image. After Costa’s move towards legal socialism and Carlo Cafiero’s mental crisis, Enrico Malatesta became the anarchist movement’s uncontested leader. His brief presence in Italy led to a revival of the movement. After his forced departure in 1884, the anarchist movement again fell apart. The presence of anarchist leaders, notably Malatesta, proved to be a decisive condition for the organisation and activities of the Italian anarchist movement. Their absence gave room to an individualist and anti-organisational form of anarchism. After the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1882, the Italian government organised a European political police network. Espionage services were set up in the most important European capitals and in cities in Italy’s neighbouring countries. These espionage services dealt exclusively with anarchism. Chapter VII analyses the start, organisation and development of these police services. The police services initially lost some of their importance after the budget cuts in the 1890 s and the increasing international cooperation against anarchism, but gained strength in some European cities after the attack on King Umberto I in 1900. It was again Malatesta’s return to Europe, in 1889, that led to the revival of socialist anarchism (Chapter VIII). An important event was the Anarchist Congress in Switzerland in 1891 during which the Italian anarchist party was founded. The Congress also decided to turn the 1891 May Day celebrations into a revolutionary day. The riots that broke out in several cities on May Day resulted in increasingly strict police action. They also led to a deeper split between the socialist and individualist anarchists. The Sicilian anarchist Paolo Schicchi was one of Malatesta’s strongest opponents. Malatesta was forced to reply to Schicchi’s continuous criticisms of socialist and organisational elements of anarchism. Additionally, Malatesta had to fight against rising <b>anarchist</b> <b>terrorism</b> which was causing deaths in France especially. Chapter IX describes anarchism’s isolated position within the labour movement. This position was clearly noticeable at several international socialist congresses, during which anarchism and Marxism supported completely opposing views. The schism between the two movements became definitive after the 1896 International Congress in London. Anarchism’s separate position at national level became clear at the founding congress of the Italian socialist party in 1892, where Italian anarchists were not admitted to the decisive meeting. The economic crisis, various corruption scandals which involved the political classes, high unemployment and the necessity of budget cuts, led to an extremely tense situation in Italy in 1893 - 1894. This situation is described in chapter X. In an aggressive way, the Crispi government suppressed the revolts of the fasci (workers and peasant associations) against poverty and authority. Anarchist leaders, such as Malatesta and Francesco Saverio Merlino, tried to spread these revolts to the mainland in vain. A solidarity revolt of anarchists and republicans in the Lunigiana was easily crushed. The affected areas were placed under martial law. <b>Anarchist</b> <b>terrorism</b> in France and an attack on Prime Minister Crispi increased the fear of anarchism. In this climate, Crispi was able to introduce a series of anti-anarchist laws in July 1894, which were also used against socialists. The causes of this repression are described in depth in this chapter. Crispi’s successor Rudini was an advocate of liberal policies, but he soon became entangled in the conservative web (chapter XI). At a later stage, his policies were characterised by persecution and arbitrariness. Malatesta’s return to Italy increased the activities of the anarchists. Their protests were aimed especially against the elections and measures that limited political freedom. Soon, the anarchists joined the riots that resulted from increases in bread prices. The bread riots came to a climax in May 1898, after which they were crushed with violence. The repressive policies that followed the bread riots were aimed not only at the anarchists but at the opposition as a whole. The new Prime Minister Pelloux, who wanted to normalise the political situation in Italy, was forced, like his predecessors, to take repressive measures. In the end it was the House of Deputies that prevented Pelloux from taking a dictatorial path. It was the murder of the Empress Elisabeth of Austria in September 1898, by an Italian anarchist, that led to the Italian initiative to set up an International Anti-Anarchist Conference in Rome. The motives for this conference, its results and subsequent Russian-German initiatives are addressed in chapter XII. The ‘new’ Italy is described in the Epilogue. The fall of the Pelloux government, the anarchist assassination of King Umberto I and the formation of the Zanardelli-Giolitti cabinet marked the end of “Liberal Italy” and the beginning of “Small Italy” or “Giolittian Italy”. The socialist and catholic representatives involved the population in the administration of the country and the government took a neutral position in labour conflicts. Italy seemed to be on its way towards an effective liberal administration. However, these liberal policies were not extended to the anarchists or to anarchist strikes. Anarchists paid the price for the temporary rapprochement between social democrats and the government. The main conclusion of this book is that anarchists and state influenced each other significantly. The state affected anarchism in the following ways: strategy changes, the splintering of groups and individuals from the anarchist movement, the lack of direction in the movement due to emigration and prison sentences, the increasing feeling among individualists that any form of organisation was a restriction of freedom, and police infiltration which increased distrust among anarchists. In general it can be stated that the government’s actions led to an increased tendency among larger groups of anarchists towards more radical and isolated views.
