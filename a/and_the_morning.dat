5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in a span of two years at Mr. Dan's Studio in Buckeye, Arizona and the old town hall of Govan, Scotland. It {{has been described as}} a concept album loosely based around a night of partying <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> effects after. The album has more of a dance-oriented sound, featuring styles of dance-punk, new wave, and electropop, marking a departure from the band's post-punk sound, which was featured on their past two albums.|$|E
5|$|Disorder {{spread across}} the {{province}} as large processions ignored section 144 and condemned {{the actions of the}} police. More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, to boycott offices and join the procession. Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the Jubilee Press <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> News. Police fired on a major janaza, or mourning rally, as it was passing through Nawabpur Road. The shooting killed several people including activist Sofiur Rahman and a nine-year-old boy named Ohiullah.|$|E

5|$|Exact French {{casualties}} {{are difficult}} to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 {{are known to have}} died in the battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900men on the French ship between the morning of 14January <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of 18January. However, a French source suggests that up to another 500 of the crew were rescued from the wreck by the corvette Arrogante and the cutter Aiguille on 17 and 18 January. This would give a toll of only about 400. A menhir at Ploz√©vet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred.|$|E
5|$|Fonda {{made her}} Broadway {{debut in the}} 1960 play There Was a Little Girl, for which she {{received}} {{the first of two}} Tony Award nominations, and made her screen debut later the same year in Tall Story. She rose to fame in 1960s films such as Period of Adjustment (1962), Sunday in New York (1963), Cat Ballou (1965), Barefoot in the Park (1967) and Barbarella (1968).

5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were anxious for the {{president}} to appear to be recovering quickly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked two hours a day in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead of the Oval Office. Reagan did not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought recovery was not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the Mission Control Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit Mission Control during STS-2 that November.|$|E

5|$|With many mining {{communities}} suffering {{high levels}} of unemployment following the General Strike, some Poor Law boards granted relief to unemployed workers by misusing provisions intended for exceptional circumstances. These boards used the provisions to give benefits to nearly all applicants. With the system thrown into crisis, Chamberlain sought legislation to permit the Minister of Health to dismiss recalcitrant boards, and later got Parliament to pass further legislation to prescribe criminal penalties to members of such boards. Though no board members were prosecuted, Chamberlain dismissed three boards, replacing their members with his own appointees. Finally, in 1929, Chamberlain brought in legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely, replacing them with bodies appointed by local authorities. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons {{for two and a}} half hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded, he was applauded by all parties. The Local Government Act 1929 passed by an ample majority, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> Post commented that (despite Labour attacks), it had been found to be impossible to make it unpopular.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1940s, the Times was {{the leading}} {{newspaper}} in terms of circulation in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 1948, it launched the Los Angeles Mirror, an afternoon tabloid, to compete with both the Daily News and the merged Herald-Express. In 1954, the Mirror absorbed the Daily News. The combined paper, the Mirror-News, ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon Herald-Express <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> Los Angeles Examiner merged to become the Herald-Examiner.
