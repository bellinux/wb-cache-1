5|$|Flag-of-convenience {{registries}} are criticized, {{mostly by}} trade union organizations based in developed countries, {{especially those of}} Europe.

Seafarers from developed countries must make themselves competitive if they wish to take advantage and practice in a global environment. , thirteen flag states have been found by international shipping organizations to have substandard regulations. A basis for many criticisms is that the flag-of-convenience system allows shipowners to be legally anonymous and difficult to prosecute in civil and criminal actions. Some ships with flags of convenience have been found engaging in crime, offer substandard working conditions, <b>and</b> <b>negatively</b> impact the environment, primarily through illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. , ships of thirteen flags of convenience are targeted for special enforcement by countries that they visit. Supporters of the practice, however, point to economic and regulatory advantages, and increased freedom in choosing employees from an international labor pool.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{building}} on Wolfgang Pauli's work, Paul Dirac produced {{a model of}} the electron– the Dirac equation, consistent with relativity theory, by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field. In order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, Dirac developed in 1930 {{a model of the}} vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy, later dubbed the Dirac sea. This led him to predict the existence of a positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron. This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who proposed calling standard electrons negatrons, and using electron as a generic term to describe both the positively <b>and</b> <b>negatively</b> charged variants.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a Coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt {{as a part of the}} reaction with water. Water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface <b>and</b> <b>negatively</b> charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.|$|E
5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to dust storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust storms owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during dust storms, leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion <b>and</b> <b>negatively</b> affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E
5|$|The boron {{nitrides}} are {{notable for}} {{the variety of}} structures that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure, called cubic boron nitride (tradename Borazon), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds {{can be viewed as}} a coordinate covalent bond, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acidic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively charged boron <b>and</b> <b>negatively</b> charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{distinct}} populations of sarus cranes in South-east Asia: the northern population in China and Myanmar, {{and the southern}} population in Cambodia and Vietnam. The sarus used to extend to Thailand and further east into the Philippines, but may now be extinct in both these countries. In 2011, 24 captive bred cranes raised from five original founders were reintroduced into Thailand. In Australia they are found only in the northern parts, and are partly migratory in some areas. The global range has shrunk and the largest occupied area is now in India. With marshlands largely destroyed, these cranes are increasingly dependent on wet paddy fields in India. Although now found mainly at a low elevation on the plains, there are some historical records from highland marshes further north in Harkit Sar and Kahag in Kashmir. The sarus crane breeds in some high elevation regions such as near the Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh, where populations may be growing in response to increasing rice cultivation along the reservoir. In rice-dominated districts of Uttar Pradesh, sarus crane abundance (estimated as occupancy) was highest in the western districts, intermediate in the central districts, and minimal in the eastern districts. Sarus crane abundance was positively associated with percentage of wetlands on the landscape, <b>and</b> <b>negatively</b> with the percentage of area under rice cultivation.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relations}} among abnormal accounting accruals measures of earnings management, stock offers, post-offer stock returns, and related shareholder lawsuits. We find that accruals are abnormally high around stock offers, especially high for firms that are subsequently sued about their offers. These accruals tend to reverse after stock offers <b>and</b> are <b>negatively</b> related to post-offer stock returns. Reversals are more pronounced and stock returns are much lower for sued firms than {{for those that}} are not sued. In multivariate logistic regressions the incidence of lawsuits involving stock offers is significantly positively related to abnormal accruals around the offer <b>and</b> significantly <b>negatively</b> related to post-offer stock returns. Moreover, settlement amounts in the lawsuits are also significantly positively related to the abnormal accruals <b>and</b> significantly <b>negatively</b> related to post-offer stock returns. These results support the view that some firms opportunistically manipulate earnings upward before stock issues rendering themselves vulnerable to litigation...|$|R
