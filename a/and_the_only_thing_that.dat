When Hibiki makes a mistake, Misaki lectures her and informs her how {{a member of the}} faculty should act, even when it may not entirely be her fault. Due to Hibiki's low magical experience, Misaki worries about Hibiki succeeding {{as a member of the}} staff. Like Hibiki, Misaki cannot perform magic, though she still has a vast knowledge of magic at her disposal. She had been adopted by a man that constantly abused her <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could cheer her up was a book from a magic user. She had been saved by Asuma and hopes to be of use to him.|$|E

25|$|Official Soviet figures {{reported}} {{that up to}} one third of urban and two thirds of rural population still held religious beliefs by 1937 (a decrease from estimated 80% of the country being religious in the late 1920s); altogether this made up 50% of the state's population (and even these figures may have been low estimates). However, religion had been hit very powerfully; the number of churches had been reduced from 50,000 in 1917 to {{only a few hundred}} (and {{there was not a single}} church open in Belarus) or perhaps even less, out of 300 bishops in 1917 (and 163 in 1929) only 4 remained (Metropolitan Sergii (the head of the church), Metropolitan Alexii of Leningrad, Bishop Nikolai (Yarushevich), and Metropolitan Sergi (Voskresenski)), out of 45,000 priests there were only to 2,000–3,000 remaining, not a single monastery remained open <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> enthusiasts of atheism could still do was to spy on individual believers and denounce them to the secret police.|$|E

A year later, upon his move to England, Van der Vaart stated, [...] "She had a very serious illness {{and it is true}} that she had to be treated at the Clinica Quiron. Last season, they wanted me to leave but I couldn't leave for that reason.

2500|$|The {{disintegration}} {{that took}} hold ... was an easily diagnosed malady which has afflicted every Australian {{rock and roll}} band that has ever achieved a degree of popular success. Essentially it comes down to: the bigger you become, the more meaningless your future. Overseas bands can make an album, do a tour and then hide away {{for a year or}} two to prepare the next LP with no concern for loss of position. In Australia, just three months off the road to prepare new material and a band's gig price drops to half, the media erects new superstars in their place, and the public acts as if they never were ... That is what killed the La De Das: the bludgeoning effect of realising that, after 10 hard years, nothing tangible had really been achieved <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> lay ahead was more of the same.|$|E
2500|$|Not all reviews {{were entirely}} positive. Jeffrey Canino of Tiny Mix Tapes criticized the {{introductory}} rap {{section of the}} song, [...] " [...] brings forth an unpleasant memory of Fred Durst. All throughout, the band is experimenting with disparaging sounds, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> ties them together is Rick Rubin and Jacknife Lee's glossy production." [...] Despite this, Canino still rates the song highly, [...] "The bulk of the middle portion is really pretty okay, so we'll concede this one as a success." [...] Similarly, Ira Robbins and Pete Crigler of TrouserPress.com said, [...] "Despite that success, rap is not an advisable direction for Weezer." [...] Alan Shulman of No Ripcord commented that the song {{did not have much}} lasting appeal: [...] "The novelty begins to wear after the 4th or 5th listen," [...] and Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly labelled the song a [...] "Bombastic mini-rock opera" [...] but also said the [...] "remedial rhymes" [...] marred an [...] "otherwise intriguing musical experiment." ...|$|E

[...] At a rally on 28 May, he announced his intention to kill the entire Serb population {{over the age of}} 15 in the Bosanska Krajina and was quoted saying: [...] "These Serbian Gypsies will be sent to Serbia, part by trains and part through the Sava River — without boats.

2500|$|After their mother's {{death in}} a {{suspicious}} fire that burns down their house 22 years prior, Sam and Dean Winchester's father goes missing during a [...] "hunting trip". As a result, Dean tracks down Sam at Stanford University. The two brothers live a life on the road, in Dean's black, 1967 Chevrolet Impala with Kansas license plates. However, their father is not a typical hunter: he hunts supernatural creatures like ghosts, vampires, and spirits, and has trained his sons to do the same. Along the way, Sam and Dean save innocent people, fight creatures and ghosts, and collect clues to their father's whereabouts. Sam begins to mysteriously develop psychic abilities and visions as they travel. They also find another man with abilities similar to Sam's, whose mother died the same way. They {{reach out to the}} young man, Max Miller, offering help and seeking answers. But Max has experienced years of physical abuse and neglect and his life ends in a murder suicide which Dean and Sam are unable to stop. They eventually find and reunite with their father, who reveals that the creature that killed their mother years earlier is the demon Azazel (aka [...] "Yellow Eyes") <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can kill him is a legendary gun created by Samuel Colt. It is revealed that Azazel, on a baby's six-month birthday, would bleed into their mouth and kill the moms when they walk in. This is what gave Sam and Max their powers. The season ends with the brothers and their father involved in a car crash when a truck hits the side of the Impala. They lie inside the car, covered in blood and unconscious.|$|E
2500|$|Spears {{talked about}} her {{feelings}} toward the conservatorship her father contains and how she feels about her life, and quotes [...] "There's no excitement, there's no passion... I have really good days, and then I have bad days. Even {{when you go to}} jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day." [...] Spears added [...] "I think it's too in control, If I wasn't under the restraints I'm under, I'd feel so liberated. When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted to become one of those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People think that when you go through something in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way. [...] "Sometimes you don't need to use words to go through what you need to go through," [...] she continues. [...] "Sometimes it's an emotion you need to feel when you dance, that you need to touch. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can touch it is when you move a certain way." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the introduction, {{the poet}} {{establishes}} the setting using conventional astrological and geographical references which place the poem within the traditional {{framework of a}} dream poem and introduces the dreamer who sits “all solytary alone besyde a lake,/ Musyng on a maner how that I myght make/ Reason & Sensualyte in oon to acorde” (1). [...] But, before he can think through his puzzle he is overcome by sleep. [...] Morpheus comes and escorts him {{to the court of}} Minos which is being held at the estate of Pluto. [...] There the dreamer watches as Diana and Neptune accuse Aeolus of flouting their authority and discrediting them in the eyes of their worshippers. [...] Before the trial can be concluded a messenger comes from Apollo, asking Minos to hold off on the judgement and inviting all the gods to his palace for a banquet. [...] In Apollo’s palace, Diana’s complaint is resolved and the dreamer describes each of the gods and goddesses as they sit down to eat. [...] The gods won’t allow Discord into their feast, but as she is leaving she meets with Atropos and sends him to stir things up. [...] Atropos goes to the gods and complains that while the gods claim to have given him power to bring death to any who disobeyed or despised them, there is one person who has escaped his power. [...] He threatens to leave their employ if they don’t make good on their promise to him and give him power over this person. [...] All the gods agree that they will bring down this one who defies Atropos. [...] They quickly resolve the dispute between Neptune and Aeolus to ensure that the offender {{will not be able to}} escape in the sea or air and then ask who it is that has defied them. [...] When Atropos tells them that it is Virtue, Pluto says he knows him well <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can harm Virtue is Vice, Pluto’s bastard son. [...] Vice is called for, and he assembles his host for battle. [...] Morpheus warns Virtue of the impending battle and Virtue prepares his host and heads to the field of Microcosm, hoping to arrive before Vice and thus have the advantage. [...] The descriptions of the assembly of these armies are made up long lists of characters representing various vices and virtues and types of people under the influence of Vice and Virtue.|$|E
