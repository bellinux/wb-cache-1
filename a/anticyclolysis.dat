5000|$|Anticyclogenesis is the {{development}} or strengthening of anticyclonic circulation in the atmosphere. It {{is the opposite of}} <b>anticyclolysis,</b> and has a cyclonic equivalentâ€”cyclogenesis. [...] Anticyclones are alternatively referred to as high pressure systems. High pressure areas form due to downward motion through the troposphere, the atmospheric layer where weather occurs. Preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughs. On weather maps, these areas show converging winds (isotachs), also known as confluence, or converging height lines near or above the level of non-divergence, which is near the 500 hPa pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere. [...] On weather maps, high pressure centers are associated with the letter H. [...] On constant pressure upper level charts, it is located within the highest height line contour.|$|E
