Among different horizons of soil, the organic horizon (O) is the area of accumulation of <b>animal</b> <b>residues</b> (low carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio) and recognizable plant material (high C/N ratio) (House et al. 1984). Microorganisms use the amino acids and sugar that are exuded by the plant roots, as a food source (Curl and Truelove 1986). Swift et al. (1979) described that macro- and mesofauna contribute to ecosystem processes such as decomposition of plant residues (Badejo et al. 1995; Gobat et al. 2010) and nutrient cycling in complex and interactive ways. Approximately 30% of nitrogen mineralization is contributed by soil fauna in agriculture and natural ecosystem (Elliott et al. 1988).|$|E

50|$|Denitrification is a microbially {{facilitated}} {{process where}} nitrate is reduced and ultimately produces molecular nitrogen (N2) {{through a series}} of intermediate gaseous nitrogen oxide products. Facultative anaerobic bacteria perform denitrification as a type of respiration that reduces oxidized forms of nitrogen in response to the oxidation of an electron donor such as organic matter. The preferred nitrogen electron acceptors in order of most to least thermodynamically favorable include nitrate (NO3−), nitrite (NO2−), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) finally resulting in the production of dinitrogen (N2) completing the nitrogen cycle. Denitrifying microbes require a very low oxygen concentration of less than 10%, as well as organic C for energy. Since denitrification can remove NO3−, reducing its leaching to groundwater, it can be strategically used to treat sewage or <b>animal</b> <b>residues</b> of high nitrogen content. Denitrification can leak N2O, which is an ozone-depleting substance and a greenhouse gas that can have a considerable influence on global warming.|$|E
5000|$|This layer {{generally}} forms {{above the}} mineral soil or occurs in an organic soil profile. The [...] "O" [...] stands for organic matter.

The O horizon is generally absent in grassland regions. The O horizon usually occurs in forested areas and is commonly referred to as the forest floor. The O horizon should be considered distinct from the layer of leaf litter covering many heavily vegetated areas, which contains no weathered mineral particles and {{is not part of the}} soil itself. O horizons may be divided into O1 and O2 categories, whereby O1 horizons contain decomposed matter whose origin can be spotted on sight (for instance, fragments of rotting leaves), and O2 horizons contain only well-decomposed organic matter, the origin of which is not readily visible. O horizons may also be divided into three subordinate O horizons denoted as: Oi, Oe, and Oa.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the variations in trophic relationships among species of blue crabs, which may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms that enable closely related species to exploit the same trophic niche. Callinectes sapidus, C. rathbunae, and C. similis from Tamiahua Lagoon, Mexico, were used in the present study to investigate this question. A total of 4, 038 crab-gut contents were analyzed. Of these 1, 350 belonged to C sapidus, 1, 128 to C rathbunae, and 1, 560 to C similis. Six groups of food items were identified: plant fragments (Halodule spp.), micromolluscs (Mulinia lateralis and Macoma atenta, crustaceans (Penaeus spp. and Callinectes spp.), <b>animal</b> <b>residues,</b> and sand and mud. A seasonal variation in prey composition was observed, as well as differences among ages of the three species. In general, as the size class increased, plant matter, sediment, and <b>animal</b> <b>residues</b> decreased, and micromolluscs and crustaceans increased. A clear overlap was detected for C sapidus-C. rathbunae of their trophic niches, with a maximum overlap in winter when both species ate practically the same type of food. The same pattern was observed also for C sapidus-C. similis. Callinectes similis-C rathbunae show overlap in spring and winter, when ovigerous females are on their breeding grounds.

30|$|HS can {{be defined}} as {{ubiquitous}} natural compounds arising from the chemical and biological degradations of plant and <b>animal</b> <b>residues</b> [23]. A general consensus regards HS as supramolecular associations of heterogeneous and relatively small molecules, which are held together in only apparently large molecular sizes by weak forces, such as hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds [24], and whose conformations can be disrupted by the action of weak organic acids [25]. Based on their solubility in aqueous solutions as a function of pH, HS can be divided into three fractions: humic acids (HA) is the fraction that is soluble under alkaline pH conditions, fulvic acids (FA) is the fraction soluble in water at all pH values, and humin is the insoluble fraction.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFat trap grease is a cheap {{source for}} {{biodiesel}} production, but until now its transformation into biofuel {{is not well}} studied. The effects {{of the use of}} biodiesel from degraded raw material on combustion in engines are not discussed by researchers. In this paper, engine tests were performed on biodiesel produced from AFR (<b>animal</b> fat <b>residues)</b> collected from fat traps. This fuel presents differences in chemical composition and on physical properties as compared to standard biodiesel produced from vegetable oils. Tests were performed on a single cylinder, air cooled, direct injection diesel engine at 1500 rpm, performance and pollutant emissions were measured and the combustion parameters were analyzed. The use of AFRBD in the engine resulted in similar performance with slight brake thermal efficiency decrease at low loads and a slight increase at high loads. A decrease of 9 % of power output at 1500 rpm was also detected. As per pollutant emissions, a drastic reduction of unburned hydrocarbons between 32 % and 45 % was obtained with AFRBD (<b>animal</b> fat <b>residue</b> biodiesel). Particulate matter emissions were also reduced at low and medium load ranges, but no differences were detected at high loads. Nitric oxides emissions were also measured and slight increase was detected at low loads and a slight reduction was noticed at full engine load. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The grant focuses on the Changing World Technologies (CWT) of West Hempstead, NY, thermal conversion process (TCP), which converts <b>animal</b> <b>residues</b> and industrial food processing biproducts into fuels, and as an additional product, fertilizers. A commercial plant was designed and built by CWT, partially using grant funds, in Carthage, Missouri, to process <b>animal</b> <b>residues</b> from a nearby turkey processing plant. The DOE sponsored program consisted of four tasks. These were: Task 1 Optimization of the CWT Plant in Carthage - This task focused on advancing and optimizing the process plant operated by CWT that converts organic waste to fuel and energy. Task 2 Characterize and Validate Fuels Produced by CWT - This task focused on testing of bio-derived hydrocarbon fuels from the Carthage plant in power generating equipment to determine the regulatory compliance of emissions and overall performance of the fuel. Task 3 Characterize Mixed Waste Streams - This task focused on studies performed at Princeton University to better characterize mixed waste incoming streams from animal and vegetable residues. Task 4 Fundamental Research in Waste Processing Technologies - This task focused on studies performed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on the chemical reformation reaction of agricultural biomass compounds in a hydrothermal medium.
