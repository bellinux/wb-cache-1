5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch.

5|$|Although certain {{levels of}} {{antioxidant}} vitamins {{in the diet}} are required for good health, there is considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity. Moreover, if they are actually beneficial, it is unknown which antioxidant(s) <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> from the diet and in what amounts beyond typical dietary intake. Some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases, while others maintain such a possibility is unproved and misguided from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Baclofen, a GABAB {{receptor}} agonist, {{is under}} {{study for the}} treatment of alcoholism. A 2015 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of baclofen for withdrawal symptoms in alcoholism.

5|$|Biochemistry {{laboratories}} {{often use}} {{in vitro studies}} to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions. ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.|$|E
5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} is reversible in {{the early}} stages by use of break periods on lower pressures of oxygen, but it may eventually result in irreversible lung injury if allowed to progress to severe damage. One or two days of exposure without oxygen breaks <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to cause such damage.|$|E
5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this <b>are</b> <b>needed.</b> For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E

5|$|Experimental robots {{have had}} the same inspiration, in {{particular}} when heavy loads <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to be carried in tight areas involving turns and curves.

5|$|In mathematics, {{constructions of}} {{mathematical}} objects <b>are</b> <b>needed,</b> {{which is also}} the case for stochastic processes, to prove that they exist mathematically. There are two main approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves considering a measurable space of functions, defining a suitable measurable mapping from a probability space to this measurable space of functions, and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.|$|E
5|$|Normally, {{an ocean}} {{temperature}} of 26.5Â°C (79.7Â°F) spanning {{through at least}} a 50-metre depth is considered the minimum to maintain a tropical cyclone.

50|$|Working mostly separately, Lynen and Bloch both {{discovered}} {{the steps that}} created squalene and turned the squalene into cholesterol.
