5|$|New York-based {{producer}} Bobby Geisler first approached Malick in 1978 {{and asked}} him to direct a film adaptation of David Rabe's play In the Boom Boom Room. Malick declined the offer, but instead discussed the idea of a film about the life of Joseph Merrick. Once word got out <b>about</b> <b>David</b> Lynch's film of The Elephant Man, he shelved the idea. In 1988, Geisler and John Roberdeau met with Malick in Paris about writing and directing a movie based on D. M. Thomas' 1981 novel The White Hotel. Malick declined, but told them that he would be willing instead to write either an adaptation of Molière's Tartuffe, or of James Jones' The Thin Red Line. The producers chose the latter and paid Malick $250,000 to write a screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Another wealthy family, the Eccles, {{commissioned}} Arrington {{to write}} a biography of David Eccles, a millionaire who helped form the industrial economy in Utah. David Eccles was a polygamist, and the descendants of his two wives, Bertha Jensen in Ogden and Ellen Stoddard in Logan, did not agree about how the biography should be written. Nora Harrison from the Logan {{part of the family}} originally commissioned the biography, but did not own enough material for the necessary research. Cleone Eccles, David's daughter-in-law from the Ogden side of the family, wanted a biography that focused on only positive things <b>about</b> <b>David</b> Eccles, while Harrison wanted a professional, scholarly work. In order to access Cleone Eccles's collection of David Eccles's manuscripts, Harrison agreed to give Cleone the right to make alterations to the text. Arrington employed JoAnn Bair to do the research and first drafts of the work. Harrison was unhappy with the manuscript and paid their neighbor and writer Wallace Stegner to critique the manuscript; his 15-page guidelines advised the writer to engage the reader through cliffhangers, flashbacks, and speculation. Stegner also found the manuscript too gentle on David Eccles's fraudulent business dealings. To appease Harrison, Arrington had Maureen Ursenbach Beecher improve the manuscript's literary style, but the final biography still lacked real criticism of Eccles's business practices.|$|E

25|$|Many reports erroneously {{stated that}} Borel's room {{was full of}} Nazi-insignia, and rumors he was sympathizing with fascist {{ideologies}} were spurred even more {{by the fact that}} his stepfather had attended several meetings of the Front National in 1989. But besides a picture of Adolf Hitler cut out from a newspaper, graffiti displaying a swastika on his door, a few books on World War II, as well as a documentary <b>about</b> <b>David</b> Koresh and the Waco siege, no evidence was found after his death that he was interested in any kind of politics. Also, a girl from Cuers spread the story that Eric had told her about his relationship with his half-sister Caroline, {{who was supposed to be}} his pregnant girlfriend. However, the sister in question did not exist, nor was it true that his father had died of cancer shortly before his rampage.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, while {{appearing}} in The Rover at the Salisbury Playhouse, Bathurst got an audition for the Granada Television comedy pilot Cold Feet. He arrived for the audition [...] "bearded and shaggy", {{on account of}} his role in the play and did not expect to win the role of upper-middle class management consultant David Marsden. The role in the pilot was only minor and created at the last minute to support characters played by James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale; the only character note in the script <b>about</b> <b>David</b> related to his high salary.

500|$|Yorke wrote [...] "Harrowdown Hill" [...] <b>about</b> <b>David</b> Kelly, a {{whistleblower}} {{who allegedly}} committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified {{weapons of mass}} destruction in Iraq. Kelly's body was found in the Harrowdown Hill woods near Yorke's former school in Oxfordshire. According to the Globe and Mail, the song resembles a love song with a sense of [...] "menace" [...] and [...] "grim political showdown". Yorke was uncomfortable about the subject matter and conscious of Kelly's grieving family, but felt that [...] "not to write it would perhaps have been worse." [...] In an interview with the Observer, he said it was [...] "the most angry song" [...] he had ever written.|$|E

[...] Critic Richard Freeman found Barbara Hershey's character [...] "moronic", and referred to the film as [...] "twaddle." [...] Freeman said it was [...] "fraught with symbolism. Or maybe it is just fraught". He further said of the film, [...] "Actually, it's <b>about</b> <b>David</b> Carradine, of whom the less said the better". The Kokomo Tribune called the story [...] "pointless". When Carradine read the reviews, {{he went back to}} the hotel bathroom and threw up.

500|$|After {{expanding}} the dairy herd in May 2004, David and Ruth hired specialist herdsman Sam Batton (Robin Pirongs). Ruth frequently {{came into contact}} with Sam around the farm and he confided in Ruth about his relationship with Kirsty Miller (Annabelle Dowler). Ruth found herself becoming jealous when Sam went on holiday with Kirsty. In their book, The Archers Archives, Simon Frith and Chris Arnot commented that the [...] "simmering mix of sexual chemistry" [...] between Ruth and Sam reached boiling point when David's ex-girlfriend, Sophie Barlow, returned to Ambridge and asked David to help organise a charity fashion show. Ruth became stressed and insecure <b>about</b> <b>David</b> spending time with his ex-girlfriend and she turned to Sam. The main reason for Ruth's insecurity was her image, as she had recently undergone a mastectomy and felt [...] "dowdy" [...] next to Sophie. Ruth became emotionally confused when Sam informed her that he had broken up with Kirsty. She then caught David lying about meeting up with Sophie and believed he was having an affair. Unbeknownst to Ruth, Sophie had tried to entice David into an affair, but he resisted her advances.|$|E
