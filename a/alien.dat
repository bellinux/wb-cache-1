Autopsies reveal that all these types have been genetically and/or cybernetically altered, which seems to indicate they are merely foot-soldiers for unseen leaders. XCOM's head of research, Dr. Vahlen, requests that a live <b>alien</b> be captured for interrogation.

5|$|<b>Alien</b> {{has been}} {{released}} in many home video formats and packages over the years. The first of these was a seventeen-minute Super-8 version for home projectionists. It was also released on both VHS and Betamax for rental, which grossed it an additional $40,300,000 in the United States alone. Several VHS releases were subsequently issued both separately and as boxed sets. LaserDisc and Videodisc versions followed, including deleted scenes and director commentary as bonus features. A VHS box set containing <b>Alien</b> and its sequels Aliens and <b>Alien</b> 3 was released in facehugger-shaped boxes, and included some of the deleted scenes from the Laserdisc editions. When <b>Alien</b> Resurrection premiered in theaters, another set {{of the first three}} films was released including a Making of <b>Alien</b> Resurrection tape. A few months later the set was re-released with the full version of <b>Alien</b> Resurrection taking the place of the making-of video. <b>Alien</b> was released on DVD in 1999, both separately and, as The <b>Alien</b> Legacy, packaged with Aliens, <b>Alien</b> 3 and <b>Alien</b> Resurrection. This set, which was also released in a VHS version, included a commentary track by Ridley Scott. The first three films of the series have also been packaged as the <b>Alien</b> Triple Pack.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single <b>alien</b> creature that pursues the player. The <b>alien</b> creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the <b>alien</b> has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the <b>alien</b> finding the player. For example, if the <b>alien</b> is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the <b>alien,</b> forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the <b>alien</b> creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E

This was followed by the release of Test Tube Aliens: Pure Evil, with 6 Pure Evil <b>aliens.</b>|$|R

5|$|For {{the scene}} of the Prometheus descent to the <b>alien</b> moon LV-223, visual effects art {{director}} Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor Richard Stammers and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes {{to have a sense of}} grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in <b>Alien.</b> Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in <b>Alien,</b> but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain Olympus Mons and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of <b>alien</b> worlds which were incorporated into the design work. MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the <b>alien</b> pyramid and a landing area for the Prometheus, and resized the planet's natural features relative to the <b>alien</b> structures.|$|E
