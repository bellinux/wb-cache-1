Their endogenous function within an animal is unknown, but may involve regulating energy expenditure. However, as secreted proteins they play multiple roles in chemical communication between animals, functioning as pheromone transporters and stabilizers in rodents and pigs. Mups can also act as protein pheromones themselves. They have been demonstrated to promote aggression in male mice, and one specific Mup protein found in male mouse urine is sexually attractive to female mice. Mups can also function as signals between different species: mice display an instinctive fear response on the detection of Mups derived from predators such as cats and rats.|$|R

40|$|Very {{few studies}} have {{described}} MUP- 1 concentrations and measured prevalence of Laboratory <b>Animal</b> <b>Allergy</b> (LAA) at such a diverse institution as the private medical school (MS) that {{is the focus of}} this study. Air sampling was performed in three dissimilar animal research facilities at MS and quantitated using a commercially available ELISA. Descriptive data was obtained from an anonymous laboratory <b>animal</b> <b>allergy</b> survey given to both animal facility employees and the researchers who utilize these facilities alike. Logistic regression analysis was then implemented to investigate specific factors that may be predictive of developing LAA as well as factors influencing the reporting of LAA symptoms to the occupational health program. Concentrations of MUP- 1 detected ranged from below detectable levels (BDL) to a peak of 22. 64 ng/m 3. Overall, 68 employees with symptoms claimed they improved while away from work and only 25 employees reported their symptoms to occupational health. Being Vietnamese, a smoker, not wearing a mask, and working in any facility longer than one year were all significant predictors of having LAA symptoms. This study suggests a LAA monitoring system that relies on self-reporting can be inadequate in estimating LAA problems.

40|$|Background:Less than 10 %of {{pancreatic}} cancer cases survive 5 years, yet its etiology is notwell understood. Studies suggest allergies {{are associated with}} reduced {{pancreatic cancer}} risk. Our study collected additional information on allergies (including skin prick test results and differentiation of allergic/nonallergic asthma), and {{is the first to}} assess possible confounding by allergy medications. Methods: A population-based case–control study was designed to comprehensively assess the association between allergy and pancreatic cancer risk. Pancreas cancer cases were diagnosed during 2011 to 2012, and identified through the Ontario Cancer Registry (345 cases). Population-based controls were identified using random digit dialing and age/sex frequency matched to cases (1, 285 controls). Questionnaires collected lifetime allergy history (type of allergy, age at onset, skin prick testing results), allergy medications, and established pancreas cancer risk factors. Logistic regression was used to estimate odd ratios and test potential confounders, including allergy medications. Results: Hay fever was associated with a significant reduction in pancreatic cancer risk [AOR 0. 68; 95 % confidence intervals (CI), 0. 52 – 0. 89], and reductionwas greatest for thosewhose skin prick testwas positive for hay fever allergens. No particular patterns were observed as regards age at onset and duration of allergy. Positive dust/mold allergy skin prick test and <b>animal</b> <b>allergies</b> were associated with a statistically significant reduced pancreatic cancer risk; AOR 0. 49; 95 %CI, 0. 31 – 0. 78 andAOR 0. 68; 95 %CI, 0. 46 – 0. 99, respectively.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the use of animals in social work from the {{perspective}} of social workers. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine social workers’ experiences of animal assisted social work and how social workers view the integration of animals in various fields of social work. The research is based on a qualitative method and four semi-structured interviews were conducted with social workers. The theories incorporated in the study are Attachment Theory and Sense of Coherence (SOC). The following results are presented: Social workers are considered to have a more comprehensive understanding of clients compared to their associates who do not hold a degree in Social Work. The Social Work Programme prepares you for work in various roles in numerous work places and the social workers claim to sympathise with the many aspects which affect clients. Some of the positive aspects of incorporating animals in social work include opportunities to experience the outdoors and exercise when spending time with the animals but also the additional satisfaction of being able to offer clients these benefits. The social workers are aware of potential safety risks in handling and associating with the animals and these safety risks appear to have a negative impact on animal assisted social work. According to the social workers, <b>animal</b> <b>allergies</b> can be minimized and should not be the focal point.

Because pigs do not sweat (the often used term [...] "I'm sweating like a pig" [...] is a misnomer since pigs only sweat a small amount from their snouts), they shed to help keep cool in the warmer summer months. This can often be a hassle as they can shed a large amount of long, stiff hair that can pierce through the skin if stepped on or embedded in clothing. It is common for the pig to gain bald spots or be mostly bald through summer and fall, and most of the hair will grow back. Though the main assumption about pigs is that they are very dirty animals, in fact, they will usually only get muddy or dirty when provided with a much needed outside area to gain vitamin D from sun/rooting soil and grass for a diet, and use the mud as a sunscreen or cooling agent to keep their body temperature regulated. Wallowing, as it is referred to, is when a pig will root up a certain area of dirt and roll around in the mud to get a layer of mud on their skin to protect against the sun and as a bug repellent.|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands {{there are}} 30, 7 million {{companion}} animals. A {{part of this}} consists of dogs and cats, {{the rest of it}} are exotic animals. From a brief research from the sector itself, it is known that on a yearly basis many pets are handed over or are left behind at petting zoos. However, a systematic research has never done before. The purpose of this research is to make an inventory of the species and numbers of exotic animals that are handed over or are left behind at petting zoos in the Netherlands, the reasons for relinquishment and to make an inventory of the health and welfare condition of the animals. Finally there has been investigated what happens to the animals after the arrival on the petting zoo. For this research a digital survey was used, this survey was sent to 421 petting zoos in the Netherlands. Seven petting zoos were also interviewed. 175 petting zoos filled in the digital survey, this is a response percentage of 41, 6 %. At 92 % of the responding petting zoos exotic animals are being offered of relinquished. In 61 % of the cases the owners ask permission before giving an animal to the petting zoo, in 38 % of the cases the animals are left behind. On a yearly basis 9. 277 animals are offered to the 175 responding petting zoos which are not accepted and 12. 422 mammals, 6. 575 birds, 149 fish, 274 reptiles and 36 amphibians are presented and accepted or relinquished at petting zoos. 80, 9 % of the petting zoos notice seasonal differences either in species or number of animals that are offered or relinquished at petting zoos. Especially in summer more animals were presented to petting zoos. This are mostly rabbits (mentioned by 83, 7 % of the petting zoos) and guinea pigs (mentioned by 52, 7 % of the respondents). Reasons given by the owner for surrendering an <b>animal</b> were: an <b>allergy</b> of the owner or family members (37 % of the cases), loss of interest (14 %) and shortage of time (13 %). 32, 5 % of the responding petting zoos also state that there are species differences in reasons for surrender. Chickens were more often given away because they cause inconvenience or there is a surplus of (male) animals. Rabbits and guinea pigs are mainly given away because of a loss of interest in the <b>animal,</b> <b>allergies</b> and shortage of time. Rabbits are also relinquished because of behaviour problems (aggression). Most of all these animals (46 %) are adults. In response to the question about what percentage of the presented and relinquished animals have health or behaviour problems, the majority of the respondents state that 0 - 5 % of the animals have these problems. However, higher percentages are also mentioned for mammals and birds (more than 5 % is mentioned in 55 % of the cases for mammals and 22 % for birds). When asked for a further specification of health and behaviour problems the following items were mentioned: aggression (rabbits), skin disorders (guinea pigs with scabies), dental problems, overweight, long nails and diarrhoea are mentioned for mammals. For birds parasites, aggression, diarrhoea and feather picking are mentioned. The majority of petting zoos also mentioned that 0 - 10 % of the animals show signs of neglect, however for mammals higher percentages were also mentioned. Most respondents mention that 0 - 5 % of the animals die within a few days after arrival on the petting zoo. In most cases animals die because they were already in a poor condition. 57, 5 % of the petting zoos places an animal in quarantine after arrival. In the long term animals are being kept in the petting zoo, alternatively, the petting zoo finds new owners for the animal, the animals go to a pet shelter or to an animal trader. The average time an animal stays at the petting zoo, varies (from one day until the animal dies). From the interviews and the results of the survey it appeared that petting zoos suspect that animals are bought in an impulse and that the knowledge level of consumers of the natural behaviour and the needs of an animal is insufficient.

As far as the bovine tuberculosis is concerned, the combination of skin tuberculin and blood gamma interferon test is recommended. Sequential genome (Mtb) analysis has given the basis for further research of the new vaccines. Key words: Tuberculosis, pathogenesis, immunity</p...|$|R
40|$|Bifidobacterium breve, a probiotic, has {{beneficial}} effects on both allergy and autoimmunity - an immune reaction against the body's own constituents -in experimental animals. Probiotics are called 'friendly bacteria' in advertisements, in which manufacturers claim their {{beneficial effects}} on gut flora, resistance and allergies. However, {{most of the}} claimed effects have not been scientifically proven in human trials. Effects of probiotics {{are known to be}} dependent on the strain of probiotics used. Previously performed research has demonstrated that Lactobacillus casei Shirota moderately stimulates both allergy and autoimmunity in experimental animals, implying that intake of probiotics, depending on the strain used, can be a hazard. This report describes the effects of the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve on <b>allergy</b> and autoimmunity. <b>Animal</b> models for <b>allergy</b> and autoimmunity were used for this investigation. Administration of Bifidobacterium breve alleviated both allergic and autoimmune responses. Bifidobacterium breve has a positive effect on the immune system, in contrast to Lactobacillus casei Shirota. Effects of probiotics on the immune system are clearly strain-dependent. Trials in humans are necessary to be able to extrapolate these data to application in the human body. These studies should therefore focus on both efficacy and safety of probiotics in humans...|$|R
40|$|Scope: In most <b>animal</b> {{models of}} <b>allergy,</b> the {{development}} of an IgE response requires the use of an adjuvant. Germ-free (GF) mice exhibit Th 2 -polarized antibody responses combined with defective immunosuppressive mechanisms. The sensitizing potential of milk proteins was investigated in GF mice in the absence of adjuvant. [br/] Methods and results: beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and whole casein (CAS) allergenicity was evaluated by means of intraperitoneal injections without adjuvant. Injections of BLG induced significant IgE and IgG 1 responses in GF mice, while CAS injections provoked the production of IgG 1 toward kappa- and alpha S 1 -caseins. No significant antibody response was evidenced in conventional (CV) mice. After in vitro BLG-reactivation, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 13 and IFN-gamma productions by splenocytes were higher in GF mice than in CV mice. Heat-treatment decreased BLG allergenicity as indicated by the absence of IgE production in GF mice. However, heat-treatment increased protein immunogenicity and led to the production of anti-BLG and anti-kappa-casein IgG 1 in both GF and CV mice. This correlated with enhanced productions of IL- 4, IL- 5 and IL- 13 in BLG-reactivated splenocytes from CV mice. [br/] Conclusion: Gut colonization by commensal bacteria appeared then to significantly reduce the susceptibility of mice toward the intrinsic allergenic and immunogenic potential of milk proteins...|$|R
