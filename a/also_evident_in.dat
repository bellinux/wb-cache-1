5|$|Biblical Hebrew from {{after the}} Babylonian exile in 587BCE {{is known as}} 'Late Biblical Hebrew'. Late Biblical Hebrew shows Aramaic {{influence}} in phonology, morphology, and lexicon, and this trend is <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the later-developed Tiberian vocalization system.|$|E
5|$|The Southeast Asian {{cultural}} {{influence is}} <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> Malagasy cuisine, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied {{by one of}} a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes. African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. Cattle rustling, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.|$|E
5|$|The {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} fields around the lake are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which {{date back to the}} most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Mature oak (Quercus) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and chestnuts (Castanea sativa). Many elm (Ulmus) trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the surrounding landscape.|$|E
25|$|With {{the influx}} of {{migrants}} from Mindanao, {{the practice of the}} Islamic faith has <b>also</b> become <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> some areas of the province.|$|R
50|$|Geologically, Eastern California {{is mostly}} {{part of the}} Basin and Range Province, marked by crustal extension, with horsts and grabens. Volcanism is <b>also</b> very <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> this region.|$|R
50|$|This mix {{of people}} has <b>also</b> become <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the range of {{restaurants}} which Middletown now has, and which is quickly {{becoming one of the}} most well-known aspects of the city.|$|R
5|$|The {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} fields of the valley are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which {{date back to the}} most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Hedgerows support the nationally rare bithynian vetch (Vicia bithynica). Mature oak (Quercus) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and chestnuts (Castanea sativa). Elm (Ulmus) trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the surrounding landscape.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{essentially}} {{established the}} historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance. Her Regencies {{were inspired by}} Jane Austen, but unlike Austen, who wrote about and for the times in which she lived, Heyer was forced to include copious information about the period so that her readers would understand the setting. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer's greatest asset. Her meticulous nature was <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> her historical novels; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror's crossing into England for her novel The Conqueror.|$|E
5|$|Reid {{occupied}} high-ranking cabinet {{positions in}} Greenfield's government {{and that of}} his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of eugenics through the sterilisation of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the seed}} of the {{background}} Asimov would create for his next novel, The Caves of Steel, a background that would <b>also</b> be <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the later Lucky Starr novels.|$|R
30|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> that <b>in</b> {{terms of}} {{financing}} this ratio is even higher, {{as the more}} favourably financed neurological cases {{are more likely to}} be handled under other professional codes (see Tables  3, 4).|$|R
50|$|Chinese {{cultural}} {{influence is}} <b>also</b> <b>evident,</b> especially <b>in</b> {{the case of}} ancestral worship. Religious objects used for conducting rituals were also used by the Chinese. The Chitty are also influenced by the Chinese to some extent in their ceramics works of art.|$|R
5|$|Relics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today; the Charminar—commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah—has come to symbolise Hyderabad. Golconda fort {{is another}} major landmark. The {{influence}} of Mughlai culture is <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the region's distinctive cuisine, which includes Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi haleem. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad {{as a cultural}} hub, attracting men of letters {{from different parts of}} the world. Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city {{from the rest of the}} Indian subcontinent. The Telugu film industry based in the city is the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures.|$|E
5|$|Romantic {{thinking}} was <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> {{the writings of}} Hugh Miller, stonemason and geologist, who followed {{in the tradition of}} Naturphilosophie, arguing that nature was a pre-ordained progression towards the human race. Publisher, historian, antiquarian and scientist Robert Chambers (1802–71) became a friend of Scott, writing a biography of him after the author's death. Chambers also became a geologist, researching in Scandinavia and Canada. His most influential work was the anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844), which was the most comprehensive written argument in favour of evolution before the work of Charles Darwin (1809–82). His work was strongly influenced by transcendental anatomy, which, drawing on Goethe and Lorenz Oken (1779–1851), looked for ideal patterns and structure in nature and had been pioneered in Scotland by figures including Robert Knox (1791–1862).|$|E
5|$|Mediterranean {{cyclones}} {{have been}} compared to polar lows—cyclonic storms which typically develop in the far regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres—for their similarly small size and heat-related instability; however, while medicanes nearly always feature warm-core lows, polar lows are primarily cold-core. The prolonged life of medicanes and similarity to polar lows is caused primarily by origins as synoptic-scale surface lows and heat-related instability. Heavy precipitation and convection within a developing Mediterranean tropical cyclone are usually incited by the approach of an upper-level trough—an elongated area of low air pressures—bringing downstream cold air, encircling an existing low-pressure system. After this occurs, however, a considerable reduction in rainfall rates occurs despite further organization, coinciding with a decrease in previously high lightning activity as well. Although troughs will often accompany medicanes along their track, separation eventually occurs, usually in the later part of a Mediterranean tropical cyclone's life cycle. At the same time, moist air, saturated and cooled while rising into the atmosphere, then encounters the medicane and permits further development and evolution into a tropical cyclone. Many of these characteristics are <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> polar lows.|$|E
50|$|They {{developed}} their business into two shops - {{a grocery store}} and a clothing store. It is <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> that <b>in</b> 1900 they occupied a store in the High Street of Epsom. In the 1920s, Alfred Button & Sons bought the business and kept the name Holland & Barrett.|$|R
50|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, Paraguayan companies now meet 70% of domestic consumption and {{have begun to}} export drugs. Paraguay is quickly supplanting foreign suppliers in meeting the country's drug needs. Strong growth <b>also</b> is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the production of edible oils, garments, organic sugar, meat processing, and steel.|$|R
50|$|They are all {{identified}} with Christ {{as the sun}} rising after Resurrection, <b>evident</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> Basque church symbols and the imagery of Loyola's Jesuit Order.|$|R
25|$|The {{influence}} of yūrei-zu is <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the manga of Shigeru Mizuki (b. 1922) and Hiroshi Shiibashi (b. 1980), {{both of whom}} are renowned for their works dealing with traditional Japanese aspects of the supernatural.|$|E
25|$|The 1998 Human Rights Watch World Report {{revealed}} that the Roma minority in Hungary were continually discriminated against. This discrimination was <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the police force, with reports of police mistreatment and brutality on the minority group.|$|E
25|$|Russell's {{influence}} is <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> {{the work of}} Alfred J. Ayer, Rudolf Carnap, Alonzo Church, Kurt Gödel, David Kaplan, Saul Kripke, Karl Popper, W. V. Quine, John R. Searle, {{and a number of}} other philosophers and logicians.|$|E
3000|$|... 36  % of the 374 {{loans to}} {{defaulting}} small- and medium-sized companies in Portugal analyzed by Dermine and Neto de Carvalho (2006) were unsecured. Nevertheless, a recovery rate of 71  % was achieved. However, {{there is no}} information regarding the collateralization ratio. A high portion of unsecured securities <b>also</b> becomes <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> a study by Jiménez and Saurina (2002) on the Spanish market.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Nikolai Dmitriev-Orenburgsky's {{painting}} of General Mikhail Skobelev - the real-life {{model for the}} book's Sobolev - captures the dashing image <b>evident</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> Akunin's literary depiction.|$|R
25|$|The city as {{it exists}} today {{consists}} essentially of remains from the Roman era dating {{for the most part}} to the 2nd and 3rd century CE. The Roman builders had to take account both of the site’s particularly craggy terrain and of earlier constructions, which led them to abandon the normal layout of Roman settlements, as is <b>also</b> particularly <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> places such as Timgad.|$|R
25|$|Modern Laconophilia {{has been}} present in popular culture, {{particularly}} {{with reference to}} the Battle of Thermopylae, as portrayed in films such as The 300 Spartans. It is <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the graphic novel 300 and the film derived from it.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in pennation angle {{may lead to}} changes in muscle structure. In a study utilizing sheep subjects, a chronic rotator cuff tear resulted in an {{increase in}} both the pennation angle and separation between myofibers of the rotator cuff muscles. Fat cells then populated the rearranged muscle. This phenomenon was <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the aforementioned human experiment.|$|E
25|$|The {{revenues}} of the OREPA barely cover operating costs, leaving insufficient resources for maintenance and no resources to self-finance investments. This problem is <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> {{the myriad of}} community-operated and privately operated smaller systems throughout the country. Sometimes water is cut off to enforce payments, partly because payments cannot be enforced through the legal system. However, many customers reconnect illegally.|$|E
50|$|As seen in {{the above}} chart, Nafsan's vowel phoneme {{inventory}} {{is that of a}} five-vowel system; {{this is one of the}} most commonly seen vowel inventories in any given language in the world and <b>also</b> especially <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> many Oceanic languages. There is a distinction between short and long vowels but it is currently in a process of change that makes its status unclear.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of human behavior is that it reflects the rapid integration of constraints from an often large number of sources, {{in a manner that is}} flexible, responsive to novel situations, and apparently effortless.

25|$|The {{previous}} volcanic edifice {{was destroyed}} by this eruption, which may have formed a caldera. The vent was no wider than , as it is completely hidden beneath the western cone. Such a vent or caldera is substantially smaller than the volume of rocks erupted, a discrepancy that is <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the 1932 eruption of Quizapu. The Soncor magma chamber {{may have been too}} deep to collapse when it was emptied.|$|E
25|$|The tubular {{systems are}} {{fundamental}} to tall building design. Most buildings over 40-stories constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan's structural engineering principles, examples including {{the construction of}} the World Trade Center, Aon Center, Petronas Towers, Jin Mao Building, and most other supertall skyscrapers since the 1960s. The strong influence of tube structure design is <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> {{the construction of the}} current tallest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Also</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the Atlantic Ocean is the tritium profile near Bermuda {{between the}} late 1960s and late 1980s. There is a {{downward}} propagation of the tritium maximum {{from the surface}} (1960s) to 400meters (1980s), which corresponds to a deepening rate of approximately 18meters per year. There are also tritium increases at 1,500meters depth in the late 1970s and 2,500meters {{in the middle of}} the 1980s, both of which correspond to cooling events in the deep water and associated deep water ventilation.|$|E
25|$|Pizer <b>also</b> finds <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> {{the story}} a Christian theme {{of love and}} redemption, as shown by Buck's refusal to revert to {{violence}} until {{after the death of}} Thornton, who had won Buck's love and loyalty. London, who {{went so far as to}} fight for custody of one of his own dogs, understood that loyalty between dogs (particularly working dogs) and their masters is built on trust and love.|$|R
50|$|The Scottish {{presence}} was <b>also</b> strongly <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> India. The first three Governor-Generals of India were Scots. When Henry Dundas became President of the Board of Control in 1784 he ‘Scoticised’ India and through his agencies Scots came {{to dominate the}} activities of the East India Company (EIC). By 1792, Scots made up one in nine EIC civil servants, six in eleven common soldiers and one in three officers.|$|R
