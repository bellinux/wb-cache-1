PaleyFest panel that the writers are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> screenplays for upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe films {{to know where}} the universe is heading, which allowed them to form a plan for the show through the end of a third season.

5|$|The {{decipherment}} {{and recovery}} of the knowledge of Maya writing {{has been a long}} and laborious process. Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter. By the end of the 20th century, scholars were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content.|$|E
5|$|Champollion's {{interest}} in Egyptian {{history and the}} hieroglyphic script developed at an early age. At the age of sixteen, he gave a lecture before the Grenoble Academy in which {{he argued that the}} language spoken by the ancient Egyptians, in which they wrote the Hieroglyphic texts, was closely related to Coptic. This view proved crucial in becoming <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> texts, and the correctness of his proposed relation between Coptic and Ancient Egyptian has been confirmed by history. This enabled him to propose that the demotic script represented the Coptic language.|$|E

50|$|It is {{frequently}} argued that Simpson’s work operates better in small doses (Simpson himself described his only novel as one which he expected no-one <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end), {{so it is}} natural {{that he should have}} produced so much sketch material for television. World in Ferment lent towards this strength, and his skilful monologues for women were seen again in But Seriously - It’s Sheila Hancock (1972). Other vehicles included Ned Sherrin’s A Rather Reassuring Programme (1977), Beryl Reid Says… Good Evening (1968) and The Dick Emery Show (1977-1980).|$|R
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, Epiphany, {{consists}} of eight chapters and focuses on the roots, development, and impact of the Scottish Enlightenment on Scotland and Great Britain. The roots come from an appreciation for democracy and literacy that developed from the Scottish Reformation, when John Knox brought Calvinist Presbyterianism to Scotland. He preached that God ordained power into the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common people to understand God's laws they had to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E
5|$|While {{the name}} Thuthmose {{had also been}} {{identified}} (but not read) by Young who realized that the first syllable was spelled with a depiction of an ibis representing Thoth, Champollion was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> phonetic spelling of {{the second part of}} the word, and check it against the mentioning of births in the Rosetta stone. This finally confirmed to Champollion that the ancient texts as well as the recent ones used the same writing system, and that it was a system that mixed logographic and phonetic principles.|$|E
5|$|A lead {{scientist}} for a pharmaceutical company is {{killed by a}} blue powder that turns his bones into dust. The Fringe division traces {{the source of the}} package which contained the powder to a former Marine; when they search his home, Peter (Joshua Jackson) finds the man nearby and gives chase, but the man is hit by a car and knocked into a coma. Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears that there may be others involved in targeted attacks. Walter (John Noble) suggests they read the man's mind to learn of any such plot using the ability of one of his undocumented nootropic Cortexiphan patients, Simon Phillips, (Omid Abtahi). Simon, who is unable to control his telepathic abilities, has isolated himself from the general population for two decades, but finds some comfort in not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> mind of Olivia (Anna Torv)—a fellow Cortexiphan patient. Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the mental anguish he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, wondering if he still feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe. Meanwhile, three military contractors are killed by the release of the compound in an elevator, confirming Broyles' fears.|$|E

25|$|The Kirk {{played a}} leading role in {{providing}} universal education in Scotland (the first such provision in the modern world), largely due to its teaching that all should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Bible.

50|$|Clement Doke {{was also}} {{interested}} in ethnology. In 1931 he compiled The Lambas of Northern Rhodesia, which {{remains one of the}} outstanding ethnographic descriptions of the peoples of Central Africa. For Doke, literacy was part of the evangelisation since people had <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>to</b> appreciate <b>the</b> message of the Bible, but it was only after his retirement that he completed the translation of the Bible into Lamba. It was published under the title of Amasiwi AwaLesa (The Words of God) in 1959.|$|R

25|$|J. B.

Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects.

25|$|As the Reformers {{wanted all}} members of the church to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Bible, {{education}} on all levels got a strong boost.

About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century, including Yale University (1701). Pennsylvania also became a centre of learning. Protestantism also initiated translations of the Bible into national languages and hereby supported the development of national literatures.|$|E

In the first letter, Lyra also mentions that she is continuing to study the alethiometer.

25|$|As the Reformers {{wanted all}} members of the church to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Bible, {{education}} on all levels got a strong boost. By the middle of the eighteenth century, the literacy rate in England was about 60 per cent, in Scotland 65 per cent, and in Sweden eight of ten men and women were able to read and to write. Colleges and universities were founded. For example, the Puritans who established Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1628 founded Harvard College only eight years later. About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century, including Yale (1701). Pennsylvania also became a centre of learning.|$|E
25|$|Whitcomb was {{appointed}} by President Andrew Jackson {{to serve as the}} Commissioner of the General Land Office in Washington, D.C. from 1836 until 1841. He probably secured the post with the help of Congressman Ratliff Boon. While in office he undertook the study of French and Spanish so that he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> land treaties, and became fluent in both languages. His primary work was overseeing the survey of large tracts of land in Iowa and Wisconsin and dealing with land disputes in the recently purchased Florida Territory. Upon resigning from the Land Office in 1841, Whitcomb moved to Terre Haute, where he eventually launched his campaign as the Democratic gubernatorial candidate.|$|E
25|$|A storage {{heating system}} takes {{advantage}} of cheaper electricity prices, sold during low demand periods such as overnight. In the United Kingdom, this is branded as Economy 7. The storage heater stores heat in clay bricks, then releases it during the day when required. Newer storage heaters are able {{to be used with}} various tariffs. Whilst they can still be used with economy 7, they can be used with day-time tariffs. This is due to the modern design features that are added during manufacturing. Alongside new designs the use of a thermostat or sensor has improved the efficiency of the storage heater. A thermostat or sensor is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> temperature of the room, and change the output of the heater accordingly.|$|E
