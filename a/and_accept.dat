40|$|About the {{expression}} of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> in Japanese, the differences between honorific and unhonorific expression of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> verbs {{are very difficult to}} Chinese learners. It's said about {{the expression}} of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting,</b> that there are seven giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> verbs <b>and</b> these verbs have a complicated system like honorific and unhonorific expression, inside and outside expression in Japanese, but Chinese is very easy and just has one verb without any systems by okutukeiitirou. In fact, because there are honorific and unhonorific expression in Japanese, there is a direction of {{up and down in the}} relationship between giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting.</b> On the other hand, in Chinese, the verb for giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> doesn't have a difference between honorific and unhonorific expressions, so maybe there is no direction up and down just from the verb. In this paper, comparison of Japanese and Chinese about the direction of up and down in the relationship between giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> will be looked at with a focus on the verbs of giving <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> in Japanese...|$|R

5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E

When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy {{with the intention of}} convincing her to reject her gender identity <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She committed suicide by walking out in front of oncoming traffic on the Interstate 71 highway.|$|E
5|$|By October 1918, Austria {{prepared}} to transfer her entire fleet to Yugoslavia {{in order to}} keep it out of Italian hands. On November 10, 1918, one day before the armistice, Yugoslav officers with scratch crews sailed Radetzky and Zrínyi out of Pola. As they cleared the breakwater at Pola, they sighted the approaching Italian fleet. The two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to Castelli Bay near Spolato. They appealed for American naval forces to meet them <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> their surrender, which a squadron of USN submarine chasers in the area did. However, under the subsequent peace treaty, the Allied powers ignored the transfer of the Austro-Hungarian ships to the Yugoslav navy; instead, the ships were to be ceded to Italy. Radetzky and Zrínyi were broken up in Italy between 1920–21; Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand survived until 1926, when she too was scrapped in Italy.|$|E

In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he {{should not be allowed to}} live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E
