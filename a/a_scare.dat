5|$|Just {{before the}} plane arrived at Andrews, the U.S. Capitol was {{evacuated}} {{for a brief}} period, for a plane carrying Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher was off course and created <b>a</b> <b>scare</b> by entering restricted airspace; the incident was attributed to radio problems on board the plane and did not affect funeral events.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 {{establishment}} of the Gympie Truth, a newspaper {{that he was to}} partly own, was part of his response. Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour's message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher's return to parliament in 1899. This time, he was the beneficiary of <b>a</b> <b>scare</b> campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the Gympie Truth as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied it. In that year he was Secretary for Railways and Public Works in the seven-day government of Anderson Dawson, the first parliamentary Labour government in the world.|$|E
5|$|From there, the Flames {{went on to}} the Campbell Conference Finals, {{where they}} {{defeated}} the St. Louis Blues in another seven-game series. This time, Calgary had to survive <b>a</b> <b>scare</b> of its own, shaking off the Monday Night Miracle at the St. Louis Arena. Trailing by a score of 5–2 with 10 minutes to play in the third period of Game 6, the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime, where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game. Calgary would win Game 7 at home, 2–1, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time. The Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens, losing the championship series in five games. Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unbeatable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy.|$|E

5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both the owners and the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as <b>a</b> <b>scare</b> tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that Stern wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at Stern after he pointed his finger at Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E
5|$|The USEE had <b>a</b> <b>scare</b> against Eighteen of Bolton in {{the three-day}} match {{starting}} on Thursday, 18 July. They won by just 21 runs having been slightly behind on first innings. Grace and Southerton bowled the Bolton team out {{but the difference}} was a second innings of 63 by Charlwood {{in a total of}} just 120. Grace scored 51 and 22 and took 20 wickets. The USEE won the final match of this tour, starting on Monday, 22 July, against Twenty-two of Birmingham by 5 wickets, having been 23 behind on first innings. The USEE had a strong Gloucestershire flavour in this match with all three Grace brothers, Midwinter, Gilbert and Cranston involved. Birmingham scored 128 and 119, Grace taking 21 wickets. USEE scored 105 and 144–5, Grace making 7 and 59. He needed the support of his brother E. M., who scored 52 not out, to secure the five wicket victory.|$|E
5|$|Müller {{was named}} in Germany's {{provisional}} 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players. Despite suffering <b>a</b> <b>scare</b> {{when he fell}} off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol, Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players. He was allocated the number 13, normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack, and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd. He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. He started {{the first game of}} Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia, winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process. He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16. In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal. However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play. He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals. The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.|$|E
