6000|$|Once more, it is {{said that}} in every poet there must be {{something}} of the woman. If to be quick in sympathy and feeling, ardent in attachment, and full of pity for the weak and suffering, is to be womanly, Stevenson was certainly all those; he was even like a woman in being [Greek: artidakrus], easily moved to tears at the touch of pity or affection, or even at any specially poignant impression of art or beauty. But yet, if any one word were to be chosen for the predominant quality of his character and example, I suppose that word would be manly. In his gentle and complying nature there were strains of iron tenacity and will: occasionally even, let it be admitted, of perversity and Scottish [...] "thrawnness." [...] He had both kinds of physical courage--the active, delighting in danger, and the passive, unshaken in endurance. In the moral courage of facing situations and consequences, of readiness to pay for faults committed, of outspokenness, admitting no ambiguous relations and clearing away the clouds from human intercourse, I have not known his equal. The great Sir Walter himself, as this book will prove, was not more manfully free from artistic jealousy or irritability under criticism, or more unfeignedly inclined to exaggerate the qualities of other people's work and to underrate those of his own. Of the humorous and engaging parts of vanity and egoism, which led him to make infinite talk and fun about himself, and use his own experiences <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> unlocking the confidences of others, Stevenson had plenty; but of the morose and fretful parts never a shade. [...] "A little Irish girl," [...] he wrote once during a painful crisis of his life, [...] "is now reading my book aloud to her sister at my elbow; they chuckle, and I feel flattered.--Yours, R. L. S. P.S.--Now they yawn, and I am indifferent. Such a wisely conceived thing is vanity." [...] If only vanity so conceived were commoner! And whatever might be the abstract and philosophical value of that somewhat grimly stoical conception of the universe, of conduct and duty, at which in mature years he had arrived, want of manliness is certainly not its fault. Take the kind of maxims which he was accustomed to forge for his own guidance:--"Acts may be forgiven; not even God can forgive the hanger-back." [...] "Choose the best, if you can; or choose the worst; that which hangs in the wind dangles from a gibbet." [...] "'Shall I?' said Feeble-mind; and the echo said, 'Fie!'" [...] "'Do I love?' said Loveless; and the echo laughed." [...] "A fault known is a fault cured to the strong; but to the weak it is a fetter riveted." [...] "The mean man doubts, the great-hearted is deceived." [...] "Great-heart was deceived. 'Very well,' said Great-heart." [...] "'I have not forgotten my umbrella,' said the careful man; but the lightning struck him." [...] "Shame had a fine bed, but where was slumber? Once he was in jail he slept." [...] With this moralist maxims meant actions; and where shall we easily find a much manlier spirit of wisdom than this? ...|$|E

5000|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} Langs' approach to psychotherapeutic practice is {{his way of}} listening to the patient, focusing on unconscious derivative or encoded communications which express latent, deep unconscious experiences and perceptions. Though listening for encoded derivatives is certainly found in the psychoanalytic tradition, traditional psychoanalytic theory tended to interpret them as unconscious fantasies rather than adaptive responses to unconscious perceptions of reality, as Langs interprets them. There appears little current emphasis on listening to encoded derivatives in contemporary psychoanalytic practice. In contrast to contemporary practice, listening for encoded derivatives takes a central—indeed predominant—place in Langs' work. Furthermore, in contrast to mainstream psychoanalysis, Langs connects derivative themes to [...] "triggers," [...] i.e. activating events born of the patient's attempt to adapt consciously to the vicissitudes of life and both consciously and unconsciously {{to his or her}} early traumas. Whereas Langs' earlier work sought primarily frame and ground rule violations through encoded communications, there is now a greater emphasis on listening for encoded communications of patients' traumas. In this way, Langs emphasizes the adaptive nature of the unconscious psyche <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>for</b> interpreting encoded derivatives and thus for understanding deep unconscious processes. Langs' approach differs from psychoanalytic approaches which treat the unconscious in purely intrapsychic terms, as opposed to giving primacy to processes of external adaptation.|$|E
