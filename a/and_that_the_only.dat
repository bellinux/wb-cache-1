5|$|Bertie's and Lionel's {{relationship}} {{comes to}} be known to the King's advisors when there are preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey. It comes to light that George never asked for advice from his advisors about his speech defect treatment and that Lionel never had formal training to be a medical doctor. Lionel explained {{that at the time}} he started with speech defects there was no formal training <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> known help that was available for returning Great War shell-shocked Australian soldiers was from personal experience.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way to ease the pain is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 1865, Booth {{heard the}} news that Robert E. Lee had {{surrendered}} at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Surratt and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house, that he {{was done with the}} stage <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> play he wanted to present henceforth was Venice Preserv'd. Weichmann did not understand the reference; Venice Preserv'd is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.|$|E
2500|$|Crosby also {{elaborated}} on {{a further}} idea of Al Jolson's: phrasing, or {{the art of}} making a song's lyric ring true. His success in doing so was influential. [...] "I used to tell Sinatra over and over," [...] said Tommy Dorsey, [...] "there's only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby. All that matters to him is <b>the</b> words, <b>and</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> thing <b>that</b> ought to for you, too." ...|$|R

5|$|On November 26, 1861, Governor Johnson {{issued an}} address to the {{citizens}} of the Commonwealth blaming abolitionists for the breakup of the United States. He asserted his belief that the Union and Confederacy were forces of equal strength, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> solution to the war was a free trade agreement between the two sovereign nations. He further announced his willingness to resign as provisional governor if the Kentucky General Assembly would agree to cooperate with Governor Magoffin. Magoffin himself denounced the Russellville Convention and the provisional government, stressing the need to abide by the will {{of the majority of the}} Commonwealth's citizens.|$|E
5|$|The Original All Blacks {{introduced}} several innovations to rugby in France and the British Isles. At {{the time}} of their tour many critics in the Northern Hemisphere blamed the use of the wing–forward for the All Blacks success. These critics claimed this player—who fed the ball into the scrum—would obstruct opposition players, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason they were not being penalised was due to poor refereeing. Their success however was due to a combination of factors, the most important being the team's discipline and organisation, which was described at the time as a scientific approach.|$|E
5|$|The most {{inflammatory}} rumour {{was that}} Washington would launch an attack {{to liberate the}} north when all anti-communists had fled south. It claimed that the Americans would use atomic bombs <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way of avoiding death in a nuclear holocaust was to move south. Lansdale's team disseminated pamphlets that depicted Hanoi with three circles of nuclear destruction superimposed on it. Lansdale's saboteurs also poured sugar into the petrol tanks of Viet Minh vehicles. Soothsayers were bribed to predict disaster under communism, and prosperity for those who went south.|$|E

5|$|With Homer having {{convinced}} Lisa {{that nothing}} can go wrong at Krusty's show, Lisa and Ralph go together. On live air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that she had never liked him <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody else would. Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited Thessaloniki to {{supervise}} the translation. On February 8, 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> outstanding task was a final review by a competent person, who had already been assigned to the task. In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to Malta to be printed, and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to {{the representative of the}} society in Corfu the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian. Meanwhile, the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the Archimandrite of Euboea, Grigor Gjirokastriti, an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop Gregory IV of Athens. Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than Koine.|$|E
5|$|Evan soon {{learns that}} 614 {{actually}} {{refers to the}} verse in the Book of Genesis, where God instructs Noah to build an Ark {{in preparation for a}} flood. God later repeatedly appears in various guises before finally revealing himself to Evan, and cordially insisting that he should also build an ark as well. God explains to Evan that a flood is coming, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> opportunity Evan will have to change the world is by saving his community instead. God also tells Evan to inform others about the flood should they ask him later. Concerned about Evan's behavior, Joan initially believes that he is having a mid-life crisis. Evan begins constructing the ark with his sons, who start to admire him as he is spending more time with them.|$|E

5|$|Liz becomes furious when Jack {{decides that}} Tracy {{should be the}} number one {{priority}} on The Girlie Show. Jenna fears that Tracy will begin to overshadow her, but Tracy is quite pleased with his new job on the show. Liz and Jenna become more aggravated when Jack decides to {{change the name of}} The Girlie Show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, without consulting either of them. Jack has Tracy and Jenna appear in a promotion for the show, in which Tracy angers Jenna by forgetting her name and by not letting her speak. After the promotion, Liz tries to re-assure Jenna by telling her that nobody on the show likes Tracy <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason that he is on the show is because of Jack. Liz finds out that Jenna's microphone was still on, and everyone in the studio heard her say terrible things about Jack and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1999, the Lomé Peace Accord was signed. Among other provisions, the {{agreement}} mandated an immediate ceasefire between the main {{parties to the}} civil war and the disarmament of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) and the RUF. It also gave the RUF status as a legitimate political party, a role in the Sierra Leone Government, and four of the twenty-two seats in the cabinet. Foday Sankoh, leader of the RUF, was given responsibility for the diamond mines—an appointment much criticised by observers and the international media given the RUF's history of diamond smuggling. However, Peter Hain, Minister of State for Africa, suggested that the British government {{had no choice but to}} endorse the Lomé agreement given the RUF's dominance, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> alternative was continued civil war. A military intervention by the United Kingdom in 1999 was ruled out as the British government had received no request for military assistance and felt it lacked the backing of the international community for a unilateral intervention. An intervention was also deemed to be politically and militarily impractical given the British military's involvement with NATO operations in Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew what had {{happened}} <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way to save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{justification for}} the GRC scheme is to entrench minority representation in Parliament. However, opposition parties have questioned the usefulness of GRCs in fulfilling this purpose, especially since Singapore has not faced the issue of minorities being under-represented in Parliament. In fact, statistics show that all PAP minority candidates have won regularly <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> two MPs to lose their seats in 1984 were Chinese. One of them was beaten by a minority candidate. In addition, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won a by-election in 1981 at Anson, a largely Chinese constituency, and the first elected Chief Minister of Singapore was David Marshall who was Jewish. Technically, as the size of GRCs has increased, the minority has had less representation overall as the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has been reduced. Since minority MPs are a numerical minority in Parliament, their political clout has also been reduced.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Dales, an {{assistant}} constable, arrived from Birmingham, {{where he was}} one of those responsible for policing the town. On ascertaining the situation he interrogated Thornton, and soon arrested him. However, Dales did not keep any notes and later proved unable to remember much of what the prisoner told him. Thornton was then examined by the local magistrate, William Bedford, who ordered Thornton searched. The search revealed that Thornton was wearing underclothing with bloodstains, and Thornton admitted having sexual intercourse with Ashford the previous night. The prisoner's shoes were removed, and comparisons with the footprints in the field were made by the factory workers, who later testified at trial that they matched. A post-mortem examination revealed that Ashford died from drowning, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> marks on her body were two lacerations in the genital area. The examination concluded that until the sexual act which caused the bleeding, Ashford was a virgin. She was menstruating at the time of her death.|$|E
5|$|Whereas {{the poll}} tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants' Revolt, {{the root of}} the {{conflict}} lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and the king's Lord High Treasurer, Robert Hales, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom. The king, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> feasible option was to negotiate.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} debate, held on RTÉ Radio 1's News at One, {{independent}} candidate Scallon explained she had delayed her {{entry into the}} race due to numerous family bereavements.

I have the knowledge and experience to be able to protect our sovereignty <b>and</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> question I think that's really urgent at this time." [...] When asked by Ryan Tubridy if she would refuse to sign any bill threatening , she responded by saying, [...] "You bet your boots I would". In fact, the President does not have such a veto power, being able only to refer a Bill to the Council of State for its consideration.|$|R
