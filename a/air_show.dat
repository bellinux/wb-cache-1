5|$|At its 100th {{delivery}} ceremony, Emirates Airline head Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum {{was hoping}} to order new A380s at the November 2017 Dubai <b>Air</b> <b>Show</b> the following week.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, in {{expectation}} {{of raising the}} number of orders placed, Airbus announced 'attractable discounts' to airlines who placed large orders for the A380. Soon after, at the November 2013 Dubai <b>Air</b> <b>Show</b> where it ordered 150 B777X, Emirates ordered 50 aircraft, totalling $20 billion.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>air</b> <b>shows</b> feature warbirds, aerobatics, {{and demonstrations}} of modern {{military}} aircraft, and many <b>air</b> <b>shows</b> {{offer a variety}} of other aeronautical attractions as well, such as wing-walking, radio-controlled aircraft, water/slurry drops from firefighting aircraft, simulated helicopter rescues and sky diving.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} <b>air</b> <b>shows</b> were held.|$|R
50|$|Before the Second World War, <b>air</b> <b>shows</b> were {{associated}} with long distance air races, often lasting many days and covering thousands of miles. While the Reno Air Races keep this tradition alive, most <b>air</b> <b>shows</b> today primarily feature a series of aerial demos of short duration.|$|R
5|$|In June 2017, {{the airline}} {{signed a letter}} of intent with Bombardier at the 2017 Paris <b>Air</b> <b>Show,</b> to {{purchase}} up to 50 Q400 aircraft, catering to growth in passenger traffic arising from its participation in the Indian government's UDAN regional connectivity scheme.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May 1975, while {{practicing}} a 9-g aerial display maneuver {{with the}} second YF-16 (tail number 72-1568) at Fort Worth, Texas, prior to {{being sent to the}} Paris <b>Air</b> <b>Show,</b> one of the main landing gear jammed. The test pilot, Neil Anderson, had to perform an emergency gear-up landing and chose {{to do so in the}} grass, hoping to minimize damage and to avoid injuring any observers. The aircraft was only slightly damaged, but due to the mishap the first prototype was sent to the Paris <b>Air</b> <b>Show</b> in its place.|$|E
5|$|The wing {{hosted the}} Cape Cod <b>Air</b> <b>Show</b> & Open House, its last <b>air</b> <b>show</b> with the F-15C Eagle {{at the end}} of Air Force Week in August 2007. The wing shared a {{commonality}} with the 101st Air Refueling Wing, the 103d Fighter Wing, and the 104th Fighter Wing, which due to commission decisions, also changed the type of planes that they flew. Beginning in 2007, the F-15s began moving to Barnes Municipal Airport. With the grounding of the F-15 Eagles, the 158th Fighter Wing, which is based in Vermont took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies earlier than expected. This interruption of the F-15's flight, coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the 104th Fighter Wing, created some issues.|$|E

50|$|The Soviet <b>air</b> <b>shows</b> {{conveyed}} {{more than}} entertainment. In {{the atmosphere of}} harshly enforced clandestinity, these <b>air</b> <b>shows</b> were frequently {{the main source of}} information about the recent aviation achievements of Soviet design bureaus (OKBs). Both Eastern and Western public opinion benefited from it, as well as foreign military intelligence.|$|R
5|$|At the Farnborough <b>Air</b> <b>Show</b> in July 2010, Airbus {{announced}} that Hong Kong Airlines {{had signed a}} MOU to convert orders for 15 A330s to A350s and place an additional order for 10 A330-200s. The airline converted an existing order for 15 A330s to the A350 XWB which will be delivered in 2018. No engine selection for the additional A330s was announced.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as these events, the Simpsons are {{attending}} an <b>air</b> <b>show</b> held at the base, before the signal on the big screen is interrupted by Bob, who threatens to detonate the nuclear bomb unless Springfield disables all television broadcasts. Upon hearing the announcement, everyone flees the airfield in panic, except for Bart and Lisa. Unable to locate Bob, Mayor Quimby decides to give in to Bob's ultimatum.|$|E
5|$|During a 19 May 1991 <b>air</b> <b>show</b> at Fairchild, Holland was {{the command}} pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} violated several safety regulations, including exceeding bank and pitch limits, flying {{directly over the}} air-show spectators, and possibly violating altitude restrictions. The base and wing commander, Colonel Arne Weinman, along with his staff, observed the demonstration, but apparently took no action.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Det Norske Helikoperskole started Norway's first {{helicopter}} pilot {{school at the}} airport. This was met with protests from the neighbors, who were affected by noise pollution all day long. The municipality was sued by 600 locals who wanted to prohibit the school from operating. During an <b>air</b> <b>show</b> in 1983, the airport was visited by a Boeing 737-200 from Braathens SAFE and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon from the Royal Norwegian Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Major air shows held {{regularly}} {{include the}} Duxford <b>Air</b> <b>Show,</b> the Flying Legends show (organised by The Fighter Collection), and American Air Day, which {{is held in}} conjunction with units of the Third Air Force (part of the United States Air Forces in Europe), based at nearby RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall. The Duxford <b>Air</b> <b>Show</b> usually exhibits {{a wide range of}} aircraft, from vintage warbirds to contemporary jet aircraft, along with aerobatic flying by groups such as the Red Arrows. while the Flying Legends show focuses on historic aircraft, especially those of the Second World War. In 2008 it was reported that these displays generate up to £1.8 million, while the loss of up to £100,000 due to adverse weather is also budgeted for. The policing bill, necessary to manage the resulting road traffic, was reported as some £8,000. Recent major events have included the Battle of Britain 70th Anniversary airshow, held on 4–5 September 2010. The show was attended by more than 40,000 people, and featured formation displays by four Hawker Hurricanes and sixteen Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|On 10 October 1984, GG1001 {{crashed in}} South Korea on a {{demonstration}} flight, killing Northrop pilot Darrell Cornell. An investigation cleared the F-20 of mechanical or design faults; it concluded Cornell had blacked out due to excessive g-forces. GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at Goose Bay, Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC; Barnes had been practicing his aerobatic routine for the Paris <b>Air</b> <b>Show.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Aviation-related {{events are}} common in the Wichita area, {{including}} <b>air</b> <b>shows,</b> fly-ins, <b>air</b> races, aviation conferences, exhibitions, and trade shows. The city's two main <b>air</b> <b>shows,</b> which are generally held in alternating years, are the city-sponsored civilian Wichita Flight Festival (originally the [...] "Kansas Flight Festival") and the military-sponsored McConnell Air Force Base Open House and Airshow. Both are large regional <b>air</b> <b>shows</b> with famous acts and multimillion-dollar aircraft displays (including many Wichita-built aircraft). In addition, numerous local, regional, and national aviation organizations host fly-ins, conferences, exhibitions and trade shows in the Wichita area on irregular schedules.|$|R
5|$|Since its reactivation, the 69 Squadron {{has also}} {{undertaken}} multiple deployments abroad. It {{was the first}} Israeli unit to participate in exercise Red Flag in October 1998, and has taken part in several Red Flags since. It has also deployed to Turkey and Italy on several occasions, and three aircraft participated in the 2001 RAF Waddington International <b>Air</b> <b>Show.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Su-35 {{project was}} aimed {{primarily}} at the export market. During {{the early stages}} of the flight-test programme, Sukhoi estimated that there was such a market for 160 aircraft, with a particular emphasis on Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Some of the candidate countries, such as Algeria, Malaysia, and India, were already operators of the Su-30MK family. As the aircraft was to be available for export starting in 2010, the actual launch order for 48 Su-35S aircraft was placed by the Russian Defence Ministry at the 2009 MAKS <b>Air</b> <b>Show</b> (as part of a larger deal worth US$2.5billion for 64 fighter aircraft). During the type's international debut at the 2013 Paris <b>Air</b> <b>Show,</b> Mikhail Pogosyan, General Director of Sukhoi's parent company United Aircraft Corporation, stated that there was an estimated demand for 200 aircraft, split evenly between the domestic and export markets. It was not until the end of 2015 when the first export contract was signed with China; by then, the Russian government had placed a follow-up order for 50 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The city's largest festival, the Neptune Festival, attracts 500,000 {{visitors}} to the oceanfront and 350,000 {{visitors to}} the <b>air</b> <b>show</b> at NAS Oceana.

5|$|An-188: A {{program to}} develop this variant was {{launched}} at the 2015 Paris <b>Air</b> <b>Show.</b> This variant will essentially be a four jet engine powered heavy-medium transport with modernized NATO- compatible western cockpit, slightly enlarged wings, winglets and aerial refueling capabilities. The An-188 is intended {{to fill the gap}} between a C-130 and C-17 while being a direct competitor to the A400M. Plans include incorporating a western engine option (as well as a Ukrainian one) to appeal to western markets and reduce dependency on eastern markets.|$|E
5|$|At the 8 August 1993 Fairchild <b>air</b> <b>show,</b> Holland {{once again}} {{commanded}} the B-52 demonstration flight. The demonstration profile once again included bank angles greater than 45°, low-altitude passes, and another high pitch climbing maneuver, {{this time in}} excess of 80° nose high. The climb was so steep that fuel flowed out of the vent holes from the aircraft's wing tanks. The new wing commander, Brigadier General James M. Richards, and the new DO, Colonel William E. Pellerin, both witnessed the demonstration, but neither took any action.|$|E
