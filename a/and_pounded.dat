5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1886, Macdonald {{traveled}} for the only time to western Canada, traveling {{from town to town}} by private railway car, and addressing large crowds. Macdonald traveled with his wife, and to get a better view, the two would sometimes sit in front of the locomotive on the train's cowcatcher. On 13 August 1886, Macdonald used a silver hammer <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> a gold spike to complete the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway.|$|E
5|$|Haleem {{originated}} as an Arabic {{dish with}} meat <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> wheat {{as the chief}} ingredients. It was introduced to Hyderabad by the Arab diaspora during {{the rule of the}} sixth Nizam, Mahbub Ali Khan, and later became an integral part of Hyderabadi cuisine during the rule of the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan. Sultan Saif Nawaz Jung Bahadur, an Arab chief from Mukalla, Hadhramaut, Yemen, who was among the seventh Nizam's court nobility, popularised it in Hyderabad. Addition of local flavours to the original recipe resulted in a taste distinct from other types of haleem.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{and other}} {{invertebrates}} {{are a major}} portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when they rely almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the winter, when invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, acorns or seeds may be wedged into cracks <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever to pry up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to cover a seed cache.|$|E

5|$|The method {{chosen by}} PAVN {{to defeat the}} {{invasion}} was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied 122mm and 130mm pieces, which simply stood off <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> the positions at will. The defensive edge {{that could have been}} provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the communist forces. Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor would then finish the job.|$|E
5|$|Two of the U.S. destroyers met {{a sudden}} demise. Either Nagara or the destroyers Teruzuki and Yukikaze {{came upon the}} {{drifting}} Cushing <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> her with gunfire, knocking out all of her systems. Unable to fight back, Cushings crew abandoned ship. Cushing sank several hours later. Laffey, having escaped from her engagement with Hiei, encountered Asagumo, Murasame, Samidare, and, perhaps, Teruzuki. The Japanese destroyers pounded Laffey with gunfire and then hit her with a torpedo which broke her keel. A few minutes later fires reached her ammunition magazines and she blew up and sank.|$|E

At the same time, the chapter points out, Fisher critiques <b>and</b> undercuts <b>Pound's</b> essentialism, thus allowing 'Atkins Stomp' to attack free-market capitalism <b>and</b> <b>Pound's</b> fascism at the same time...|$|R

25|$|In April 1863, Federal ironclads and shore {{batteries}} began a {{bombardment of}} Fort Moultrie {{and the other}} forts around Charleston harbor. Over the ensuing twenty months, Union bombardment reduced Fort Sumter to a rubble pile <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> Fort Moultrie below a sand hill, which protected it against further bombardment. The Rifled cannon proved its superiority to brickwork fortifications {{but not to the}} endurance of the Confederate artillerymen who continued to man Fort Moultrie. In February 1865, as General Sherman marched through South Carolina, the Confederate soldiers finally abandoned the rubble of Fort Moultrie and evacuated the city of Charleston.|$|E

25|$|The Islanders {{continued}} to struggle and in 1989, they missed {{the playoffs for}} the first time since 1974. In the first game of the Islanders' next playoff series, in 1990, LaFontaine suffered the first of many concussions, after a controversial, open-ice hit by James Patrick of the New York Rangers. He fell on his head and was unconscious while being taken off the ice on a stretcher. The ambulance he took was delayed en route to the hospital by Ranger fans who rocked <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> it as it left Madison Square Garden. He was lost for the remainder of the series.|$|E
25|$|Rammed earth {{walls are}} formed {{in place by}} {{pounding}} damp sub-soil (containing sand, clay and sometimes gravel) into movable, reusable forms with manual or machine-powered tampers. In traditional rammed earth, a mixture of around 70% aggregate (gravel,sand) and 30% clay is optimal. Pigmentation may be added in the mix to achieve the desired color. Around 5-10inches of mixed damp sub-soil are placed inside the forms <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> to total compaction and the process is repeated until the desired height is achieved. What is left after the forms are removed is a wall that is structural and can last over 1000 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of those who escaped unharmed were workers {{in the front of}} the building who left through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke. Others tried to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success; most of the survivors from the rear of the building got out through a loading bay. The bay was initially blocked by a tractor-trailer, but three workers went into the rear of the truck <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> on the walls until they were heard by rescuers who moved the vehicle. Others escaped when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, though for many this came too late.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about the paper's {{manufacture}} in the pre-Hispanic period. Stone beaters dating from the 6th century CE have been found, and these tools are most often found where amate trees grow. Most are made of volcanic stone with some made of marble and granite. They are usually rectangular or circular with grooves on one or both sides to macerate the fibers. These beaters are still used by Otomi artisans, and almost all are volcanic, with an additional groove added on the side to help hold the stone. According to some early Spanish accounts, the bark was left overnight in water to soak, after which the finer inner fibers were separated from coarser outer fibers <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> into flat sheets. But it is not known who did the work, or how the labor was divided.|$|E
25|$|After {{the gold}} rush the A. J. Goddard spent much of its time in the towing {{business}} on Lake Laberge. In 1899 the company behind her was sold to a competitor, the Canadian Development Company, which appears to have confined the vesselâ€™s service between Whitehorse and {{the foot of the}} Thirty Mile River. On October 11, the A. J. Goddard entered Lake Laberge with a large barge in tow. Here she sank during a storm. The little ship was blasted with freezing rain and snow <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> by waves. Despite the crewâ€™s efforts, she began to take on water, which extinguished the boiler fires and left the ship without power. She sank to the lake bottom only a few hundred metres from shore. Three of the crew, Charles MacDonald, Fay Ransom and John Thompson, drowned while two were rescued by a local trapper in a rowboat.|$|E
25|$|The seventh, eighth, {{and ninth}} matches {{of the evening}} {{comprised}} the main event championship unification tournament. The first match was the match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kurt Angle for Austin's WWF Championship. In the beginning, both men applied holds. Austin then took advantage <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> Angle. The two had a test of strength and Angle applied the ankle lock. Austin {{kicked out of the}} hold, and applied an armlock, followed by an eye rake. He choked Angle in the ropes and attacked in his biceps. Austin threw Angle into the ringpost three times, injuring the left side of Angle's torso. In the ring, Austin used an armbar takedown on Angle's injured left shoulder. Angle then applied the ankle lock on Austin. Austin reached the ropes and Angle broke the hold. Austin followed by knocking Angle's head on the announce table. Angle then wrapped Austin's leg around the ringpost, and applied the ringpost figure four leglock. Back in the ring, Angle applied the ankle lock but Austin rolled through. Angle hit a belly-to-belly suplex, and three German suplexes. Angle missed a moonsault, and Austin took advantage, hitting a Lou Thesz press, and a spinebuster. Austin then hit five German suplexes, but, while in the ropes, Angle hit a low blow, and an Angle Slam. Angle then tried to hit a Stone Cold Stunner, but Austin reversed it into his Stone Cold Stunner to win the match, and retain his title.|$|E

500|$|Hyderabadi haleem (...) {{is a type}} of haleem {{popular in}} the Indian city Hyderabad. Haleem is a stew {{composed}} of meat, lentils <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> wheat made into a thick paste.

500|$|Seeing their {{disadvantage}} the Spanish second-in-command {{assembled a}} boarding party, at which Cochrane drew off <b>and</b> <b>pounded</b> their massed ranks with shot and musket fire before drawing in close again. After having {{their attempts to}} board frustrated three times, the Spanish returned to their guns. Cochrane then decided to board the Gamo, and assembled his entire crew into two parties, leaving only the ship's doctor aboard. The British rushed the Gamo, some boarding from the bow with faces blackened to look like pirates, the rest boarding from the waist. There was a hard-fought battle between the two crews, until Cochrane called down to the doctor, {{at the time the}} only person on Speedy, ordering him to send another 50 men over. At the same time he ordered the Spanish colours to be torn down. Thinking that their officers had surrendered the ship, the remaining Spanish seamen stopped fighting. The British had lost three men killed and nine wounded, while the Spanish had lost 14 killed and 41 wounded, a casualty list exceeding Speedys entire complement. The British then secured the Spanish prisoners below deck and made their way back to Port Mahon. Stung that he had been beaten by such an inferior foe, the Spanish second-in-command asked Cochrane for a certificate assuring him that he had done all he could to defend his ship. Cochrane obliged, with the equivocal wording that he had [...] "conducted himself like a true Spaniard". Cochrane was amused to learn that this certificate had later secured the Spanish officer further advancement. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Speedy 6 May 1801" [...] to all surviving claimants from the action.|$|E
