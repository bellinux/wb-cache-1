25|$|The West Saxon aristocrat, monk, scholar, {{and poet}} Aldhelm (c. 639–709) composed, {{among many other}} works, a set of one hundred hexametrical 'enigmata' or 'enigmas', {{inspired}} by the so-called Riddles of Symphosius. The thirty-third was Lorica ('corselet'). This was translated into Old English, and first witnessed in the Northumbrian dialect of Old English as the Leiden Riddle; the language is of the seventh or eighth century. Unusually, the riddle is also attested, in West Saxon, among the Old English riddles of the later tenth-century Exeter Book, where it is number 33 or 35 (depending on the edition consulted). Apart from differences in language caused by dialect and date, and damage to the Leiden manuscript, the texts are the identical on all but <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In December 1997, Cohen's {{book was}} {{reviewed}} by Professor Charles W. Ingrao of Purdue University's History Department in Nationalities Papers. Ingrao described {{the book as}} a [...] "well-written, heavily footnoted narration" [...] which [...] "details {{the degree to which}} the Serbs of what is today Rump-Yugoslavia collaborated with the Nazis, both before and immediately after the April 1941 German invasion". He noted that, [...] "It is difficult to refute his contention that it was the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks, and Jews of multiethnic Bosnia and the Krajina that provided the backbone to the anti-fascist war effort at a time when both the Četniks and Nedić regimes of Serbia were pursuing their own agenda of an ethnically pure Greater Serbia". Ingrao observed that while scholars were already familiar with a great deal of the material included in the book, Cohen's exposé on the Serbian-Jewish Friendship Society founded by Slobodan Milošević was new evidence about an organisation that was used to convince the international community of the common bond between Serbs and Jews. Ingrao concluded that, while Cohen overplayed the evidence at <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> in the book, he was impressed by both its factual accuracy and balanced judgements.|$|E

60|$|It {{was about}} {{three o'clock in the}} morning when Rob, moving restlessly in his sleep, accidently touched with his right hand the {{indicator}} of the machine which was fastened to his left wrist, setting it <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> to the south of east. He was, of course, unaware of the slight alteration in his course, which was destined to prove of serious importance in the near future. For the boy's fatigue induced him to sleep far beyond daybreak, and during this period of unconsciousness he was passing over the face of European countries and approaching the lawless and dangerous dominions of the Orient.|$|E
60|$|But {{the thought}} {{of the men in the}} midst of it steadied me, and in my quest for them I forgot myself. For an hour I saw nothing but the naked, desolate sea. And then, where a vagrant shaft of {{sunlight}} struck the ocean and turned its surface to wrathful silver, I caught a small black speck thrust skyward for an instant and swallowed up. I waited patiently. Again the tiny point of black projected itself through the wrathful blaze <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> off our port-bow. I did not attempt to shout, but communicated the news to Wolf Larsen by waving my arm. He changed the course, and I signalled affirmation when the speck showed dead ahead.|$|E
60|$|But {{the weather}} now {{became more and}} more stormy. Thick clouds {{gathered}} on the horizon. The wind began to blow with steady violence, and shifted <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> to the southward; so that Martin found it impossible to keep straight for the Point. Still he worked perseveringly at his single oar, and sculled rapidly over the sea; but, as he approached the Point he soon perceived that no effort of which he was capable could enable him to gain it. But Martin's heart was stout. He strove with all the energy of hope, until the Point was passed; and then, turning the head of his little boat towards it, he strove with all the energy of despair, until he fell down exhausted. The wind and tide swept him rapidly out to sea; and when his terrified comrade reached the Point the little boat was but a speck on the seaward horizon.|$|E
30|$|To {{conclude}} this paper, we note that, for {{the general}} case of a weakly nonexpansive bivariate mapping F, the Picard-type iteration process (2.4) does not generally converge or, even if it converges, its limit is not <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> fixed <b>point</b> <b>of</b> F, but the Krasnoselskij-type iteration process always converges to <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> fixed <b>point</b> <b>of</b> F.|$|R

Speaking of grub, I might as well stop long enough to explain <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>points.</b> Up thereabouts, {{in the midst of}} the mountains, is an almighty curious formation. There is no end of little valleys, each like the other much as peas in a pod, and all neatly tucked away with straight, rocky walls rising on all sides. And at the lower ends are always small {{openings}} where the drainage or glaciers must have broken out. The only way in is through these mouths, and they are all small, and some smaller than others. As to grub--you've slushed around on the rain-soaked islands of the Alaskan coast down Sitka way, most likely, seeing as you're a traveller. And you know how stuff grows there--big, and juicy, and jungly. Well, that's the way it was with those valleys. Thick, rich soil, with ferns and grasses and such things in patches higher than your head. Rain three days out of four during the summer months; and food in them for a thousand mammoths, to say nothing of small game for man.|$|E

40|$|We {{formulate}} a general abstract criterion for verifying the local-to-global principle for a rigidly-compactly generated tensor triangulated category. Our approach {{is based upon}} an inductive construction using dimension functions. Using our criterion we give a new proof of the theorem that the local-to-global principle holds for such categories {{when they have a}} model and the spectrum of the compacts is noetherian. As further applications we give a new set of conditions on the spectrum of the compacts that guarantee the local-to-global principle holds and use this to classify localising subcategories in the derived category of a semi-artinian absolutely flat ring.
