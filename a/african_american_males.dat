25|$|By the 1970s, {{following}} passage of {{federal civil rights}} legislation in the mid-1960s and enforcement of constitutional rights by the federal government, {{the influence of the}} Councils had waned considerably yet remained an institutional basis for the majority of white residents in Mississippi. The successor organization to the White Citizens' Councils is the St. Louis-based Council of Conservative Citizens, founded in 1985 to continue collaborations between Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist political agendas in the United States. Republican politician and past Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi was a member while North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms and Georgia Congressman Bob Barr were both strong supporters of the Council of Conservative Citizens; David Duke also spoke at a fund raising event, while Patrick Buchanan's campaign manager was linked to both Duke and the Council.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study examined <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> secondary principals' beliefs, values, and leadership practices {{that contribute to}} successful urban schools. Narrative inquiry was used to investigate the factors that influenced the leadership practices [...] and related education environment success [...] of six <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> public school principals from six different secondary urban schools in Ohio.

These findings highlight several implications for consideration: (a) social and systemic issues severely distract <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> urban school leaders from their educational focus; (b) attention needs {{to be given to}} the critical dual role of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> principals; and (c) focus needs to be directed toward developing and then hiring qualified <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> principals...|$|R
40|$|Educational {{and public}} {{narratives}} on the achievement outcomes of Black boys in mathematics {{are too often}} negative. Contrary to these negative narratives, however, research affirms positive outcomes for students, including Black boys, when engaged in caring teacher–student relationships (see, e. g., Bartell, 2011; Roberts, 2009; Steele, 1992). Considering the growing importance of mathematics both nationally and globally, {{an investigation into the}} benefits of such caring relationship is important. But literature specific to caring teacher−student relationships, <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students, and mathematics teaching and learning is all but nonexistent. For this reason, I sought to uncover the definition that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students had of teacher care, and how, if at all, an <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> teacher might influence their perceptions of teacher care. Additionally, I was intrigued with and wished to uncover any influence an <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> teacher might have on <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students’ attitudes toward mathematics. The purpose of this qualitative study, therefore, was to explore the influence a “successful” <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> teacher had on three <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students’ perceptions of teacher care and their attitudes toward mathematics. This critical ethnography was guided by an intersection of an eclectic array of theoretical traditions (Stinson, 2009), including care theory (e. g., Gilligan, 1982; Noddings, 1992), critical race theory (e. g., Ladson-Billings, 1998), and culturally relevant pedagogy (e. g., Ladson-Billings, 1992). This eclectic array aligned with both the philosophical foundations of the project and the methodological procedures employed. The project used ethnographic methods—specifically, participant observations and semi-structured interviews—during data collection. Data analysis identified six overarching themes that the participants used to describe teacher care: (a) motivation, (b) culture, (c) confidence, (d) discipline, (e) concern for futures, and (f) environment. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} teachers should reconsider the ways they care for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students, specifically, in the mathematics classroom, and that a caring teacher–student relationship has a positive influence on <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students’ attitudes toward mathematics as well as their descriptions and perceptions of teacher care...|$|R

As police vehicles began racing down Superior Avenue to reach E. 120th Street, E. 123rd Street, Lakeview Road, and E. 124th Street, the crowd began throwing rocks at police and jeering them. At 9:15 PM, Mayor Stokes called Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes to inform him that a riot in Cleveland was likely. The governor called Major General Sylvester Del Corso, Adjutant General of the Ohio Army National Guard, and had the National Guard placed on alert. By 9:30 PM, the crowd numbered close to a thousand, mostly young adult, teenage, and pre-adolescent <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>males.</b> About this time, the Glenville riots broke out. A Molotov cocktail hit a marked police vehicle, causing it to burst into flames.

A black Cleveland Police officer, Herbert Reed, was pulled from his vehicle and savagely beaten. Two television news vehicles were also set aflame.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{esophageal cancer}} is the seventh-leading {{cause of cancer death}} among males (making up 4% of the total). The National Cancer Institute {{estimated}} there were about 18,000 new cases and more than 15,000 deaths from esophageal cancer in 2013 (the American Cancer Society estimated that during 2014, about 18,170 new esophageal cancer cases would be diagnosed, resulting in 15,450 deaths). The squamous-cell carcinoma type is more common among <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>males</b> with a history of heavy smoking or alcohol use. Until the 1970s, squamous-cell carcinoma accounted {{for the vast majority of}} esophageal cancers in the United States. In recent decades, incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (which is associated with Barrett's esophagus) steadily rose in the United States to the point that it has now surpassed squamous-cell carcinoma. In contrast to squamous-cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma is more common in Caucasian men (over the age of 60) than it is in African Americans. Multiple reports indicate esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence has increased during the past 20 years, especially in non-Hispanic white men. Esophageal adenocarcinoma age-adjusted incidence increased in New Mexico from 1973 to 1997. This increase was found in non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics and became predominant in non-Hispanic whites. Esophageal cancer incidence and mortality rates for African Americans continue to be higher than the rate for Causasians. However, incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer has significantly decreased among African Americans since the early 1980s, whereas with Caucasians it has continued to increase. Between 1975 and 2004, incidence of the adenocarcinoma type increased among white American males by over 460% and among white American females by 335%.|$|E

[...] But what these folklorists had merely recommended John and Alan Lomax were able to put into practice.

[...] They toured Texas prison farms recording work songs, reels, ballads, and blues from prisoners such as James [...] "Iron Head" [...] Baker, Mose [...] "Clear Rock" [...] Platt, and Lightnin' Washington.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine and {{interpret}} the life experiences and leadership practices of four <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> superintendents leading urban school districts across the nation. The research approach adopted in this dissertation used semi-structured interviews with four <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> superintendents that consisted of three main issues: (1) <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> superintendent identity, (2) <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> superintendent leadership, and (3) acts of equity leadership related to student outcomes. The findings of this study revealed that participants do not allow themselves to be defined by their positions, and they honor their responsibilities as educational leaders who have devoted their lives to providing a quality education for their students. Each participant acknowledged that certain aspects of their jobs may be affected by their race, yet each expressed the importance of focusing on the work and remaining committed to reaching their goals for the districts they lead. The superintendents expressed importance of collaborative leadership that is inclusive of all stakeholders while they embraced the responsibilities carried by the positions they hold. The thoughts, expressions, and sometimes emotions conveyed by the superintendents provide a clear view into who they are, how they lead, and what they are about as urban school district leaders. This study reveals that superintendents? top priority is to ensure that every student has access to a quality education.

40|$|The {{research}} literature regarding <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> college students reports {{that they often}} experience difficulties with mathematics (Stage 2 ̆ 6 Kloosterman, 1995; Treisman, 1992). It is also reported that many <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students enter college seeking to complete their degrees in mathematics and science, but few of these students successfully complete the core requirements (Hrabowski, Maton, 2 ̆ 6 Greif, 1998; Treisman, 1992). In spite of these reported trends, there are some <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students who, indeed, achieve in college mathematics. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze how being <b>African</b> <b>American</b> and <b>male</b> might play out in the college mathematics experiences of high-achieving <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men. Employing qualitative research methodology, specifically, multiple case study research (Bogdan 2 ̆ 6 Biklen, 2007; Merriam, 1998) situated in critical race theory (CRT; Bell, 1992; Tate, 1997), I administered a survey instrument, conducted three interviews, and solicited artifacts from four <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men who are currently pursuing graduate degrees in mathematics or mathematics education. Coupling multiple case study research with CRT, I explored how they gained access to college mathematics, how they achieved in college mathematics, and how their race and/or racism affected their performance in mathematics. An analysis of the data revealed that the participants’ achievement and persistence in mathematics was explained, in part, by the participants’ (a) internal characteristics such as strong cultural identities as <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men, persistent attitudes, and spiritual connections; (b) ability to negotiate racial injustices as <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men; (c) positive mathematics identities developed as undergraduate mathematics majors at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs); and (d) positive outlooks concerning the participation of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>male</b> students in mathematics.
