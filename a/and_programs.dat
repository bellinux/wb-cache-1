In addi-tion to reintroducing the contributions of SIMULA and the Scandina-vian approach to object-oriented programming, we do this by discussing a number of issues in modeling <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> <b>and</b> argue 3 why we consider a unified approach to be an advantage. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Program</b> schemata <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> {{techniques}} {{provide a}} mechanism for representing the essential characteristics of logic programs. By abstracting out common recursive control flow patterns, program schemata capture large classes of logic programs. Programming techniques represent common program components. By instantiating portions of program schemata with programming techniques, {{it is possible to}} generate arbitrary logic programs. In order to represent <b>program</b> schemata <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> techniques for any programming language, it is desirable to use a higher-order programming language as the representation language. �Prolog is a higher-order logic programming language that extends Prolog by incorporating higher-order unification and �-terms, making it an ideal logic programming language for representing logic <b>program</b> schemata <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> techniques. Because �Prolog <b>program</b> schemata <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> techniques can be represented in �Prolog, {{there is no need for}} the creation of an abstract meta-language in order to define <b>and</b> classify logic <b>program</b> schemata <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> techniques. ...|$|R
