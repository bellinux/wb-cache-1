2500|$|The basal or resting {{heart rate}} (HRrest) {{is defined as}} the heart rate when a person is awake, in a {{neutrally}} temperate environment, and has not been subject to any recent exertion or stimulation, such as stress or surprise. Most texts cite the typical resting heart rate in adults as 60–100 beats per minute (bpm). A large body of evidence indicates that the normal range is actually 50-90 beats per minute. For example, all-cause mortality is increased by 1.22 (hazard ratio) when heart rate exceeds 90 beats per minute. The mortality rate of patients with myocardial infarction increased from 15% to 41% if their admission heart rate was greater than 90 beats per minute. ECG of 46,129 individuals with low risk for cardiovascular disease revealed that 96% had resting heart rates ranging from 48-98 beats per minute. Finally, expert consensus reveals that 98% of cardiologists believe that the [...] "60 to 100" [...] range is too high, with a vast majority of them agreeing that 50 to 90 beats per minute is more appropriate. The normal resting heart rate is based on the <b>at-rest</b> firing rate of the heart's sinoatrial node, where the faster pacemaker cells driving the self-generated rhythmic firing and responsible for the heart's autorhythmicity are located.

50|$|The M86 antipersonnel mine is {{manually}} armed {{by removing}} the safety clip and then the arming strap assembly. A camming action breaks the shorting bar and forces the battery ball against the battery breaking the glass ampule containing an electrolyte which activates the reserve battery and provides power. The shorting bar hook, attached to the cam, shears the shorting bar (a safety device across the detonator). After a 60-second (nominal) electronic time delay, a piston actuator in the Safe and Arm mechanism is electrically fired, moving a slider to align the detonator with an explosive lead in the slider. At the same time, seven sensor triplines are released. Approximately three or four triplines will deploy up to 20 feet from the mine, depending upon the <b>at-rest</b> position of the mine. The remaining triplines may be hindered due to their proximity to the resting surface. After an additional 10-second electronic time delay, allowing the munition to return to equilibrium, the mine is fully armed electronically.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the reliability, responsiveness, and validity of the VAFS. Methods. Twenty-one people post-stroke (12 males, age[*] = 59. 5 ± 10. 3 years; time post-stroke[*] = 4. 1 ± 3. 5 years) participated. Subjects underwent a standardized fatigue-inducing exercise; fatigue level was assessed at rest, immediately after exercise, and after recovery. The same protocol was repeated after 14 days. Results. ICC values for the VAFS at rest was 0. 851 (CI[*]=[*] 95 %, 0. 673 [*]∼[*] 0. 936, P <. 001), immediately after exercise was 0. 846 (CI[*]=[*] 95 %, 0. 663 [*]∼[*] 0. 934, P <. 001), and 15 minutes after exercise was 0. 888 (CI[*]=[*] 95 %, 0. 749 [*]∼[*] 0. 953, P <. 001).

40|$|Normally, suction-controlled {{triaxial}} {{tests are}} used to characterize soil behavior in constitutive modeling of unsaturated soils. However, this type of tests requires sophisticated equipment and is time-consuming. This {{has been one of}} the major obstacles to the implementation and dissemination of unsaturated soil mechanics beyond the research context. In contrast to suction-controlled triaxial tests, the suction-controlled oedometer test requires simpler equipment and a shorter testing period. Oedometer tests represent the <b>at-rest</b> earth pressure (K 0) condition, which is an important stress state in any simulation. The major disadvantage of the oedometer test is that its lateral stress is controlled by the condition of zero lateral strain and remains unknown during the testing process. At present, no well-established, simple, and objective methods are available that take advantage of oedometer test results for constitutive modeling purposes. This paper derives an explicit formulation of the <b>at-rest</b> coefficient for unsaturated soils and develops an optimization approach for simple and objective identification of material parameters in elasto-plastic models for unsaturated soils using the results from suction-controlled oedometer tests. This is achieved by combining a modified state surface approach (MSSA), recently proposed to model the elasto-plastic behavior of unsaturated soils, with the quasi-Newton method to simultaneously calibrate all parameters governing virgin behavior in elasto-plastic models.
