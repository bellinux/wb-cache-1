Archbishop Robert of Esztergom baptised him on 18 October. The child, heir <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> birth, was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} caterpillars and pupae used for classification are {{completely different from}} that of adults; different classification schemes are sometimes provided separately for classifying adults, larvae and pupae. The characteristics of immature stages are increasingly used for taxonomic purposes as they provide insights into systematics and phylogenies of Lepidoptera that are not <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> examination of adults.|$|E
5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in mineralogy {{at this time}} is also <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy. Beginning in 1808, while at the Surrey Institution, Accum also published, {{a series of articles}} on the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander Tilloch's Philosophical Journal.|$|E

5|$|Many Māori {{place names}} possess either {{historical}} or mythological significance. Their meaning {{is not always}} <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> literal translations {{and they have been}} passed down through oral tradition. Before European arrival, place names commemorated notable or historical incidents, described features of the location or were derived from traditional Hawaiki names or myths. After European arrival many locations became known as Māori versions of European words or poorly pronounced contractions of the original Māori names.|$|E
5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life in biblical times is <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, wine {{is used as a}} symbol of abundance, and of physical blessing. Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and wrath.|$|E
5|$|The work's moralising tone is <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> some of {{its more}} overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath {{the weight of the}} damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more {{numerous}} and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it can be compared to Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying.|$|E

5|$|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{defines a}} Malay as a Malaysian citizen {{born to a}} Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, adheres to Malay customs, and is {{domiciled}} in Malaysia or Singapore. Though this definition is not according to ancestry lineage, it is however correct {{in the sense of}} social behaviours. Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour, is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic groups as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{of females}} in {{southern}} Texas revealed that ovaries are developed by {{two years of}} age and the first birth takes place typically a year later, though in a few cases females as young as one-and-a-half years may mate successfully. Females can breed again around a year after parturition. Males in the same location were found to have active testes by the age of three years, that matured considerably by the next year. Males become sexually active at four or five years. Mating may occur throughout the year, with peaks of three to four months. The time of the year when these peaks occur varies geographically. In Texas, a peak is <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> December to March. In Bharatpur National Park (Rajasthan, India) the breeding season is from October to February, peaking in November and December. The Sariska reserve witnesses a similar peak in December and January.|$|E
5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E

5|$|Taken together, the {{injuries}} {{appear to be}} a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on the corpse. The body wounds show that the corpse had been stripped of its armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a backplate and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from behind on the back and buttocks while they were exposed to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with the legs and arms dangling down on either side. There may have been further flesh wounds not <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> the bones.|$|E
5|$|The Selfe family {{landed at}} Sydney's Semi-circular Quay in January 1855, when Norman was 15 years old. One {{of the reasons}} they emigrated to the colony of New South Wales was to enable him and his brother Harry to {{undertake}} engineering apprenticeships without having to pay the heavy premium required by large firms in London. They initially resided in the nearby Rocks district in a small house that had previously been the first Sydney home of Mary Reibey, a former convict who became Australia's first businesswoman. Selfe's parents had high expectations of their children, particularly of Norman, whose ability in mathematics and draughtsmanship was <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> a young age. The brothers earned a reputation for innovation during their youth, and were the first to construct a velocipede in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Project A119 remained largely secret until the mid-1990s, when writer Keay Davidson discovered the story while researching {{the life of}} Carl Sagan for a biography. Sagan's involvement with the project was <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> his application for an academic scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley's Miller Institute in 1959. In the application, Sagan gave details of the project research, which Davidson felt constituted a violation of national security. The leak consisted of Sagan revealing the titles of two classified papers from the A119 project—the 1958 paper Possible Contribution of Lunar Nuclear Weapons Detonations to the Solution of Some Problems in Planetary Astronomy, and the 1959 paper Radiological Contamination of the Moon by Nuclear Weapons Detonations. A 1958 paper titled Cosmic Radiation and Lunar Radioactivity, credited to I. Filosofo, was also named by Sagan in a 1961 paper written for the United States National Research Council. These were among the eight reports created by the project, {{all of which were}} destroyed in 1987.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> the end of episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character {{who has not been}} seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E
5|$|The kakapo {{was a very}} {{successful}} species in pre-human New Zealand, {{and one of the}} reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually (with the exception of owls) hunt by day. Apart from the two surviving New Zealand raptors, the New Zealand falcon and swamp harrier, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier. All four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid these avian predators, the kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. In addition, when the kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night, when the laughing owl was active, and it is <b>apparent</b> <b>from</b> their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the kakapo was among their prey.|$|E
