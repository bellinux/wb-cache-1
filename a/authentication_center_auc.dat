40|$|Abstract—In {{universal}} {{mobile telecommunication}} system (UMTS), authentication functions are utilized {{to identify and}} authenticate a mobile station (MS) and validate the service request type {{to ensure that the}} user is authorized to use the particular network services. The authenticating parties are the <b>authentication</b> <b>center</b> (<b>AuC)</b> in the home network and the MS. In UMTS, the serving general packet radio service support node (SGSN) accesses the AuC to obtain the authentication data, and delegates the AuC to perform mutual authentication with the MS. Since the cost for accessing AuC is expensive, the SGSN may obtain an array of authentication vectors (AVs) at a time so that the number of accesses can be reduced. On the other hand, if the size of the AV array is large, the AV array transmission from the AuC to the SGSN may be expensive. Thus, it is desirable to select an appropriate value to minimize the authentication network signaling cost. We propose an analytic model to investigate the impact of on the network signaling traffic, which is validated by simulation experiments. Then, we propose an automatic-selection mechanism that dynamically selects the size of the AV array to reduce the network signaling cost. Our study indicates that the automatic-selection mechanism effectively identifies appropriate size of the authentication vector array.

Because time-domain distortions like TSM or jittering may occur before verification, the beat sequence of the susceptible music and that of its original version registered in the <b>authentication</b> <b>center</b> are not guaranteed to be the same. Therefore, beat alignment is firstly performed by virtue of dynamic time warping. Next, the chroma-based robust hash of the received music is calculated and compared with its original data stored in the <b>authentication</b> <b>center.</b> By using fuzzy logic, we calculate the hash difference's confidence belonging to acceptable operations and malicious modifications, respectively, thereby make the final decision of authentication.|$|R

40|$|The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) {{represents}} an evolution {{in terms of}} capacity, data speeds and new service capabilities from second generation mobile networks. It also provides more secure wireless access security mechanisms. One of these mechanisms, the authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol, {{is designed to help}} a foreign network to authenticate a roaming mobile user through authentication vectors generated by the <b>authentication</b> <b>center</b> (<b>AuC)</b> in the user’s home network. However, AKA has been criticized due to its introduction of sequence numbers and its vulnerabilities of redirection attacks and active attacks in corrupted networks. Moreover, since only the home network can generate authentication vectors to its subscribers, the AuC actually becomes the traffic bottleneck. This paper proposes an enhanced AKA based on vector combination (VC-AKA) to eliminate the above drawbacks. Through vector combination, a size n array of authentication vectors can realize up to 2 n− 1 times mutual authentication instead of only n times in UMTS AKA. Hence, the traffic for the home network to generate authentication vectors is exponentially decreased. Also, VC-AKA abandons the employment of sequence numbers and no more re-synchronization procedure needed as in UMTS AKA. Through security analysis and comparison with related work, we show that VC-AKA is more efficient and secure...|$|E
40|$|Milenage {{algorithm}} {{applies the}} block cipher Rijnadael (AES) with 128 bit key and 128 bit block size. This algorithm {{is used in}} the 3 GPP authentication and key generation functions (f 1, f 1 *, f 2, f 3, f 4, f 5 and f 5 *) for mobile communication systems (GSM/UMTS/LTE). In this paper a modification of Milenage algorithm is proposed through a dynamic change of S-box in AES depending on secret key. To get a new secret key for every authentication process we add the random number (RAND) transmitted from the <b>authentication</b> <b>center</b> (<b>AUC)</b> to the contents of the fixed stored secret key (Ki) and thus the initialization of the AES will be different each new authentication process. For every change in secret key a new S-box is derived from the standard one by permuting its rows and columns {{with the help of a}} new designed PN sequence generator. A complete simulation of modified Milenage and PN sequence generator is done using Microcontroller (PIC 18 F 452). security analysis is applied using Avalanche test to compare between the original and modified Milenage. Tests proved that the modified algorithm is more secure than the original one due to the dynamic behavior of S-box with every change of the secret key and immunity against linear and differential cryptanalysis using Avalanche tests. This makes the modified Milenage more suitable for the applications of authentication techniques specially for mobile communication systems...|$|E

This project will attempt to answer these questions, both by understanding which security mechanisms are recommended in the standards and other relevant documentations, and by trying to acquire information about and assess the current practice and operation with respect to communication security techniques used between the serving and home network in the roaming situation, and within each mobile operator domain communication with the <b>Authentication</b> <b>Center</b> (<b>AuC).</b> Then, based on the collected information and its best interpretation, try to construct a realistic scenario and software simulation that shows that a mix-up attack can be attainable in practice.
