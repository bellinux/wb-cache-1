5|$|Nielsen {{had five}} children, {{two of them}} illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met <b>Anne</b> <b>Marie.</b> In 1912, an illegitimate {{daughter}} was born– Rachel Siegmann, about whom <b>Anne</b> <b>Marie</b> never learned. With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied music theory with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert Møller (1893–1978), a medical doctor who became {{a professor at the}} University of Copenhagen and director of the polyclinic at the National Hospital.

Savoy fared particularly badly against the larger French forces resulting in a siege of Turin in 1706. <b>Anne</b> <b>Marie's</b> uncle, Louis XIV (along with Spanish forces from <b>Anne</b> <b>Marie's</b> second cousin Philip V of Spain), besieged Turin during the Battle of Turin. French troops were under the control of <b>Anne</b> <b>Marie's</b> half brother, the Duke of Orléans. She and her sons were forced to flee Turin with the grandmother for the safety of Genoa.

5|$|Into Temptation was {{produced}} by Coyle's production company, Ten Ten Films, and the company Farnam Street II, in association with Cabin 14 Productions.

5000|$|This {{volume is}} the most revised of the Nesthäkchen books. In the original, <b>Anne</b> <b>Marie's</b> school year goes by the old count: {{in the eighth grade}} she {{advances}} to the seventh. In later editions, it is her third year and she advances to her fourth year. In the 1921 edition <b>Anne</b> <b>Marie's</b> friend Gerda was from Breslau, the capital of Lower Silesia. After 1945 Gerda was from Munich, capital of Bavaria. In the original [...] "Princess Heinrich" [...] (that is Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine, 1866-1953, wife of Prince Heinrich, brother of Kaiser Wilhelm II) visited the island and the children's sanitorium. In later editions Princess Heinrich became the young queen of Denmark. A final chapter, “War Time,” added after 1945 to maintain continuity of the series after volume 4 was dropped, was a politically correct abridgement of the original version of Volume 4, Nesthäkchen and the World War. The further course of the First World War is reduced to, [...] "However, the terrible war had ended a short time later." [...] <b>Anne</b> <b>Marie's</b> girlfriend Vera, who appears in Volume 4, is introduced in the new chapter with a few words. Vera's oppressive history, a chilling example of relational aggression that is left out, is not only {{one of the most important}} and most instructive episodes in <b>Anne</b> <b>Marie's</b> life, but also one of Ury’s major literary achievements (see Nesthäkchen and the World War). By 1996 the publisher had dispensed with the new chapter [...] "War Time," [...] and the story ends, as it did in 1921, with Annemarie's return to her home in Berlin.|$|R
5|$|Unidentified police sources {{alleged that}} Condit had {{admitted}} to {{an affair with}} Levy during an interview with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation {{and was surprised to}} find out that the lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant <b>Anne</b> <b>Marie</b> Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor Connie Chung on the ABC News program Primetime Thursday. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media's coverage of the Levy case.|$|E
