5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of alcoholism, the {{lifetime}} suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E

Letters to The Straits Times criticised the poor coverage of the Paralympics. Many Singaporeans also commented about the disparity of the cash awards handed out by the government: S$1,000,000 for an Olympic gold and S$100,000 for a Paralympic gold. When the issues were raised in Parliament, MCYS parliamentary secretary Teo Ser Luck promised to study plans to give disabled athletes greater support and to include them in sporting programmes such as Project 0812, a training programme for top Singaporean sportspeople. Two months later, the cash rewards for Paralympic medals were doubled and funding for the Singapore National Paralympic Council was increased.|$|E

50|$|If {{preferences}} reverse {{based on}} inconsequential aspects {{of how the}} problem is framed, people cannot possibly be maximizing expected utility.

Decision-making in matters as important as lives saved or lives lost can reverse risk preference.

No differentiation is made between an integer and floating-point value: some implementations may treat 42, 42.0, and 4.2E+1 as the same number while others may not. Furthermore, no requirements are made regarding implementation issues such as overflow, underflow, loss of precision, or rounding. Additionally, JSON says nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of signed zeros: whether 0.0 is distinct from -0.0.

25|$|While {{some say}} that blanket consent, or the general consent to {{unspecified}} treatment given by patients beforehand, is ethical, others argue that patients should always obtain specific information about {{the name of the}} drug they are receiving, its side effects, and other treatment options.

The policy of detaining asylum-seeking children was to be abandoned as part of the coalition agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who formed a government in May 2010. However, in July 2010 the government was accused of back-tracking on this promise after the Immigration Minister Damian Green announced that the plan was to minimise, rather than end, child detention.|$|E

Furthermore, holding such strong moral convictions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fair <b>treatment</b> of their group causes the prevention-oriented to disregard societal rules against hostile forms of collective action (i. e., forms of action that are aimed at harming the interests of those held responsible for the group's disadvantage).
