50|$|Another {{distinction}} is between net and gross return. The 'pure' net {{return to the}} investor is the return net of all fees, expenses, <b>and</b> <b>taxes,</b> whereas the 'pure' gross return is the return before all fees, expenses, <b>and</b> <b>taxes.</b> Various variations between these two extremes exist. Which return one looks at depends on what one is trying to measure. For example, if one wishes to measure the ability of an investment manager to add value, then the return net of transaction expenses, but gross of all other fees, expenses, <b>and</b> <b>taxes</b> is an appropriate measure to look at since fees, expenses, <b>and</b> <b>taxes</b> other than transaction expenses are often outside {{the control of the}} investment manager.|$|R
