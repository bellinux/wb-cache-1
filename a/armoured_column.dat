5|$|Although {{the arms}} of the encirclement had now made contact, the Allies were not yet astride Seventh Army's escape route in any great {{strength}} and their positions came under frenzied assault. During the day an <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> from the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, capturing half the village and maintaining an open road for six hours until being forced out. Many Germans escaped along this route and numerous small parties infiltrated on foot through to the River Dives during the night.|$|E
5|$|By 17 August the encirclement was incomplete. The 1st Polish Armoured Division, {{part of the}} First Canadian Army, {{was divided}} into three battlegroups and ordered to make a wide sweep to the {{south-east}} to meet American troops at Chambois. Trun fell to the 4th Canadian Armoured Division on 18 August. Having captured Champeaux on 19 August, the Polish battlegroups converged on Chambois, and with reinforcements from the 4th Canadian Armoured Division, the Poles secured the town and linked up with the US 90th and French 2nd Armoured divisions by evening. The Allies were not yet astride the 7th Army escape route in any great strength, and their positions were attacked by German troops inside the pocket. An <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> of the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, took half the village and kept a road open for six hours until nightfall. Many Germans escaped, and small parties made their way through to the Dives during the night.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Army {{also began}} to {{withdraw}} southwards on 9 April, and on 10 April it quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation {{in the face of}} two determined armoured thrusts by the XLVI Motorised Corps, one of which captured Zagreb that evening. Italian offensive operations also began, with thrusts towards Ljubljana and down the Adriatic coast, capturing over 30,000 Yugoslav troops near Delnice. When fifth column elements arrested the staffs of 1st Army Group, 4th Army and 7th Army on 11 April, the 1st Army Group effectively ceased to exist. On 12 April, a German <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> linked up with the Italians near the Adriatic coast, encircling the remnants of the withdrawing 7th Army. Remnants of the 4th Army attempted to establish defensive positions in northeastern Bosnia, but were quickly brushed aside by German armour as it drove towards Sarajevo. The Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered on 18 April.|$|E

50|$|Despite this, the Soviet <b>armoured</b> <b>columns</b> made a {{slow but}} regular progress, {{entering}} Khost on December 30. Soviet and DRA outposts were maintained {{to keep the}} Gardez-Khost road open, but were withdrawn {{at the end of}} January.|$|R
50|$|After the D-Day {{landings}} in 1944, Boardman was detailed {{to act as}} navigator {{for four}} <b>armoured</b> <b>columns</b> formed from the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, and 1st Battalion Black Watch. The columns were to take Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil, about 20 kilometres south of Caen.|$|R
5|$|The 1974 Portuguese Carnation Revolution {{against the}} authoritarian Estado Novo {{returned}} Portugal to a multi-party system and facilitated {{the independence of}} the Portuguese colonies Angola and East Timor. In Africa, where Angolan rebels had waged a multi-faction independence war against Portuguese rule since 1961, a two-decade civil war replaced the anti-colonial struggle as fighting erupted between the communist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), backed by the Cubans and the Soviets, and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), backed by the United States, the People's Republic of China, and Mobutu's government in Zaire. The United States, the apartheid government of South Africa, and several other African governments also supported a third faction, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Without bothering to consult the Soviets in advance, the Cuban government sent a number of combat troops to fight alongside the MPLA. Foreign mercenaries and a South African <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> were deployed to support UNITA, but the MPLA, bolstered by Cuban personnel and Soviet assistance, eventually gained the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|A {{short while}} later a German <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> was seen {{advancing}} from Oudna, and Frost decided {{to set an}} ambush to try to destroy it; the leading elements of the column, however, surprised a group of paratroopers filling water bottles at a nearby well, the ambush was sprung too early, inflicting only a single casualty. The battalion was understrength, having taken casualties at Oudna, and was running low on ammunition, but it managed to drive off the column with mortar fire; however, this was only a brief respite. Two armoured cars and a tank was seen to be moving towards the battalion from a different direction, reportedly sporting recognition signals of British First Army; Frost sent a party out to greet the vehicles, only {{for them to be}} taken prisoner and it to be revealed that the vehicles were German with captured equipment. The German commander sent one of the captured paratroopers with a message demanding Frost surrender, but he refused to comply; instead he ordered that the radios and mortars were to be destroyed and the battalion would evacuate westwards towards Allied lines, approximately fifty miles away. The battalion managed to withdraw to higher ground, but suffered a number of casualties from the German armour as it did so. Now positioned on the high ground, which consisted of a ridge crowned by two small hills, the paratroopers were attacked by tanks and infantry supported by heavy mortar fire. The battalion suffered a number of casualties but was saved by the unexpected intervention of German aircraft; mistaking their troops for the paratroopers, they knocked out several tanks and inflicted heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|The Squadron {{did not see}} {{action in}} the Battle of France {{on the first day}} of the campaign—10 May—but many other Battle squadrons did and {{suffered}} high losses attacking German ground forces. The squadron's airfield came under air attack from the first day. Junkers Ju 88s destroyed hangars and two aircraft in a night attack. On 11 May it was bombed again and three of four aircraft were lost attacking German Army columns in daylight hours. On 14 May McLachlan flew his first sortie over the Sedan bridgeheads. The German thrust at Sedan threatened to outflank the Maginot Line in the south and the Allied Armies in the north by breaking through in the centre and advancing to the English Channel. On 12 May Sedan fell. Heinz Guderian's XIX Panzer Corps and Georg-Hans Reinhardt's XXXXI Panzer Corps were breaking through onto the west bank on the 14 May. Desperate to halt the attacks, General Marcel Têtu, commander of the Allied Tactical Air Forces in consultation with Air Vice-Marshal Playfair, commander of the AASF, ordered all available units to attack. No. 88 Squadron was committed to the air offensive. Six aircraft attacked <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> positions, four attacked bridges. One aircraft was lost. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire and German fighter opposition MacLachlan attacked and got away at low altitude. Allied units suffered 50 percent losses that day. On 15 May the airfield was hit twice again and the squadron moved back near Troyes.|$|E
50|$|About {{the same}} time, {{multiple}} reports indicated separatist militias were receiving reinforcements {{that allowed them}} to turn the tables on government forces. <b>Armoured</b> <b>columns</b> coming from Russia also pushed into southern Donetsk Oblast and reportedly captured the town of Novoazovsk, clashing with Ukrainian forces and opening a new front in the Donbass conflict.|$|R
50|$|For {{his role}} in the action Flying Officer McPherson was {{presented}} with one of the first two DFCs of the war by King George VI himself. On 12 May 1940 he was killed when his Blenheim was shot down by German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters near Lanaken, Belgium whilst on a mission to bomb <b>armoured</b> <b>columns.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 38 combat {{missions}} were flown by jet and helicopter pilots of the Free Libyan Air Force throughout March until the No Fly Zone was imposed, effectively grounding the small air force. Nine of these strikes {{were carried out}} by the rebels three Mi-35 helicopters gunships against Gaddafi's <b>armoured</b> <b>columns</b> advancing on Benghazi, one of which was destroyed.|$|R
5|$|By 1 January 1945 {{the threat}} to Charleville had eased {{sufficiently}} for the division {{to be transferred to}} another area of the Ardennes, being transported to an area south-west of Bastogne near the village of Morhet on 3 January; there it relieved the 11th Armored Division which had occupied the village prior to its arrival. On 4 January the division entered combat for the first time when it was ordered alongside the 87th Infantry Division to seize a number of key towns to the west of Bastogne, in order to prevent German forces from encircling the town a second time; it had been relieved by the Third Army on 26 December. With the 87th Infantry Division on its left flank, the division advanced towards German positions with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment and 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment forming the division's assault element; the 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment and the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment moved behind these two regiments to deal with expected German armoured counter-attacks against them. During its initial advance the division engaged German forces, including infantry and armour, in an attempt to secure a narrow, high-rimmed road to the north-west of Bastogne; during a battle that lasted three days the division suffered nearly 1,000 casualties attempting to hold what the division's official historian labeled 'Dead Man's Ridge'. It was during the opening stages of this battle that the division earned its first Medal of Honor. Staff Sergeant Isadore S. Jachman of the 513th Parachute Infantry engaged and destroyed with a bazooka two German tanks that formed part of an <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> attacking American positions, forcing the column to retreat but simultaneously being killed by machine gun fire. Between 19 and 26 January, the division broke through German lines and captured several towns before linking up with elements of the British 51st Infantry Division. After it had captured the town of Espeler on 26 January the entire division was withdrawn from the front and transported by truck to Luxembourg, effectively ending its participation in the Ardennes campaign.|$|E
25|$|Operation Silver (April 5): A 1,000-strong group {{composed}} of a heliborne force of U.S. paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division, along with an <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> of 250 Royal Marines cleared the town of Sangin, that had been mostly abandoned by the Taliban.|$|E
25|$|The <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> led by Peiper {{continued}} west toward Ligneuville. The German troops {{left behind}} assembled the American prisoners {{in a field}} along with other prisoners captured earlier in the day. Many of the survivors testified that about 120 troops {{were standing in the}} field when, for unknown reasons, the SS troops suddenly opened fire with machine guns on the prisoners. Several POWs later testified that a few of the prisoners had tried to escape, and others claimed that some prisoners had picked up their previously discarded weapons and shot at the German troops when they attempted to continue toward Ligneuville.|$|E
50|$|The Laté 298s {{first saw}} action during the Battle of France in 1940. They were used at first for {{maritime}} patrol and anti-submarine duties, {{but did not}} meet any German ships. Later, as the Wehrmacht drove through France, {{they were used to}} harass and interdict <b>armoured</b> <b>columns.</b> Despite not having been designed for this role, they suffered fewer losses than units equipped with other types.|$|R
5000|$|Ukrainian Forces {{surrounded}} Sloviansk {{supported by}} multiple <b>armoured</b> <b>columns,</b> and warned civilians to stay indoors {{ahead of a}} planned offensive on 25 April. The pro-Russian militant commander Ponomarev threatened to turn Sloviansk into a [...] "Stalingrad" [...] if Ukrainian troops were to enter the town. He also reported that only one checkpoint {{to the east of}} Sloviansk remained under separatist control, while the rest had been captured the previous day.|$|R
50|$|On 2 September 1939, one PZL.23B of the 21st Squadron bombed {{a factory}} in Ohlau, the first bomb attack on the German Third Reich. The PZL.23 bomber squadrons also {{attacked}} German <b>armoured</b> <b>columns,</b> especially on 3 September 1939, while the main mission of the Army squadrons was reconnaissance. The five squadrons of the Bomber Brigade delivered about 52-60 tons of bombs during the campaign, the Army squadrons added about another dozen tons.|$|R
25|$|A {{disastrous}} {{series of}} withdrawals followed {{in which the}} regiment lost all of its equipment. A week later, further withdrawals took them towards Elasson, where the regiment was briefly attached {{in support of the}} 6th New Zealand Brigade. On 18 April, the fighting was so intense that the regiment's guns fire over 6,000 rounds in a twenty-four-hour period as it attempted to thwart the advance of a German <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> near Mount Olympus. Later the regiment supported the 4th New Zealand Brigade around Erithrai. Finally, on 27 April the regiment was evacuated from Greece on board HMS Ajax and withdrawn back to Crete.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneer {{had spotted}} an {{advancing}} column of around 30 assorted AFVs, APCs, T-34 tanks and other vehicles advancing slowly {{up the road}} from Techamutete. It immediately opened fire on the column, destroying three BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers in the process, but then {{had to return to}} Grootfontein air force base to re-arm and refuel, leaving about 200 of the remaining paratroopers temporarily unprotected. All that stood between them and the advancing <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> were the 22 men of the anti-tank platoon, armed only with 10 RPG-7 rocket launchers and five anti-tank mines which they had planted in the road.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October, an <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> of Gurkhas and RESPFOR entered Suai {{together}} with RESPFOR in Black Hawks, capturing 116 militia; however, {{a number of}} SASR personnel were later ambushed, resulting in two Australians wounded. In the counter-attack two militia were killed, while two escaped but were later found to have died of wounds. Meanwhile, a third Australian battalion—the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (5/7 RAR)—had arrived in Dili relieving 3 RAR. On 10 October, 3 RAR was inserted into Bobonaro and Maliana by helicopter and V Company, 1 RNZIR was inserted in Suai also by Black Hawks relieving the Gurkhas/RESPFOR. The same day a platoon from 2 RAR was fired on by Indonesian police near Mota'ain on the border, and in the ensuing clash one Indonesian was killed.|$|E
50|$|Weygand {{arrived on}} 17 May and started by {{cancelling}} the flank counter-offensive ordered by Gamelin, {{to cut off}} the enemy <b>armoured</b> <b>columns</b> which had punched through the French front at the Ardennes. Thus he lost two crucial days before finally adopting the solution, however obvious, of his predecessor. But it was by then a failed manoeuvre, because during the 48 lost hours, the German infantry had caught up behind their tanks in the breakthrough and had consolidated their gains.|$|R
25|$|The British {{captured}} Gilan-e-Gharb {{and attacked}} Iranian forces who defended {{the town of}} Sarpol-e-Zahab. With overwhelming firepower and decreasing Iranian morale, the British captured that town, scattering the remaining defenders. The Pai Tak Pass, and the road to Kermanshah and eventually Tehran was open. The <b>armoured</b> <b>columns</b> began to secure the pass and the areas around it. The British forces moved along the Kermanshah highway towards the city of Shahabad. There was little Iranian resistance but some trees were cut down and {{a section of the}} road was even dynamited, which delayed the British forces for several hours.|$|R
50|$|During the Siege of Goražde, an SAS {{operator}} in UN dress, {{was shot and}} killed as a patrol attempted to survey Bosnian-Serb positions. On 16 April 1994, as part of Operation Deny Flight, a Royal Navy Sea Harrier FRS.1 of 801 NAS flying from HMS Ark Royal was shot down by a Serbian SA-7 SAM but its pilot was recued by a four-man SAS team operating within Goražde. The same team called in a number of airstrikes on <b>armoured</b> <b>columns</b> entering the city, until they were forced to escape through the lines of encircling Serbian paramilitaries to avoid capture and possible execution.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{apparently}} {{under the}} false impression from the helicopter departures that the paratroopers had all extracted, the Cuban column advanced {{directly into the}} ambush that the paratroopers had set for them. The lead T-34 tank was destroyed {{by one of the}} anti-tank mines, while the paratroopers destroyed four of the BTR-152s using their RPG-7s. They also killed approximately 40 of the Cuban troops before making their 'fighting retreat' back along the road towards the Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ) east of Cassinga where Breytenbach was organising the remaining paratroopers for final extraction. In the face of the oncoming <b>armoured</b> <b>column,</b> Breytenbach ordered a thin defensive line, but realised the lightly armed paratroopers stood little chance against the armoured vehicles and prepared to fall-back into the bush to an emergency LZ while calling urgently for air support.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, Chechen fighters {{attacked}} and destroyed a Russian <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> which {{had entered the}} village of Duba-Yurt the day before. The following day, Gen. Valentin Astaviyev said on state television that Russian forces had suffered only three dead in the previous 24 hours. Yet the commander of an Interior Ministry unit in Grozny told Agence France-Presse that 50 men {{had been killed in}} the previous 48 hours. On January 4, Chechen fighters in Grozny launched a series of counter attacks and broke through Russian lines in at least two places, temporarily seizing the village of Alkhan-Kala. Russian public support for the war, which was previously overwhelming, appeared to fade as casualties mounted and the government came in for increasing criticism in the tightly controlled Russian media for understating casualty figures. However, Russia's heavy bombardments had finally begun to take their toll: using multiple rocket launchers and massed tank and artillery fire, the Russians flattened large parts of Grozny in preparation for an all-out assault.|$|E
25|$|Brimstone {{was used}} {{extensively}} during Operation Ellamy over Libya in 2011. According to a British Ministry of Defence News report, dated 26 March 2011, RAF Tornado GR4 aircraft launched several Brimstone missiles over {{the towns of}} Misrata and Ajdabiya destroying {{a total of five}} armoured vehicles belonging to the Gaddafi regime. Sixty Brimstone were fired in the first four weeks of the Libya campaign, out of 110 Brimstone fired in all operations up to that time. This prompted the MoD to ask MBDA to convert more missiles to the dual-mode version. 150 dual-mode missiles had been ordered in December 2010, but according to the Royal United Services Institute, stocks of usable dual-mode missiles fell to single figures at one stage of the Libya campaign. The 500th dual-mode Brimstone was delivered in March 2012, at which time over 200 had been fired in combat. The single-mode missile was not fired in combat until 15 September 2011 when a pair of RAF Tornado GR4 of IX(B) Squadron fired 22 missiles (including a salvo of 12 by one aircraft) against an <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> near Sebha/Sabha, 400 miles south of Tripoli.|$|E

50|$|Initially the Russians {{were taken}} by surprise, and their <b>armoured</b> <b>columns</b> - which were {{supposed}} to take the city without difficulty, as Soviet forces had taken Budapest in 1956 - were decimated in fighting more reminiscent of the Battle of Budapest in late 1944. As a short-term measure, the Russians deployed self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (ZSU-23-4 and 9K22 Tunguska) to engage the Chechen combat groups, as the main gun of the tanks they used could not elevate and depress enough to engage the fire teams, and the armoured vehicle's machine gun could not suppress the fire of several different fire teams simultaneously.|$|R
500|$|The {{objective}} of Charnwood was to clear Caen of its defenders {{up to the}} Orne river and if possible to secure bridgeheads in southern Caen. To achieve the latter it was planned to send an <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> through the city to rush the bridges; {{it was hoped that}} ICorps could exploit the situation to sweep on through southern Caen towards the Verrières and Bourguébus ridges, paving the way for the British Second Army to advance towards Falaise. Historian Roger Cirillo however points out the operation was designed to clear the town of German forces; due to it being cut by both a river and a canal any attempts to make rapid progress through and beyond Caen were [...] "in all probability, impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{three years}} at the MoD, Dannatt {{attained}} general officer status with promotion to major general, and took command of the 3rd Mechanised Division in January 1999. Later in the year, the prospect of NATO intervention in the Kosovo War became likely, and Dannatt and his staff began planning for a potential ground invasion of the territory. In the event, Slobodan Milošević agreed to withdraw Serbian–Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, the practicalities of which were negotiated by Mike Jackson. It was decided, given {{the large number of}} British troops serving as part of the multinational Kosovo Force (KFOR), that the 3rd Division's headquarters would deploy to oversee British operations, with Dannatt as COMBRITFOR. Not long after Dannatt's arrival, a Russian <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> moved into Kosovo and took control of Pristina Airport. Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, subsequently ordered Jackson, commander of KFOR, to block the runways of the airport and prevent Russia flying in reinforcements. The issue eventually became moot but Dannatt, as COMBRITFOR, had been ordered to veto the use of British troops—known in NATO as a [...] "red card", afforded to each national contingent commander—for any such operation. He was later awarded the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service for his conduct in Kosovo.|$|E
500|$|At 01:00 on 22 May FSB Coral {{was again}} attacked, though {{not on the}} same scale as before, coming under a short but {{accurate}} mortar bombardment that was subsequently broken up artillery and mortar fire. In order to bolster his defences and provide an increased offensive capability, on 21 May Dunstan ordered the Centurion tanks from C Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment to redeploy the [...] from Nui Dat. Under the command of Major Peter Badman, the slow-moving <b>armoured</b> <b>column</b> departed on 22 May, traversing the difficult terrain that included a number of old, rusting Bailey bridges, which threatened to collapse under the 50-tonne weight of the Centurions. Moving via the inland route under cover provided by an observation aircraft from 161st Reconnaissance Flight, they drove north on Route 2, then west on Highway 1 to Long Binh where they staged overnight. Just north of Blackhorse the lead vehicle of the convoy hit a road mine, damaging a dozer tank but resulting in no casualties. They finally arrived at FSB Coral at 02:30 on 23 May. Four tanks from 1 Troop were subsequently allocated to 1 RAR, while 2 Troop was allocated to 3 RAR. Two American M42 40mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns had also accompanied the tanks and further strengthened the Australian FSBs in a ground support role.|$|E

Their <b>armoured</b> <b>columns</b> that were {{supposed}} to take the city without difficulty as Soviet forces had taken Budapest in 1956 were decimated in fighting more reminiscent of the Battle of Budapest in late 1944. As in the Soviet assault on Berlin, as a short term measure, they deployed self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (ZSU-23-4 and 2K22M) to engage the Chechen combat groups, as their tank's main gun did not have the elevation and depression to engage the fire teams and an armoured vehicle's machine gun could not suppress the fire of half a dozen different fire teams simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{approximately}} 201,000 personnel {{on active duty}} in the ČSLA in 1987, about 145,000, or about 72 percent, served in the ground forces (commonly {{referred to as the}} army). About 100,000 of these were conscripts. There were two military districts, Western and Eastern. They contained infantry, supported by tanks, armoured vehicles, and artillery. Czechoslovak military doctrine demanded large tank columns spearheading infantry assaults. While the <b>armoured</b> <b>columns</b> secured objectives, the infantry would provide close support with mortars, snipers, anti-tank guns and medium artillery. The majority of the soldiers in the Ground Forces were recruited through conscription, compulsory military service of 24 months for all males between 18 and 27.|$|R
5000|$|... 10 August 1945, {{to prevent}} {{dissection}} and encirclement by the Sovier <b>armoured</b> <b>columns,</b> the 124th division {{was ordered to}} retreat.

Also, two engineer battalions and 31st independent anti-tank battalion (2 companies) were added. This meager force was pitted against whole of Soviet 5th army (2nd formation) and other formations, totalling 12 rifle divisions and 5 armoured brigades.|$|R
