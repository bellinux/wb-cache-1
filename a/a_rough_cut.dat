5|$|The film {{score for}} Angel Heart was {{produced}} and composed by South African composer Trevor Jones, with saxophone solos by British jazz musician Courtney Pine. Parker hired Jones after being {{impressed by his}} orchestral score for the 1986 film Runaway Train. Jones viewed <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of Angel Heart prior to scoring the film.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, but {{post-production}} work continued, and {{the film}} was not released in France until almost a year later. A cut-down version was released in the United States and United Kingdom in September 2010. The critical response was sharply divided: positive reviews described the film as captivating and innovative, while negative critics called it tedious and puerile. The film performed poorly at the box office.|$|E
5|$|Unusual for a {{television}} series, the sound team receives <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> {{of a full}} season and approaches it as a ten-hour feature film. Although seasons one and two had different sound teams, one team has {{been in charge of}} sound since then. For the show's blood-and-gore sounds, the team often uses a chamois. For dragon screams, mating tortoises and dolphin, seal, lion and bird sounds have been used.|$|E
50|$|The {{documentary}} has had <b>a</b> few <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> test screenings, but has {{not been}} released yet due to copyright issues.|$|R
50|$|George Lucas hired {{director}} Kershner for The Empire Strikes Back {{because he}} was very impressed after seeing <b>an</b> early <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film.|$|R
50|$|The entire project {{went from}} a story by Jason Cuadrado to <b>a</b> {{completed}} <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> in six months. The film was completed and had its domestic premiere at Paramount Studios three months after.|$|R
5|$|Spielberg and Williams both watched <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of {{the film}} to {{determine}} what scenes would have music. The two decided to leave music out of the fighting sequences, in favor of playing it over long sequences of eight to nine minutes that lack action. The playing of music between fighting sequences gives a moment of reflection for what happened. Tom Hanks came to {{a portion of the}} recording session and read the Bixby letter – which appears in the movie – to the orchestra at the behest of Williams. This caused the musicians to shuffle their feet in appreciation.|$|E
5|$|The film's budget {{climbed from}} an initial US$150 {{million to a}} then-record-breaking $207 million, making it {{at one point the}} most {{expensive}} film yet made. Universal only agreed to such an outlay after seeing a screening of the unfinished film, to which executives responded enthusiastically. Marketing and promotion costs were an estimated $60 million. The film's length also grew; originally set to be 135 minutes, it soon grew to 200, prompting Universal executives to fly to New Zealand to view <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut,</b> but they liked it so their concerns were addressed.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E
2500|$|Aragno {{recorded}} the sound during production {{and was later}} the sound mixer during post-production. Godard edited <b>a</b> 2D <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film before he and Aragno worked on the 3D final cut. Godard edited the first cut alone on HDCAM. Aragno said that: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{third season}} began on June 1, 2008, and marked the {{beginning}} of the show's broadcast in high-definition. <b>A</b> 15-minute <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of [...] "The Doctor Is Sin" [...] aired on April 1, 2008, as part of Adult Swim's April Fool's Day theme of airing sneak peeks of new episodes.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the fall}} of 2008, Hickenlooper {{uploaded}} <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> director's <b>cut</b> of the film to Youtube now referred to as [...] "The Unseen Director’s Cut." [...] Due to the Weinstein Comapny's ownership of the footage and the material not being authorized for release, it {{was removed from the}} website.|$|R
5|$|Filming {{began on}} June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, {{primarily}} {{taking place at}} Leavesden Film Studios in England. Leavesden was leased for a {{two and a half}} years so the production company could leave the sets intact and return after principal photography had been completed. The forest scenes on Naboo were filmed at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire. Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film for friends and colleagues in May 1998. Most of the action and stunts were filmed by Roger Christian's second unit, which worked alongside the main unit instead of afterwards because of the high number of shots to be completed daily.|$|E
5|$|Hawks' friend Howard Hughes finally {{suggested}} Cary Grant for the role. Grant {{had just}} finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The Awful Truth, and Hawks may have seen <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the unreleased film. Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving. Grant was initially concerned {{about being able to}} play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. Grant met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{score was}} written, co-produced and {{composed}} by English singer and songwriter Peter Gabriel. It marked his first {{work on a}} feature film, {{as well as his}} first collaboration with music producer Daniel Lanois. Parker first met Gabriel during the film's post-production, as he had been experimenting with his music, incorporating the percussive rhythms from the musician's solo albums into the film. Parker contacted Gabriel's manager, record producer David Geffen, who advised him that producing the soundtrack would be a slow process, as Gabriel was known for working at his own pace. While working on his fifth studio album So, Gabriel agreed to score Birdy after viewing <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film.|$|E
50|$|A {{rotary mower}} rotates about a {{vertical}} axis with the blade spinning {{at high speed}} relying on impact to cut the grass. This tends to result in <b>a</b> <b>rougher</b> <b>cut</b> and bruises and shreds the grass leaf resulting in discolouration of the leaf ends as the shredded portion dies. This is particularly prevalent if the blades become clogged or blunt. Most rotary mowers need to be set a little higher than cylinder equivalents to avoid scalping and gouging of slightly uneven lawns, although some modern rotaries are fitted with a rear roller {{to provide a more}} formal striped cut. These machines will also tend to cut lower (13 mm) than a standard four-wheeled rotary.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, <b>a</b> {{poor quality}} <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> {{of the film}} had leaked on the Internet which {{contained}} alternate dialogue and music, deleted scenes, and different ending. Some of the deleted scenes, such as Stern being escorted out of the WNBC building, appeared in the film's original trailer and publicity materials before it was cut.|$|R
50|$|Influenced by Bicycle Thieves (1948), Mangiamele {{directed}} and {{appeared in his}} first feature film, Il Contratto, on a £500 budget. The story tells of the challenges faced by four Italian migrants after their arrival to Australia, and {{was based on the}} stories that Mangiamele had heard from the Melbourne Italian community around him. The film was shot without sound on 16mm stock with the intention of adding an Italian-language soundtrack later. But Il Contratto was never completed and the version that survives is <b>a</b> mute <b>rough</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|R
5|$|Keith Baxter {{said that}} the film's soundtrack was post-dubbed months after filming was completed, and that actors Fernando Rey and Marina Vlady were dubbed by {{different}} actors because of their heavy accents. Baxter also stated that he, Welles and Michael Aldridge recorded voices for several characters in post-production. Mistress Quickly's speech after Falstaff's death, which was disrupted by the audible hum of a power generator, used the original version of the soundtrack because Welles liked Margaret Rutherford's performance enough to keep it. The score was composed by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, {{who had worked with}} Welles on Othello. The score was recorded in an Italian studio, which paid Lavagnino for his work on the film in exchange for the rights to the music, and later released a soundtrack album in Italy and the UK. During the editing, Welles showed <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> to the visiting head of the Cannes Film Festival, who immediately wanted to include the film in the festival, and Welles had to finish the editing more quickly than he preferred.|$|E
5|$|The second unit filmed {{part of the}} prologue's 1912 segment from August 29 to September 3. The {{main unit}} began two days later with the circus train {{sequence}} at Alamosa, Colorado, on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. They filmed at Pagosa Springs on September 7, and then at Cortez on September 10. From September 14 to16, filming of Indiana falling into the train carriages took place in Los Angeles. The production then moved to Utah's Arches National Park to shoot more of the opening. A house in Antonito, Colorado {{was used for the}} Jones family home. The production had intended to film at Mesa Verde National Park, but Native American representatives had religious objections to its use. When Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn viewed <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film in late 1988, they felt it suffered from a lack of action. The motorcycle chase was shot during post-production at Mount Tamalpais and Fairfax near Skywalker Ranch. The closing shot of Indiana, Henry, Sallah and Brody riding into the sunset was filmed in Texas in early 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Tunisia battle {{sequence}} {{that opened the}} film was the last major sequence filmed. The filmmakers wanted to avoid the appearance that von Stauffenberg wanted to kill Hitler because of the injuries he suffered in the battle. They began <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> in October 2007, and between then and June 2008, there were several test screenings without the battle sequence. By June 2008, the filmmakers felt that {{they knew how to}} adequately frame the characters when filming the battle sequence. Singer scouted Jordan and Spain for locations, but the candidates did not meet the aesthetic and economic criteria. The Cougar Buttes desert in California was ultimately chosen to represent Tunisia. Since the production budget was adjusted to provide visual effects to make von Stauffenberg's injuries realistic, not enough was left for solely computer-generated fighter planes. Singer instead used two P-40 Warhawks in the battle sequence. The budget increased in the course of production due to the filming in Germany, the rebuilding of sets, and lost shooting days, but German tax rebates tempered the growth. The studio reported its final production budget to be $75 million, but competing studios believed it to be closer to $90 million.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{his death}} Bråthen {{was working on a}} {{documentary}} about the Norwegian black metal scene, entitled A Black Metal Year in Norway. Originally slated to a 2012 release, his death prevented it from being finished and released. (<b>A</b> very <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film is available at YouTube though.) Around the same time Urgehal began work on their seventh studio album, Aeons in Sodom, which remained unfinished until 2016 - it was eventually finished with the help of numerous guest musicians and released on 12 February.|$|R
50|$|This {{memorial}} is <b>a</b> {{column of}} <b>rough</b> <b>cut,</b> rusticated grey granite supported on a red-white marble plinth and bracketed by three white marble fins each supported by triple columns on attached bases. The column is {{finished with a}} projecting abacus of granite, and is supported on a concrete stylobate of two steps, surfaced in red granite chips.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} to generate <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> machining tool paths for multipatched B-spline surfaces. For {{a group of}} B-spline surfaces, smoothly connected, separated or intersecting one another, this method can guarantee generating paths without overcutting any of the surfaces under consideration. The use of multipatched surfaces to construct complex surfaces can greatly increase the controllability and friendliness {{in the design of}} surfaces. <b>A</b> method for <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> planning by convex hull boxing is proposed to generate paths guaranteeing no over-cut. since no computation for solving nonlinear equation is involved, the <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> plan is robust and efficient...|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of {{the film}} was previewed on 15 July 2006 at the Galway Film Fleadh, but the film was {{subsequently}} turned down by several prestigious European film festivals. However, once finished, it secured spots at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival on 20 January 2007 and the Dublin Film Festival in February 2007, and received the audience awards at both events.|$|E
25|$|Director David Yates {{stated that}} he wanted John Williams {{to return to the}} series for the final installment, but their {{schedules}} did not align due to the urgent demand for <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film. The final recording sessions of Harry Potter took place on 27 May 2011 at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra, orchestrator Conrad Pope, and composer Alexandre Desplat.|$|E
25|$|On location, {{shooting}} {{conditions were}} often cold and wet, causing Vigo to become ill {{and develop a}} fever. He was already suffering from tuberculosis and was bedridden for portions of the filming. Vigo refused {{to take a break}} and would often fight with executives at Gaumont over the film. He worked until the film was almost complete and <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> had been made.|$|E
5000|$|McGehee and Siegel set up {{a limited}} {{partnership}} and borrowed money for the $1 million budget from family and friends. They decided to shoot Suture in Phoenix, Arizona because McGehee {{felt that it was}} [...] "almost like an abandoned city, it's so large and overbuilt and the streets are so dead it feels empty". They liked the city's [...] "high modernist, very spare aesthetic". After seeing <b>an</b> early <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film, Steven Soderbergh became fascinated with it and helped McGehee and Siegel find completion finances during post-production.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is in Neoclassical style but drawing inspiration from Baroque revival and Art Nouveau. The {{building is}} constructed of red brick on <b>a</b> base of <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> granite. The windows are also framed by horizontal bands of granite. The building appear relatively complex {{with a large}} 7-story castle-like tower, shifted floors and different dormer windows, balconies and bay windows.|$|R
5000|$|Timothy Dwight IV, President of Yale University, {{along with}} Williams College President Ebenezer Fitch, climbed Greylock in 1799, {{probably}} over <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> route <b>cut</b> by <b>a</b> local pioneer farmer Jeremiah Wilbur (in that time more land {{had been cleared}} on the slopes for farming than today). His account in Travels in New England and New York describes the experience, although he noted the summit vegetation was so thick he and Fitch had to climb a balsam fir tree {{to get a better}} view: ...|$|R
25|$|Completing The Fog was {{an unusually}} {{difficult}} process for Carpenter. After viewing <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the film, he was {{dissatisfied with the}} result. For {{the only time in}} his filmmaking career, he had to devise a way to salvage a nearly finished film that did not meet his standards. In order to make the film more coherent and frightening, Carpenter filmed additional footage that included a number of new scenes.|$|E
25|$|An Afterthought is only {{occasionally}} used in productions of the play, {{but it made}} a poignant conclusion to the musical production starring Mary Martin, and provided the premise for Disney's sequel to their animated adaptation of the story, Return to Never Land. This epilogue was filmed for the 2003 film but {{not included in the}} final version, though <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the sequence was included as an extra on the DVD of the film.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with Soundtrack, a music and film website, Vangelis talked about his compositional processes. For films, Vangelis stated that he would begin composing a score for a feature {{as soon as he}} sees <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> of the footage. In addition to working with synthesizers and other electronic instruments, Vangelis also works with and conducts orchestras. For example, in the Oliver Stone film Alexander, Vangelis conducted an orchestra that consisted of various classical instruments including sitars, percussion, finger cymbals, harps, and duduks.|$|E
5000|$|The Region 1 (United States and Canada) DVD includes, {{as a bonus}} feature, <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> {{workprint}} <b>cut</b> of the film. The {{visual quality}} of the <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> is rather poor, with unfinished special effects and a timecode visible at all times, and alternating between widescreen and full-screen. This cut features a subplot involving Connor giving a Christmas tree to an orphanage every Christmas, an activity picked up by Duncan after Connor's death. Kate {{does not appear in}} this version of the film at its conclusion, unlike the producers' cut included on the DVD. The <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> also notably features an extended version of the [...] "Last Supper" [...] scene in which Jin Ke plunges his sword into a wall and beheads himself after realizing that he cannot beat Kell, thereby denying Kell the opportunity to kill him. In the other versions of the film, this scene was edited to make it appear that Kell beheads Jin Ke (off-screen) {{along with the rest of}} the group.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} is {{wrapped in a}} skin of stainless steel and glass. It is lifted by a base of four recessed rectilinear marble volumes, resting upon <b>a</b> field of <b>rough</b> <b>cut</b> slate and granite. [...] Walls of glass stretch taut between two larger end volumes, creating an interior lobby and plazas {{to the east and}} west with the smaller volumes encasing double-sided elevator shafts.|$|R
5000|$|Stùc a' Chroin is {{most often}} climbed in {{conjunction}} with Ben Vorlich from Ardvorlich on Loch Earnside to the north. The normal routes of ascent is over the summit of Ben Vorlich and down its south west ridge to the Bealach an Dubh Choirein. From this bealach <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> path <b>cuts</b> very steeply up on the right (NW) side of the prominent buttress to the summit of Stùc a' Chroin. Returning from the bealach, Ben Vorlich can be skirted by a pathless traverse of grassy slopes to the pass on its east.|$|R
