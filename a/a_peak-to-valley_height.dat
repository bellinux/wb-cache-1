However, an unknown component 2 ̆ 019 s profile with <b>a</b> large <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>height</b> variation can not usually be measured using a short range sensor.

With the developed system, the real-time distance from the sensor to the component surface is acquired, and used as a feedback signal to control the sensor 2 ̆ 019 s position on the Z axis to automatically maintain its distance with a given value. Through this development, the measuring range of the system is extended from the sensor 2 ̆ 019 s measuring range up to the Z axis travelling range of the motion system so that a surface with large <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>height</b> variation can be easily measured by a short range sensor with substantially improved accuracy.

Rhododendron dominates the understory layer of the forests throughout the Black Sea Region in Turkey with substantial biomass potential. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate suitability of Rhododendron fiber for MDF production. For the experiments, rhododendron and commercially-manufactured-chip (Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus robur L.) with 11 % moisture content were used. The mixing ratios of rhododendron with commercially-manufactured-chip were 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75 and 0 : 100 %, respectively. Commercial urea formaldehyde (UF) adhesive was used as a binder. A stylus method was employed to evaluate the surface characteristics of the samples. Roughness measurements by the stylus method were taken perpendicularly to the fiber. There was a significant difference (p= 0. 05) between surface roughness parameters (Ra, Rz, Rq, and Ry). The results obtained in this study revealed that all the panels have met the general purpose-use requirements of European Norm (EN). It was found that panels made with a 25 / 75 ratio of rhododendron to commercially-manufactured-chip had a significantly lower contact angle (88. 14 º) than panels made with a 100 / 0 ratio (117. 91 º). Surface roughness measurements are based on four roughness parameters, average roughness (Ra), mean <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>height</b> (Rz), root mean square roughness (Rq), and maximum <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>height</b> (Ry) were considered to evaluate the surface characteristics of the panels and supported the above findings as the panels made with a 25 / 75 ratio had a slightly rougher surface with average values of 2. 929 ìm (Ra).

40|$|AbstractProduction {{engineers}} need {{to focus}} increasingly on the sustainability of manufacturing processes. Unfortunately, there are a confusingly high number of sustainability indicators available and they mostly focus on energy and material efficiency. These indicators are, however, not all appropriate for finishing operations. For example, many efficiency indicators relate to the material volume processed, but since the volume is very small in finishing operations, the material removal rarely is the best indicator. This paper discusses more appropriate efficiency indicators for finishing operations which are calculated as ratio of change in process performance or part quality divided by the needed resources. Three efficiency indicators based on average roughness, average <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>height</b> and subjective part quality are then used in a case study on vibratory grinding.

Four kinds of surface polishing/finishing methods evaluated were: Group 1 : Control: carborundum points (CP); Group 2 : silicon points (SP); Group 3 : diamond paste (DP); Group 4 : glazing (GZ). Surface roughness was measured using an interferometer and the parameters of Sa (average height deviation of the surface) and St (maximum <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>height</b> of the surface) were evaluated.

Dense, polycrystalline, {{synthetic}} hydroxyapatite (HA) was incubated for 36 days in modified simulated {{body fluid}} (SBF) with increased HCO 3 - and reduced Cl- ion concentrations (27 and 120 mM, respectively) closer to actual blood plasma than typical SBF. The resulting precipitated apatite layer {{was characterized by}} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements and found to be nonstoichiometric, calcium deficient (Ca/P~ 1. 06), noncarbonate containing, and of intermediate hydrophilicity (advancing contact angle, θa= 76. 5 ± 1. 3 °). The nanoscale surface topography of the SBF-incubated HA sample was imaged by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM), observed to be = 100 nm in thickness, and composed of three distinct morphologies. These topographically distinct regions were localized within individual grains and facets of the initial HA surface and included: hemispherical, globular structures (maximum lateral dimension, d= 44. 7 ± 12. 7 nm, <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>height,</b> h= 3. 6 ± 2. 7 nm); elongated, needle-like structures (minimum lateral dimension, w= 31. 0 ± 8. 5 nm, d= 104. 4 ± 31. 1 nm, h= 5. 0 ± 3. 2 nm), and regions of larger, irregularly shaped structures that were relatively smooth (d= 504. 9 ± 219. 1 nm, h= 104. 0 ± 51. 7 nm) ...|$|R
