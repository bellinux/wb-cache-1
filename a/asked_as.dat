The town of Stain'd-By-The-Sea was abandoned following the closure of Ink Inc. (a large ink factory) and the town's sea being drained. Snicket recalls four adventures he had in Stain'd-By-The-Sea, with each revolving around a question he incorrectly <b>asked.</b> <b>As</b> Lemony and his chaperone, S. Theodora Markson, investigate crimes Snicket makes both friends and enemies, including Hangfire.|$|E

25|$|Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's 1980 song Enola Gay {{depicts the}} events of the 1945 {{deployment}} of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima {{from the point of view}} of the crew of the B29 Superfortress Bomber Enola Gay. Clear references are made to the exact time the bomb detonated ("It's eight fifteen, and that's the time that it's always been"), and questions are <b>asked</b> <b>as</b> to whether the action was necessary. The song also references a supposed radio message in which the crew detail no anomalies as a result of nuclear detonation ("We got your message on the radio - conditions normal and you're coming home"); the American government denied any rumours of radiation sickness associated with the dropping of the bombs.|$|E

25|$|In 1912–13, {{he played}} 14 league matches, scoring once, before signing for Fulham {{just ahead of}} the March {{transfer}} deadline. Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division {{at the end of that}} season, and promptly re-signed Winship, who had played just twice for Fulham. Questions were <b>asked</b> <b>as</b> to the probity of the transfer– Sir Henry Norris had been and remained a director of Fulham before becoming major shareholder in and chairman of Arsenal– but the Football League's management committee ratified his return. Woolwich Arsenal began the 1913–14 season in their new stadium with the visit of Leicester City on 6 September. The visitors took a one-goal lead, and George Jobey scored the equaliser– Arsenal's first goal at what would become generally known as Highbury– with a header from Winship's corner; Arsenal won 2–1.|$|E

The song was recorded with a 40-person orchestra, led by Saito and concert master Great Eida. Even though she was <b>asked</b> <b>as</b> a soloist to create the theme song, Sheena wanted to include her band Tokyo Jihen in the process. Hence, Sheena invited the members to perform the backing tracks and instruments for the songs on the single. Sheena had wanted the song to be released as a single by the band, however the staff involved with the drama specifically requested the song be under her solo stage name. The lyrics were completed {{at the very end of}} the song creating process, after the song arrangement.|$|E

Butts was adamant he had had only a limited role in the torture of the victims, but confessed to actively participating in the torture of one victim. Butts claimed he typically drove in an aimless manner as Bonin abused and tortured his victims {{in the rear of the}} van, then stopped the vehicle in order to assist in restraining the victim as Bonin escalated the torture. When <b>asked</b> <b>as</b> to why some victims had been subjected to more extensive blunt force trauma than others, Butts stated that, in many instances, Bonin would escalate the level of beatings to which he subjected his victim if the youth resisted his sexual advances.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} the {{difficulties}} inherent in the enlarged war was the siting of Lima Site 85 on a mountaintop at Phou Pha Thi, Laos. This clandestine guidance radar facility was proposed at a mid-1967 meeting chaired by General Hunter Harris. Its purpose was radar directed air raids into Hanoi. Lair's opinion of the installation was <b>asked,</b> <b>as</b> he was the local expert, and he was being charged with its defense. He predicted that the Vietnamese would build a road toward the radar site until they could attack it. When asked if LS 85 could be defended, Lair pointed out that guerrilla forces were not equipped or trained for fixed defensive battles. He recommended the use of special forces or other trained infantry for defense, but his request was rejected. In January 1968, North Vietnamese forces bypassed the site temporarily to attack royalist positions at the Battle of Nam Bac. Despite the PAVN's delay of the battle, Lair's prediction of Lima Site 85's fall was prophetic. The radar site was captured by Vietnamese sappers on 11 March 1968 even though Hmong guerrillas and Thai mercenaries remained on the mountain. Shackley had predicted in a cable to headquarters that the site could not hold out beyond 10 March. The accuracy of his estimate burnished his reputation in the agency.|$|E
500|$|Shubhangi Khapre of Daily News and Analysis {{noted in}} her article titled Forget {{political}} will, Raj has state support, stated, [...] "Ever since its birth on 9 March 2006, MNS has been nurtured by the ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) with an ulterior motive of splitting the Shiv Sena. Ironically, the Sena itself was given a 'protected childhood' in the late 1960s by the then Congress {{as a tool to}} war with the Communist Party of India, which had a strong presence in Mumbai. Not surprisingly, covertly the administration has provided Raj adequate platform to consolidate the political forum through an emotive Marathi plank. The purpose is to split the 26% [...] Marathi voters in Mumbai, which is rather loyal to the Shiv Sena. The electoral merit of the MNS remains untested but its ability to bond with sons of the soil cannot be cursorily dismissed in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik and Pune." [...] She further noted, [...] "Under chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the Congress sees a double advantage in the strategy: A proactive MNS will divide Sena voters {{on the one hand and}} drive Mumbai’s North Indian community— which was being targeted as [...] "outsiders" [...] by the MNS— to Congress’s lap. North Indians, who dominate 48 essential services in Mumbai, constitute a sizeable— and hence decisive— vote bank. Forget political will, it is well-calculated political design which has withheld the Democratic Front government from taking stern action against Raj. Or else, how does one explain home minister RR Patil engaging in a telephone conversation urging him to slow down instead of arresting his men indulging in violence on streets?" [...] She also said, [...] "(Vilasrao) Deshmukh is no better. He has often said, [...] "My administration will not tolerate divisive forces. Nobody is above the law"." [...] She expressed her views in reference to, Bombay High Court on lashing out at the Maharashtra government over the threat given by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena about displaying the Marathi signboard on the shops and establishments in the metropolis. [...] "If you don't have political will, then give that message to the people that we can not do anything," [...] Division Bench of Justice J N Patel and K K Tated said dissatisfied about government's inaction against hooliganism of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena activists. [...] "Why no action has been taken against respondent number six (Raj Thackeray)? Are some people 'untouchable' for you?"

2500|$|It {{is known}} that `Abdu'l-Bahá also sat for portraits {{at the request of}} Gibran.

So the influence is really at the choice of Gibran - he could as well have chosen and mention any other source of inspiration for his book. It seems he chose `Abdu'l-Bahá. As `Abdu'l-Bahá is one of the [...] of the Bahá'í Faith and these are works of fiction, it is certainly the case that at least two of Gibran's, and his most famous, are properly mentioned here.|$|E
2500|$|Chikatilo was {{initially}} questioned in detail about each charge upon the indictment.

He would become indignant only when accused of stealing personal possessions from the victims, or to his retaining organs excised from the victims missing from the crime scenes. On one occasion, when <b>asked</b> <b>as</b> to his seeming indifference as to the lifestyle and gender of those whom he had killed, Chikatilo replied: [...] "I {{did not need to}} look for them.

2500|$|Due to {{an earlier}} {{antitrust}} case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who <b>asked.</b> <b>As</b> a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users weren't legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a [...] "complete Unix-compatible software system" [...] composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984. Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.|$|E
2500|$|Going to {{the small}} {{telephone}} box with its slender wire attachments, Mr. Bell coolly <b>asked,</b> <b>as</b> though addressing someone in an adjoining room, [...] "Mr. Watson, are you ready!" [...] Mr. Watson, five miles away in Somerville, promptly answered in the affirmative, and soon was heard a voice singing [...] "America". [...] Going to another instrument, connected by wire with Providence, forty-three miles distant, Mr. Bell listened a moment, and said, [...] "Signor Brignolli, who is assisting at a concert in Providence Music Hall, will now sing for us." [...] In a moment the cadence of the tenor's voice rose and fell, the sound being faint, sometimes lost, and then again audible. Later, a cornet solo played in Somerville was very distinctly heard. Still later, a three-part song came over the wire from Somerville, and Mr. Bell told his audience [...] "I will switch off the song {{from one part of}} the room to another so that all can hear." [...] At a subsequent lecture in Salem, Massachusetts, communication was established with Boston, eighteen miles distant, and Mr. Watson at the latter place sang [...] "Auld Lang Syne", the National Anthem, and [...] "Hail Columbia", while the audience at Salem joined in the chorus.|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{increase}} in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, he stated he had been [...] "completely swept along" [...] with his compulsion to kill, adding: [...] "It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long." [...] When <b>asked</b> <b>as</b> to why he had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated {{he had been in}} the process of constructing a private altar of victims' skulls which he had intended to adorn upon the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims. This display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Ernest Miller and Oliver Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. Incense sticks were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights. The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair. When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview who the altar was dedicated to, Dahmer replied: [...] "Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home." [...] He further described his intended altar as a [...] "place for meditation," [...] from where he believed he could draw a sense of power, adding: [...] "If this [...] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found." ...|$|E
