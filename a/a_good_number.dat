5|$|On {{the north}} side, the Midway High Lakes Area, which lies mostly outside the {{wilderness}} area, {{is one of}} the more popular areas around Mount Adams. The area is made up of four large lakes, Council Lake, Takhlakh Lake, Ollalie Lake, and Horseshoe Lake; one small lake, Green Mountain Lake; and a group of small lakes, Chain of Lakes. The area offers developed and primitive camping as well as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>number</b> of trails for hiking and backpacking. Most trails are open to horses and many outside the wilderness are open to motorcycles. More scenery similar to what is encountered in the Mount Adams Wilderness abounds. The area also offers boating and fishing opportunities on several of the lakes.|$|E

Between 1933 and 1939, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) used {{the site for}} its regional trachoma school, using both laboratory animals and Indian children for experiments to treat the eye disease. During World War II, the school taught students from <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>number</b> of southwestern tribes. During the 1950s, as the tribe was fighting against termination, the emphasis of the school was on vocational and technical training. Beginning in 1960, the BIA contracted for schools to be built near other tribes, and attendance at the school started to drop.|$|E
5|$|There are two Grade II listed {{churches in}} Stretford: the Church of St Ann and the Church of St Matthew. St Ann's is a Roman Catholic church, built in 1862â€“7 by E. W. Pugin for Sir Humphrey and Lady Annette de Trafford. It was officially opened by Bishop William Turner on 22 November 1863, and was consecrated in June 1867. Features include a {{historic}} organ built by Jardine & Co (1867) and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>number</b> of fine {{stained glass windows}} by Hardman & Co of Birmingham.
