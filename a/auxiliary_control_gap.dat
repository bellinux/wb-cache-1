40|$|A method {{based on}} the use of an Adaptive Control Module (ACM) made thanks to the {{knowledge}} of the process state description is presented. The outputs of this module are the actual process commands and the inputs are constituted by an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> signal set. Each <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> signal is computed by a usual SISO controller (e. g. PI type). The ACM structure and parameters are determined in order to obtain the desired dynamics between the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> signals and the process outputs. When the process inputs come into saturation, it is possible - thanks to the ACM - to project these input saturations into the state variable space and to choose among the set points specifications which of them may be lost and which must be held. The method is easy to handle. It enables non-interactive and feed-forward control. It can be applied with great success to bilinear systems. The example of a mixer plant shows the advantages of the method. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} an optimal {{singular}} stochastic control problem. By using a time transformation, {{this problem is}} shown to be equivalent to an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> problem defined as a combination of an optimal stopping problem and a classical control problem. For this <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> problem, the controller must choose a stopping time (optimal stopping), and the new control variables belong to a compact set. This equivalence is obtained by showing that the (discontinuous) state process governed by a singular control is given by a time transformation of an auxiliary state process governed by a classical bounded control. It is proved that the value functions for these two problems are equal. For a general form of the cost, {{the existence of an}} optimal singular control is established under certain technical hypotheses. Moreover, the problem of approximating singular optimal control by absolutely continuous controls is discussed in the same class of admissible controls...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{theoretical}} and experimental {{work done in}} {{the examination of the}} relationship between human generated carbon dioxide concentration and temperature rise in an occupied room. Generation of carbon dioxide by humans is linked to metabolic rate and heat generation. Therefore, carbon dioxide concentration may be used as an indicator of occupancy in a room. Typically, a heating control system will react slowly to changes in room occupancy if temperature is used as the process variable. The aim of the work was to establish if carbon dioxide concentration in the space could be used as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> variable so as to allow a more rapid temperature control system response. Models of the relationship between room air temperature and occupancy, and carbon dioxide concentration and occupancy are mathematically developed and experimentally validated. The paper concludes that carbon dioxide concentration is an appropriate <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> variable for temperature control when the room, having been occupied, is vacated...|$|R
40|$|Rotating unbalanced-mass (RUM) {{devices are}} {{a new way to}} scan space-based, balloon-borne, and {{ground-based}} gimbaled payloads, like x-ray and gamma-ray telescopes. They {{can also be used to}} scan free-flying spacecraft. Circular scans, linear scans, and raster scans can be generated. A pair of RUM devices generates the basic scan motion and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> system using torque motors, control moment gyros, or reaction wheels keeps the scan centered on the target and produces some complementary motion for raster scanning. Previous analyses and simulation results show that this approach offers significant power savings compared to scanning only with the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> system, especially with large payloads and high scan frequencies. However, these claims have never been proven until now. This paper describes a laboratory experiment which tests the concept of scanning a gimbaled payload with RUM devices. The test results are compared with those from a computer simulation model of the experiment and the differences are discussed...|$|R
