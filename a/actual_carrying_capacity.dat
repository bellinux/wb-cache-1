40|$|For {{the purpose}} of the {{numerical}} analysis of the <b>actual</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of rolling contacts in large rolling bearings with surface-hardened raceways, an elasto-plastic constitutive model was used which links the mechanics of material damage with the isotropic and kinematic hardening or softening. A damage material model, implemented into a commercial finite element program, allows us to monitor the elastic strain, plastic strain increase, stress changes and material damage growth, which are closely related to the number ofload cycles. In this way, the location and the time of occurrence of bearing raceway damage can be determined along with the growth of damage up to the point when a microcrack is formed. In other words, low cycle life of rotational rolling connection can be assessed. The paper presents the material model, numerical analysis of the <b>actual</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the rolling contact in single-row ball bearings and the verification of the numerical material model with experimental results of low cycle carrying capacity...|$|E

30|$|Accurate {{prediction}} {{of the load}} bearing capacity of plate structures {{plays an important role}} in many practical engineering problems. Traditional elastic designs cannot evaluate the <b>actual</b> load <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of plates and incremental elasto-plastic analyses can become cumbersome and present convergence issues for large-scale structures. Therefore, various limit analysis approaches have been devised to investigate the behavior of structures in the plastic region. Nowadays, limit analysis has become a well-known tool for assessing the safety load factor of engineering structures as an efficient direct method. Due to limitation of analytical methods, various numerical approaches such as finite element methods (FEM) [1]–[6], meshfree methods [7],[8], and natural element method [9], just to mention a few, have therefore been developed.|$|R

Although the lack of detailed information of Benevente river basin opposes the great importance of managing the use of natural resources based on knowledge of the <b>actual</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and vulnerability of these resources. In order to provide subsidies to the better management of the Basin, this study aimed to characterize the soils, the land use and occupation and morphometry of Benevente river basin.

40|$|Flow in {{meandering}} channel is quite ubiquitous for natural flow {{systems such as}} in rives. Rivers generally follow this pattern for minimization of energy loss. However, several factors such as environmental condition, roughness are responsible for generation of this path for rivers. Selection of proper value of Roughness coefficient is essential for evaluating the <b>actual</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of Natural channel. An excessive value underestimates the discharge and a low value can over estimates. The resistance to the flow in a river is dependent {{on a number of}} flow and surface and geometrical parameters. The influences of all the parameters are assumed to be lumped into a single value of Manning’s n. It is seen that Manning’s coefficient n not only denotes the roughness characteristics of a channel but also the energy loss in the flow. The larger the value of n, the higher is the loss of energy within the flow. Experimental investigations concerning the variation of roughness coefficients for a highly {{meandering channel}} for different flow condition, geometry are presented. The flow properties are found to be affected by different geometric, surface and flow parameters. In the present work, an attempt has been made to analyses the important parameters affecting the flow behavior and flow resistance in term of Manning’ n in a meandering channel. The factors influencing for predicting the roughness coefficient of a meandering channel are non-dimensionlised and its dependency with different parameters are studied. Further, a regression analysis has been done to formulate a mathematical model to predict the roughness coefficient. The equation can be suitably applied to predict the stage-discharge relationships of a meandering channel. The efficacy of the proposed equation has also been tested not only to the present data sets but also the data of other investigators...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} procedures for masonry arches and columns usually assume homogeneous constitutive models for which strength and stiffness parameters {{are described in}} terms of a uni-axial constitutive law. The limits of such an approach are seldom discussed and related to the brickwork inhomogeneity, i. e. to the brick size and to the masonry bond. In this paper, a first theoretical and experimental approach to concentric and eccentric loading of solid clay brickwork are developed and discussed, investigating the failure modes and the compressive strength of masonry and their dependence on the strength, on the geometry of the constituents and on the loading conditions. A mechanical model for the load <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of eccentrically compressed brickwork prisms, based on the Static Theorem of Limit Analysis, is proposed allowing: i) the compressive strength {{to be related to the}} size of bricks and mortar joints, showing that edge effects at the free edges do not significantly affect the global behaviour of the material; ii) the limit domains in the axial force-bending moment space to be derived. Moreover, a series of brickwork prisms have been tested with different load eccentricities; the comparison with the theoretical approach provides upper and lower bounds to the load <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the material and shows that: i) brickwork exhibits limited inelastic strains that need to be taken into account to explain the experimental data; ii) plastic models for masonry overestimate the <b>actual</b> load <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> On the basis of these results, one-dimensional homogenized constitutive models, suitable for applications, are formulated and their effectiveness supported by the experimental results...|$|R

But even the composite materials manufactured by the same process may demonstrate differences in their elastic properties. For design purposes, one {{should be aware of}} the potential variations in load-carrying capacity and dynamic behavior of such structures that can arise due to the uncertainty in elastic moduli. A more realistic analysis of composite structures should be performed with the variations of the elastic moduli being taken into consideration at the same time. The present paper is a generalization of a study where the influence of uncertainty in elastic moduli on the axial buckling load was discussed. Here, we consider another case of buckling, shells under uniform external pressure. In addition, this paper deals with the variability of natural frequencies by use of convex modeling, which is apparently the first study of this kind in the literature. A numerical approach to the uncertainty problem is nonlinear programming, which we apply to solve the same problem to generate a set of comparable numerical data. The results from both methods show good agreement throughout. Thus, the effectiveness of the analytic convex modeling is clearly demonstrated. The bounds of he natural frequency and the buckling load provide the designer with a better view of the vibrational behavior and the <b>actual</b> load <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> possessed by the composite structure...|$|R

One particular family or fleet of bridges that has been determined to be desirable for load testing consists of single-span bridges with non-composite, cast-in-place concrete decks, steel stringers, and timber substructures. Six bridges with poor performing superstructure and substructure from the aforementioned family of bridges were selected to be load tested.

Volume I of this report focuses on evaluating the superstructure for this family of bridges. This volume discusses the behavior characteristics that influence the load <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of this fleet of bridges.

Physical, real (ecological) and effective (manageable) are different kinds of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> The current study presented these varieties of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> for Gheisary protected area, stretched over 10, 000 ha in Cheharmahal- & Bakhtiary province. The physical <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> was measured using an ecotourism-based zoning followed by imposing periodic, pedologic, climatic and vegetative limitations, based on the minimum area needed for each person. Real <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> was then calculated according to the physical <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> The {{results showed that the}} intensive recreation zone with surface of 1, 292 ha had the annual physical <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of 2, 079, 227 and real <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of 18, 465 people. The values for the extensive recreation zone with surface of 2, 378 ha were 2, 478, 832 and 1, 215 respectively. The study has also speculated the embedded management strength and recreation convenience of the area and concluded that effective <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> can only enjoy 10 % of the real <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> which were 1, 968 people...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{relative}} <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> {{of resources}} methods {{was used to}} calculate the relative <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of land resources, the relative <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of economic resources and <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of integrated resource of Xuchang City during 1978 - 2008. Study shows that: <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of integrated resource of Xuchang City is overload, overloading population between 44. 2 ~ 1. 203 million, showing a "low- high- low " fluctuations; before 1996, land resources is the main capacity resources of Xuchang City, while economic resources become the main capacity resources from then on, mainly due to the decrease of indices of the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of land resources. the key factors to restrict sustainable development in Xuchang city is a weak economic foundation and a large population, so Xuchang city should speed up economic development, enhance the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of economic resources; control the rapid population growth, improve population quality, make great efforts to achieve sustainable development of resources, environmental, economic and population in Xuchang Cit...|$|R
40|$|Urban railway {{transport}} that connects suburbs and city areas {{is characterized by}} uneven temporal and spatial distribution in terms of passenger flow and underutilized <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> This paper aims to develop methodologies to measure the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the urban railway by introducing a concept of the express-slow mode. We first explore factors influencing the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> under the express-slow mode and the interactive relationships among these factors. Then we establish seven different scenarios to measure the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> by considering {{the ratio of the}} number of the express trains and the slow trains, the station where overtaking takes place, and the number of overtaking maneuvers. Taking Shanghai Metro Line 16 as an empirical study, the proposed methods to measure the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> under different express-slow mode are proved to be valid. This paper contributes to the literature by remodifying the traditional methods to measure the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> when different express-slow modes are applied to improve the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the suburban railway...|$|R
