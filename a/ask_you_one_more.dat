6000|$|... "I will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> question, Mary, {{and before}} {{answering}} it I {{want to make}} you believe that my only object in asking it is to ascertain how I may make you happy. When you did meet Mr.--this gentleman--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> question, Miss Stapleton. If {{you meant}} {{no more than}} this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or anyone else, could object." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, well indeed," [...] {{answered}} Swanhild. [...] "Had Atli {{known this}} {{he would have}} scourged Hall hence with rods of seaweed. And now, Eric, I desire to <b>ask</b> <b>thee</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> thing: why wearest thou thy hair long like a woman's? Indeed, few women have such hair as thine is now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you and Fan {{together}} {{met this}} man and never mentioned it to me! Let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question <b>more,</b> Constance. Is this person you are engaged to a Christian or an infidel?" ...|$|R
60|$|But none of us, I trust, are fallen {{as low as}} that. We all, surely, admire a good action, {{and love}} a good man. Surely we do. Then I will go on, to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> {{question}} <b>more.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I wish to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> question, which I {{wish you}} all to answer by your votes, honestly. It is this. Do {{you think that the}} real {{disorder}} which has been in this class, that is, the real cases which you referred to, when you stated to me, that you thought that the class was not in good order, have been now really exposed, so that I honestly and fully understand the case? How many suppose so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the only}} name I choose to {{acknowledge}} at present {{is the name}} of Merton Ware," [...] Philip declared. [...] "If you think there is any mystery about me, any connection with the gentleman whom I believe you call Mr. Douglas Romilly, well, the matter is one for your investigation. You will forgive me if I remind you that my guests will be here in {{a matter of a few}} minutes, and permit me to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> question. Why do you come here to me in this very unofficial manner? If I am really an impostor, you are giving me every opportunity of clearing out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, I will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> {{singular}} still," [...] said Madeline Neroni, raising {{herself on}} her elbow and turning her own face full upon her companion's. [...] "Do you love him, love him with all your heart and soul, with all the love your bosom can feel? For I {{can tell you that}} he loves you, adores you, worships you, thinks of you and nothing else, is now thinking of you as he attempts to write his sermon for next Sunday's preaching. What would I not give to be loved in such a way by such a man, that is, if I were an object fit for any man to love!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; I {{must not}} make myself cry,' said Violet, quietly. 'I {{will not go}} on, when I have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing <b>more,</b> and that is, to write to John, {{and tell him that}} I thank him for all he has done for me, and that {{this has been a very}} happy year. You and John will comfort--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a muzzle upon my mouth," [...] he said presently. [...] "There {{are words}} {{close to my}} lips which would part you and me, so I'll say no more. Go your own way, John. I'll <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> but <b>one</b> <b>more</b> question, and <b>you</b> must take that as man from man, brother from brother. How old is she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, Fan, {{and rest}} yourself," [...] said Miss Starbrow, closing and locking the door; then after moving {{about the room}} in an aimless way for a little while, she came and sat down near the girl. [...] "Before you tell me this dreadful story, Fan," [...] she said, [...] "I wish to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing <b>more.</b> <b>One</b> day last week when it was raining you came home from Kensington with a young man. Who was he--a friend of yours?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Dear Mother: I {{have written}} this {{to tell you}} my {{worrying}} secret. Now don't cry when you read {{it because it is}} neither yours nor my fault. I suppose I will have to tell it now without any nonsense. To begin with I was not meant to be an athlet [...] I {{was meant to be a}} composer, and will be I'm sure. I'll <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> thing.—Don't ask me to try to forget this unpleasant thing and go play football.—Please—Sometimes I've been worrying about this so much that it makes me mad (not very).|$|E
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you," [...] said Matt, [...] "and that isn't what I mean. But {{if it would}} have been right and well for him to come forward at such a time, why shouldn't some other man, who does love her?" [...] He hurried tremulously on: [...] "Wade, let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing <b>more!</b> <b>You</b> have seen her so much more than I; and I didn't know--Is it possible--Perhaps I ought to <b>ask</b> if <b>you</b> are at all--if you care for her?" ...|$|R
60|$|I am {{now about}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to confer <b>one</b> <b>more</b> {{literary}} obligation on me by accepting {{the dedication of}} this book, as the earliest acknowledgment which {{it has been in}} my power to make of the debt I owe to my critic, to my translator, and to my friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you are mistaken, and {{you know}} nothing about me, and nothing about the sort of love of which I am capable. Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and {{sickness}} {{it would still be}} dear. Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive. I should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas? I was talking of removing you from Thornfield. All, you know, is prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go. I only <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to endure <b>one</b> <b>more</b> night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever! I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from falsehood and slander." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brave {{and generous}} friend, will <b>you</b> let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> last question? I am very ignorant, and it {{troubles}} me--just a little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite unnecessary," [...] replied Chauvelin curtly. [...] "I {{have only}} a letter to deliver, and after that to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> brief question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I don't think it's funny at all,' said Sam. 'But jes let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing: what's {{the name}} of the toll-gate woman?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{but look}} here. I {{just want to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. What sort of a time did you have in that scratch game tonight?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me, uncle," [...] {{said the}} nephew, with extreme deference, [...] "but I should {{just like to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. Will <b>you</b> let me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, youngster," [...] said Mr Park, [...] "when you've done capering I {{should like}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> or two questions. What brought you here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question, Alick--not a {{flattering}} one. May {{not some}} of these private impressions of yours have been coloured by your long illness!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question, for if {{the answer}} is in the negative, I shall still {{continue}} to hope? Do you care for any other man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Permit me to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question," [...] <b>asked</b> the sailor;--"is there {{anything}} {{of which you}} are ashamed in the circumstances which you have declined to communicate." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Farebrother {{was silent}} for a moment, and then said earnestly, [...] "My dear fellow, let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. Forgive me if I take a liberty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not directly. But {{my sister}} has, I know, very strong {{opinions}} on such subjects. Now, I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing. Is it true that--she--remains here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Hurd," [...] he begged, [...] "do let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question! Why do {{you refuse}} me? What harm can I {{possibly}} do {{by talking to}} your villagers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{answered}} {{your question}} just now," [...] said the girl, very quietly, [...] "because I wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one.</b> Do <b>you</b> believe my uncle’s {{story about the}} buried treasure?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your pardon, Queen," [...] said Olfan bluntly, [...] "but I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> {{question}} before <b>you</b> {{tell me the}} end of your tale. What is this white man to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray don't {{think that}} I wish to intrude myself into your affairs," [...] he said. [...] "I am obliged to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> or two plain questions. What is your name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Streuss said grimly, [...] "we {{have now}} no <b>more</b> secrets from <b>one</b> another. I will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> last question. Where is that packet {{at the present}} moment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] I said quietly, [...] "you {{have spoken}} well and convincingly. Pardon my presumption, if I venture to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. The Power of whom you have spoken--is it England?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Jacks," [...] he said, [...] "you are, I am sure, a {{very clever}} man. Let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. Has it ever fallen to your lot {{to make a}} mistake?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing--when I {{tell you}} my story, let it be for your breast alone. Say only that I am a common girl whom you saved from the soldier." ...|$|R
2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will <b>ask</b> all of <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|R
