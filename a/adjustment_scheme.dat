We have developed a numerical, analytical tool which models the dynamically changing network tra c environment using a time-varying, uid- ow, di erential equation {{that can be used to}} study the impact of an adaptive capacity <b>adjustment</b> control <b>scheme.</b> We present the results for a simple, blocking-based capacity <b>adjustment,</b> control <b>scheme.</b> In particular, we show that a purely blocking-based capacity <b>adjustment</b> control <b>scheme</b> can be very sensitive to capacity changes, and can lead to network instability...|$|R

This article provides general methods to evaluate the long-run average adjustment interval and mean-squared deviation from target corresponding to dead band <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes</b> under very general assumptions concerning both the process disturbances and the process dynamics.

40|$|Three {{different}} convective <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes</b> {{are employed}} in the GFDL GCM to investigate if the spontaneous collapse of the thermohaline circulation under mixed boundary conditions, as observed by F. Bryan, depends on the parameterization of convective overturning. It is found that both a procedure guaranteeing complete static stability and Cox's implicit vertical diffusion scheme avoid the spontaneous collapse. Both schemes are also insensitive to the choice of time step, whereas the standard GFDL convection algorithm in conjunction with mixed boundary conditions produces results that differ qualitatively from each other when different time steps are used...|$|R

A new frame complexity measure is proposed also using the number of motion vector differences to enhance the existing MAD-based frame complexity measure. We propose some target bits modification and QP <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes</b> considering buffer fullness, frame complexity, and number of FMO slice groups to generate a QP that better allocates the bits for encoding the current frame.|$|R

40|$|To {{compromise}} the computational cost {{and the model}} resolution and accuracy of wind fieldover regions with complex terrain, the diagnostic downscaling of prognostic meteorological fields is developed and employed in recent years. This approach aims at providing a simple and efficient algorithm to generate high resolution wind data. An EPA-approved diagnostic model (CALMET) is being {{used in this study}} for downscaling the initial guess field generated from the output of NCAR prognostic model (WRF). Although this method has been widely used, especially in countries or communities where computational resources is limited, the validity of the terrain <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes</b> in the diagnostic model and its sensitivity to the model’s parameterization is not well documented. This kind of parameterizations is of crucial importance on the accuracy of the final wind field output from the model, especially in regions with complex terrain like Hong Kong and PRD or regions where observational data is not available for model evaluation. This study aims at exploring the different terrain <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes</b> in the CALMET model. Their limitations is discussed and documented after numerical experiments on the sensitivity of the model to different parametric relations. Improvements on the parametric relation are also suggested which is expected to also improve the accuracy of the model. Finally, the structure similarity of the diagnostic and prognostic downscaled wind field is evaluated to select a currently best model option. The downscaled wind field from this option with 100 m resolution is also compared to the observation data to access the performance and seek for further improvements...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{robustness}} of pure Nash Equilibria of sponsored search auctions, {{based on the}} forward-looking response function. To consider the robustness of such refined solution concept, we first study the convergence property of several <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes.</b> Especially, we prove that under the randomized scheme, the auction always converges to a unique fixed point with probability one, whose revenue {{is equal to the}} celebrated VCG mechanism. Additionally, we study the robustness of such forward-looking strategic heuristic against aggressive selfish strategic heuristic called vindictive bidding. We investigate three types of such bidding strategies and substantiate that the pure Nash equilibrium still exists under two types even if there is an arbitrary portion of vindictive bidders. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009...|$|R
30|$|The {{approach}} {{taken so}} far [14, 15] modifies the FMO map {{to minimize the}} overhead in bits, and the rate control essentially remains the same. In this article, we take a more proactive approach by proposing enhancements to the H. 264 /AVC frame layer rate control regardless of the FMO mapping, using an explicit FMO map type, to better control the rate when FMO is enabled. The approach taken is similar to other studies on rate control [6 – 8] where frame complexity, target bits and QP <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes</b> are made to enhance the frame layer rate control. We take this approach further by considering the number of motion vector differences to enhance the MAD and develop a new header bits model with FMO enabled, using a different number of slice groups.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-technical {{overview of the}} recent investment literature with a special emphasis on the connection between technological progress and the investment decision. First of all, we acknowledge that some dramatic advances {{have been made in}} the 1990 s in understanding and modelling non-convex capital <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes</b> and irreversibility. Nonetheless, this new literature has not always satisfactorily accounted for the investment-specific (or embodied) nature of technical progress. We argue that the recent technological trends towards more embodiment have had a heavy impact on the way the investment decision is taken and is to be taken. This is turn should imply the reconsideration of many empirical results, and a more careful modelling strategy taking into account the price variables and scrupulously choosing the most appropriate level of (dis) aggregation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to explore adult/child {{interactions}} in a therapeutic situation with an augmentative communication that integrates vocal, gestural and visual modes. This study has an interactionist and multimodal approach of language acquisition. Based on ecological and video data of a child with language delay from 3; 09 to 4; 05, we analyse efficient conditions for the process of language acquisition. On the one hand, we showed how multimodality created by the situation is part of adults' strategies in order to facilitate linguistics forms and, on the other hand, how some modalities of interaction are more efficient than others (i. e. expansions and extensions). The purpose is to establish scaffolding and <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes</b> that contribute to the emergence of language, in addition to the multimodal support...|$|R
40|$|Optimal wage indexation, as {{derived by}} Gray, {{was subject to}} {{criticism}} {{due to a lack}} of efficient use of information; failure to clear the market which resulted in non-optimal contracts; and the lack of an explicit use of welfare criteria. The purpose of this paper is to derive a wage contract scheme that is free from the above criticism, but is capable of preserving the insight of Cray's analysis. In so doing the analysis reveals the role of costs of information collection in a world characterized by incomplete information. The analysis focuses also on the interaction between wage indexation and costly information collection as alternative <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes.</b> It is shown that the first depends only on relative variances, whereas the second also depends on aggregate volatility. The justification for labor contracts hinges on the cost of information collection and last minute wage negotiation. ...|$|R
50|$|Spectral band {{replication}} (SBR) is a {{new technique}} that has gained popularity as an “add-on” to popular perceptual audio codecs such as MP-3 and the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC). New audio coders consisting of a marriage between SBR and the conventional audio coders have been formed, namely the MP3Pro and AAC+. In these algorithms, the lower spectrum is encoded using either MP-3 or AAC, whereas the high band is encoded using SBR. The key to the SBR algorithm is the information {{used to describe the}} high frequency portion of the signal. The primary design goal of this algorithm is to reconstruct the high band spectrum without introducing any aliasing artifacts and to provide good spectral and time resolution. A 64-band complex-valued polyphase filterbank is used at the analysis portion. At the encoder, the filterbank is used to obtain energy samples of the original input signal's high band. These energy samples are then used as reference values for the envelope <b>adjustment</b> <b>scheme</b> used at the decoder.|$|E

Although the code assignment problem has been studied extensively on PRN, we observe in this paper that the power control problem has been ignored by most works, but may have significant impact on performance.

We show given a PRN in which each host already received a code, how to adjust the powers of stations to control /improve the topology of the PRN without violating the original code assignment. Several schemes are proposed. Through simulations, we demonstrate that although the code assignment problem is NP-complete and thus computationally very expensive, using our power <b>adjustment</b> <b>schemes</b> can easily improve the network performance by about 20 % with polynomial costs.

40|$|Aimed at {{ultra-low}} permeability reservoirs, {{the recovery}} effect of inverted nine-spot equilateral well pattern is studied through large-scale natural sandstone flat model experiments.
