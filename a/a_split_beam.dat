50|$|The first dual-beam {{oscilloscope}} {{was developed}} in the late 1930s by the British company A.C.Cossor (later acquired by Raytheon). The CRT was not a true double beam type but used <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>beam</b> made by placing a third plate between the vertical deflection plates. It was widely used during WWII for the development and servicing of radar equipment. Although extremely useful for examining the performance of pulse circuits it was not calibrated so could not be used as a measuring device. It was, however, useful in producing response curves of IF circuits and consequently a great aid in their accurate alignment.|$|E
50|$|Trailer:The trailer {{offered as}} an option with the Astus 20.1 has <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>beam</b> and tilting rollers and is fitted with a winch to {{facilitate}} launching and recovering.Trailer Sailers are boats small and light enough to be towed by ordinary cars. Their width (beam) is constrained by road regulations. In Europe, to be towable on the road {{the width of the}} boat and trailer must not exceed 2.55m. The maximum weight is determined by the towing capacity of the towing vehicle and by the type of driving license.Folding trimarans are particularly well suited as trailer sailers because their narrow width with folded floats makes them towable on the road whilst their wide beam with floats extended makes them stable and safe on the water. Furthermore, the absence of ballast makes them considerably lighter than a keelboat of similar size (375 kg for the Astus 20.1 compared to 1000 kg for a 20 ft keelboat). Heavier boats require a stronger and heavier road trailer, making the towing weight even greater.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Estimating mean fish density {{per unit}} area {{has been done by}} {{counting}} single fish echo traces with <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>beam</b> echo sounder system in the open sea. A data program has been written that scans the acoustic signals for echo peaks and classify these into echo traces. The program counts the number of echo traces from fish that cross the beam within given distances from the acoustic axis over a known sailing distance, and gives an absolute estimate of fish density. This is ob-tained by using the off acoustic axis angles of fish that generate resolved echoes to compute the athwartship distance from the vertical acoustic axis to the fish. The program is described and demonstrated on selected files of raw data recorded by the SIMRAD EK 60 split beam system. Estimated fish densities for these files are also obtained by the echo integration method, and the echo trace method gives estimates that agree well with these estimates under sufficiently “good condi-tions”...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2000 The {{enumeration}} of fish is {{of critical}} importance to the management of both commercial and sport fisheries in Alaska and worldwide. Current methods for riverine fish enumeration are inaccurate and unreliable. Improved fish counting accuracy in Alaskan rivers by acoustic methods is required. <b>A</b> <b>split</b> <b>beam</b> sonar system {{in the presence of}} noise is modeled. The sonar system including the received sonar pulse, receiver system, transducer beam pattern, propagation losses, and noise are modeled. An analysis of the effects of noise, pulse duration and sampling frequency on the uncertainty in fish location is presented. Signal to noise ratios less than 5 dB can cause significant errors in the calculation of received signal phase. A stationary fish with a signal to noise ratio of 15 dB has approximately plus-minus 0. 001 degrees of uncertainty in the angles of arrival. Reducing the SNR to 3 dB the uncertainty increases to plus-minus 3. 6 degrees in the angles of arrival...|$|E

40|$|The Mixed Mode Bending (MMB) test uses a lever to {{simultaneously}} apply mode I and mode II loading to <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>beam</b> specimen. An iterative analysis {{that accounts for}} the geometric nonlinearity of the MMB test was developed. The analysis accurately predicted the measured load displacement response and the strain energy release rate, G, of an MMB test specimen made of APC 2 (AS 4 /PEEK). The errors in G when calculated using linear theory {{were found to be}} as large as thirty percent in some cases. Because it would be inconvenient to use a nonlinear analysis to analyze MMB data, the MMB apparatus was redesigned to minimize the nonlinearity. The nonlinear analysis was used as a guide in redesigning the MMB apparatus. With the redesigned apparatus, loads were applied through a roller attached to the level and loaded just above the midplane of the test specimen. The redesigned apparatuus has geometric nonlinearity errors of less than three percent, even for materials substantially tougher than APC 2. This apparatus was demonstrated by measuring the mixed mode delamination fracture toughness of APC 2...|$|E
40|$|Hydroacoustic {{monitoring}} of fish growing in sea cages needs of an accurate relationship between fish size and target strength (TS) for every species of commercial interest. We discuss {{the conditions for}} TS measurement in near range conditions in sea cages for {{the case of the}} dorsal and ventral aspects of gilthead sea bream and bluefin tuna. Gilthead sea bream dorsal and ventral TS distributions, obtained with <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>beam</b> echosounder, are unimodal and the same results are derived for single beam data analysis when specific processing threshold criteria are applied. The expected linear relationship between the average TS and the logarithm of fish length is only found for the ventral case, being more accurate the uncompensated TS single beam analysis, probably due to near range errors. Bluefin tuna dorsal measurements performed in a fattening farm from February to July did not show a significant variation of TS distributions, and we propose a synchronized system of echosounder and video recordings, in order to relate target strength and orientation and size of specific tuna in the acoustic beam. Preliminary results indicate that only ventral TS values correlate properly with tuna size...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} habitat {{used during}} spawning may potentially {{be an important}} factor affecting reproductive output of broadcast spawning marine fishes, particularly for species with complex, substrate-oriented mating systems and behaviors, such as Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. We characterized the habitat use and behavior of spawning Atlantic cod at two locations off the coast of southwestern Iceland during a 2 -d research cruise (15 – 16 April 2009). We simultaneously operated two different active hydroacoustic gear types, <b>a</b> <b>split</b> <b>beam</b> echosounder and a dual frequency imaging sonar (DIDSON), as well as a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). A total of five fish species were identified through ROV surveys: including cusk Brosme brosme, Atlantic cod, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, lemon sole Microstomus kitt, and Atlantic redfish Sebastes spp. Of the three habitats identified in the acoustic surveys, the transitional habitat between boulder/lava field and sand habitats was characterized by greater fish density and acoustic target strength compared to that of sand or boulder/lava field habitats independently. Atlantic cod were observed behaving {{in a manner consistent with}} published descriptions of spawning. Individuals were observed ascending 1 – 5 m into the water column from the bottom at an average vertical swimming speed of 0. 20 – 0. 25 m s− 1 and maintained an average spacing of 1. 0 – 1. 4 m between individuals. Our results suggest that cod do not choose spawning locations indiscriminately despite the fact that it is a broadcast spawning fish with planktonic eggs that are released well above the seafloor...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{multimode}} theory of non-Gaussian operation induced by an imperfect on/off-type photon detector on <b>a</b> <b>splitted</b> <b>beam</b> from <b>a</b> wideband squeezed light. The events are defined for finite time duration T {{in the time}} domain. The non-Gaussian output state {{is measured by the}} homodyne detector with finite bandwidh B. Under this time- and band-limitation to the quantm states, we develop a formalism to evaluate the frequency mode matching between the on/off trigger channel and the conditional signal beam in the homodyne channel. Our formalism is applied to the CW and pulsed schemes. We explicitly calculate the Wigner function of the conditional non-Gaussian output state in a realistic situation. Good mode matching is achieved for BT 1, where the discreteness of modes becomes prominant, and only a few modes become dominant both in the on/off and the homodyne channels. If the trigger beam is projected nearly onto the single photon state in the most dominant mode in this regime, the most striking non-classical effect will be observed in the homodyne statistics. The increase of BT and the dark counts degrades the non-classical effect. Comment: 20 pages, 14 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of high power {{single mode fiber}} lasers has given deeper and narrower laser welds than seen previously. In some cases the weld becomes too narrow and must be expanded to fit the geometrical shape of a given weld task. It was suggested that instead of using only one beam, the <b>beam</b> was <b>split</b> into multiple <b>beams</b> placed in a pre-specified pattern. In this way {{the dimensions of the}} weld pool could be controlled. This gave the ability to control the final weld face width and penetrationdepth independently of each other with minimum heat input. Practical implementation of <b>splitting</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> into a beam pattern with a diffractive optical element (DOE) is presented with results on <b>splitting</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> from a single mode fiber laser into either three or seven individual beams on a row.

5000|$|Using optical amplifiers, the {{capacity}} of fibers to carry information was dramatically increased {{with the introduction of}} wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) in the early 1990s. AT&T’s Bell Labs developed a WDM process in which <b>a</b> prism <b>split</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> of light into different wavelengths, which could travel through a fiber simultaneously. The peak wavelength of each beam is spaced far enough apart that the beams are distinguishable from each another, creating multiple channels within a single fiber. The earliest WDM systems had only two or four channels—AT&T, for example, deployed a 4-channel long-haul system in 1995. Erbium-doped amplifiers, however, do not amplify signals uniformly across their spectral gain region. During signal regeneration, slight discrepancies in various frequencies introduce an intolerable level of noise into the information-bearing wavelength, making WDM impractical for long-distance fiber communications ...|$|R
