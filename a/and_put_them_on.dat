25|$|England {{having won}} all four matches {{to this point}} (on 8 points) and Wales with three {{victories}} (6 points) meant that their match {{against each other in}} the final week, on 16 March, would determine the champions. A victory by Wales would give them two points <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> equal footing with England. If they won by more than seven points they would move ahead on points differential and retain the title. England were slight favourites heading into the game due to their unbeaten run, although Wales had the advantage of a more experienced side and playing at home in the Millennium Stadium. Going into the final round Scotland were on 4 points, Ireland on 3, Italy on 2 and France on 1. Italy ended up beating Ireland and Scotland lost to France, giving Scotland and Italy 4 points each (with Scotland finishing ahead on points differential) and Ireland and France 3 points each (with Ireland finishing ahead on points differential). France ended up with the wooden spoon, the first time they had finished last in the competition since 1999.|$|E

25|$|England were {{expected}} to lose the seven match ODI series against India, as they were regarded as the dominant team in that format of the game. However, England cruised to victory in the first match at The Rose Bowl, with a convincing victory of 104 runs. The result was largely down to a majestic innings of 126 from Ian Bell, which helped England {{on their way to}} 288/2, a total India never looked like getting. In the second match, India levelled the series,winning the match by 9 runs after posting 329. Although Bell again impressed, hitting 64, England fell just short. England retook the lead following the third match at Edgbaston. Bell again batted well, scoring 79 as England posted 281/8. Although India started well, they were bowled out for 239. England made it back to back wins after winning the fourth ODI, beating India by 3 wickets in a closely fought encounter. The victory gave England a 3-1 series lead <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> course for a series victory.|$|E

500|$|In mid-July 1803, Karađorđe {{obtained}} {{arms and}} munitions from Habsburg Serb merchants in Zemun. Later that month, he dispatched couriers through Šumadija {{calling for a}} meeting of Serbian notables to devise a strategy for resisting the Dahis. The flow of arms from the Austrian Empire into the Pashalik, combined with their inability to crush the guerillas in the countryside, made the Dahi leadership increasingly uneasy. In January and February 1804, the Dahis launched a pre-emptive assault against the Pashalik's Serbian chieftains (known as knezovi, or [...] "princes"), killing between 70 and 150 of them. The killings outraged the Serbian rayah, the Pashalik's tax-paying lower class. By this time, Karađorđe was a well known and well respected figure in Šumadija. He narrowly escaped being killed in the two-month massacre, which {{came to be known}} as the Slaughter of the Knezes (...) [...] Upon killing the chieftains, the Dahis impaled their severed heads on wooden stakes <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> public display. On Candlemas, , the surviving chieftains assembled in the village of Orašac, near Aranđelovac, to decide on a course of action. They agreed to launch a rebellion against the Dahis and Karađorđe was elected without opposition to lead it. It is said that he twice refused to lead the uprising, arguing that his violent temper would make him unsuitable for the role. Karađorđe's initial refusal only reinforced the chieftains' convictions that he was the only suitable candidate, and eventually, he agreed to lead the rebels. This event marked the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising, the opening phase of what would come to be known as the Serbian Revolution.|$|E

500|$|There {{were several}} {{administrative}} difficulties during the tour. Bill Dowling—the {{chairman of the}} Australian Board of Control—had informed Loxton that no Test match was to begin until a receipt for 6,500 pounds had been handed over to Australian authorities. The Australian manager had also been told to rebuff any Pakistani overtures for a reciprocal tour, as it was feared that they lacked public appeal and would have caused financial losses due to a fall in ticket sales. Despite previous assurances to prepare turf pitches, the locals made a matting surface for the First Test. During the Second Test, when asked by General Ayub Khan—head of the ruling military junta—why Pakistan had not been invited to Australia, Loxton exploited the opportunity {{to complain about the}} wickets. When the tourists were greeted by another matting track in the Third Test, Ayub threatened to shoot the groundsmen if they prepared any more non-turf surfaces. The financial issue reared its head before the Second Test against India in Kanpur, when Loxton belligerently refused to start the match after the payment had failed to arrive on time. An Indian official asked the Australian manager to not [...] "spoil a beautiful friendship over money", to which the Australian manager replied [...] "Try me. I want it please...You know the rules." [...] The match proceeded after the cheque was delivered, and India inflicted Australia's only defeat for the tour and their first Test win over the visitors. Another mishap occurred during the Fifth Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta; the Australians left their hotel and took to the field with ten men, having failed to notice that Ian Meckiff had overslept and been left behind by the team bus. During the First Test against Pakistan in Dacca, one of the umpires took off his shoes <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the ground while play was in progress. Loxton took a photo of the scene and lodged it to cricket authorities, asking them to make a ruling on whether a batsman would be out if the ball struck the umpire’s loose shoes and bounced up into a fielder’s hands. However, he never received a reply.|$|E
