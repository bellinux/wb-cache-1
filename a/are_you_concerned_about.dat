40|$|Aim: Dental {{treatment}} {{is necessary in}} oncology patients since pre-existing oro-dental disease may influence cancer treatment and prognosis. This study investigated the applicability of two indices in reflecting the actual oral health status of 100 non-cancer patients who were admitted for dental complaints/routine controls. Methods: The radiographic examination results and the decayed, missed, filled teeth score represented the ‘actual oro-dental status’. The simplified oral hygiene index was utilised for oral hygiene determination, and general oral health assessment index was used to establish the self-perceived oral health. Results: No correlation was observed between actual oro-dental status and the simplified oral hygiene index (p = 0. 27), but the relationship between oro-dental status and general oral health assessment index was significant (p = 0. 026). Items 9, 5 and 1 (How often <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> problems with your teeth, gums or dentures? How often <b>were</b> <b>you</b> able to eat anything without feeling discomfort? How often did you limit the kinds or amounts of food you eat because of problems with your teeth or dentures?) presented correlation (r = − 0. 285, r = 0. 268, and r = − 0. 248).

Many issues often surround a problem or concern. The terms “public issue ” and “public policy ” can be defined in several ways. A private problem or issue becomes public when consequences of individual or group action go beyond those directly involved. An effort by others to influence those consequences is also present. As more people become involved, leaders and interested citizens become aware of the concern. Discussion clarifies and defines the problem or opportunity—the gap between “what is ” and “what could be. ” The issue then emerges as differen...|$|R
