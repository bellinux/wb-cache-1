5000|$|In 1953, Tiffany and Co. of New York chose <b>Adler’s</b> as its sole local representative. That same year, <b>Adler’s</b> {{designed}} the official 14-carat gold plaque commemorating the 150th {{anniversary of the}} Louisiana Purchase presented to President Eisenhower. Window displays have long been {{a big part of}} <b>Adler’s</b> connection to the New Orleans community. <b>Adler’s</b> regularly coordinated their displays with events in civic life. The store created a special display for the local Association of Commerce’s “Made in New Orleans Week.” [...] <b>Adler's</b> displayed local high school students’ work spotlighting the field of social work in 1935, and created window a display of special medals awarded by the branches of the U.S. armed services for National Defense Week in 1937.

5000|$|Max <b>Adler’s</b> first {{theoretical}} work of {{note was}} a study [...] "Max Stirner. Ein Beitrag zur Feststellung des Verhältnisses von Socialismus und Individualismus" [...] (1894). The title sets the agenda for <b>Adler’s</b> later theoretical activities. Although this study of Marx’s scorned opponent seriously antagonized Marxist Party theorists, and so remained unpublished, Stirner remained an influence on <b>Adler’s</b> thinking throughout his life. <b>Adler’s</b> biographer Alfred Pfabigan, upon sight of his unpublished papers, was surprised by his “intellectual relationship with Stirner owing to its high degree of continuity”.|$|R

5|$|On House's insistence, {{neurologist}} Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Cameron {{break into}} Adler's house {{to find anything}} that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of non-kosher ham in Adler's kitchen. House concludes that <b>Adler</b> is suffering from cysticercosis due to eating undercooked pork; when the tapeworm inside of her reproduced, its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. <b>Adler,</b> wishing to die with dignity, refuses to accept more treatments unless {{there is evidence that}} the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, <b>Adler</b> asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an infarction in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her leg, House proves that <b>Adler</b> is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, <b>Adler</b> agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms. A couple of days later, <b>Adler</b> is visited by all 16 of her kindergarten children and their other teacher, whom she welcomes with open arms.|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York, he and Thomashefsky jointly leased The People's Theater, {{intending}} {{to use it}} on different nights of the week. <b>Adler,</b> exhausted from his Russian trip, was often leaving his nights unused, and Thomashefsky offered to buy him out for $10,000 {{on the condition that}} he would not return to performing in New York. <b>Adler</b> was so insulted that the two did not speak for months, even though at the time they were living across a courtyard from one another, and could see into each other's St. Mark's Place apartments. <b>Adler</b> decided to perform Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness, and decided that he would do his own translation from Russian to Yiddish. The play was a great success, the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the U.S., and Thomashefsky was so obviously happy for <b>Adler</b> that their friendship was renewed. <b>Adler</b> followed with equally successful productions of Gordin's dramatization of Tolstoy's Resurrection and the Gordin original The Homeless.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adler</b> and Noxon did {{not return}} for the show's fourth season and instead House writers Russel Friend and Garrett Lerner, and Stacy Traub were hired.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title role}} became {{a pillar of}} <b>Adler's</b> image and career. Theater Magazine wrote of <b>Adler's</b> {{performance}} in a 1901 revival of The Yiddish King Lear, [...] "No finer acting has ever been seen in New York than <b>Adler's</b> gradual transition from the high estate of the Hebrew father distributing his bounty in the opening scenes to the quavering blind beggar of later developments." [...] After <b>Adler's</b> 1920 stroke, when he was nearly paralyzed, on several occasions he played Act I of The Yiddish King Lear {{as part of a}} benefit performance: his character remained seated throughout this act.|$|R
50|$|<b>Adler's</b> {{quickly became}} a local favorite. From its {{earliest}} years, the firm has designed original pieces for the city’s many Mardi Gras krewes each carnival season. <b>Adler’s</b> has been commissioned to create pieces {{for many of the}} area’s historic occasions as well. The firm created the 1904 Times-Picayune Loving Cup awarded to education pioneer Sophie B. Wright. In 1906, <b>Adler’s</b> created a solid silver tea service that local dignitaries presented to naval crew of the U.S.S. Louisiana. The firm was commissioned to create the official Louisiana Centennial coin in 1912. <b>Adler’s</b> designed the silver football perpetual trophy awarded in the annual Thanksgiving Day contest between Tulane University and Centenary College in the 1920s. In 2012, <b>Adler’s</b> created the Louisiana Bicentennial coin from the original 1912 press for the Centennial coin.|$|R

5|$|<b>Adler</b> went on {{the road}} with Boris Thomashefsky, who at the time was {{pioneering}} the touring circuit for Yiddish theater in America. They played in Philadelphia and Chicago, where word arrived of an opportunity to take over Poole's, Heine having moved on to the Thalia. <b>Adler</b> returned to New York, where he managed also to win Mogulesko and Kessler away from Heine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adler</b> {{wrote in}} his memoir that the passion of his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the {{profession}} despite his uncle's view. When she was cast by Rosenberg opposite Jacob Spivakovsky {{in the title role}} of Abraham Goldfaden's darkly comic operetta Breindele Cossack, she pulled strings so that the role of Guberman would be reassigned to <b>Adler.</b>|$|E
5|$|By November 1885, <b>Adler</b> had a {{theatrical}} club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a week, {{but with a}} fame well {{out of proportion to}} the meagre money. Many of the most prominent figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara <b>Adler),</b> gave guest performances when they passed through London.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper addressed the following question: Do select case studies conform to Dr. Freda <b>Adler's</b> theory regarding socio-economic influences on female criminal behavior or dispute her theory?

This study provided evidence that all three case studies conform to <b>Adler's</b> theory. nIn accordance with <b>Adler's</b> theory, each of these three females committed crimes of accessibility.

5|$|In 1963, Briarcliff {{resident}} and artist Myril <b>Adler</b> proposed {{a series of}} exhibits of graphic art; the first showing was in October of that year and recurred each month thereafter, each with Sunday opening receptions. Exhibitors included <b>Adler,</b> Michael Ponce de Leon, Seong Moy, Rodolfo Abularach, Fritz Eichenberg, Jacob Landau, George Earl Ortman, Minna Citron, and Alfredo Da Silva. Exhibited works included etchings and engravings, woodcuts, cellocuts, lithographs, collage intaglios, and serigraphs.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of class, {{kindergarten}} teacher Rebecca <b>Adler</b> (Robin Tunney) becomes dysphasic, falls to the floor, and experiences seizures. Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) attempts to convince the curmudgeonly Gregory House to treat <b>Adler,</b> but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would be boring. Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because the cases are usually simplistic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on <b>Adler,</b> they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic.|$|E
