Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic, sometimes referred to as a second-generation antipsychotic. The receptor-binding profile of risperidone, which includes potent antagonism of the serotonin 5 -HT 2 A, dopamine D 2, and alpha-adrenergic receptors, is believed to be related to positive effects on mood. The FDA-approved bipolar indications for risperidone include: 1) monotherapy for short-term treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and 2) combination therapy with lithium or valproate for the short-term treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. This review of risperidone for bipolar mania will address the chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of risperidone, use with concomitant medications, clinical trials in bipolar mania, as well as safety and tolerability issues.

40|$|Background: Estimation {{of facial}} aging has <b>assumed</b> <b>growing</b> <b>importance</b> {{due to the}} advent of several antiaging therapies. Evidence-based {{estimation}} of global facial aging is often necessary, especially for validation of these treatment modalities. Most available methods are expensive and {{have been used in}} fair skinned individuals. Aim: We attempted to develop a clinical rating scale for the estimation of global facial aging applied on an Indian population which has brown to black skin. We have also measured the association of this rating scale score with the chronological age. Methods: Initially, a 14 - item summated rating scale was developed with inputs from five dermatologists and a clinical pharmacologist. The rating scale was applied to 105 consenting subjects with healthy facial skin between 30 to 90 years of age. Intra- and inter-rater reliability was assessed. Results: The summated rating score showed a significant positive correlation with the chronological age (Pearson′s correlation coefficient 0. 834, P < 0. 001). We omitted one item from the scale due to a low inter-rater agreement. The resulting 13 -item rating scale was internally consistent (Cronbach′s alpha: 0. 905), with substantial inter- and intra-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0. 973 and 0. 788, respectively). Principal components and predictive equation for perceptible age were identified on further computation. Limitations: Participants of this study were limited to a particular ethnic group from West Bengal and other neighboring states of Eastern India. Conclusions: We have developed and validated a 13 -item rating scale for the quantification of global facial aging suitable for Indian (brown to black) skin type.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has <b>assumed</b> <b>growing</b> <b>importance</b> in the detection of cardiac sources of embolism. However, there is controversy regarding the implications of TEE findings for the therapeutic approach to patients with ischemic stroke. OBJECTIVES: To analyze TEE findings in the diagnostic work-up of patients with ischemic cerebral events and to determine their influence on therapeutic strategy. METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) before the age of 65, of no apparent cause after carotid ultrasound, electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiography, who underwent TEE between 1992 and 2009. The following diagnoses on TEE were considered as potential embolic sources: atrial septal defect; patent foramen ovale (PFO); atrial septal aneurysm (ASA); vegetations; tumors; intracavitary thrombi; and aortic plaques > 2 mm (ascending aorta and arch). RESULTS: We analyzed 294 patients, mean age 45 years, 56. 8 % men. TEE revealed a potential cardioembolic source in 36. 7 % of the patients, PFO and ASA being the most frequent. Throughout the period considered, there was an increase in the number of exams performed, as well as in diagnoses, mainly PFO and ASA. Comparison of patients with and without a diagnosis on TEE showed that the former were older and were more often prescribed oral anticoagulation. By multivariate analysis, the presence of a positive TEE finding was shown to be an independent predictor of treatment with oral anticoagulation (OR= 2. 48; CI 95 %: 1. 42 - 4. 34; p= 0. 001).

Superficially, however, ontologies and models are very similar, and in fact are sometimes visualized using the same language (e. g. UML). This has given rise to avariety of different interpretations of the roles of the two technologies, and had generated a certain degree of confusion about the relationship between them. Sowhat exactly isthe difference between ontologies and models and why are both concepts needed? Are they basically the same thing viewed from different angles oristhere some fundamental difference between them beyond the idiosyncrasies of current tools and languages? This paper discusses this question. After considering common informal distinctions between ontologies and models, and analyzing their fundamental definitions, we propose how they might usefully be distinguished in the future. ...|$|R

It addresses two board issues: 1) Has there been a convergence in the safety nets of these member countries of the European Union during the 1990 s? 2) What are the implications of enlargement of the European Union {{for the creation of a}} common safety net? Initially several dimensions of the poverty regime are employed to compare the safety nets. Subsequently we analyze the incidence of poverty and poverty reduction for the entire population and vulnerable groups-the unemployed, solo mothers and large families, and the elderly-in the countries using data from the Luxembourg Income Study. In analyzing poverty reduction effectiveness we utilize both relative and absolute measures to gauge the impact of income maintenance policies, distinguishing between the safety net and other transfers. The analysis reveals that during the 1990 s the poverty rate increased in most countries and in many instances for vulnerable groups; an exception was the elderly. Means tested benefits <b>assumed</b> <b>growing</b> <b>importance</b> in alleviating poverty, but reforms also produced diversity in the safety nets across Europe. Contrary to earlier theorizing that means tested benefits are marginalized in the social democratic welfare state regime, we find that the safety nets in these countries often equaled or surpassed that of the UK in reducing poverty. Finally, apart from impressive poverty reduction, the policies of the three candidate countries did not form a distinctive poverty regime. Instead they tended to cluster with other member countries...|$|E
40|$|A partir de 1970, o Estado (em maior grau, a instância Federal), até então, agente central na condução do processo de desenvolvimento {{territorial}} e urbano mato-grossense, inicia a ampliação das parcerias com os agentes privados neste processo. Ao longo das décadas seguintes, estes agentes privados passaram a assumir crescente protagonismo na articulação, formulação e condução das ações de planejamento em Mato Grosso - definindo uma rede de infraestrutura regional e urbana voltada, essencialmente, a produção e exportação de commodities. Nesta época, o Estado instituiu um conjunto de políticas territoriais que intensificaram o processo de urbanização, materializado, p. ex, nas quatro cidades planejadas que constituíram objeto inicial desta pesquisa - Alta Floresta, Matupá, Sapezal e Sinop-, polos urbanos dos microterritórios da atuação inicial dos agentes privados. O estudo das políticas territoriais, públicas e privadas implantadas em Mato Grosso, ao longo de quarenta anos, evidencia as principais transformações nas dimensões sociais, econômicas e ambientais. A metodologia de pesquisa utilizada privilegiou a análise do espaço por meio da articulação das suas diferentes escalas: regional, urbana e intraurbana. Foram examinados os impactos socioeconômicos e ambientais decorrentes da organização e transformação do espaço mato-grossense voltadas ao desenvolvimento da agroindústria, que o integrou economicamente ao território brasileiro. A pesquisa também mostra que o processo de promoção do desenvolvimento pelo Estado teve como contrapartida indissociável uma atuação proeminente da parte de agentes privados que organizaram, consolidaram e expandiram seus microterritórios em Mato Grosso, ou a partir de Mato Grosso, em redes técnicas e políticas. Demonstra-se, dessa forma, a existência de uma justaposição entre políticas territoriais públicas e privadas. O trabalho conclui que as intensas transformações nas estruturas regionais e urbanas de Mato Grosso, iniciadas com o processo de intervencionismo estatal dos anos de 1970, são resultado, principalmente, da atuação dos agentes privados que promovem a agroindústria, suplantando o protagonismo tradicionalmente atribuído ao Estado desenvolvimentista. Por outro lado, {{a magnitude}} dos problemas sociais e ambientais gerados por esse processo deixa clara a necessidade de um novo patamar de eficácia da ação estatal, não na promoção direta, mas priorizando à articulação entre iniciativas públicas e privadas. Since 1970, the State (to a greater extent, the federal level), until then the central agent in conducting the territorial {{and urban development}} process in Mato Grosso State, starts the expansion of partnerships with the private agents in this process. At that time, the State instituted a set of territorial policies that intensified the urbanization process, materialized, for example, in the four planned cities that constituted the initial object of this investigation - Alta Floresta, Matupá, Sapezal and Sinop - urban centers of microterritories where these private agents act at first. Over the following decades, these private agents have <b>assumed</b> <b>growing</b> <b>importance</b> in the join, formulation and conduct of planning actions in Mato Grosso State, defining a network of regional and urban infrastructure, focused mainly on the production and exportation of commodities. The study of territorial policies, both public and private, implemented in Mato Grosso State over forty years, highlights the major changes in social, economic and environmental dimensions. The research methodology privileged the analysis of space through the articulation of its different scales: regional, urban and intra-urban. The socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the organization and transformation of mato-grossense space due {{to the development of}} agribusiness, which economically integrated this State with the territory of Brazil, were examined. The survey also shows that the process of promoting development by the State had its inseparable counterpart in the outstanding performance of the private agents who organized, consolidated and expanded their microterritories in Mato Grosso State, or from Mato Grosso State, into technical and political networks. It is demonstrated, therefore, that there is an overlap between public and private territorial policies. The research implies that the profound transformations in regional and urban structures of Mato Grosso State, which began with the process of State interventionism of the 1970 s, are mainly a result of the actions of private agents that promote agribusiness, supplanting the leading role traditionally assigned to the State developmental. On the other hand, the magnitude of the social and environmental problems generated by this process makes clear the need for a new level of effectiveness of State action, prioritizing a better coordination between public and private initiatives...|$|E

Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) {{is one of the}} options that can enable the utilization of fossil fuels with lower CO₂ emissions. Of the different technologies for CO₂ capture, capture of CO₂ by chemical absorption is the technology that is closest to commercialization. While a number of different solvents for use in chemical absorption of CO₂ have been proposed, a systematic comparison of performance of different solvents has not been performed and claims on the performance of different solvents vary widely. This thesis focuses on developing a consistent framework for an objective comparison of the performance of different solvents. This framework has been applied to evaluate the performance of three different solvents - monoethanolamine, potassium carbonate and chilled ammonia. In this thesis, comprehensive flow-sheet models have been built for each of the solvent systems, using ASPEN Plus as the modeling tool. In order to ensure an objective and consistent comparison of the performance of different solvent systems, the representation of physical properties, thermodynamics and kinetics had to be verified and corrected as required in ASPEN Plus. The ASPEN RateSep module was used to facilitate the computation of mass transfer characteristics of the system for sizing calculations. For each solvent system, many parametric simulations were performed to identify the effect on energy consumption in the system. The overall energy consumption in the CO₂ capture and compression system was calculated and an evaluation of the required equipment size for critical equipment in the system was performed. The degradation characteristics and environmental impact of the solvents were also investigated. In addition, different flow-sheet configurations were explored to optimize the energy recuperation for each system. Monoethanolamine (MEA) was evaluated as the base case system in this thesis. Simulations showed the energy penalty for CO₂ capture from flue gas from coal-fired power plants to be 0. 01572 kWh/gmol CO₂. The energy penalty from CO₂ regeneration accounted for 60 % of the energy penalty while the compression work accounted for 30 %. The process flexibility in the MEA system was limited by degradation reactions. It was found that different flow-sheet configurations for energy recuperation in the MEA system did not improve energy efficiency significantly. Chilled ammonia was explored as an alternative to MEA for use in new coal-fired power plants as well as for retrofitting existing power plants. The overall energy penalty for CO₂ capture in chilled ammonia was found to be higher than in the MEA system, though energy requirements for CO₂ regeneration were found to be lower. The energy penalty for 85 % capture of CO₂ in the chilled ammonia system was estimated to be 0. 021 kWh/gmol CO₂. As compared to the MEA system, the breakdown of the energy requirements was different with refrigeration in the absorber accounting for 44 % of the energy penalty. This illustrates the need to perform a systemwide comparison of different solvents in order to evaluate the performance of various solvent systems. The use of potassium carbonate as a solvent for CO₂ capture was evaluated for use in Integrated Reforming Combined Cycle (IRCC) system. With potassium carbonate, a high partial pressure of CO₂ in the flue gas is required. Different schemes for energy recuperation in the system were investigated and the energy consumption was reduced by 22 % over the base case. An optimized version of the potassium carbonate flowsheet was developed for an IRCC application with a reboiler duty of 1980 kJ/kg. In conclusion, a framework for the comparison of the performance of different solvents for CO₂ capture has been developed and the performance of monoethanolamine, chilled ammonia and potassium carbonate has been compared. From the standpoint of energy consumption, for existing power plants the use of MEA is found to be the best choice while for future design of power plants, potassium carbonate appears to be an attractive alternative. An economic analysis based on the technical findings in this thesis will help in identifying the optimal choices for various large, stationary sources of CO₂. by Anusha Kothandaraman. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Hence, innovation is critical {{to the creation of a}} knowledge-based economy which in turn is vital to a country like Armenia that is landlocked, has scarce natural resources and faces high transportation costs.|$|R

By using these trading methods countries expect to be able to ensure a continuation of the urgently needed flow of imports, open up new markets for surplus products and bring about greater export diversification as between both regions and products. The following article therefore focuses on the countertrade of Third World countries, both among themselves and with industrialised countries...|$|R

It is considered important that the teaching of {{physical medicine and rehabilitation}} should be carried out concurrently with other medical and surgical teaching programs. Paramedical and auxiliary rehabilitation personnel should participate in the teaching program. The number of hours devoted to physiatrics should be increased, and the medical student should be permitted to choose physical medicine and rehabilitation as a part of his internship program...|$|R

The importance of this concern is provided by recent public awareness over health risks from improper disposal of toxic wastes {{as well as by the}} continuing emphasis on risk assessment. The first step in the chain of the risk assessment is the quantification of the error in predicting water quality. For each mathematical modelling application, different uncertainties are involved. The uncertainty-sources can be classified into different categories (model-input uncertainty, model-structure uncertainty, model-parameter uncertainty and measurement errors). These different types of uncertainty sources determine collectively the total uncertainty in the model results. In this paper, the relative contributions of uncertainties associated with each source were studied. This provides information as to where available resources should be focused...|$|R

But as concret activity and as particular type of political knowledge, diplomacy <b>assumes</b> a <b>growing</b> <b>importance</b> in the modern age. What was central to relations among states was not a sphere of formalized actions (“diplomacy”) but a “role,” or an “office: that of ambassador. This contribution try to sketch out the features, the activities and the political learning of modern ambassadors, both in the leaterature about the ambassador’s institutio, and in the political practice of Early Modern Italy. Instead of writing about diplomacy as a specific sector of statecraft, early modern authors focused on the ambassador’s moral profile and duties. Until the late seventeenth century, writings about ambassadorship were primarily works on political ethics and education in a “role. ...|$|R
40|$|Student mobility, {{defined as}} the {{movement}} of students between national systems of higher education is an activity <b>assuming</b> <b>growing</b> <b>importance</b> within {{the region of the}} European Union (EU). In recent years, policy-makers in the EU have ascribed academic mobility a political and economic role of significant proportions. Indeed, student mobility is expected to contribute to the international competitiveness of the European economy, to create European elite identities with a commitment to furthering European integration and to produce a mobile labour force, which is central {{to the success of the}} Single Market. In this context, student mobility has been thrust onto the policy agenda of intergovernmental organisations, national governments and higher education institutions within the EU. Although student mobility has become an explicit issue of policy within the EU, there has been little attempt to carefully analyse developments. In fact, the research literature pertaining to academic mobility remains limited, parochial, atheoretical and centred on student experiences. This thesis seeks to develop our knowledge and understanding of undergraduate student mobility in the EU through an analysis of policy at the intergovernmental, national and institutional levels in the context of a policy analysis framework. The result is new theoretically informed insights into the emergence, development, implementation and impacts of student mobility policy. Most notably, the creation of a systems model of the student mobility policy process facilitates an improved understanding of the relative contribution and interdependence of decision-makers at the intergovernmental, national and institutional levels during policy development and implementation. It is hoped that these insights enhance the understanding of those who make, implement and evaluate policy, such that the opportunities and constraints of future years are given considered attention in an area of increasing European significance...|$|R
40|$|Research on 4 G/ 5 G {{cellular}} networks is progressively {{shifting to}} paradigms that involve virtualization and cloud computing. Within this context, prototyping <b>assumes</b> a <b>growing</b> <b>importance</b> as a performance evaluation method, besides large-scale simulations, as it {{allows one to}} evaluate the computational requirements of the system. Both approaches share {{the need for a}} structured and statistically sound experiment management, with the goal of reducing errors in both planning and measurement collection. In this paper, we describe how we solve the problem with OpenAirInterface (OAI), an open-source system for prototyping 4 / 5 G cellular networks. We show how to integrate a sound, validated software, namely ns 2 -measure, with OAI, so as to enable harvesting samples of arbitrary metrics in a structured way, and we describe scripts that allow structured experiment management, such as launching a parametric simulation campaign and harvesting its results in a plot-ready format. We complete the paper by demonstrating some advantages brought about by our modifications...|$|R

It is <b>assuming</b> a <b>growing</b> <b>importance</b> all over the Europe and represents a preferred channel for promoting Made in Italy offer. Numerous competences with different skill, abilities and background are necessary to fulfill market requirements. Stakeholders are arranged into complex inter and intra temporary networks where sometimes- conflicting interests and purposes need to converge into a single and integrated design solution. Contract furniture combines product design with interior and architectural design requests to provide coherent furniture by assembling custom high-quality items from different firms. As a consequence, the design process is complex and collaboration is imperative to achieve the expected goals. This paper explores contract furniture design and defines a technological platform to support team working. The proposed methodology is applied to an industrial case study in the hospitality and retail sectors. Method application brings to define the system platform architecture and its main software modules...|$|R
40|$|The PMI are <b>assuming</b> a <b>growing</b> <b>importance</b> as {{promoters}} {{of the economic}} industry, in particular {{in some of the}} most dynamic local productive systems in Europe. In spite of this, the majority of the PMI are affected by the lack of funds available to invest in research and development, a field traditionally considered to be the main source of innovation. This apparent contradiction has induced many studious to investigate the sources from which the PMI obtain their inputs of knowledge. Such investigation, which has tended to use patents as proxy of the public research activity, has shown that PMI are particuarly sensitive to the disclosures which derive from public and university research. In this essay, the matter is analysed by using, in place of the number of patents, a bibliometric indicator of the output of public research with regard to 99 Italian provinces during the nineties. The results highlight a strong geographical correlation between the teritorial concentration of the PMI and public research that, at the same time, such correlation is influenced by the size of the enterprize...|$|R
