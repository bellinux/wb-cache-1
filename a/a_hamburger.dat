5|$|Another failed product, {{this time}} under Grand Metropolitan's {{successor}} Diageo, was the BK Back Porch Grillers line of burgers that featured a spiced and flavored patty {{served on a}} bakery-style roll. There were two varieties: The Regular served with mayonnaise, whole leaf iceberg lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, and the Bacon Cheddar, with bacon and smoked cheddar cheese. There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote Men in Black II. The Griller patty was flavored so {{that it had a}} taste similar to <b>a</b> <b>hamburger</b> that had been grilled over a charcoal-fired grill.|$|E
5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant was a family-owned American-style steakhouse {{and seafood}} {{restaurant}} in the Woodstock neighborhood of southeast Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Adjacent to the restaurant was a bar called CB's Lounge. The restaurant opened in 1964 when ownership transferred from Bill Blake to Ron Thomas' family. Though Thomas was not particularly fond {{of the name of}} the business Blake had established in 1960, he was unable to afford new signage and kept the lounge's title. Over time the restaurant grew from <b>a</b> <b>hamburger</b> stand into a family dining restaurant, expanding from one space to four. In 1978, the family purchased the building and property following the landlord's death.|$|E

5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant {{opened in}} 1964 after Ron Thomas' family {{purchased}} the business from Bill Blake for $600.

Though he was not fond of the lounge's name, Thomas was unable to afford new signage and kept the title.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered <b>a</b> <b>hamburger</b> and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E
5|$|Diablo Cody {{was first}} {{approached}} {{to write a}} screenplay by film producer Mason Novick, who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir, , after discovering her blog about stripping. He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen, but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios; that sample became Juno. After deciding on an adoption storyline, Cody collected the stories of adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents, including that of her then-husband, an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote the film. She also found inspiration {{in the story of}} a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend's experience in the film, such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician. Much of Juno, however, was based on Cody's own high school experiences: She dated a tic-tac-loving boy similar to Paulie, she was best friends with a cheerleader like Leah, and she used <b>a</b> <b>hamburger</b> phone identical to the one that appears in the film. After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section of a Target store in Crystal, Minnesota, Cody compared writing to breathing, seeing Juno as an extension of herself.|$|E
