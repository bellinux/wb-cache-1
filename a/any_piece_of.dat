5|$|It is {{a long-standing}} practice, {{as with many}} Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> work they do. It stands for the Latin phrase Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam which means For the Greater Glory of God. At {{the end of a}} piece of work they write L.D.S. in the centre of the page. It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always. These are both {{traditional}} Jesuit mottoes.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{forensic}} fields, forensic anthropologists {{are held}} to {{a high level of}} ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals who fail to disclose any conflict of interests or who fail to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions. It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.|$|E
5|$|Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project, and {{was largely}} unguided. It was tasked with {{research and development}} of almost <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> equipment that might help with the mission outlined in its charter. As a result, few of the programs came to fruition and fewer still left a definitive mark on the conflict. The developments under Shed Light were quickly eclipsed by new aircraft produced under Project Gunship (notably under Gunship II and Gunship III). They were fitted with many of the sensors developed under Shed Light, but took on a life all their own. Shed Light’s most visible programs, Black Spot and Tropic Moon, have largely fallen into obscurity.|$|E

25|$|As with <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> {{equipment}} {{that depends on}} coils to transfer heat between air and a fluid, {{it is important for}} both the condenser and evaporator coils to be kept clean. If deposits of dust and other debris are allowed to accumulate on the coils, the efficiency of the unit (both in heating and cooling modes) will suffer.|$|E
25|$|In {{emergency}} situations, {{a prescription}} pad {{may not be}} available. In this situation, <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> paper will do, provided it is marked Periculum in mora!; that is, danger in delay (other designations, such as Cito! or Statim!, are also used and understood). Such ad-hoc prescriptions have a limited period of validity; typically, {{this is the day}} after the prescription is written.|$|E
25|$|Lumads have a {{traditional}} concept of land ownership {{based on what}} their communities consider their ancestral territories. The historian B. R. Rodil notes that ‘a territory occupied by a community is a communal private property, and community members have the right of usufruct to <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> unoccupied land within the communal territory.’ Ancestral lands include cultivated land as well as hunting grounds, rivers, forests, uncultivated land and the mineral resources below the land.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} theories of interpretation. On the one hand, there may be innumerable interpretations for <b>any</b> given <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> art, <b>any</b> one {{of which may be}} considered valid. However, it may also be claimed that there really is only one valid interpretation for <b>any</b> given <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> art. The aesthetic theory that says people may approach art with different but equally valid aims is called [...] "pluralism." [...] But the aim of some of interpretations is such that they claim to be true or false.|$|R

Similar {{to his work}} on O Brother, Burnett chose a mix of vintage songs by Blind Willie Johnson, The Soul Stirrers, Swan Silvertones and Bill Landford & The Landfordaires, along with recordings of contemporary black gospel artists, including Donnie McClurkin, Rose Stone, Bill Maxwell and church choirs, made especially for the film soundtrack. Hip hop songs by Nappy Roots and Little Brother are also featured.|$|R
25|$|The {{television}} licence fee. Within the State, it {{is necessary}} to pay a fee of €160 per annum to legally possess <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> equipment capable of receiving television signals (not necessarily those of RTÉ). This money is collected by An Post on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The state pays for TV Licence Inspectors who have the power to obtain and execute search warrants of private houses. Failure to possess a valid television licence can result in a fine and a criminal record.|$|E
25|$|Nishi {{proposed}} MSX as {{an attempt}} to create a single industry standard for home computers. Inspired by the success of VHS as a standard for video cassette recorders, many Japanese electronic manufacturers along with GoldStar, Philips and Spectravideo built and promoted MSX computers. <b>Any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> hardware or software with the MSX logo on it was compatible with MSX products of other manufacturers. In particular, the expansion cartridge form and function were part of the standard; any MSX expansion or game cartridge would work in any MSX computer.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} organ console was {{not adequate}} {{to control a}} theatre organ, as {{the large number of}} draw knobs required made the console so huge an organist could not possibly reach all of them while playing. Thus, the horseshoe console was born. Based on a curved French console design and using stop tabs instead of drawknobs, the horseshoe console now allowed the organist to reach any stop or control while playing <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> music, eliminating the need to move around awkwardly on the bench. The smaller stop tabs also permitted the addition of many more stops on the console than could be added on a traditional console.|$|E

25|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the collection is Le Rêve, the Picasso portrait that was the working name of the resort project. Wynn purchased the painting from an anonymous collector in a private sale in 2001. In 2006 he reportedly was {{to sell it to}} Steven A. Cohen for $139 million, which would at that time have been the highest price paid for <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> art. However, he put his elbow through the canvas while showing it to a group of guests—including the screenwriter Nora Ephron and her husband Nick Pileggi, the broadcaster Barbara Walters, the art dealer Serge Sorokko and his wife, the model Tatiana Sorokko, the New York socialite Louise Grunwald, and the lawyer David Boies and his wife, Mary.|$|E
25|$|The Aeroscraft’s {{cargo system}} {{provides}} the aircraft with unmatched volume and flexibility when deploying cargo to virtually any {{point on the}} planet, empowering the aircraft to pick-up and off-load cargo in more efficient ways, even from hover. The internal cargo handling system {{has been designed to}} facilitate cargo loading, sorting, and unloading in a more innovative and efficient manner, overcoming pre-deployment requirements for ground handling cargo equipment in austere environments. The system affixes containers and cargo pallets to rails in the fuselage ceiling, rather than on the floor; adjusts cargo positioning to accommodate changes in center of gravity, such as when other cargo is loaded and unloaded; facilitates access to <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> cargo at any time, eliminating unneeded cargo movements and reducing ground time; and eliminates labor costs with traditional cargo handling and weight-and-balance requirements.|$|E

50|$|While many authors, (e.g. Neil Gaiman, J.K. Rowling, D.J. MacHale, Stephenie Meyer, Terry Pratchett) do {{not take}} issue with authors of {{derivative}} works, a number of authors do. They may request that fan fiction archival sites remove and ban <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> fan fiction based on their original works.

In {{the summer}} of 1968, Fritz the Cat strips appeared in the Viking Press compilation titled Head Comix, which focused exclusively on Crumb's material. In 1969, Ballantine Books paid Crumb a $5,000 advance for the publication rights to a compilation of three stories featuring Fritz. Crumb used the money to purchase a three-acre lot. In 2017, Crumb's original cover art for the Ballantine collection sold at auction for $717,000, the highest sale price to that point for <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> American cartoon art.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} extant {{record of}} the painting is in a 1492 inventory of the Medici family, where it {{is described as a}} small panel bust of a French lady, coloured in oil, the work of Pietro Cresci of Bruges. However, it seems from other works in the collection that the scribe was uninformed and noted <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> northern art in the collection as [...] "French". It was highly valued, with an unusually high price of 40 florins, and [...] prominently displayed. The record does not address the matter of the girl's identity beyond her nationality, indicating that the painting was regarded as of aesthetic rather than historical interest.|$|E

500|$|Sonnets are, canonically, {{poems of}} 14 lines with {{assorted}} rhyming schemes. Originating in the 14th century works of Petrarch, {{the most common}} form of the sonnet is known as the Italian Sonnet: a stanza of eight lines in which the writer lays out a complex thought, followed by a pause and a six-line conclusion [...] "which is characteristically both unpredictable and intense". This was interlinked with the idea of courtly love, in which the goal of a romance is not simply passion, but a more significant moral perfection. [...] "The Good-Morrow", although identified by Donne as a sonnet, does not follow this structural layout, although it does follow the thematic one; Donne used [...] "sonnet" [...] simply to refer to <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> love poetry, ignoring the fact that [...] "The Good-Morrow" [...] was a 21-line work divided into three stanzas.|$|E

[...] Initially called The Lawton Story and filmed in Cinecolor, the film was so cheaply, shoddily and quickly made that telephone poles could be seen behind the crucifix. Its cast consisted of local non-professionals whose Oklahoma twangs were so thick that all of their lines had to re-recorded by professional voice-over actors; upon release, one reviewer described it as [...] "the only film {{that had to be}} dubbed from English to English." [...] In addition to re-dubbing it, Babb re-edited and re-titled it The Prince of Peace; it was so successful that the New York Daily News called it [...] "the Miracle of Broadway." ...|$|E

40|$|Frank Jackson’s famous Knowledge Argument {{moves from}} the premise that {{complete}} physical knowledge about experiences is not complete knowledge about experiences to the falsity of physicalism. Some physicalists (e. g., John Perry) have countered by arguing that what Jackson’s Mary, the perfect scientist who acquires all physical knowledge about experiencing red while being locked in a monochromatic room, lacks before experiencing red is merely a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> recognitional knowledge of an identity, and that since lacking a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> recognitional knowledge of an identity does not entail lacking <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> knowledge of worldly facts, physicalism is safe. I will argue that what Mary lacks in her room {{is not merely a}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> recognitional knowledge of an identity and that some physicalists have failed to see this because of a failure to appreciate that Mary’s epistemic progress when she first experiences red has two different stages. While the second epistemic stage can perhaps be plausibly considered as acquiring merely a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> recognitional knowledge of an identity, {{there is good reason to}} think that the first epistemic stage cannot be thus considered...|$|R
