2500|$|W. <b>A.</b> <b>Speck</b> {{wrote in}} 1980 that a reason Macaulay's History of England [...] "still {{commands}} respect {{is that it}} was based upon a prodigious amount of research". Speck claims that [...] "Macaulay's reputation as an historian has never fully recovered from the condemnation it implicitly received in Herbert Butterfield's devastating attack on The Whig Interpretation of History. Though he was never cited by name, {{there can be no doubt}} that Macaulay answers to the charges brought against Whig historians, particularly that they study the past with reference to the present, class people in the past as those who furthered progress and those who hindered it, and judge them accordingly". Speck also said that Macaulay too often [...] "denies the past has its own validity, treating it as being merely a prelude to his own age. This is especially noticeable in the third chapter of his History of England, when again and again he contrasts the backwardness of 1685 with the advances achieved by 1848. Not only does this misuse the past, it also leads him to exaggerate the differences". On the other hand, Speck also wrote that Macaulay [...] "took pains to present the virtues even of a rogue, and he painted the virtuous warts and all", and that [...] "he was never guilty of suppressing or distorting evidence to make it support a proposition which he knew to be untrue". Speck concluded: [...] "What is in fact striking is the extent to which his History of England at least has survived subsequent research. Although it is often dismissed as inaccurate, it is hard to pinpoint a passage where he is categorically in error... his account of events has stood up remarkably well... His interpretation of the Glorious Revolution also remains the essential starting point for any discussion of that episode... What has not survived, or has become subdued, is Macaulay's confident belief in progress. It was a dominant creed in the era of the Great Exhibition. But Auschwitz and Hiroshima destroyed this century's claim to moral superiority over its predecessors, while the exhaustion of natural resources raises serious doubts about the continuation even of material progress into the next." ...|$|E
