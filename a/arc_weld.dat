When accessed, the player is given a menu of the available items. When an item is chosen it can be picked up at an adjacent dispenser area. The objects received from the terminals disappear upon {{the death of the}} player that obtained them. Terminals may be neutral and available to both sides, or under the control of one side. Terminals can be attacked and disabled, but not destroyed. If damaged or disabled, they can be repaired with an <b>arc</b> <b>weld,</b> issued to the Demolisher and Sky Jockey classes. Neutral or enemy-controlled terminals can be hacked with a 's hacking device. There are two types of terminals: Specialist Ordinance terminals, and Mobile Units terminals.|$|E
