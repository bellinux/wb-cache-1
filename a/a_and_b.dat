5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b</b> is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b</b> is actually {{the same as the}} set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b</b> is the ideal generated byg alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b</b> also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>B</b> alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>B</b> alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>B</b> alleles, chances are that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Bézout's {{identity}} {{states that}} the greatest common divisor g of two integers <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b</b> can be represented as a linear sum of the original two numbers <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b.</b> In other words, it is always possible to find integers s and t such that g = sa + tb.|$|E

5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} calculates {{the greatest}} common divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b.</b> The {{greatest common divisor}} g is the largest natural number that divides both <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b</b> without leaving a remainder. Synonyms for the GCD include the greatest common factor (GCF), the highest common factor (HCF), the highest common divisor (HCD), and the greatest common measure (GCM). The greatest common divisor is often written as gcd(a,b) or, more simply, as (a,b), although the latter notation is also used for other mathematical concepts, such as two-dimensional vectors.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the {{algorithm is}} formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for real numbers. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b</b> corresponds to the greatest length g that measures <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b</b> evenly; in other words, the lengths <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b</b> are both integer multiples of the length g.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution.

In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b,</b> including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be less than or equal to r'N−1.
