The <b>accumulator</b> <b>vessel</b> size dictates total energy storage capacity and may require more space than an electric battery set. Any vehicle space consumed by a larger size of <b>accumulator</b> <b>vessel</b> may be offset by {{the need for a}} smaller sized charging engine, in HP and physical size.|$|E
40|$|The Integral Test Facility Karlstein (INKA) test {{facility}} {{was designed and}} erected to test {{the performance of the}} passive safety systems of KERENA, the new AREVA Boiling Water Reactor design. The experimental program included single component/system tests of the Emergency Condenser, the Containment Cooling Condenser and the Passive Core Flooding System. Integral system tests, including also the Passive Pressure Pulse Transmitter, will be performed to simulate transients and Loss of Coolant Accident scenarios at the {{test facility}}. The INKA test facility represents the KERENA Containment with a volume scaling of 1 : 24. Component heights and levels are in full scale. The reactor pressure vessel is simulated by the <b>accumulator</b> <b>vessel</b> of the large valve test facility of Karlstein - a vessel with a design pressure of 11 MPa and a storage capacity of 125 m 3. The vessel is fed by a benson boiler with a maximum power supply of 22 MW. The INKA multi compartment pressure suppression Containment meets the requirements of modern and existing BWR designs. As a result of the large power supply at the facility, INKA is capable of simulating various accident scenarios, including a full train of passive systems, starting with the initiating event - for example pipe rupture.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes require high amounts of steam. Design {{and operation of}} steam plants are particularly complex when the steam supply is required for short periods and with a varying time schedules. To fulfil the discontinuous needs of steam users, avoiding the steam boiler oversizing to the peak value of the steam request, a thermal energy storage (TES) system can be adopted. The proper sizing of TES systems, which, in this application, is constituted by a steam <b>accumulator</b> <b>vessel</b> installed between the steam generator and the consumer, cannot {{be based on the}} sole initial and final state conditions of the steam storage, since a performance prediction of the process time-evolution is also required. In this paper, a model of steam batch processes for industrial thermal treatments, able to describe unsteady operative conditions, is presented. More in detail, a three-stage steam plant, with a sequentially interconnected steam boiler, steam accumulator and processing tank, has been considered. The dynamic model of the charging and discharging processes of the steam accumulator has been applied to a real case study in the food industry: the batch debacterisation process of cocoa beans. Nevertheless, the obtained results can be profitably employed in the design and the performance assessments of a wide set of applications involving the steam processing fluid, such as desalination plants, solar thermal power plants, retorts, steam ovens and others...|$|E
40|$|Critical {{stress states}} highly depend {{not only on}} types and the {{distribution}} of stresses but also the intensity and the character of changes. A large number of pressure vessels, during its whole life, are exposed to a variable pressure that is oscillating around a constant value. A special case of pressure <b>vessels</b> are <b>accumulator</b> <b>vessels</b> exposed to the pre-stressing state due to the permanently internal pressure in the situation out of the work, which is conditioned by their application. The loading character in real systems is often stochastic. The application of stochastic changes can not be directly used for the determination of basic fatigue characteristics. For these reasons, stochastic curve is replaced with the lawful one, which should have the same effect on the fatigue and durability of the part of the mechanical system. Lawful curve is obtained using corresponding interpretation of stochastic functions recorded on real mechanical system by strain gauges...|$|R
40|$|Equipment leak {{standards}} {{are designed to}} control emissions of VOCs and VHAPs from regulated equipment {{through the application of}} work practices and equipment practices. The work practice most commonly applied to control equipment leaks is the LDAR program, which is discussed in detail in Section 2. 2. 4. 2. Subsequent chapters address the monitoring, recordkeeping. and reporting requirements of implementing a LDAR program under NSPS or NESHAP standards. In this chapter, regulated equipment is reviewed to illustrate how monitoring programs are applied to specific pieces of equipment action, and special canned-motor and diaphragm pumps (US. �PA, 1990). Chemicals transferred by pumps can leak at the point of contact between the moving shaft and stationary casing. To isolate the pump's interior from the atmosphere. all pumps, except the seal-less type (canned-motor and diaphragm), require a seal {{at the point where the}} shaft penetrates the housing. The most commonly used seals in these pumps are packed and mechanical (US. EPA. 1980 a). Equipment practices include the use of specific types of components, equipment design standards or specifications, and operational standards for certain types of equipment. Equipment practices are evaluated using performance standards that provide a basis for monitoring or substantiating the effectiveness of such control practices. Equipment practices, briefty summarized in Section 2. 2. 4. 3, are addressed in greater detail in this chapter. A general set of equipment is covered by all of the equipment leak standards. Some equipment is covered only by specific standards. For example, product <b>accumulator</b> <b>vessels</b> are covered only by the equipment leak standards for benzene. Also, the vinyl chloride fugitive emission standards cover additional sources (loading and unloading lines, agitators, slip gauges, opening of equipment. and inprocess wastewater). Except for agitaton, however, the emissions from these sources generally are not considered "equipment leaks. " The equipment leak standards also identify requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices that may be used to comply with the regulations...|$|R
2500|$|In normal {{operation}} the cylinders of the hydraulic rams were {{connected by a}} [...] diameter pipe that allowed water to pass between them, thus lowering the heavier caisson and raising the lighter one. To make adjustments at the start and end of a lift either cylinder could be operated independently, powered by an <b>accumulator</b> or pressure <b>vessel</b> {{at the top of}} the lift structure, which was kept primed by a [...] steam engine. If necessary, the steam engine and accumulator could operate either hydraulic ram independently to raise the caissons, although in this mode it took about 30 minutes to raise a caisson, as opposed to three minutes in {{normal operation}}.|$|R
40|$|Accumulators are {{important}} components {{used in many}} systems at commercial boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors in the United States. The <b>accumulators</b> are <b>vessels</b> attached to fluid systems to provide 1) a limited backup source of stored fluid energy for hydraulic/pneumatic mechanical equipment, 2) a damping effect on pressure pulses in fluid systems, and 3) a volume of fluid to be injected passively into a fluid system. Accumulators contain a gas that is compressed or expanded as the fluid from the system enters or exits the accumulator. The gas and fluid in accumulators are usually separated from each other by a piston or bladder. In support of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Nuclear Aging Research Program (NPAR), the Pacific Northwest Laboratory conducted an analysis of available industry databases to determine if accumulator components already had been studied in other NPAR assessments and to evaluate each accumulator type for applicable aging issues. The results of this preliminary study indicate that two critical uses of accumulators have been previously evaluated by the NPAR program. NUREGICR- 5699, Aging and Service Wear of Control Rod Drive Mechanisms for BUT Nuclear Plants (Greene 199 I), identified two hydraulic control unit components subject to aging failures: accumulator nitrogen-charging cartridge valves and the scram water accumulator. In addition, NUREGICR- 6001, Aging Assessment of BWR Standby Liquid Control Systems (Buckley et al. 1992), identified two predominant aging-related accumulator failures that result {{in a loss of}} the nitrogen blanket pressure: (charging) valve wear and failure of the gas bladder. The present study has identified five prevalent aging-related accumulator failures: rupture of the accumulator bladder separation of the metal disc {{from the bottom of the}} bladder leakage of the gas from the charging valve leakage past the safety injection tank manway cover gasket leakage past O-rings. An additional study of the accumulator subcomponents associated with these failures is recommended, including an evaluation of current inspection programs to verify that they are detecting the aging degradation effects. The study may also provide beneficial input to the design of passive accumulator applications in advanced reactor designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{functions}} of the ECCS accumulators are to supply water to the reactor vessel during the blowdown phase of a {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA), to provide inventory to help accomplish the refill phase that follows thereafter, and to provide Reactor Coolant System (RCS) makeup for any LOCA that reduces RCS pressure to below the accumulator pressure. The blowdown phase of a large break LOCA is the initial period of the transient during which the RCS departs from equilibrium conditions, and heat from fission product decay, hot internals, and the vessel continues to be transferred to the reactor coolant. The blowdown phase of the transient ends when the RCS pressure falls to a value approaching that of the containment atmosphere. In the refill phase of a LOCA, which immediately follows the blowdown phase, reactor coolant inventory has vacated the core through steam flashing and ejection out through the break. The core is essentially in adiabatic heatup. The balance of accumulator inventory is then available to help fill voids in the lower plenum and reactor vessel downcomer so as to establish a recovery level {{at the bottom of the}} core and ongoing reflood of the core with the addition of safety injection (SI) water. The <b>accumulators</b> are pressure <b>vessels</b> partially filled with borated water and pressurized with nitrogen gas. The accumulators are passive components, since no operator or control actions are required in order for them to perform their function. Internal accumulator tank pressure is sufficient to discharge the accumulator contents to the RCS, if RCS pressure decreases below the accumulator pressure. Each accumulator is piped into an RCS cold leg via an accumulator line and is isolated from the RCS by a motor operated isolation valve and two check valves in series...|$|R
