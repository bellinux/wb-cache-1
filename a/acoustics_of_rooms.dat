40|$|International audienceReverberation {{is one of}} {{the main}} perceptual {{dimensions}} allowing to rate and to discriminate the <b>acoustics</b> <b>of</b> <b>rooms.</b> Several studies concerning its perceptive threshold have been carried out previously. The resulting threshold values are somewhat scattered, varying between 4 % and more than 20 %. These studies differ in terms of sound stimuli, length of the reverberation, experiment design and experience of the subjects. In this study, a comparison and an adjustment experiments were carried out using three sound stimuli: white noise, male spoken words and an orchestral extract. The room impulse responses used in these comparisons are characterized by frequency-dependent decays. The reverberation time at 1000 Hz of the mean impulse response was 1, 89 s which is representative of a medium size concert hall. The subjects were students with half of them playing a musical instrument regularly. They had no prior experience in terms of perceptual audio testing. A differentiation threshold around 10 % is obtained, varying slightly with the experimental conditions and the sound stimuli. The thresholds obtained for speech signals were lower of about 2 % than those obtained for white noise and the orchestral piece of music...|$|E
40|$|The <b>acoustics</b> <b>of</b> <b>rooms</b> can be objectively {{described}} by the room impulse responses obtained for given transfer paths using measurement or simulation. In practice, the directionally dependent behavior of sources and receivers is often disregarded and thus assumed to be of omnidirectional type. In reality, however, these sources and receivers have specific directivity patterns, which are reported to induce audible differences. In this work a methodology to capture, analyze and process directivity patterns of sources and receivers is described. With the help of surrounding spherical microphone and loudspeaker arrays these directivity patterns are measured {{to be used in}} room acoustic applications. Room impulse responses with respect to specific directivity patterns can be realized using compact loudspeaker arrays with known directivity. Applying the results of directivity superposition to the set of measured room impulse responses, the acoustics for specific directivity patterns are found. Using a simulation of the room instead, source and receiver directivity patterns can be included in both wave based and particle based methods. The results of this work facilitate more authentic descriptions of room acoustics for specific source and receiver directivity patterns...|$|E

The general one-dimensional-port boundary termination is investi-gated, where depends on the geometry of the modeled domain and the mesh topology used. The equivalence between phys-ical variable Kirchoff-model, and scattering-based wave-model boundary formulations is proved. This leads to the KW-hybrid one-dimensional-port boundary-node termination, which is shown to be equivalent to the Kirchoff- and wave-model cases. The KW-hybrid boundary-node is implemented as part of a new hybrid two-dimensional triangular digital waveguide mesh.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{improving}} {{the suitability of}} the time domain Boundary Element Method (BEM) for predicting the scattering from surface treatments used to improve the <b>acoustics</b> <b>of</b> <b>rooms.</b> The discretised integral equations are typically solved by marching on in time from initial silence; however, this being iterative has potential for divergence. Such instability and high computational cost have prohibited the time domain BEM from widespread use. The underlying integral equation is known to not possess unique solutions at certain frequencies, physically interpreted as cavity resonances, and these manifest as resonant poles, all excited and potentially divergent due to numerical error. This has been addressed by others using the combined field integral equation; an approach built upon in this thesis. Accuracy and stability may also be compromised by poor discretisation and integration accuracy. The latter is investigated on real-world surfaces, demonstrating that the popular Gaussian integration schemes are not suitable in some circumstances. Instead a contour integration scheme capable of resolving the integrands‟ singular nature is developed. Schroeder diffusers are Room Acoustic treatments which comprise wells separated by thin fins. The algorithm is extended to model such surfaces, applying the combined field integral equation to the body and an open surface model to the fins. It is shown that this improves stability over an all open surface model. A new model for compliant surfaces is developed, comparable to the surface impedance model used in the frequency domain. This is implemented for surfaces with welled and absorbing sections, permitting modelling of a Schroeder diffuser as a box with surface impedances that simulate the delayed reflections caused by the wells. A Binary Amplitude Diffuser - a partially absorbing diffuser - is also modelled. These new models achieve good accuracy but not universal stability and avenues of future research are proposed to address the latter issue.
