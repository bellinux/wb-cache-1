40|$|A {{new program}} {{analysis}} is presented, and two compile time methods {{for this analysis}} are given. The analysis attempts to answer the question: "Given some trustworthy and some untrustworthy input, can we trust {{the value of a}} given variable after execution of some code". The analyses are based on an abstract interpretation framework and a constraint generation framework respectively. The analyses are proved safe with respect to an instrumented semantics. We explicitly deal with a language with pointers <b>and</b> <b>possible</b> <b>aliasing</b> problems. The constraint based analysis is related directly to the abstract interpretation and therefore indirectly to the instrumented semantics. 1 Introduction This paper discusses a static program analysis {{that can be used to}} check that the validity of data is only promoted to higher levels of trust in a conscious and controlled fashion. It is important to stress that the purpose of the analyses is not to improve run-time performance, but to give warnings to the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Results for a {{seasonally}} varying {{diurnal tide}} in temperature at Churchill are presented, <b>and</b> <b>possible</b> significant <b>aliasing</b> of longer period waves by this tide is discussed. A diurnal tide whose amplitude and phase are coherent {{throughout the year}} is found to have little effect on periodic amplitudes other than the long-term mean, because most rocketsonde observations are taken near the same local time each day. Errors in periodic components arising from lack of solar radiation corrections {{are found to be}} largest for the long-term mean with a small influence noted in the annual wave's amplitude. Spatial variations of the amplitudes and phases of long-period waves are examined through the use of height-latitude sections, 20 - 65 km, at 80 deg N to 30 deg S. The quasi-biennial oscillation and semiannual waves have tropical maxima of 2 and 3 C near 30 and 40 km respectively. The annual wave's maximum is over 22 C near 45 km at 70 deg N and the terannual wave's maximum is over 6 C near 55 km at 80 deg N. The semiannual wave has to polar maxima: 7 C near 75 deg N at 32 km and 3 C above 60 km north of 35 deg N...|$|R

Procedure calls are dispatched to the appropriate procedure body based on the alias combination that occurs among the actual parameters and imported global variables; errors are generated {{if there is no}} corresponding body. This approach makes writing verifiable client code simpler, since clients do not need to write code to determine the aliasing combination among actuals. Furthermore, since procedure bodies are free of aliases, their static analysis and verification is easier.

The enhanced AKL compiler produces more optimal code, which when executed will improve execution performance, and save memory.

40|$|Getting precise alias {{information}} in a language that allows pointers, such as C, is expensive. One reason is that alias analysis should generate conservative (safe) alias information. Alias analysis assumes <b>possible</b> <b>aliases</b> when it can’t prove there are no aliases. The conservative alias information may greatly affect compiler optimizations. In this paper, we present a general framework to allow speculative (unsafe) alias information {{to be used in}} several compiler optimizations such as redundancy elimination, copy propagation, dead store elimination and code scheduler. Speculative alias information is not guaranteed to be correct. Run-time verification and recovery code are generated to guarantee the correctness of the optimizations that use speculative alias information. In the framework, the key idea is to use data speculative code motion (DSCM) to move the instruction that will be optimized away to the instruction that causes the optimization. During DSCM, verification and recovery code are generated. After the DSCM, the optimization becomes non-speculative and the moved instruction can be optimized away. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Several tools {{exist for}} {{reasoning}} about Java programs annotated with JML specifications. A main issue is {{to deal with}} <b>possible</b> <b>aliasing</b> between objects <b>and</b> to handle correctly the frame conditions limiting the part of memory that a method is allowed to modify.

In this paper, we present the modeling of Java programs used in the Krakatoa tool, which generates proof obligations expressed in a logic language suitable for both automatic and interactive reasoning. Using the Simplify automatic theorem prover, {{we are able to}} establish automatically more properties than static analysis tools, with a method which is guaranteed to be sound, assuming only the correctness of our logical interpretation of programs and specifications. 1 Introduction Krakatoa [16] is a prototype tool for verifying that a Java program meetsits JML specification (JML stands for Java Modeling Language [14, 15]).

40|$|Objects often define usage {{protocols}} {{that clients}} must follow {{in order for}} these objects to work properly. Aliasing makes it notoriously difficult to check whether clients and implementations are compliant with such protocols. Accordingly, existing approaches either operate globally or severely restrict aliasing. We have developed a sound modular protocol checking approach, based on typestates, that allows {{a great deal of}} flexibility in aliasing while guaranteeing the absence of protocol violations at runtime. The main technical contribution is a novel abstraction, access permissions, that combines typestate and object aliasing information. In our methodology, developers express their protocol design intent through annotations based on access permissions. Our checking approach then tracks permissions through method implementations. For each object reference the checker keeps track of the degree of <b>possible</b> <b>aliasing</b> <b>and</b> is appropriately conservative in reasoning about that reference. This helps developers account for object manipulations that may occur through aliases. The checking approach handles inheritance in a novel way, giving subclasses more flexibility in method overriding. Case studies on Java iterators and streams provide evidence that access permissions can model realistic protocols, and protocol checking based on access permissions can be used to reason precisely about the protocols that arise in practice...|$|R
40|$|Aliasing {{may cause}} {{problems}} for both optimization and reasoning about programs. Since static alias analysis is expensive, and sometimes, even impossible, compilers {{tend to be}} conservative. This usually leads to missing some optimization opportunities. Furthermore, when trying to understand code, one must consider all <b>possible</b> <b>aliasing</b> patterns. This can make reasonning about code difficult and non-trivial. We have implemented an approach for having alias-free parameters in C. This approach allows aliasing between the arguments at the call site, but guarantees {{that there will be}} no aliasing between arguments and between arguments and globals inside procedure bodies. This is done by having multiple bodies, up to one for each aliasing pattern. Procedure calls will be dispatched to the body that matches the aliasing pattern at the call site. By having alias-free parameters in the bodies, good optimization can be achieved. Furthermore, verification and reasoning about the code is easier when there is no aliasing. The main advantages of our approach are that code to determine the aliasing pattern is automatically generated, and the programmer does not have to code it by hand. We tested our implementation, and found that using this approach can be very practical. It is easy to convert already-existing code to use it. And in some cases, we had run-time execution speedup as much as 29 %...|$|R

Previous approaches focused on natural language processing and structured data, whereas in this research we analyze the local association, or “social ” network in which aliases reside.

The problem is defined as given social network S, constructed from email address collocations, and an email address E, identify any aliases for E that also appear in S. The alias detection methods are evaluated on a data set of over 14, 000 University X email addresses for which ground truth relations are known. The results are reported as partial lists of k choices for <b>possible</b> <b>aliases,</b> ranked by predicted relational strength within the network.

First, we addressed a <b>possible</b> <b>aliasing</b> of semidiurnal wind variability by the twice daily NSCAT sampling with a statistical analysis of averaged TAO hourly winds sampled at NSCAT crossing times versus 24 -hour sampling. The aliasing was small (- 0. 12 +/- 0. 23 ms- 1 and- 0. 03 +/- 0. 24 ms- 1 for zonal and meridional winds, respectively) for 10 -day and longer periods. A subset (34) of the TAO buoys with sufficiently complete time series was used for large-scale comparisons. These were located predominately in {{the central part of}} the TAO array. An EOF analysis over the period from October 1996 to June 1997 found the first two modes were very similar in both the TAO data and NSCAT data sampled at TAO locations. One mode represented an equatorial velocity jet associated with the onset of the 1997 - 1998 El Niño, the other an acceleration of the northeast Trade and Monsoon winds. The order of these modes was reversed in the EOF of the full spatial resolution NSCAT data.

Our photometry completely rules out the previously published spectroscopic period of 0. 212 days (5. 09 hr). Consequently, we reanalyzed the 15 archival ESO/VLT spectra (obtained 2002 June by others) that were {{the basis of the}} previously published spectroscopic period. We used a “restframe search ” technique that is well suited for cases when the signal-to-noise ratio of individual spectra is low. For each of roughly 1. 1 million binary ephemerides, we summed all of the spectra in a trial restframe of the secondary star, and each restframe spectrum was cross-correlated against a template spectrum. We then searched for the set of orbital parameters that produced the strongest cross-correlation value. The results confirmed the photometric period of 0. 3205 days, and rule out the alias period near 0. 38 days.

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{detailed}} spectral {{analysis of the}} time series of the 8 B solar neutrino flux published by the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration is presented, performed through a likelihood scan approach. Preliminarily a careful review of the analysis methodology is given, showing that the traditional periodicity search via the Lomb-Scargle periodogram is a special case of a more general likelihood based method. Since the data are published together with the relevant asymmetric errors, it is then shown how the likelihood analysis can be performed either {{with or without a}} prior error averaging. A key point of this work is the detailed illustration of the mathematical model describing the statistical properties of the estimated spectra obtained in the various cases, which is also validated through extensive Monte Carlo computations; the model includes a calculation for the prediction of the <b>possible</b> <b>alias</b> effects. In the successive investigation of the data, such a model is used to derive objective, mathematical predictions which are quantitatively compared with the features observed in the experimental spectra. This article clearly demonstrates that the handling of the errors is the origin of the discrepancy between published null observations and claimed significant periodicity in the same SK-I data sample. Moreover, the comprehensive likelihood analysis with asymmetric errors developed in this work provides results which cannot exclude the null hypothesis of constant rate, even though some indications stemming from the model at odd with such conclusion point towards the desirability of additional investigations with alternative methods to shed further light on the characteristics of the data.
