40|$|The {{transformation}} of musical practices in Lisbon {{at the end}} of the Ancien Regime: new commercial dynamics, cosmopolitan models and keyboard repertoires. During the Reign of Queen Maria I (1777 - 1816) new musical practices have developed in Portugal and the business of music became a flourishing one. Musicians who had established themselves in Lisbon in the previous decades, hired by the Royal Chamber and other important musical institutions of the Crown, were then bestowed royal privileges for trading. Their warehouses imported music, instruments and other sophisticated products such as nautical instruments and luxury <b>accessories.</b> Newspapers began <b>advertising</b> for these traders on musical matters promoting novelty and cosmopolitanism. Advertisements recommended the music or the instruments of the “best piano Professors in Europe”, making some special note of the Luso-Brazilian market. The article addresses music as part of the new commercial dynamics that developed in Lisbon {{at the end of}} the Ancien Regime, promoting keyboard repertoires that respond to (a) the interest in a new sentimental opera for domestic consumption in keyboard arrangements (La Molinara and Nina from Paisiello are the most interesting cases); (b) the composition of Variations longing commercial viability based on local hits such as the case of theatrical dance (lundum from Monroi) and popular urban songs (Moda do Tiro liro) or cosmopolitan ones, like Marlborough. In fact these are already the principles that Carl Czerny will confirm as good thematic options for keyboard variations in School of Practical Compositional (c. 1848) and in his own piano works...|$|R
40|$|The Autopoint {{company was}} founded around 1920 in Chicago. The founders pioneered using molded plastic to make {{mechanical}} pencils. In the mid 1920 s, the Bakelite Corporation took over ownership of Autopoint. Over the next 50 years Autopoint had several different corporate owners, but {{it continued to}} operate as a stand-alone company with its own officers, employees, manufacturing plant, sales force, etc. By 1966 Autopoint had developed an extensive product line of pencils, ball-point pens, desk top <b>accessories,</b> and specialty <b>advertising</b> products like cigarette lighters and pocket knives. They got much of their business as a job shop manufacturing personalized pencils, pens, and the like advertising businesses. One interesting illustration {{of that sort of}} use is a pencil listing business-card type information about Sol Sulman, the president of Autopoint. (p. 46) The inside cover of this catalog shows the logos of numerous companies Autopoint had done business with. The catalog contains tables showing pricing information for various quantities of pencils ordered. Substantial discounts were offered for thousands of pencils ordered at once. Since this is a loose-leaf catalog, pages could be easily added to it. One interesting addition is a page advertising pencils using ultra thin (“UTL”), 0. 5 mm, lead. These new pencils were obviously introduced in response to competition from Japanese companies selling the newly introduced 0. 5 mm lead. Elsewhere in the catalog, lead sizes are shown in fractions of an inch. “Standard” (0. 45 inch) lead was the industry standard for mechanical pencils when Autopoint was founded. “Real Thin” (0. 36 mm) lead had been introduced in 1938. Also, Autopoint sold some marker type pencils with. 076 inch (“Thick”) lead. The catalog has been modified by pasting in pricing information on the previously printed pages. Many of the pages were changed that way...|$|R
