25|$|The two {{remaining}} original {{buildings on the}} Phoenix Block, {{one of which is}} the Kersey H. Fell building, are done in the Greek Revival style of architecture. They share a common wall and use simple stone lentils and sills in the windows. The storefronts are accented by columns. The common wall helped to increase the speed which the Phoenix Block was constructed <b>at.</b> <b>So</b> eager were merchants to occupy the storefronts that several stores opened for business while workers were still constructing the second and third floors of the buildings.|$|E

According to palaeographer Bernard de Montfaucon and biblical scholar Scholz {{it was written in}} the 8th century. According to Leonard Hug, biblical scholar, it is not older than the ninth century, because no one has yet shown that the compressed letters Σ, Ε, Ο, and Θ were ever used in manuscripts <b>at</b> <b>so</b> early a date as the 8th century. The letters Ζ and Ξ ever have their strokes prolonged beneath the line, or that the small strokes {{at the bottom of the}} letter Δ are ever extended below the line, in the manuscripts from the 8th century.|$|E

25|$|While Dupont lingered at Andújar {{with two}} {{divisions}} (Generals Barbou and Fresia), attempting {{to master the}} strategic Madrid—Seville highway and the wide plains which it crossed, Castaños' four divisions advanced steadily {{from the south and}} guerrillas from Granada marched to bar the road to the sierra and La Mancha beyond. Vedel's division was posted east to Bailén with a view to guarding these nearby mountain passes and on July 1 Vedel was forced to dispatch a brigade under General Cassagne to curb the advance of the guerrillas on Jaén and La Carolina, stretching the French line still further east. Meanwhile, General Liger-Belair with 1,500 men moved into a forward post at Mengibar, a village on the south bank of the Guadalquivir. At Andújar a tower by the river was fortified and small field works constructed on the south bank to forestall an enemy crossing, but, the Guadalquivir being fordable <b>at</b> <b>so</b> many points, and open to fire from the surrounding hills, Dupont's defences did not inspire much confidence. Cassagne, after driving the guerrillas off in rout, returned to Bailén on July 5 with 200 dead or wounded and nothing to show for his exertion—the Spaniards having plundered the towns of all provisions.|$|E

500|$|Gowariker {{remarked that}} {{shooting}} this film was more challenging than Jodha Akbar because of filming <b>at</b> <b>so</b> many locations. He found it more time-consuming and challenging but also {{called it an}} exciting experience. The second schedule started in January in Mumbai, with scenes also being filmed in Chicago and Baroda, and was scheduled to last until April 2009. The film was also shot at the Mehboob Studio and Film City. The musical numbers were choreographed by Terence Lewis, Rekha Chinni Prakash, Chinni Prakash, Raju Khan, and Rajeev Surti. The song [...] "Aaja Lehraate" [...] was filmed in a single continuous take using a five-camera setup. It was a draining process for Chopra and Baweja, since each mistake required returning to the beginning and filming all over again.|$|E
500|$|Lilienthal {{had made}} [...] "whirling arm" [...] tests on {{only a few}} wing shapes, and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings, which had a {{different}} shape. The Wrights took a huge step forward and made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 wings of many shapes and airfoil curves, followed by detailed tests on 38 of them. The tests, according to biographer Fred Howard, [...] "were the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so short a time with so few materials and <b>at</b> <b>so</b> little expense". An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings: in aeronautical terms, wings with a larger aspect ratio (wingspan divided by chord—the wing's front-to-back dimension). Such shapes offered much better lift-to-drag ratio than the broader wings the brothers had tried so far.|$|E

Its style is {{tentatively}} given as RAK {{and some of the}} runes are cipher runes in the form of branch runes. The runic text tells that a man named Báulfr died with the Greeks at a location that has not been clearly identified through several analyses of the cipher runes. Läffler (1907) suggested that the location is to be read Ίϑὡμη which was the name of a town in Thessaly and a stronghold in Messenia, also called Θὡμη. Báulfr is described as being þróttar þegn or a thegn of strength. The term thegn describes a class of retainer. The phrase þróttar þegn is used on six other runestones, Sö 90 in Lövhulta, Sö 112 in Kolunda, Sö 151 in Lövsund, and Sö 158 in Österberga, and, in its plural form <b>at</b> <b>Sö</b> 367 in Släbro and Sö Fv1948;295 in Prästgården.|$|E

[...] Fanny was therefore moved, by coach, to Bartlet's Court. [...] The next day her doctor returned and met with her apothecary. [...] Both agreed that Fanny's symptoms were indicative of smallpox. [...] On hearing this, Fanny sent for an attorney, to ensure the will she had had made was in good order, and that Kent would inherit her estate. [...] An acquaintance of Kent's, Stephen Aldrich, Rector of St John Clerkenwell, reassured her that she would be forgiven for her sins. [...] She died on 2February.|$|E

500|$|Returning to England for the 1906 season, Crawford {{completed}} the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in first-class cricket, the youngest player {{at the time}} to accomplish this feat. Against Gloucestershire, he scored 148 and then took seven for 85 and four for 63 with the ball; he also took ten wickets in his next game. In total, he compiled 1,174 runs at an average of 30.10, and took 118 wickets at an average of 20.28. These performances earned him selection for the representative Gentlemen versus Players matches at both Lord's and The Oval, in which he played for the amateur Gentlemen. At the end of the season, he was chosen as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation said: [...] "Few cricketers have won equal fame <b>at</b> <b>so</b> early an age", and noted the unusual ease with which he had moved into first-class cricket. Crawford's powerful batting and straight hitting were praised, as was his accurate bowling. The report also stated: [...] "That he should have done all this is the more astonishing from the fact that he invariably plays in glasses. No one handicapped in this way has ever been so consistently successful both as batsman and bowler." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s, {{some critics}} pointed {{out how the}} lines of the poems were memorable and popular while others {{emphasised}} the poem's place in the greater tradition of English poetry. W. K. Wimsatt, in 1970, suggested, [...] "Perhaps we shall be tempted to say only that Gray transcends and outdoes Hammond and Shenstone simply because he writes a more poetic line, richer, fuller, more resonant and memorable in all the ways in which we are accustomed to analyze the poetic quality." [...] In 1971, Charles Cudworth declared that the elegy was [...] "a work which probably contains more famous quotations per linear inch of text than any other in the English language, not even excepting Hamlet." [...] When describing how Gray's Elegy is not a conventional elegy, Eric Smith added in 1977, [...] "Yet, if the poem <b>at</b> <b>so</b> many points fails to follow the conventions, why are we considering it here? the answer is partly that no study of major English elegies could well omit it. But it is also, and more importantly, that in its essentials Gray's Elegy touches this tradition at many points, and consideration of them is of interest to both to appreciation of the poem and to seeing how [...] they become in the later tradition essential points of reference." [...] Also in 1977, Thomas Carper noted, [...] "While Gray was a schoolboy at Eton, his poetry began to show a concern with parental relationships, and with his position among the great and lowly in the world [...] But in the Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard these longstanding and very human concerns have their most affecting expression." [...] In 1978, Howard Weinbrot noted, [...] "With all its long tradition of professional examination the poem remains distant for many readers, as if the criticism could not explain why Johnson thought that [...] "The Church-yard abounds with images that find a mirrour in every mind". He continued by arguing that it is the poem's discussion of morality and death that is the source of its [...] "enduring popularity".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party <b>at.</b> <b>So</b> I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E
