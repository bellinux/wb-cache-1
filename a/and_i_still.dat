From the first of its 900-odd pages, I knew, and my friends at the University of Sussex knew, that this was something else. We talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue. Imagine that: young male students more interested in a book than in gooseberry tart and custard.|$|E
25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E

25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

500|$|In August 1967, McCartney met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the London Hilton {{and later}} went to Bangor in North Wales {{to attend a}} weekend {{initiation}} conference, where {{he and the other}} Beatles learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation. He said, [...] "The whole meditation experience was very good <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> use the mantra... I find it soothing." [...] In 2009, McCartney and Starr headlined a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall, raising threemillion dollars for the David Lynch Foundation to fund instruction in Transcendental Meditation for at-risk youth.|$|E

No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality." [...] Lovato later said: [...] "I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality.

500|$|Moore wrote lyrics for {{the album}} by [...] "mumbling {{along to the}} song and then {{deciphering}} what I'm saying." [...] The lyrics feature political themes ("Hello, Helicopter!" [...] is about the US supplying military arsenals to other countries to protect its own national interests), although Matheos stated that the album was not political in nature. Moore said that he writes lyrics based on personal experiences, and {{that much of the}} album's lyrical content stems from how the September 11 attacks affected him. Moore's brother was a firefighter who worked at the World Trade Center after the attacks, [...] "and I was totally apolitical before this, politically naïve <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> am," [...] Moore stated. [...] "I was like, 'Whoa, what the fuck {{is going on in the}} world?'" ...|$|E

She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a mini-stroke. Regarding her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it's up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show. Sheindlin admits the court show is [...] "seductive" [...] and hard to give up. Sheindlin said, [...] "I'm not tired.

She wore a golden gown, with the words: [...] "Love... It's a journey <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> have questions" [...] appearing in a screen behind her. Lopez began to break down, appearing as though she was about to cry. She then paused, looked up and shed most of her clothes for a performance of [...] "Papi". Critics noted the [...] "fake breakdown" [...] to be poking fun at her breakdown during her performance of the song at the Mohegan Sun casino a month earlier. The performance was compared to Britney Spears's music video for [...] "Toxic" [...] and Lopez's performance during the 2001 American Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} went relatively smoothly {{except for}} the unrelentingly antagonistic relationship that developed between Reeves and Price. Reeves kept it no secret from everyone associated with the production that the American actor was not his choice for the role, and the director's comments had reached the actor back in the US. [...] Reeves refused the courtesy of meeting Price at Heathrow Airport {{when he arrived in}} England, a [...] "deliberate snub calculated to offend both Price and AIP." [...] "Take me to your goddamn young genius," [...] Price reportedly said to co-producer Philip Waddilove, who greeted the actor at the airport instead of Reeves. When Price went on location and met Reeves for the first time, the young director told the actor, [...] "I didn't want you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> don't want you, but I'm stuck with you!" ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who {{has often}} been heavily {{influenced}} by the various Quatermass serials, and despite Kneale's dislike of it ("It sounded a terrible idea <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> think it was," [...] he commented in 1986) and his refusal to write for it, unofficial references to Quatermass {{have appeared in the}} programme and its spinoffs. [...] Serials directly influenced include The Web of Fear, The Invasion, Spearhead from Space, The Ambassadors of Death, Inferno, The Seeds of Doom and Image of the Fendahl, as well as the 2007 [...] "The Lazarus Experiment", which echoes the first serial's climax in Westminster Abbey, with the use of Southwark Cathedral. Former Doctor Who script editor and producer Derrick Sherwin admitted on a DVD documentary that the idea of setting more serials on contemporary Earth in the early 1970s was to recall a Quatermass feel.|$|E

500|$|Born in Jamaica to an English mother, Johnson {{played for}} the England Schoolboys team by virtue of going to school in England. He was called up to the England U21 squad in December 1997 for a 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship {{qualification}} play-off game against Greece, but remained an unused substitute. After the game, he said: [...] "My chances with England are virtually gone now..I am ready if Jamaica come in for me. I was hoping for a game on Wednesday – <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> {{might have had a}} chance with England had they qualified for the last eight but that's the way it goes. I have enjoyed the experience of being with England but I am hoping to hear from Jamaica." [...] Johnson played his first senior international football in 1998, making a nine-minute cameo for the England B team under Glenn Hoddle in a 4–1 victory over Russia at Loftus Road.|$|E
500|$|Iyall {{released}} a solo album entitled Strange Language with former band members Bossi and Smith in 1986. Afterward she pursued {{a career as}} an art teacher. The band reunited briefly for a live performance in 1993. In 2004, Romeo Void was featured on an episode of VH1's Bands Reunited. Bossi had sustained too much hearing damage {{over the years and}} was unable to perform, although he did meet up with the band again and observed the reunion performance in an adjacent room. Iyall has continued to dabble in music related projects and events. [...] "I still like to sing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> like to perform," [...] she said. In 2003 she was involved in a musical project called Knife in Water. She began collaborating with Peter Dunne, who was known as Peter [...] when he played guitar for Pearl Harbor and the Explosions. Iyall and Dunne performed at a support benefit for Crawdaddy! founder Paul Williams in June 2009, and performed at a concert honoring 415 Records later that September. They {{released a}}n album entitled Stay Strong in 2010.|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> think it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E

500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his early}} promise, Moore's {{parents had been}} against him {{training}} as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became {{a teacher at the}} school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed. He recalled later, [...] "for me the war passed in a romantic haze of trying to be a hero." [...] This attitude changed as he reflected on the destructiveness of war and in 1940 he wrote, {{in a letter to his}} friend Arthur Sale, that [...] "a year or two after [...] the sight of a khaki uniform began to mean everything in life that was wrong and wasteful and anti-life. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> have that feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E
