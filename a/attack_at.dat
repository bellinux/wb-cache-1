5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces than at {{the other}} gates, so that Khalid {{would be unable to}} move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector.

Thomas ordered Khalid to be taken alive.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Armada of the Damned {{was split}} between land and sea.
