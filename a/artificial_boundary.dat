50|$|Boon {{has dealt}} {{with the issue of}} copies, imitations and the concept of the original. Starting from the {{observation}} that copying is a universally popular, but often criminal practice, he developed a point of view which holds that the distinction between copy and original is for practical purposes only. Boon argues in the book that for everything in the universe there already is a copy, as much as everything is original. Therefore, it is impossible under ethics to ban the copy, since it is impossible not to copy. The distinction between originality and copy creates an <b>artificial</b> <b>boundary</b> which in truth does not exist. Copies are the principle on which the universe rests, even at the molecular level all the things are made by copying. Learning itself cannot occur without copying from others.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{concerns}} the numerical finite element computation, {{in the frequency}} domain, of the diffracted wave produced by a defect (crack, inclusion, perturbation of the boundaries, etc.) located in a 3 D infinite elastic waveguide. The objective is to use modal representations to build transparent conditions on some <b>artificial</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the computational domain. This cannot be achieved in a classical way, due to non-standard properties of elastic modes. However, a biorthogonality relation allows us to build an operator, relating hybrid displacement/stress vectors. An original mixed formulation is then derived and implemented, whose unknowns are the displacement field in the bounded domain and the normal component of the normal stresses on the <b>artificial</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Numerical validations are presented in the 2 D case...|$|R

To avoid the traditional integral equation formulations for wave problems in unbounded domains, <b>artificial</b> <b>boundaries</b> are introduced when the region is unbounded and absorbing boundary conditions are imposed on the <b>artificial</b> <b>boundaries</b> to minimize unphysical wave reflections.

50|$|The discretized surface {{equation}} is {{coupled with the}} 3-D subsurface flow equation via superposition (common node approach) or via leakage through a surficial skin layer (dual node approach). For both approaches, fully implicit coupling of the surface and subsurface flow regimes provides an integral view of the movement of water, {{as opposed to the}} traditional division of surface and subsurface regimes. Flux across the land surface is, therefore, a natural internal process allowing water to move between the surface and subsurface flow systems as governed by local flow hydrodynamics, instead of using physically <b>artificial</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions at the interface. When the subsurface connection is provided via superposition, HydroGeoSphere adds the surface flow equation terms for the 2-D surface mesh to those of the top layer of subsurface nodes. In that case, the fluid exchange flux, which contains leakance term {{does not need to be}} explicitly defined.|$|E

Expanding recognition of the articulation between scholarship and activism in fact begins to dissolve the arguably <b>artificial</b> <b>boundary</b> between decolonial analytics and programmatics, between decolonial thought and action by recognizing that {{the way in which}} scholars view “the causes, forms, and consequences of social movements has significant implications for how they understand their potential, the stakes involved and the meaning of the political decolonial itself.” Scholars—those usually concerned primarily with analytics—who fail to recognize the connection between politics or decoloniality and the production of knowledge—between programmatics and analytics—are those most likely to reflect “an underlying acceptance of capitalist modernity, liberal democracy, and individualism” (Juris & Khasnabish 2013: 6) values which decoloniality seeks to challenge.|$|E
50|$|The {{second is}} a shape effect {{that results from}} the {{artificial}} shape delineated by the boundary. As an illustration {{of the effect of}} the artificial shape, point pattern analysis tends to provide higher levels of clustering for the identical point pattern within a unit that is more elongated (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). Similarly, the shape can influence interaction and flow among spatial entities (Arlinghaus and Nystuen 1990; Ferguson and Kanaroglou 1998; Griffith 1982). For example, the shape can affect the measurement of origin-destination flows since these are often recorded when they cross an <b>artificial</b> <b>boundary.</b> Because of the effect set by the boundary, the shape and area information is used to estimate travel distances from surveys (Rogerson 1990) or to locate traffic counters, travel survey stations, or traffic monitoring systems (Kirby 1997). From the same perspective, Theobald (2001; retrieved from BESR 2002) argued that measures of urban sprawl should consider interdependences and interactions with nearby rural areas.|$|E
