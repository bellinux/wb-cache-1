50|$|When a ship heels, {{the centre}} of {{buoyancy}} of the ship moves laterally. It might also move up or down {{with respect to the}} water line. The point at which a vertical line through the heeled centre of buoyancy crosses the line through the original, vertical centre of buoyancy is the metacentre. The metacentre remains directly above {{the centre of}} buoyancy by definition. In the diagram, the two Bs show the centres of buoyancy of a ship in the upright and heeled conditions, and M is the metacentre. The metacentre is considered to be fixed for small angles of heel; however, at larger angles of heel, the metacentre can no longer be considered fixed, and its actual location must be found to calculate the ship's stability.The metacentre can be calculated using the formulae:Where KB is the centre of buoyancy (height above the keel), I is the Second moment <b>of</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> the <b>waterplane</b> in metres4 and V is the volume of displacement in metres3.

40|$|A three {{dimensional}} time-domain model, {{based on}} Cum-mins equation, {{has been developed}} for an axisymmetric point absorbing wave energy converter (WEC) with an irregular cross section. This model incorporates a number of nonlinearities to accurately account for {{the dynamics of the}} device: hydro-static restoring, motion constraints, saturation of the power-take-off force, and kinematic nonlinearities. Here, an interpo-lation model of the hydrostatic restoring reaction is developed and compared with a surface integral based method. The effects of these nonlinear hydrostatic models on device dynamics are ex-plored by comparing predictions against those of a linear model. For the studied WEC, the interpolation model offers a large im-provement over a linear model and is roughly two orders-of-magnitude less computationally expensive than the surface in-tegral based method.

50|$|If a ship floods, {{the loss}} of {{stability}} {{is caused by the}} increase in KB, the centre of buoyancy, and the loss <b>of</b> <b>waterplane</b> <b>area</b> - thus a loss <b>of</b> the <b>waterplane</b> moment <b>of</b> inertia - which decreases the metacentric height. This additional mass will also reduce freeboard (distance from water to the deck) and the ship's angle of down flooding (minimum angle of heel at which water will be able to flow into the hull). The range of positive stability will be reduced to the angle of down flooding resulting in a reduced righting lever. When the vessel is inclined, the fluid in the flooded volume will move to the lower side, shifting its centre of gravity toward the list, further extending the heeling force. This is known as the free surface effect.|$|R

To verify the effectiveness of the modeling and ensure the use of the model in marine handling simulators, a detailed model is tentatively established on the basis of empirical formulas.

40|$|When {{designing}} large complex vessels, {{the evaluation}} of a particular design can be both complicated and time consuming. Designers often resort {{to the use of}} concept design models enabling both a reduction in complexity and time for evaluation. Various optimisation methods are then typically used to explore the design space facilitating the selection of optimum or near optimum designs. It is now possible to incorporate considerations of seakeeping, stability and costs at the earliest stage in the ship design process. However, to ensure that reliable results are obtained, the models used are generally complex and computationally expensive. Methods have been developed which avoid the necessity to carry out an exhaustive search of the complete design space. One such method is described which is concerned with the application of the theory of Design Of Experiments (DOE) enabling the design space to be efficiently explored. The objective of the DOE stage is to produce response surfaces which can then be used by an optimisation module to search the design space. It is assumed that the concept exploration tool whilst being a simplification of the design problem, is still sufficiently complicated to enable reliable evaluations of a particular design concept. The response surface is used as a representation of the concept exploration tool, and by it's nature can be used to rapidly evaluate a design concept hence reducing concept exploration time. While the methodology has a wide applicability in ship design and production, it is illustrated by its application to the design of a catamaran with respect to seakeeping. The paper presents results exploring the design space for the catamaran. A concept is selected which is robust with respect to the Relative Bow Motion (RBM), the heave, pitch and roll at any particular waveheading. The design space is defined by six controllable design parameters; hull length, breadth to draught ratio, distance between demihull centres, coefficient <b>of</b> <b>waterplane,</b> longitudinal centre <b>of</b> floatation, longitudinal centre of buoyancy, and by one noise parameter, the waveheading. A Pareto-optimal set of solutions is obtained using RBM, heave, pitch and roll as criteria. The designer can then select from this set the design which most closely satisfies their requirements. Typical solutions are shown to yield average reductions of over 25 % in the objective functions when compared to earlier results obtained using conventional optimisation methods...|$|R

6000|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> these <b>waterplanes</b> is {{an important}} step towards the huge and swarming popularisation of flying which is now certainly imminent. We ancient survivors of those who believed in and wrote about flying before there was any flying used to make a great fuss about the dangers and difficulties of landing and getting up. We wrote with vast gravity about [...] "starting rails" [...] and [...] "landing stages," [...] and it is still true that landing an aeroplane, except upon a well-known and quite level expanse, is a risky and uncomfortable business. But getting up and landing upon fairly smooth water is easier than getting into bed. This alone is likely to determine the aeroplane routes along the line of the world's coastlines and lake groups and waterways. The airmen will go to and fro over water as the midges do. Wherever there is a square mile <b>of</b> water the <b>waterplanes</b> will come and go like hornets at the mouth of their nest. But there are much stronger reasons than this convenience for keeping over water. Over water the air, it seems, lies in great level expanses; even when there are gales it moves in uniform masses like the swift, still rush of a deep river. The airman, in Mr. Grahame-White's phrase, can go to sleep on it. But over the land, and for thousands of feet up into the sky, the air is more irregular than a torrent among rocks; it is--if only we could see it--a waving, whirling, eddying, flamboyant confusion. A slight hill, a ploughed field, the streets of a town, create riotous, rolling, invisible streams and cataracts of air that catch the airman unawares, make him drop disconcertingly, try his nerves. With a powerful enough engine he climbs at once again, but these sudden downfalls are the least pleasant and most dangerous experience in aviation. They exact a tiring vigilance.|$|R
