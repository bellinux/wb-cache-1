50|$|In November 2012, unit 91114 had {{a second}} {{pantograph}} added as a pilot project operated jointly by Eversholt Rail Group, East Coast, ESG, Wabtec Rail and Brecknell Willis. The new design uses the same mounting positions as a conventional pantograph but pairs two pantograph arms in an opposing configuration. If there is an <b>ADD</b> (<b>Automatic</b> <b>Dropping</b> <b>Device)</b> activation or the pantograph becomes detached, the train can keep going, so the system provides redundancy {{in the event of}} a pantograph/OLE failure.|$|R

30|$|In the per-period regressions, occasionally, some {{variables}} are automatically dropped by Stata due to collinearity. This affects mainly the model or brand-segment dummies (it usually affects “irrelevant” dummies such as, for example, those {{that correspond to}} models that are not sold in the period), although in very specific time periods it may also affect some dummies for characteristics in the Fixed Effects specification (see Table 5 in the online appendix in supplementary material). The differences in the <b>automatic</b> <b>dropping</b> patterns of Stata between the Fixed Effect (FE) case and the Model Dummies (MD) case give rise to small differences between the set of parameters estimated in the hedonic regressions in each case. This leads to slight differences between the FE and MD quality-adjusted hedonic price indexes shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. A more “robust” robustness check would require tedious manual correction and control of this <b>automatic</b> <b>dropping.</b> In any case, the Stata code used is fully available upon request.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} an algorithm for <b>automatic</b> identification of <b>drops</b> with different sizes in monochromatic digitized frames of a liquid-liquid chemical process. These image frames were obtained at our Laboratory, using a nonintrusive process, with a digital video camera, a microscope, and an illumination setup from a dispersion of toluene in water within a transparent mixing vessel. In this implementation, we propose a two-phase approach, using a Hough transform that automatically identifies drops in images of the chemical process. This work is a promising {{starting point for the}} possibility of performing an <b>automatic</b> <b>drop</b> classification with good results.

40|$|Whistling due to vortex {{shedding}} {{has been extensively}} studied {{in the case of}} cylinders in cross-flows, of flow separation above cavities and of shear layers with flow impingement feedback. Less attention has been given to pressure <b>drop</b> <b>devices</b> in piping systems, which are known to generate high noise levels due to single tones in gas systems, and even in water systems. Based on recent work of Auregan et Starobinski (1999), an experimental criterion is proposed to evaluate the whistling ability of a pressure <b>drop</b> <b>device</b> in the presence of plane waves acoustic feedback. The idea of the criterion can be summarized as follows: if for a given combination of incident pressure waves, the amount of acoustic power scattered is higher than the incident one, the pressure <b>drop</b> <b>device</b> behaves as an acoustic amplifier, so that whistling can occur if the adequate acoustic boundary conditions are met. The main advantage of this criterion is that it depends only on the acoustic scattering matrix of the device, rather than on the acoustics of the surrounding pipe. Results obtained in an air test rig with an inner diameter of 3 cm, a Mach number varying from 10 - 3 to 10 - 1 and a Reynolds number varying from 103 to 105 are reported for single hole orifices. Basing the Strouhal number on the thickness of the orifice and on the average velocity through the hole, thin single hole orifices with sharp angles appear to whistle at Strouhal numbers close to 0. 2. Furthermore, it is shown that a thin orifice with a downstream bevel is prone to whistling, whereas the same orifice with the bevel upstream cannot whistle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a reliable, {{low cost}} and non-intrusive method of detecting {{the occurrence of}} cavitation in the pressure <b>drop</b> <b>devices</b> used for flow zoning in PFBR core. This involves classification of a pressure <b>drop</b> <b>device,</b> under given operating conditions, as cavitating or noncavitating using an adequately trained neural network. In this work, two models are assimilated, namely a process dependent ANN model and a generalized ANN model. The RMS of the wideband [10 - 100 kHz] acoustic signal and skewness of the acoustic time signal acquired from an accelerometer installed downstream of the test section are fed as features to the process model and generalized model respectively, for training. The networks are trained using feed forward back propagation training algorithm till the test error reduces to a predetermined level. The networks are tested using data not under the training domain and classification errors are derived.

30|$|As seen in Figures 3 and 4 {{depict the}} {{simulation}} {{results for the}} reconfigurable and autonomous devices, respectively; {{the application of the}} prediction system in the load-balancing framework results to <b>dropping</b> less mobile <b>devices</b> requests than that of the initial load-balancing framework. As regards the reconfigurable mobile devices, for the first two experiments the percentage of <b>dropped</b> <b>devices</b> is almost the same. According to the first simulation scenario for the prediction-based load-balancing system, 1.8 % of the reallocation requests are dropped, corresponding to 11 devices from the initial 600 (Figure 3 a), while at the second one 1.9 % are dropped, corresponding to 19 from the overall 1, 000 devices (Figure 3 b). It {{should be noted that the}} load-balancing framework without the prediction mechanism results to dropping more devices: 3 % for the first scenario, corresponding to 18 of the 600 devices and 3.1 % for the second, corresponding to 31 <b>dropped</b> <b>devices</b> from the 1000. For the third simulation scenario where the population mix is composed only of reconfigurable devices, the prediction model results in better improvement compared to the previous two scenarios (Figure 3 c). Specifically, only 15 from the 1, 200 devices could not be handled (1.25 %), while without the prediction model 39 <b>devices</b> were <b>dropped</b> (3.25 %). In this case, the absence of autonomous devices alleviated the system from additional control signalling and thus it performed better, resulting to an increased improvement of the overall performance.|$|R
