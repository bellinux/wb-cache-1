(Chemistry) Abstract: Spherical-like Au, Ag, Ru and Pt metal {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized {{using three}} different generations (G 4, G 5 and G 6) of amine and hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dedrimers as a templating agent. Generation 6 amine-terminated PAMAM denrimers {{were used for}} the synthesis of Au nanoparticles (Au-DENs) using different dendrimer to metal molar ratio of 1 : 55 and 1 : 147. The resulted nanoparticles were denoted as Au 55 -DENs and Au 147 -DENs, respectively. Similarly, Generation 4 amine-terminated PAMAM dendrimers were employed for the synthesis of Au nanoparticles using dendrimer to metal molar ratios of 1 : 13 and 1 : 100. These nanoparticles were designated as Au 13 -DENs and Au 100 -DENs. Characterization of these DENs was carried out using UV-vis spectroscopy, HRTEM and EDX. The <b>average</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> of Au 55 -DENs and Au 147 -DENs were determined to be 1. 7 ± 0. 4 and 2. 0 ± 0. 3 nm, respectively. The <b>average</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> of Au 13 -DENs and Au 100 -DENs were determined to be 2. 1 ± 0. 3 and 3. 1 ± 0. 4, respectively. Generation 4 amine-terminated PAMAM dendrimers {{were used for the}} encapsulation of Ag and Au nanoparticles within silica nanosphere support. In that way, the dendrimer was acting as a dual templating agent for both the nanoparticles and the silica nanosphere. Dendrimer encapsulated or stabilized Ag or Au nanoparticles were prepared first, followed by the in situ encapsulation within the silica nanosphere. The <b>average</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> of Ag and Au as determined by HRTEM prior to silica encapsulation were 3. 3 ± 0. 4 and 6. 5 ± 1. 0 nm, respectively. After silica encapsulation and calcination for the removal of dendrimer template, the <b>average</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> increased to 3. 6 ± 0. 6 and 7. 0 ± 1. 0 for Ag and Au respectively. Characterization of these silica encapsulated Ag and Au nanoparticles was performed by UV-vis spectroscopy, HRTEM, EDX, SEM, FTIR, TGA, BET and PXRD. Generation 4 hydroxyl-terminated PAMAM dendrimers were used for the synthesis of Ru and Pt nanoparticles. Characterization of these prepared Ru and Pt-DEN catalysts prior to immobilization on mesoporous support materials was performed using UV-vis, HRTEM and EDX. The <b>average</b> <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> were determined to be 1. 4 ± 0. 2 and 1. 7 ± 0. 3 for Ru- and Pt-DENs, respectively.

Mesoporous titania and silica materials were synthesized using P 123 as a surfactant by a soft template method. These mesoporous supported Ru and Pt catalysts were further characterized using HRTEM, SEM, EDX, FTIR, TGA, BET, TPR and PXRD.
