5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would <b>actually</b> <b>make</b> available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E

25|$|Opponents {{of the dam}} {{point out}} that there are three {{different}} kinds of floods on the Yangtze River: floods which originate in the upper reaches, floods which originate in the lower reaches, and floods along {{the entire length of the}} river.

Twelve hundred years of low water marks on the river were recorded in the inscriptions and the carvings of carp at Baiheliang, now submerged.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the film}} is of course fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done {{advertising}} work, he received many offers to do television commercials after Billy's Balloon drew international attention.

Eventually this became the germ for Rejecteds theme of a collection of cartoons so bad they were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator's breakdown and ultimately the cartoons' metaphysical crisis.|$|E
25|$|When {{printed books}} on the occult, {{particularly}} in the English language, had begun to be produced, some cunning folk obtained, and used, grimoires, or books of magic.

Indeed, some cunning folk appeared to own these grimoires purely for cosmetic reasons, to impress their clients, and did not <b>actually</b> <b>make</b> use of any of the magical rituals contained within them.|$|E
25|$|After the Civil War, General Robert E. Lee {{turned down}} several financially tantalizing offers of {{employment}} that would merely have traded on his name, and instead accepted the post of college president for three reasons. First, he had been superintendent of the United States Military Academy on the Hudson River at West Point, New York, so supervising higher education was in his background. Second, and more important, he {{believed that it was}} a position in which he could <b>actually</b> <b>make</b> a contribution to the reconciliation of the nation. Third, the Washington family were his in-laws: his wife was the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington, and Lee had long looked on George Washington as a hero and role model, so {{it is hardly surprising that}} he welcomed the challenge of leading a college endowed by and named after the first president.|$|E

25|$|Two {{years before}} their ascent, Grove had {{stood in the}} Hotel Royal in Chamouni (Chamonix), trying to persuade two young ladies and their father, who were using a {{telescope}} to view the peaks around Mont Blanc, that a black dot on the summit snowfield was not a person, but a distant rock some hundreds of feet in height. By chance they espied a real group of climbers, appearing as extremely small dots making {{their way across the}} Dôme du Goûter. Attempting to devise for them some imaginary route by which they might have reached that point, Grove showed them the fine snow crest descending in a gentle curve from the sharp and still unclimbed summit of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. The thought then struck him that an expedition to the summit, with an exit down the eastern ridge towards the easy Dôme du Goûter might <b>actually</b> <b>make</b> a fine undertaking.|$|E
