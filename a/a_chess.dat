5|$|The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) {{held the}} first major chess tournament for computers, the North American Computer Chess Championship, in September 1970.

5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well.

The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching <b>a</b> <b>chess</b> championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E

There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.|$|E

5|$|Howard Staunton (1810– 22 June 1874) was an English chess master who is {{generally}} regarded as having been the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, {{largely as a result}} of his 1843 victory over Saint-Amant. He promoted <b>a</b> <b>chess</b> set of clearly distinguishable pieces of standardised shape—the Staunton pattern promulgated by Nathaniel Cook—that is still the style required for competitions. He was the principal organiser of the first international chess tournament in 1851, which made England the world's leading chess centre and caused Adolf Anderssen to be recognised as the world's strongest player.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>chess</b> computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E

5|$|In formal competition, {{each player}} {{is obliged to}} record each move as it is played in <b>a</b> <b>chess</b> {{notation}} in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position.
