5|$|The breed {{was first}} {{registered}} with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1888. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1918. During the Second World War many kennels were dispersed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> destroyed, due to both the lack of food caused by rationing and that of manpower. Following the war several kennels {{led the way to}} reestablishing the breed including the Bellmead Kennels, located first in Surrey before later moving to Old Windsor. Dandies continued to be bred up at Bellmead up until the early 1990s, when it passed into the hands of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.|$|E
5|$|Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros, {{literally}} The City <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dogs,</b> 1963/1966), The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and {{the monumental}} Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversación en la catedral, 1969/1975). He writes prolifically across {{an array of}} literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (1973/1978) and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the breed}} had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working dog. In the early 20th century the breeders {{on either side of the}} Atlantic had created {{different}} breed standards for the Cocker Spaniel and the breed gradually diverged from one another, with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> overall were lighter and smaller. The differences were so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the English Cocker Spaniel Club and restricted breeding between the two types of spaniel. The two types of Cocker Spaniel in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognised the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed.|$|E

25|$|One theory {{proposes that}} some of the dogs left the Asian steppes with the Goths, a {{confederation}} of German tribes. Some, (the Ostrogoths), went west and their dogs became the German poodle, called in German the poodle-hund or puddle-dog, that is, water-dog. Others, (the Visigoths), went south to fight the Romans, and their dogs became the Lion Dog, groomed in the traditional lion cut. In 413 CE, the Visigoths invaded Iberia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> found their homeland before being settled in Aquitania north of the Pyrenees in 418 before extending their rule to most of Iberia after 470 CE.|$|E

25|$|In 1580, a miner named Adreas Berthold {{traveled}} around Germany selling Silesian terra sigillata {{made from a}} special clay dug from the hills outside the town of Striga, now Strzegom, Poland, and processed into small tablets. He promoted it as a panacea effective against every type of poison and several diseases, including plague. Berthold invited authorities to test it themselves. In two cases, physicians, princes and town leaders conducted trials involving dogs who were either given poison followed by the antidote or poison alone; the dogs who got the antidote lived <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> who got the poison alone died. In 1581, a prince tested the antidote on a condemned criminal, who survived.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{the breed}} began in Australia about 1820, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> were at first called the Rough Coated Terrier. The breed was officially {{recognised}} in 1850, and later renamed as the Australian Terrier in 1892. The Australian Terrier was shown at a dog {{show for the}} first time in 1906 in Melbourne, and was also shown in Great Britain about the same time. The Kennel Club (UK) recognised the breed in 1933. The American Kennel Club recognised the Australian Terrier in 1960, and the United Kennel Club (US) in 1970. It is now recognised by all of the kennel clubs in the English speaking world, and also is listed by various minor kennel clubs and other clubs and registries.|$|E
25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous. The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even huddled in the corner {{to the point of}} starvation to avoid electric shock.|$|E

25|$|While dog {{fighting}} was previously seen as isolated animal welfare issues—and therefore rarely enforced, {{the last decade}} has produced a growing body of legal and empirical evidence that has revealed a connection between dog-fighting and other crimes within a community, such as organized crime, racketeering, drug distribution, and/or gangs. Within the gang community, fighting dogs compete with firearms as the weapon of choice; indeed, their versatile utility arguably surpasses that of a loaded firearm in the criminal underground. Drug dealers distribute their illicit merchandise, wagers are made, weapons are concealed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> mutilate each other in a bloody frenzy as crowds cheer on. Violence often erupts among the usually armed gamblers when debts are to be collected and paid. There is also a concern for children who are routinely exposed to dogfighting and are forced to accept the inherent violence as normal. The routine exposure of the children to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance.|$|E

With supplies for themselves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> for 24days, they had about eight days' time before having {{to return to}} Hut Point. The alternative to waiting was moving southwards for another four days. Any travel beyond that, {{in the absence of}} the dog food depot, would mean killing dogs for dog food as they went along, thus breaching Atkinson's [...] "not to be risked" [...] order. Cherry-Garrard argued that the weather was too poor for further travel, with daytime temperatures as low as , and that he might miss Scott if leaving the depot, and thus decided to wait for Scott. On , in worsening weather, with his own supplies dwindling, Cherry-Garrard turned for home. Meanwhile, Scott's team were fighting for their lives less than [...] away.

500|$|On 23 April 1911 {{the sun set}} for the {{duration}} of the winter months, and the party settled into the Cape Evans hut. Under Scott's naval regime the hut was divided by a wall made of packing cases, so that officers and men lived largely separate existences, scientists being deemed [...] "officers" [...] for this purpose. Everybody was kept busy; scientific work continued, observations and measurements were taken, equipment was overhauled and adapted for future journeys. The surviving ponies needed daily exercise, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> required regular attention. Scott spent much time calculating sledging rations and weights for the forthcoming polar march. The routine included regular lectures on a wide range of subjects: Ponting on Japan, Wilson on sketching, Oates on horse management and geologist Frank Debenham on volcanoes. To ensure that physical fitness was maintained there were frequent games of football in the half-light outside the hut; Scott recorded that [...] "Atkinson is by far the best player, but Hooper, P.O. Evans and Crean are also quite good." [...] The South Polar Times, which had been produced by Shackleton during the Discovery expedition, was resurrected under Cherry-Garrard's editorship.
