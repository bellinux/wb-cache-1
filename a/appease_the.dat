5|$|The revolutionary {{forces were}} to be demobilized as soon as {{possible}} and the federal forces {{were to be}} the only army in Mexico. This was in order to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> army, which had opposed a compromise with Madero.|$|E
5|$|Bud Carson was Tech's {{defensive}} coordinator in 1966. His {{job was to}} <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> massive Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. Carson was not the charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired.|$|E
5|$|Despite Nerva's {{measures}} to remain {{popular with the}} Senate and the Roman people, support for Domitian remained strong in the army, which had called for his deification immediately after the assassination. In an attempt to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> soldiers of the Praetorian Guard, Nerva had dismissed their prefect Titus Petronius Secundus—one of the chief conspirators against Domitian—and replaced him with a former commander, Casperius Aelianus.|$|E

50|$|A Bobohizan plays {{a pivotal}} role in a daily life of the Kadazan people before the advent of Christianity. This ranges from <b>appeasing</b> <b>the</b> rice spirit during Kaamatan and Magavau festivals, <b>appeasing</b> <b>the</b> skull spirits during <b>the</b> Magang celebration, <b>appeasing</b> and {{offering}} sacrifices to the spirits of the sacred jars (Gusi) and to exorcise evil spirits. Bobohizans are also involved in charms, reading omens {{and to a lesser extent}} augury.|$|R

5|$|Husayn's brother Musa Pasha then governed Gaza {{into the}} early 1670s, {{implementing}} an anti-French and anti-Christian regime to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman government. Soon after his reign ended, Ottomans officials were appointed to govern. The Ridwan period is considered Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule and the city gradually dwindled after they were removed from office.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> people of Rome an {{estimated}} 135 million sestertii {{was spent on}} donatives, or congiaria, throughout Domitian's reign. The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets, which {{had been reduced to}} a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86 he founded the Capitoline Games, a quadrennial contest comprising athletic displays, chariot racing, and competitions for oratory, music and acting.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII chose many centrist cabinets, as {{he wanted}} to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> populace, much {{to the dismay of}} his brother, the ultra-royalist Count of Artois. Louis always dreaded the day he would die, believing that his brother, and heir, Artois, would abandon the centrist {{government}} for an ultra-royalist autocracy, which would not bring favourable results.|$|E

5|$|The new {{government}} sought to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> protesters by reopening {{the border with}} Czechoslovakia. This, however, merely resulted in the resumption of the mass exodus through Hungary via Czechoslovakia. On 8November 1989, with huge demonstrations continuing across the country, the entire Politbüro resigned and a new, more moderate Politbüro was appointed under Krenz's continued leadership.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany and his regime's anti-Semitic {{policies}} significantly affected American pre-Code filmmaking. Although Hitler had become unpopular {{in many parts of}} the United States, Germany was still a voluminous importer of American films and the studios wanted to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> German government. The ban on Jews and negative portrayals of Germany in the Fatherland even led to a significant reduction in work for Jews in Hollywood until after the end of World War II. As a result, only two social problem films released by independent film companies addressed the mania in Germany during the pre-Code era (Are We Civilized? and Hitler's Reign of Terror).|$|E
5|$|Both Titus and Domitian were fond of gladiatorial games, and {{realised}} {{its importance}} to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> citizens of Rome. In the newly constructed Colosseum, the Flavians provided for spectacular entertainments. The Inaugural {{games of the}} Flavian Amphitheatre lasted for a hundred days and {{were said to be}} extremely elaborate, including gladiatorial combat, fights between wild animals (elephants and cranes), mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races. During the games, wooden balls were dropped into the audience, inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold, or even slaves), which could then be traded for the designated item.|$|E

5000|$|Critics have {{alleged that}} LT2's {{mandates}} {{may have been}} aimed more at <b>appeasing</b> <b>the</b> corporate public-works-engineering industry, which lobbied the Environmental Protection Agency during the LT2 drafting process, and which has benefited from {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in ensuing public works contracts.|$|R
5|$|Henry {{believed}} that kings should rule England in a dignified manner, surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual. He thought that his predecessors had allowed {{the status of}} the Crown to decline, and sought to correct this during his reign. The events of the civil war in Henry's youth deeply affected the King, and he adopted Edward the Confessor as his patron saint, hoping to emulate {{the way in which the}} Anglo-Saxon King had brought peace to England and reunited his people in order and harmony. Henry tried to use his royal authority leniently, hoping to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> more hostile barons and maintain peace in England.|$|E
5|$|In 1671 Morgan {{attacked}} Panama City, {{landing on}} the Caribbean coast and traversing the isthmus before he attacked the city, which was on the Pacific coast. The battle was a rout, although the privateers profited less than in other raids. To <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> Spanish, with whom the English had signed a peace treaty, Morgan was arrested and summoned to London in 1672, but {{was treated as a}} hero by the general populace and the leading figures of government and royalty including Charles II.|$|E
5|$|In folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often {{play the}} role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most {{harmless}} case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.|$|E
5000|$|Flavius Josephus relates {{that about}} the year 50 a Roman soldier seized a Torah-scroll and, with abusive and mocking language, burned it in public. This {{incident}} almost brought on a revolution; but the Roman procurator Cumanus <b>appeased</b> <b>the</b> Jewish populace by beheading the culprit.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{a policy}} of <b>appeasing</b> <b>the</b> Nazi Party, Franz von Papen's {{government}} on 28 June 1932 lifted {{a ban on the}} SA and SS which had been in place since April. This led to recurrent riots and open street fighting between Nazis and Communists.|$|R
5000|$|This new {{political}} formation <b>appeased</b> <b>the</b> pro-German Falangists while tempering {{them with the}} anti-German Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law Ramón Serrano Súñer, who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists (Manuel Fal Condé) and the Falangists (Manuel Hedilla) to secure his political future. Franco also <b>appeased</b> <b>the</b> Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' anti-clericalism in his propaganda, in particular concerning the [...] "Martyrs of the war". While the loyalist forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against Fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of [...] "Catholic Spain" [...] against [...] "atheist Communism." ...|$|R
5|$|Phelan {{reacts to}} McNulty's report by {{complaining}} to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.|$|E
5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to an hour a day.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
25|$|Bobbili's {{rule was}} autocratic {{and he was}} highly {{inaccessible}} to party members. The success of every previous government in the Presidency had been due to {{the support of the}} district boards. However, the Raja of Bobbili, instead of <b>appeasing</b> <b>the</b> district-level politicians tried to destroy their power and influence.|$|R

5000|$|Gnaeus Genucius M. f. M. n. Aventinensis, consul in 363 BC, {{the third}} year of a great plague, which distracted from the threat of war with the Hernici. Lucius Manlius Capitolinus was {{nominated}} dictator in order to perform the rite of clavum fingere, in hopes of <b>appeasing</b> <b>the</b> gods.|$|R
5|$|Bader {{was named}} {{tactical}} {{commander of the}} combined forces (known as Kampfgruppe Bader) committed to Operation Trio, but to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> Italians the force was formally under the overall command of the Italian Second Army, commanded by Roatta. Kampfgruppe Bader consisted of the 718th Infantry Division (the only German division stationed in the NDH at the time), the Italian 22nd Infantry Division, 1st Alpine Division, 5th Alpine Division and 28 NDH battalions. Since 18 February, the 718th Infantry Division had been responsible for an area of operations bounded by the Sava and Bosna in the north, the Drina {{to the east and}} the German-Italian demarcation line to the south. Mainly because of lack of transport and firepower, the division had only conducted limited offensive operations against the Partisans between mid-February and mid-April.|$|E
5|$|During the 1996 elections, the BJP shifted its stance {{away from}} {{protectionism}} and towards globalisation; its election manifesto recommended increasing {{foreign investment in}} priority sectors, while restricting it in others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India. This was criticised by the left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch). The communist parties said that the BJP was attempting to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> World Bank and the United States government through its neoliberal policies. Similarly, the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its swadeshi ideology.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner has {{suggested}} that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} {{intended}} to provide a shelter for spirits that could cause problems for the people if not <b>appeased.</b> <b>The</b> shrines often include images of people and animals. Votive offerings are left at the house to propitiate the spirits. More elaborate installations include an altar for this purpose.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The ultra-Calvinistic view becomes in {{the mind}} and {{language}} of the hot-headed ignorant fanatic a denial of God's Unity. [...] "The merciful Son <b>appeasing</b> <b>the</b> wrath of the angry Father" [...] is language which implies two Wills, two Counsels in the Divine Mind (compare with this John iii. 16).|$|R
