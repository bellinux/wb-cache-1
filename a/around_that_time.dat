5|$|The {{long-lived}} Cyclone Pancho-Helinda {{formed on}} January18 in the Australian region from the monsoon trough {{to the north}} of the Cocos Islands. For several days, the system meandered in several directions before maintaining a southwest trajectory on January21. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> the system had intensified into Tropical Cyclone Pancho, reaching 10minute winds of 205km/h (125mph) before weakening occurred. On January23, the cyclone entered the south-west Indian Ocean, at which time Pancho was renamed Helinda. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> the storm was located between two ridges, causing the motion to become nearly stationary, and by January24 Helinda had re-entered the Australian region. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> the storm began undergoing a large loop to the east of 90°E, during which the winds decreased below tropical storm status. The influence of the monsoon trough turned the storm back to the south on January29, and a day later a building ridge turned the storm back to the west. On January31, Helinda again crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean as an intensifying tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, {{but the group}} {{splintered}} by mid-November.

As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E

5|$|In January and February 1984, {{conditions}} were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis {{in the southwest}} Indian Ocean, including warmer than normal sea surface temperatures and an active monsoon trough. On January16, a spiral area of convection persisted off the northeast coast of Madagascar, associated with the intertropical convergence zone. That day, it organized enough to warrant a satellite-based Dvorak rating of T2.5, prompting the Réunion Meteorological Service to name it Domoina. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> Météo-France (MFR) estimated winds of about 65km/h (40mph). Domoina initially tracked to the west-northwest, passing near Tromelin Island on January18. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> the storm had begun moving to the southwest, and MFR estimated that it weakened to tropical depression status. On January19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began warning on Domoina, designating it Tropical Cyclone 14S. The same day, MFR again upgraded Domoina into a moderate tropical storm. On January21, the storm made landfall just south of Tamatave in southeastern Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E

5|$|A later source, Johannes Aventinus, {{writes that}} Taksony {{fought in the}} Battle of Lechfeld on August 10, 955. There, future Holy Roman Emperor Otto I routed an 8,000-strong Hungarian army.

Modern historians, {{including}} Zoltán Kordé and Gyula Kristó, suggest that Fajsz abdicated in favor of Taksony <b>around</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> After that battle the Hungarians' plundering raids in Western Europe stopped, and they were forced to retreat from the lands between the Enns and Traisen rivers. However, the Hungarians continued their incursions into the Byzantine Empire until the 970s.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, Eline was still encountering wind shear and dry air. Despite these factors, the eye became better defined and the storm intensified, aided by favoring upper-level conditions. The cyclone turned {{more to the}} west toward Madagascar, despite a weakness in the ridge to the south. While approaching the country, Eline quickly intensified, reaching 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph) by 18:00UTC on February17. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> the cyclone made landfall on eastern Madagascar near Mahanoro. Eline rapidly weakened over land while moving to the west-southwest, and the JTWC downgraded the storm to tropical depression status within 18hours of moving ashore.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions {{and the center of}} circulation was close to the main area of convection. Intensity estimates <b>around</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become displaced from the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} the feature was displaced from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E
