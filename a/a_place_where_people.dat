500|$|During its 120years of operation, Kew's title changed {{numerous}} times. [...] This {{has been}} in response to society's changing views towards the treatment and care of mentally ill persons; improvements in treatment leading to better health outcomes {{and changes in the}} Victorian Government's various Health Acts. [...] From its establishment until 1905 the institution at Kew was known as an asylum – a title which emphasised its function as a place of detention rather than <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> could possibly be cured. [...] Kew was also for a short period known as the Metropolitan Lunatic Asylum at Kew, possibly to differentiate it from its sister country asylums at Ararat and Beechworth. During this period, all people committed to the asylum were termed 'inmates' rather than patients – again emphasising detention rather than cure.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of Seeley's series Hack/Slash through Image Comics, {{publisher}} Eric Stephenson suggested Seeley write another monthly book. Seeley {{knew he wanted to}} work with Norton again, and the two discussed ideas over the following months, mostly during lunch breaks. Seeley was interested setting a story in a small town so he could write about the kind of crimes that happen in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> prefer to live far away from each other. Norton was interested in telling a new kind of zombie story, since he felt The Walking Dead had perfected the zombie survival story. They combined the two ideas to create the premise for Revival. They pitched the series as Fargo meets The Walking Dead, using the terms [...] "Rural Noir" [...] and [...] "Farm Noir" [...] to describe the hardboiled detective story set in a small town.|$|E
500|$|Maxentius' {{rule was}} {{nevertheless}} insecure. His early support dissolved {{in the wake}} of heightened tax rates and depressed trade; riots broke out in Rome and Carthage; and Domitius Alexander was able to briefly usurp his authority in Africa. By 312AD, he was a man barely tolerated, not one actively supported, even among Christian Italians. In the summer of 311AD, Maxentius mobilized against Constantine while Licinius was occupied with affairs in the East. He declared war on Constantine, vowing to avenge his father's [...] "murder". To prevent Maxentius from forming an alliance against him with Licinius, Constantine forged his own alliance with Licinius over the winter of 311–312AD, and offered him his sister Constantia in marriage. Maximinus considered Constantine's arrangement with Licinius an affront to his authority. In response, he sent ambassadors to Rome, offering political recognition to Maxentius in exchange for a military support. Maxentius accepted. According to Eusebius, inter-regional travel became impossible, and there was military buildup everywhere. There was [...] "not <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> were not expecting the onset of hostilities every day".|$|E
500|$|Guests were {{expected}} to dress to high standards, with men wearing evening suits and the women wearing [...] "gowns with silk gloves reaching the elbow". All women in full evening dress received an orchid or gardenia corsage, compliments of the Stork Club. A requirement for all men was a necktie; {{those who were not}} wearing one were either lent one or had to buy one to gain admittance. Although African Americans were not explicitly barred from entry, there was a mutual understanding that they were not welcome. Billingsley insisted on orderly conduct for all of his Stork Club guests; fighting, drunkenness, or rowdiness were prohibited. He ran the club on the principle of it being <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> could have a good time and that it was somewhere he could bring his own family without worrying that they would see or hear something he did not want them to. Billingsley closely controlled the seating placement system in the club. Unescorted women were not allowed to enter the club after 6:00 p.m; this was a protective measure for men who may have been out with someone other than their wives.|$|E

[...] She described the role, which went through enormous transformations, as being one that had pushed her acting abilities. Blair's pleas to the show producers to let the down-on-luck Carmella be up-beat again were rejected. In June 2008, the actress confirmed her plans to leave the series when her contract expired. Speaking of her decision to leave, Blair said: [...] "I made the decision in December [...] I am eager to try new things and go to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> have no idea what I have done, I want to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't as a performer." [...] Producers confirmed they did not intend to kill her character off, as they hoped for her to return again in the future. A spokesperson for the programme's broadcaster, Network Ten, stated: [...] "Obviously, we've loved having Natalie on the show all these years and we're really sad to see her go [...] and hope to see her on Ramsay Street again one day in the future." [...] Blair later admitted she was surprised at her rise popularity whilst playing Carmella.|$|E
