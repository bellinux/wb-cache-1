5|$|Because {{of their}} human qualities, we never entirely lose sympathy with Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, and our {{imagination}} participates with theirs in the tragedy. Their imagination makes the two more human and yet also destroys them. As Kinnaird points out (elaborating on {{an idea of}} Joseph W. Donohue, Jr.), Hazlitt in part sees Macbeth as <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> of imagination itself.|$|E

5|$|After {{handling}} the marketing for Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh, 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance starring Ratna Asmara. Academia {{was critical of}} the film, believing it to lack educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> based in Bali, for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie Karsito describes as a dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer.|$|E
5|$|Between 1818 and 1820, she absorbed a {{considerable}} amount of drama, reading many of William Shakespeare's plays, some with Percy. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for dramatic writing, and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as dramatic theory. He even sought her advice on his play The Cenci, and she transcribed the manuscript of his drama Prometheus Unbound. The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays. Percy also encouraged Mary to translate Vittorio Alfieri's play Mirra (1785), <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> about father-daughter incest which influenced her own novel Mathilda.|$|E

5|$|His films also {{typically}} {{end with}} a death, which is portrayed not as <b>a</b> <b>tragedy,</b> but as a happy moving on where the deceased looks down happily at the world below. Between Heaven and Earth ends with a birth, but it is similarly handled the passing of a character into a new world. This pattern is continued in Mr. Nobody, where two deaths open the film and a unique twist on death {{at the end of}} the film conveys a wistful sense of happiness.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Sarumpaet, who was {{suffering}} domestic violence {{at home and}} discouraged by the market, left theatre and entered the film industry. After her divorce, which took several years and required records of her broken ribs to satisfy the religious courts, she returned to theatre in 1989 with a performance of Shakespeare's Othello. Sarumpaet began working as a director in 1991, with the television serial Rumah Untuk Mama (House for Mother), which was broadcast on the state-owned television station TVRI. That same year, she adapted Antigone, <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> by French writer Jean Anouilh, in a Batak setting.|$|E

5|$|Palencia-Roth {{notes that}} critics {{have been struck}} by the humorless elegiac style of The General in His Labyrinth; its dark mood and somber message {{is similar to that}} of The Autumn of the Patriarch. Love is a theme common to both Love in the Time of Cholera and The General in His Labyrinth, but the latter is {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>tragedy.</b> These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez's work.|$|E

5|$|All kanyas lack {{mothers in}} their life. Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti is adopted at birth and {{separated}} from a mother. Though all of kanyas {{are described as}} mothers, except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element {{is the theme of}} loss in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> and used by men, but battles on with life and society. They are considered by Mr Pradip Bhattacharya as victims of patriarchal myth-making, however orthodox Hindus usually oppose such theoretical speculation and consider such speculation distorting the message. A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.|$|E
5|$|Boitani {{discusses}} the modern {{use of the}} character of Troilus in a chapter entitled Eros and Thanatos. Love and death, the latter either as <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> in itself or as an epic symbol of Troy's own destruction, therefore, are the two core elements of the Troilus myth for the editor of the first book-length survey of it from ancient to modern times. He sees the character as incapable of transformation on a heroic scale in the manner of Ulysses and also blocked from the possibility of development as an archetypal figure of troubled youth by Hamlet. Troilus' appeal for the 20th and 21st century is his very humanity.|$|E
5|$|During the 1986–87 season, the Broncos {{relocated}} to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, becoming the Swift Current Broncos. Sakic, {{playing in his}} first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, {{he and his team}} faced <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the Regina Pats, and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, who declined to talk about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in 1987–88, Sakic was named the WHL Most Valuable Player and Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with Theoren Fleury of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the WHL scoring title.|$|E
