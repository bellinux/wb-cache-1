40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{algorithm}} for calibrating definitive observatory data {{with the goal}} of providing users with estimates of the data error standard deviations (SDs). The algorithm has been implemented and tested using Chambon-la-Forêt observatory (CLF) data. The calibration process uses all available data. It is set as a large, weakly non-linear, inverse problem that ultimately provides estimates of baseline values in three orthogonal directions, together with their expected standard deviations. For this inverse problem, <b>absolute</b> <b>data</b> error statistics are estimated from two series of absolute measurements made within a day. Similarly, variometer data error statistics are derived by comparing variometer data time series between different pairs of instruments over few years. The comparisons of these time series led us to use an autoregressive process of order 1 (AR 1 process) as a prior for the baselines. Therefore the obtained baselines do not vary smoothly in time. They have relatively small SDs, well below 300  pT when <b>absolute</b> <b>data</b> are recorded twice a week – i. e. within the daily to weekly measures recommended by INTERMAGNET. The algorithm was tested against the process traditionally used to derive baselines at CLF observatory, suggesting that statistics are less favourable when this latter process is used. Finally, two sets of definitive data were calibrated using the new algorithm. Their comparison shows that the definitive data SDs are less than 400  pT and may be slightly overestimated by our process: an indication that more work is required to have proper estimates of <b>absolute</b> <b>data</b> error statistics. For magnetic field modelling, the results show that even on isolated sites like CLF observatory, there are very localised signals over a large span of temporal frequencies that can be as large as 1  nT. The SDs reported here encompass signals of a few hundred metres and less than a day wavelengths...|$|E

40|$|We extend {{application}} of our lowest-order perturbative approach (in electron-electron correlation) {{for analysis of}} photo-double-ionization (PDI) of He [A. Y. Istomin et al., J. Phys. B 35, L 543 (2002) ] to excess energies up to 450 eV and to analysis of circular dichroism. We find that account of electron correlation in the final state to first order provides predictions for the triply differential cross section and circular dichroism that are in reasonable agreement with <b>absolute</b> <b>data</b> for excess energies up to 80 eV. For an excess energy of 450 eV, account of electron correlation in both initial and final states is necessary and the predicted triply differential cross sections are in agreement with <b>absolute</b> <b>data</b> only for large mutual ejection angles. We find that at excess energies of a few tens of eV, the PDI {{is dominated by the}} 2 ̆ 2 virtual 2 ̆ 2 knock-out mechanism, while the 2 ̆ 2 direct 2 ̆ 2 (on-shell) knock-out process gives only small contributions for large mutual ejection angles.

40|$|Starting from 1981 {{relative}} gravity {{measurements are}} carried out at the Neapolitan volcanoes (Vesuvius, Campi Flegrei and Ischia). Measurements are periodically carried out on networks covering the whole volcanoes and are referred to a common reference station located in a comparatively stable area (Naples). A program of absolute gravity measurements was started in 1986 at the reference station and on selected ones of the relative networks. The long-term periodically surveying of them permits the check of base stations and is aimed to reveal long-term variations or to confirm their stability; moreover it permits periodic calibration checks and comparison for relative gravimeters and for the recording gravity stations where operating. Several absolute field surveys have been carried out, mainly at Vesuvius and at Campi Flegrei. The last campaign was carried out on March 2009.
