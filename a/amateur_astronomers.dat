5|$|The first {{director}} of STScI, Riccardo Giacconi, announced in 1986 {{that he intended}} to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> to use the telescope. The total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle but excited great interest among <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> Caroline Moore and Lucas Bolyard {{attended}} the event. Both Moore and Bolyard had previously made noteworthy discoveries in astronomy. New York {{high school student}} Moore contributed {{to the discovery of}} Supernova 2008ha in 2008, becoming the youngest individual to identify a supernova.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{is one of}} the few {{sciences}} where amateurs {{still play}} an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena. <b>Amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> have made and contributed to many important astronomical discoveries, such as finding new comets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{asteroid}} {{was discovered}} on 9 November 1999, by American <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomer</b> Charles W. Juels at the Fountain Hills Observatory (...) in Arizona, United States. It {{was named after}} Australian <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomer</b> John Broughton.|$|R
500|$|A fireball, {{smaller than}} the {{previous}} observed impacts, was detected on June 3, 2010, by Anthony Wesley, an <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomer</b> in Australia, and was later discovered to have been captured on video by another <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomer</b> in the Philippines.|$|R
50|$|In {{combination}} with other improvements such as narrow-pass filters and improved eyepieces, the large apertures of the Dobsonian have dramatically increased the depth to which an <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomer</b> can penetrate into the universe. Whereas the <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomer</b> of the 1970s and 1980s typically did not explore much beyond the Messier and brighter NGC objects, the <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomer</b> of today, {{thanks in part to}} Dobsonians, can routinely observe objects in the IC, Abell, Perek Kohoutek, Minkowski, and other obscure catalogues once considered the domain only of professional astronomers.|$|R
5|$|Other uses of DD {{time have}} {{included}} the observations that led to views of the Hubble Deep Field and Hubble Ultra Deep Field, {{and in the first}} four cycles of telescope time, observations that were carried out by <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{scientific}} organizations {{headed by the}} European Southern Observatory (ESO) organized a network of <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> and students to measure Earth's distance from the Sun during the transit. The participants' observations allowed a calculation of the astronomical unit (AU) of 149,608,708km ± 11,835km which had only a 0.007% difference to the accepted value.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> {{observe a}} variety of {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and {{a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E

5|$|Previous space {{missions}} to comets, such as Giotto and Stardust, were fly-by missions. These missions {{were able to}} photograph and examine only the surfaces of cometary nuclei, and even then from considerable distances. The Deep Impact mission {{was the first to}} eject material from a comet's surface, and the mission garnered large publicity from the media, international scientists, and <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> {{continue}} to make scientific contributions {{to the field of}} astronomy and {{it is one of the}} few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conspiracy}} claim regards a {{patch of}} missing data in Google Sky near the constellation of Orion, which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted. However, the same region of sky can still be viewed by thousands of <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers.</b> A scientist at Google said that the missing data {{is due to a}} glitch in the stitching software used to piece the images together.|$|E

None of these smaller comets have survived its perihelion passage. Larger sungrazers such as the Great Comet of 1843 and C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) have survived their perihelion passage. <b>Amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> have been successful at discovering Kreutz comets in the data available in real time via the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Capella, is {{an unusual}} multiple star system among the brightest stars in the night sky. Beta Aurigae is an interesting variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers.</b> In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.|$|E
5|$|Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, {{but a small}} {{minority}} experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).|$|E

5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} the above problems with transient phenomena reports was made during the Clementine mission by a network of <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers.</b> Several events were reported, of which four of these were photographed both beforehand and afterward by the spacecraft. However, careful analysis of these images shows no discernible differences at these sites. This does not necessarily imply that these reports were a result of observational error, as {{it is possible that}} outgassing events on the lunar surface might not leave a visible marker, but neither is it encouraging for the hypothesis that these were authentic lunar phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Milky Way, {{there are}} no bright deep-sky objects for <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> in Serpens Caput, with nothing else above 10th magnitude. The {{brightest}} is NGC 5962, a spiral galaxy positioned around 28 megaparsecs distant with an apparent magnitude of 11.34. Slightly fainter is NGC 5921, a barred spiral galaxy with a LINER-type active galactic nucleus situated somewhat closer {{at a distance of}} 21 megaparsecs. A type II supernova was observed in this galaxy in 2001 and was designated SN 2001X. Fainter still are the spirals NGC 5964 and NGC 6118, with the latter being host to the supernova SN 2004dk.|$|E
5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Alpha Andromedae, is {{a binary}} star that {{has also been}} counted {{as a part of}} Pegasus, while Gamma Andromedae is a colorful binary and a popular target for <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers.</b> Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its color visible to the naked eye. The constellation's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest Messier objects. Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions M110 and M32, as well as the more distant NGC 891, lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object.|$|E

5|$|Lynx is a {{constellation}} {{named after the}} animal, usually observed in the northern sky. The constellation {{was introduced in the}} late 17th century by Johannes Hevelius. It is a faint constellation, with its brightest stars forming a zigzag line. The orange giant Alpha Lyncis is the brightest star in the constellation, and the semiregular variable star Y Lyncis is a target for <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers.</b> Six star systems have been found to contain planets. Those of 6 Lyncis and HD 75898 were discovered by the Doppler method; those of XO-2, XO-4, XO-5 and WASP-13 were observed as they passed in front of the host star.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 2007, a 50th anniversary semi-spoof {{edition of}} the {{programme}} was broadcast on BBC One, with Moore depicted as a Time Lord and featured special guests, <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers</b> Jon Culshaw (impersonating Moore presenting the first The Sky at Night) and Brian May. On 6 May 2007, {{a special edition of}} The Sky at Night was broadcast on BBC One, to commemorate the programme's 50th anniversary, with a party in Moore's garden at Selsey, attended by amateur and professional astronomers. Moore celebrated the record-breaking 700th episode of The Sky at Night at his home in Sussex on 6 March 2011. He presented with the help of special guests Professor Brian Cox, Jon Culshaw and Lord Rees, the Astronomer Royal.|$|E
5|$|Y Lyncis is {{a popular}} target among <b>amateur</b> <b>astronomers,</b> {{as it is a}} semiregular {{variable}} ranging in brightness from magnitude 6.2 to 8.9. These shifts in brightness are complex, with a shorter period of 110 days due to the star's pulsations, and a longer period of 1400 days possibly due to the star's rotation or regular cycles in its convection. A red supergiant, it has an estimated diameter around 580 times that of the Sun, is around 1.5 to 2 times as massive, and has a luminosity around 25,000 times that of the Sun. 1 Lyncis and UX Lyncis are red giants that are also semiregular variables with complex fluctuations in brightness.|$|E
