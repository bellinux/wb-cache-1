5|$|In 1910 Capper was {{transferred}} to command of the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham, marking {{the end of his}} <b>aeronautical</b> career.|$|E
5|$|Lodger Units at Northolt include No.600 Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force, 621EOD Squadron Royal Logistics Corps (part of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment RLC), No.1 AIDU (<b>Aeronautical</b> Information Documents Unit), the Central Band of the Royal Air Force, the Service Prosecuting Authority, Naval <b>Aeronautical</b> Information Centre, the British Forces Post Office (BFPO), the Air Historical Branch and the Polish Records Office.|$|E
5|$|While at the Air Service, Verville {{was awarded}} eight <b>aeronautical</b> patents for {{technologies}} such as airplane truss design, radiator mounting, and an automatic gun mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Although a Masonic benefit {{was held}} in his honour to try to recoup some of his {{financial}} losses, the fiasco spelt the end of L'Estrange's <b>aeronautical</b> career.|$|E
5|$|The {{request for}} a new bombsight was quickly {{passed on to the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment, where Patrick Blackett of the <b>Aeronautical</b> Research Committee volunteered to lead the effort. His {{solution}} to the problem was a thorough revision of the CSBS concept.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{were made}} in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with {{aircraft}} carriers and submarines. Although <b>aeronautical</b> warfare had relatively little success {{at the start of}} the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Born in Los Angeles, Parsons {{was raised}} by a wealthy family on Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena. Inspired by science fiction literature, he {{developed}} an interest in rocketry in his childhood and in 1928 began amateur rocket experiments with school friend Ed Forman. He dropped out of Pasadena Junior College and Stanford University due to financial difficulties during the Great Depression, and in 1934 he united with Forman and graduate student Frank Malina to form the Caltech-affiliated Guggenheim <b>Aeronautical</b> Laboratory (GALCIT) Rocket Research Group, supported by Guggenheim <b>Aeronautical</b> Laboratory chairman Theodore von Kármán. In 1939 the GALCIT Group gained funding from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to work on Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) for the U.S. military. Following American entry into World War II, in 1942 they founded Aerojet to develop and sell their JATO technology; the GALCIT Group became JPL in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Cernan was {{commissioned}} a U.S. Navy Ensign through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps at Purdue, and after graduation attended flight training. In 1958, Cernan became a Naval Aviator, flying FJ-4 Fury and A-4 Skyhawk jets in Attack Squadrons 126 and 113. Upon completion of his assignment in Miramar, California, {{he finished his}} education in 1963 at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School with a Master of Science degree in <b>Aeronautical</b> Engineering.|$|E
5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian <b>aeronautical</b> pioneer John Stringfellow (1799–1883) first {{demonstrated}} that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839–1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for a man who lost his arm in a cannon accident in 1863. Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham's work.|$|E
5|$|Committees in {{both houses}} of the United States Congress with {{oversight}} of the space program soon launched investigations, including the Senate Committee on <b>Aeronautical</b> and Space Sciences, chaired by Senator Clinton P. Anderson. Seamans, Webb, Manned Space Flight Administrator Dr. George E. Mueller, and Apollo Program Director Maj Gen Samuel C. Phillips were called to testify before Anderson's committee.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s {{there was}} a dirt {{airstrip}} known as Dutch Flats {{in what is now}} the Midway neighborhood of Point Loma. That is where Charles Lindbergh first tested and flew his airplane, The Spirit of St. Louis, which had been built in San Diego by the Ryan <b>Aeronautical</b> Company. A U.S. Post Office now located on the site contains several historic plaques commemorating Dutch Flats and Lindbergh.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Ford {{supported}} {{a constitutional amendment}} against desegregation busing. He also floated a proposal to put the federal budget on a two-year cycle, believing too much time was spent annually on budget wrangling. This idea, based on the model used in the Kentucky state budget, was never implemented. During the Ninety-fifth Congress (1977–1979), {{he was chairman of}} the Committee on <b>Aeronautical</b> and Space Sciences.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} wanted to earn a {{graduate}} degree, the University of Denver offered a twelve course program for those wanting to earn a Master of Science degree in systems management. Emery-Riddle also offered three graduate degrees, including the Master of <b>Aeronautical</b> Science. The University of Maine at Presque Isle also offered a Master of Public Administration as well.|$|E
5|$|From 1924 to 1928 he {{attempted}} without success to find employment {{as a civil}} engineer in California, where his father was now stationed. Instead he worked as an apprentice and journeyman boilermaker with the Steel Tank and Pipe Company in Berkeley, California. Advances in aviation in the 1920s led Hansell to undertake a career in <b>aeronautical</b> engineering, and to gain flying experience, he decided to join the United States Army Air Corps.|$|E
5|$|Government, military, {{and private}} {{customers}} have acquired the 757 for uses ranging from <b>aeronautical</b> testing and research to cargo and VIP transport. The 757-200, {{the most widely}} ordered version of the aircraft, has {{formed the basis for}} these applications. The first government operator of the 757 was the Mexican Air Force, which took delivery of a VIP-configured 757-200 in November 1987.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, at age 17, Armstrong began {{studying}} <b>aeronautical</b> engineering at Purdue University. He {{was the second}} person in his family to attend college. He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The only engineer he knew (who had attended MIT) dissuaded him from attending, telling Armstrong {{that it was not}} necessary {{to go all the way}} to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a good education.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Smithsonian Institution {{commissioned}} <b>aeronautical</b> engineer Paul MacCready {{to build}} a half-scale working model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi. The replica was launched with a ground-based winch. It flew several times in 1986 and was filmed {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's IMAX film On the Wing. However, the model was not anatomically correct and embodied vertical and horizontal tail stabilizers that pterosaurs did not have. It also had a longer tail, changing the weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, All Nippon Airways took {{delivery}} of the first 767-300BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter), a modified passenger-to-freighter model. The conversion work was performed in Singapore by ST Aerospace Services, the first supplier to offer a 767-300BCF program, and involved {{the addition of a}} main deck cargo door, strengthened main deck floor, and additional freight monitoring and safety equipment. Since then, Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, and Wagner <b>Aeronautical</b> have also offered passenger-to-freighter conversion programs for 767-300 series aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Orville {{made his}} last flight {{as a pilot}} in 1918 in a 1911 Model B. He retired from {{business}} and became an elder statesman of aviation, serving on various official boards and committees, including the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), predecessor agency to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and <b>Aeronautical</b> Chamber of Commerce (ACCA), predecessor to the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA).|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{majored in}} police science at Los Angeles City College, where he began dating Eileen-Anita Rexroat and became {{interested}} in <b>aeronautical</b> engineering. He obtained a pilot's license through the United States Army Air Corps-sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program. He enlisted with the USAAC on December 18, 1941, and married Eileen on June 13, 1942. He graduated from the USAAC on August 5, 1942, when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|The Boultons had two {{children}}, Matthew Robinson Boulton and Anne Boulton. Matthew Robinson in turn had {{six children}} with two wives. His eldest son Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, broadly educated {{and also a}} man of science, gained some fame posthumously for his invention of the important <b>aeronautical</b> flight control, the aileron. As his father before him, he also had two wives and six children.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Brazilian Air Force <b>Aeronautical</b> Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB, {{in accordance with the}} provisions of ICAO Annex 13, participated in the investigation representing the state of manufacture of the Boeing, state of registry and operator of the Embraer, and state of manufacture of the Honeywell avionics equipment installed in both planes.|$|E
5|$|The {{center was}} a part of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), a United States federal agency founded to promote <b>aeronautical</b> research. Cooperative {{students}} at NACA took part in a program that combined work and study, providing a way for them to fund their college degrees while gaining experience in aeronautics. Lunney graduated from college in June 1958, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace engineering.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the search shifted to the Southern Indian Ocean west of Australia and within Australia's <b>aeronautical</b> and {{maritime}} Search and Rescue regions that extend to 75°E longitude. Accordingly, on 17 March, Australia agreed to lead the search in the southern locus from Sumatra to the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The watch {{supervisor}} at Kuala Lumpur ACC activated the Kuala Lumpur <b>Aeronautical</b> Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC) at 05:30, over four hours after communication was lost with Flight 370. The ARCC is a command post at an Area Control Centre that coordinates search-and-rescue activities when an aircraft is lost.|$|E
5|$|Verville {{joined the}} Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce in 1933. The Aeronautics Branch became the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934. During his time there, Verville {{served in the}} {{following}} roles: <b>aeronautical</b> engineer; chief of the Manufacturing, Engineering, and Inspections Service; and finally assistant chief of the Aeronautic Development Section. In his role as chief of the Manufacturing, Engineering, and Inspections Service, {{he was in charge}} of the reviews for issuing type certificates for all manufactured airplanes.|$|E
5|$|While at Purdue, Chaffee took flight {{training}} {{as part of}} the NROTC program to prepare himself for a career as a naval aviator, soloing on March 29, 1957, and obtaining his private pilot's license on May 24, 1957. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in <b>Aeronautical</b> Engineering at Purdue in 1957.|$|E
5|$|After {{his service}} with the Navy, Armstrong {{returned}} to Purdue, where his best grades {{came in the}} four semesters following his return from Korea. He had previously earned average marks, but his final GPA was 4.8 out of 6.0. He pledged the Phi Delta Theta fraternity after his return and he wrote and co-directed its musical {{as part of the}} all-student revue; he was also a member of Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity and a baritone player in the Purdue All-American Marching Band. Armstrong graduated in 1955 with a Bachelor of Science degree in <b>Aeronautical</b> Engineering.|$|E
5|$|After racing {{airplanes}} competitively {{during the}} 1950s, Cummings and her husband, Howard Critchell, {{helped found the}} Bates Aeronautics program at Harvey Mudd College in 1962. They ran it together until he retired in 1979, at which point Iris continued alone until the program's end in 1990. A long-time certified FAA Pilot Examiner, she {{is the recipient of}} several international aviation awards {{and is a member of}} the National Flight Instructors Hall of Fame. In her later years, she has remained active as a lecturer, consultant, and curator of the <b>Aeronautical</b> Library Special Collections at Harvey Mudd.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{detailed}} wind tunnel tests Wilbur traveled to Chicago at Chanute's invitation {{to give a}} lecture to the Western Society of Engineers on September 18, 1901. He presented a thorough report about the 1900–01 glider experiments and complemented his talk with a lantern slide show of photographs. Wilbur's speech was the first public account of the brothers' experiments. A report {{was published in the}} Journal of the society, which was then separately published as an offprint titled Some <b>Aeronautical</b> Experiments in a 300 copy edition.|$|E
5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian <b>aeronautical</b> pioneer John Stringfellow first {{demonstrated}} that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be lit by acetylene gas lighting, supplied by the North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company. Street lights were provided in 1906. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, {{as well as by the}} provision of an electricity supply.|$|E
5|$|Civil flights ceased {{when the}} central area at Heathrow opened in 1954 with Northolt {{reverting}} to sole military use in May that year. Northolt's operations became constrained by {{its proximity to}} the new much larger civil airport at Heathrow. No. 1 <b>Aeronautical</b> Information Documents Unit (AIDU) moved to the station in 1956 from the neighbouring RAF West Ruislip station. The unit had been established in 1953 to provide information on airfields, communications and navigational aids {{for the benefit of}} aircraft safety. AIDU was originally under the command of RAF Transport Command but this was moved to Home Command in March 1957.|$|E
5|$|Cummings was {{inducted}} into the National Flight Instructors Hall of Fame in 2000. She was awarded the Federal Aviation Administration's Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award in 2006 for her dedication to airplane safety and the Nile Gold Medal of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale in 2007 for her lifetime of dedication to aviation. Since her official retirement, she has remained active on several faculty projects at Harvey Mudd College, in addition to working as a lecturer, consultant, and curator of the <b>Aeronautical</b> Library Special Collections at the university's Sprague Library. She {{has been a member of}} the Ninety-Nines, an organization dedicated to the support of women pilots, since 1952.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, <b>aeronautical</b> {{designers}} {{looked to}} variable-geometry wing designs {{to gain the}} manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings {{with the speed of}} swept wing designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the TSR-2 and subsequent F-111K aircraft, and was still looking for a replacement for its Avro Vulcan and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. Britain and France had initiated the AFVG (Anglo French Variable Geometry) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967. Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG, and sought new partners to achieve this.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the Lithuanian army was {{expanding}} and modernizing. The Lithuanian Air Force was especially targeted for rapid development and service in this branch was prestigious. Some of its earlier members such as Jurgis Dobkevičius and Antanas Gustaitis were instrumental in improving on <b>aeronautical</b> designs. While at the military school Marcinkus played for the KSK (Kauno sporto klubas) football club. After his father's death in 1927, Marcinkus took on the responsibility of supporting his remaining family, he also began playing football for LFLS Kaunas.|$|E
