25|$|In {{the first}} {{extraction}} of radium Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende. The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, {{which is similar}} to barium sulfate but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide followed by hydrochloric <b>acid</b> <b>treatment</b> to remove as much as possible of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate carrying the radium, thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution the barium and radium are reprecipitated as sulfates and this was repeated one or few times, for further purification of the mixed sulfate. Some impurities, that form insoluble sulfides, were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfate were pure enough they were once more converted to mixed chloride and barium and radium were separated by fractional crystallisation while monitoring the progress using a spectroscope (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the electroscope.|$|E

40|$|Most {{carbonate}} {{rocks are}} heterogeneous at multiple length scales. These heterogeneities strongly influence {{the outcome of}} the <b>acid</b> stimulation <b>treatments</b> which are routinely performed to improve well productivity. At the pore scale, carbonate rocks are very complex and exhibit a wide variety of pore classes. However, most of the previous studies reported in the literature have focused on the injection rate, temperature, and fluid properties. This study focused primarily on the effect of carbonate pore structure on the <b>acid</b> stimulation <b>treatments.</b> The objective of this study were to: 1) understand the effect of carbonate pore structure on the acid fluid flow through porous media by the use of thin section analysis, electrical measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) measurements, and tracer tests; 2) correlate the parameters that govern the tracer fluid flow through porous media to the acid fluid flow through the porous media of the carbonate rocks; 3) quantify the heterogeneity of the carbonate rocks at the pore scale so that the response of the carbonate rock to <b>acid</b> <b>treatments</b> in terms of acid volume needed to propagate the wormhole beyond the damaged zone, the wormhole fractal dimension, and the skin factor evolution during the treatment, can be correlated to the magnitude of pore scale heterogeneity; 4) find correlations between the flowing fraction obtained from tracer tests and the petrophysical parameters obtained from MICP and NMR measurements so that the response of the carbonate rocks to <b>acid</b> <b>treatments</b> can be connected to the basic petrophysical parameters; and 5) build a new methodology to predict the performance of <b>acid</b> stimulation <b>treatments</b> in carbonate rocks using non-destructive tracer tests. In order to achieve the objectives of the study, a carbonate characterization study was conducted first on different carbonate rock types using thin section analysis, electrical measurements, NMR, and MICP measurements. Then, tracer tests were conducted on these carbonates using two different tracer fluids. Following the tracer tests, coreflood experiments using two different acid systems (15 wt% HCl, and emulsified acid formulated at 1 vol% emulsifier and 0. 7 acid volume fraction) were conducted at field conditions. The results reveal that the pore scale heterogeneity has a significant effect on the <b>acid</b> stimulation <b>treatments.</b> It was also found that the response of carbonate rocks to <b>acid</b> <b>treatments</b> is correlated to the basic petrophysical parameters and the tracer fluid flow through porous media. A tracer fluid can be injected into a core, or on a field scale, between two wells, or injected into a single well configuration and then flow it back. The analysis of the tracer flowback samples can be then used to predict the <b>acid</b> stimulation <b>treatments</b> in carbonate rocks.

40|$|Carbonate {{reservoirs}} are heterogeneous; therefore, proper acid placement/diversion {{is required}} to make matrix <b>acid</b> <b>treatments</b> effective. Viscoelastic surfactants (VES) are used as diverting agents in carbonate matrix acidizing. However, these surfactants can adversely affect wettability around the wellbore area. Lab and field studies show that significant amounts of VES are retained in the reservoir, even after an EGMBE postflush. Optimizing <b>acid</b> <b>treatments</b> requires {{a study of the}} effect of VES on wettability. In a previous study using contact angle experiments, it was reported that spent acid solutions with VES only, and with VES and EGMBE are water-wetting. In this thesis, we studied the effect of two amphoteric amine-oxide VES', designated as "A" and "B" on the wettability of Austin cream chalk using contact angle experiments. We extended the previous study by using outcrop rocks prepared to simulate reservoir conditions, by demonstrating that VES adsorbs on the rock using two-phase titration experiments, by studying the effect of temperature on wettability and adsorption, and by developing a detailed procedure for contact angle experiments. We found that for initially oil-wet rocks, simulated <b>acid</b> <b>treatments</b> with VES "A" and "B" diversion stages and an EGMBE preflush and postflush made rocks water-wet at 25, 80, and 110 degrees C. Simulated <b>acid</b> <b>treatments</b> with a VES "A" diversion stage only made rocks water-wet at 25 degrees C. Our results suggest that both VES formulations cause a favorable wettability change for producing oil. The two-phase titration experiments show that both VES "A" and "B" adsorb on the rock surface. From our literature review, many surfactant wettability studies use contact angle measurements that represent advancing contact angles. However, wettability during stimulation is represented by receding contact angles. Results of static receding contact angles may be misinterpreted if low oil-acid IFT's cause oil droplets to spread. Spreading could be a reflection of the effect of the surfactants on the fluid-fluid interface rather than the rock-fluid interface. The new procedure shows the effect of VES and EGMBE on the rock-fluid interface only, and so represents the actual wettability...|$|R
