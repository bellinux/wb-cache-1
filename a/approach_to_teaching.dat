The second award, received in 2007, was for the development of a PhD Prep Track to prepare MAcc students to enroll in a PhD program after graduation. For 2013, the bachelor's degree in the School of Accountancy received two #3 rankings, one by Public Accounting Report and the other by U.S. News & World Report. The same two reporting agencies also ranked the school's MAcc program #2 and #7 in the nation, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Parsons family spent mid-1929 {{on a tour}} of Europe before {{returning}} to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the Great Depression their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching.</b> He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper El Universitano and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry. With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the Hercules Powder Company, where he learned more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel rocket engine, and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Willy Ley and Wernher von Braun. Parsons and von Braun had hours of telephone conversations about rocketry in their respective countries as well as their own research.|$|E

Thus, altogether there were 340 teachers {{from a variety of}} disciplines in Finland and the UK. The second study involved only the Finnish sample.

40|$|To {{promote a}} change in epistemic beliefs in {{in-service}} university teachers and a consequent improvement of their <b>teaching</b> methods <b>to</b> encourage students {{to take a more}} sophisticated <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> learning their subjects, I explored the relationships between epistemic beliefs and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> in a group of 111 lecturers across different disciplines at the University, Colombia, South America. This correlational research is based on epistemic metacognition research (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997) and phenomenography research (Marton & Booth, 1997). The methodology comprised quantitative and qualitative research techniques including the participation of a selected sample in face-to-face and online interventions. I also conducted two questionnaires, the Discipline-Focused Epistemic Beliefs Questionnaire (DEBQ) (Hofer, 2000) and the <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>Teaching</b> Inventory (ATI) (Trigwell & Prosser, 2004). Furthermore, I carried out interviews that were later analysed according to phenomenographic principles. Based on the findings, I concluded that the DEBQ and the ATI are suitable in measuring epistemic belief and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> in a university setting. As I found correlations between epistemic beliefs and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching,</b> I concluded that epistemic beliefs do play an important role and influence the way in which teachers approach their own teaching. Additionally, as there was a statistically significant decrease in the Information Transmission/Teacher-Focused Approach through the online intervention, and as epistemic beliefs and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> are correlated, the results indicate the possibility of a change from naive to more sophisticated epistemic beliefs. The results also indicate the possibility of changing epistemic beliefs and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> through an online intervention or facilitated by online learning environments. The results also indicate the possibility of changing <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> through short-term interventions as well. Regarding disciplinary differences, lecturers did have different perceptions. I concluded that discipline did have an influence and an impact on epistemic beliefs and <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching.</b> There was no statistically significant difference between genders or the number of years of experience. Finally, there were variations in lecturers‘ ways of experience learning, teaching, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), and knowledge. The description of lecturers' experiences of learning, teaching, ICTs, and knowledge shows 13 qualitatively distinct categories of descriptions. Also 13 holistic views, in a form of outcome space, were derived from their various ways of experiencing those phenomena...|$|R

25|$|The first {{surviving}} {{record of}} a systematized <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> singing {{was developed in the}} medieval monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church sometime near the beginning of the 13th century. As with other fields of study, the monasteries were the center of musical intellectual life during the medieval period and many men within the monasteries devoted their time to the study of music and the art of singing. Highly influential {{in the development of a}} vocal pedagogical system were monks Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia who were the first to develop a concept of vocal registers. These men identified three registers: chest voice, throat voice, and head voice (pectoris, guttoris, and capitis). Their concept of head voice, however, is much more similar to the modern pedagogists understanding of the falsetto register. Other concepts discussed in the monastic system included vocal resonance, voice classification, breath support, diction, and tone quality to name a few. The ideas developed within the monastic system highly influenced the development of vocal pedagogy over the next several centuries including the Bel Canto style of singing.|$|E
25|$|As a {{university}} professor {{for much of his}} life, Dijkstra saw teaching not just as a required activity but as a serious research endeavor. His <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> was unconventional. His lecturing style has been described as idiosyncratic. When lecturing, the long pauses between sentences have often been attributed to the fact that English is not Dijkstra's first language. However the pauses also served as a way for him to think on his feet and he was regarded as a quick and deep thinker while engaged in the act of lecturing. His courses for students in Austin {{had little to do with}} computer science but they dealt with the presentation of mathematical proofs. At the beginning of each semester he would take a photo of each of the students, in order to memorize their names. He never followed a textbook, with the possible exception of his own while it was under preparation. When lecturing, he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. He invited the students to suggest ideas, which he then explored, or refused to explore because they violated some of his tenets. He assigned challenging homework problems, and would study his students' solutions thoroughly. He conducted his final examinations orally, over a whole week. Each student was examined in Dijkstra's office or home, and an exam lasted several hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{rhetoric and}} {{composition}} pedagogy {{developed in the}} late nineteenth century, and still used in many schools today, is known as current-traditional rhetoric, commonly referred to among field scholars, and hereinafter, as “CTR.” CTR is defined by an emphasis on the final product, usually the five-paragraph, informal essay or short research paper on an objective topic. In addition, CTR centers around the notion that discourse is delivered in a prescribed, mechanical form, leading to its pedagogical focus on grammar, spelling, syntax, and uniform style and arrangement. Further, CTR promotes the idea that the purpose of writing is the product, which is expected to reflect a predefined, stagnant reality without consideration for process, authorial identity, or audience. For example, a CTR pedagogue might instruct his or her students to write an essay on bicycles; the expected outcome is an objective discussion of bicycles organized in a five-paragraph essay, the identity of the audience or the writer is not to be considered, and the goal is the final product—the “essay”— which should have no errors (or even intentional boundary-breakers) in grammar, spelling, or design. James Berlin and Robert Inkster examine typical CTR textbooks and evaluate their limited <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> composition, concluding that CTR limits “discovery procedures,” diminishes the “importance of the writer,” and restricts writer engagement with audience. Likewise, W. Ross Winterowd similarly contends that the pedagogy of CTR is dated and ultimately ineffective in his examination of a number of current-traditional textbooks.|$|E

Grove Musics summary is that [...] "Tristano's influence is felt most strongly {{in the work of}} his best pupils [...] and in his example of high-mindedness and perfectionism, characteristics which presupposed for jazz the highest standards of music as art." [...] Shim too identified his teaching as part of his legacy: parts of his <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> jazz have become standard practice; and [...] "the sheer number of students he taught, which may easily exceed a thousand", tied to some of them going on to employ what they learned in their own playing and pedagogy, illustrate his influence.

500|$|Hilda Rix and {{her sister}} Elsie both played musical {{instruments}} as children, and would perform songs or dances at regional shows. Elsie was a singer and actor who performed at the meetings of the Austral Salon, and the sisters collaborated in designing posters to advertise the Salon's activities. As a child, Hilda was enthusiastic about drawing. [...] Her artistic efforts drew praise while she was attending high school at Melbourne Girls Grammar (known as Merton Hall), though in most other respects Rix was not an outstanding student. Both Elsie and Hilda took some art lessons with a Mr Mather, before Hilda went on to study at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905, where she was taught by a leading member of the Heidelberg School, Frederick McCubbin. Her fellow students were mostly women and included Jessie Traill, Norah Gurdon, Ruth Sutherland, Dora Wilson, and Vida Lahey. Rix would subsequently be critical of McCubbin's <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>teaching,</b> referring to his methods as [...] "vague persuasions". Nevertheless, {{the author of the}} only comprehensive biography of Rix, John Pigot, considered that McCubbin influenced her in several ways: he emphasised the creativity of individuals rather than imitating the style of any one school of painting; he modelled the importance of nationalistic ideas and subjects that would become so prominent in her later painting; and his work emphasised the painting's subject over technical considerations.|$|E
