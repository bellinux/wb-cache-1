25|$|In {{the first}} couple of decades there was no {{traditional}} marriage in the kibbutz. If a man and woman wanted to get married, they went to the housing office and requested a room together. Not having traditional marriage was seen as a way to dissolve the patriarchy and give women their own standing without depending on a man (economically or socially) and was also viewed as <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> for the community as a whole, as communal life was the main aspect of the kibbutz.|$|E
25|$|Soon this {{movement}} expanded {{outside of the}} youth realm and became a more widespread Muslim practice. Women viewed this way of dress {{as a way to}} both publicly announce their religious beliefs as well as a way to simultaneously reject western influences of dress and culture that were prevalent at the time. Despite many criticisms of the practice of hijab being oppressive and detrimental to women’s equality, many Muslim women view the way of dress to be <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>thing.</b> It is seen as a way to avoid harassment and unwanted sexual advances in public and works to desexualize women in the public sphere in order to instead allow them to enjoy equal rights of complete legal, economic, and political status. This modesty was not only demonstrated by their chosen way of dress but also by their serious demeanor which worked to show their dedication to modesty and Islamic beliefs.|$|E

Her audition impressed all three judges, and she progressed through to the semi-finals. Following the semi-final process, Mauboy had advanced through to the toptwelve. The media cited her previous Sony contract as grounds for dismissal, but since the contract had expired, Australian Idol producers refused to remove her from the show. Throughout the series, Mauboy continued to impress the judges with her performances. In the final eleven week, following her rendition of Kelly Clarkson's [...] "Walk Away", judge Kyle Sandilands commented on Mauboy's weight, that if she wished {{to succeed in the}} music industry, she should [...] "lose the jelly belly". Mauboy appeared stunned by the comment. In an interview with Who magazine's Alicia Neil, two years after the comment was made, Mauboy stated [...] "I kind of took it as a joke...I look back on it as <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> – it made me a stronger person." ...|$|E

In 2015, the UK Supreme Court rejected Trump's bid to stop an offshore wind farm being built close {{to one of his}} two golf resorts in Scotland. Trump has twice lost bids in the Scottish courts to halt the development, leading Salmond to describe him as a [...] "three times loser", to which Trump called Salmond a [...] "totally irrelevant has-been" [...] and [...] "an embarrassment" [...] to Scotland. Salmond has also said that Trump's impact in Scotland – in particular Turnberry, the Ayrshire golf resort he bought in 2014 – has had a [...] "damaging impact" [...] on the Scottish economy.

[...] During the cover's designing stage, Rihanna met with Mitchell, in which they [...] "drank" [...] {{and came up with a}} poem that would be used for the artwork and liner notes entitled If They Let Us. Mitchell explained the poem and its meaning to Rolling Stone magazine, stating it was about being misunderstood, but still be able to stand out while doing what is right for you.

[...] Of the ensuing controversy, Rowling said, [...] "I know that it was <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> that I said it, for at least one person, because one man 'came out' at Carnegie Hall."

[...] Harris also says that there is a drastic underrepresentation of gays in the population, and it is a failure of decency and nerve on the entertainment industry— [...] "including the tremendous number of gay producers, writers, and executives who sacrifice their convictions so they don't look too strident or political." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, it was {{announced}} that India Longford (Beth Kingston) would be murdered after an experiment with online dating goes [...] "horribly wrong". Hollyoaks worked closely with the University of Central Lancashire's Cyberspace Research Unit on the storyline, in a bid to raise awareness of internet safety. Speaking on behalf of the Research Unit, Dr Jo Bryce commented: [...] "If the storyline can remind one young person to protect themselves when engaging in online activity, then that can only be <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>thing.</b> Too many youngsters think they are immune to online risks and this storyline is a reminder that you don't always know who you're talking to online." [...] Hollyoaks series producer, Paul Marquess, added: [...] "This is a terrifying murder that highlights the dangers of meeting strangers online. The storyline, which launches at Christmas, will take us right through 2011 and audiences will be gripped {{to find out if the}} dangerous killer will strike again." [...] Marquess said he was surprised that the show had not done a big storyline about [...] "stranger danger" [...] on the internet before, branding it [...] "absolutely key Hollyoaks territory". Hollyoaks writer, Steve Hughes, explained that the storyline was inspired by a real-life incident, where a friend had her identity stolen on social networking service Facebook.|$|E

2500|$|Schierholtz hit a 467-foot {{home run}} at Coors Field on April 18, 2011, against Esmil Rogers in an 8–1 {{victory over the}} Rockies. At the start of May, Schierholtz took over the Giants' right field job, due to a slump by Burrell. He hit a game-tying, two-run pinch-hit home run against Grant Balfour on May 22 in an 11-inning, 5–4 victory over Oakland. He had a game-tying RBI single {{in the ninth inning}} on June 1 against Fernando Salas and a game-winning RBI single in the 11th inning against Ryan Franklin in a 7–5 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. On July 6, against the San Diego Padres, Schierholtz {{recorded}} his first multi-home run game. In the bottom of the 14th inning of that game, he hit a walk-off home run against Pat Neshek that secured a 6-5 victory for the Giants. Two days later, he had a splash hit home run against R.A. Dickey in a 5–2 loss to the New York Mets. Following the acquisition of Carlos Beltrán on July 28, Schierholtz began playing some left field {{for the first time in}} his career. He broke his right foot against the Atlanta Braves on August 15, appearing in five more games before the injury became too severe to play through. He was placed on the disabled list on August 27 (retroactive to August 22), and, though initially expected to return, he missed the rest of the season. In 115 games (335 at bats), Schierholtz hit [...]278 with 93 hits, 22 doubles, nine home runs, and 41 RBI. He said of his 2011 season, [...] "I was able to contribute to the team this year.

2500|$|Rabbi Simeon bar Abba in {{the name}} of Rabbi Johanan taught that every time Scripture uses the {{expression}} “and it was” (vayechi), it intimates the coming of either trouble or joy. [...] If it intimates trouble, there is no trouble to compare with it, and if it itimatres joy, there is no joy to compare with it. [...] Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman made a distinction: [...] In every instance where Scripture employs “and it was” (vayechi), it introduces trouble, while when Scripture employs “and it shall be” (vehayah), it introduces joy. [...] The Sages raised an objection to Rabbi Samuel’s view, noting that to introduce the offerings of the princes, [...] says, “And he that presented his offering [...] [...] [...] was (vayechi),” and surely that was <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>thing.</b> [...] Rabbi Samuel replied that the occasion of the princes’ gifts did not indicate joy, because it was manifest to God that the princes would join with Korah in his dispute (as reported in [...] ). [...] Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Simon said {{in the name}} of Rabbi Levi ben Parta that the case could be compared to that of a member of the palace who committed a theft in the bathhouse, and the attendant, while afraid of disclosing his name, nevertheless made him known by describing him as a certain young man dressed in white. [...] Similarly, although [...] does not explicitly mention the names of the princes who sided with Korah in his dispute, [...] nevertheless refers to them when it says, “They were princes of the congregation, the elect men of the assembly, men of renown,” and this recalls [...] “These were the elect of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers [...] [...] [...] ,” where the text lists their names.

6000|$|Evolution is a {{good example}} of that modern {{intelligence}} which, if it destroys anything, destroys itself. Evolution is either an innocent scientific description of how certain earthly things came about; or, if it is anything more than this, it is an attack upon thought itself. If evolution destroys anything, it does not destroy religion but rationalism. If evolution simply means that <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> called an ape turned very slowly into <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>thing</b> called a man, then it is stingless for the most orthodox; for a personal God might just as well do things slowly as quickly, especially if, like the Christian God, he were outside time. But if it means anything more, it means that there is no such thing as an ape to change, and no such thing as a man for him to change into. It means that there is no such thing as a thing. At best, there is only one thing, and that is a flux of everything and anything. This is an attack not upon the faith, but upon the mind; you cannot think if there are no things to think about. You cannot think if you are not separate from the subject of thought. Descartes said, [...] "I think; therefore I am." [...] The philosophic evolutionist reverses and negatives the epigram.

Elizabeth Barrett contrived to assert, what still needs but then urgently needed assertion, the fact that womanliness, whether in life or poetry, was <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>thing,</b> and not the negative of manliness. Her verse at its best was quite as strong as Browning's own, and very nearly as clever.

And the picture of a shadow is <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>thing.</b> Indeed, we have negative names, to which there be no positive ideas; but they consist wholly in negation of some certain ideas, as SILENCE, INVISIBLE; but these signify not any ideas in the mind but their absence.|$|E
