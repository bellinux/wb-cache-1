5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> of the Grand Lodge era, {{during the}} 1720s, James Anderson {{composed}} the first printed constitutions for Freemasons, {{the basis for}} most subsequent constitutions, which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry. As Freemasonry spread, continental masons began to include their ladies in Lodges of Adoption, which worked three degrees with the same names as the men's but different content. The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century. Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the United States, but distinguished {{the names of the}} degrees from those of male masonry.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> of the Industrial Revolution, {{development}} of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales, mainly in and around Cardiff (the capital), Swansea and Newport, and in the nearby valleys. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, Wales' economy depends on the public sector, light and service industries and tourism. Wales' 2010 gross value added (GVA) was £45.5 billion (£15,145 per head, 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA per head in Britain).|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that Lithuanians began combining their forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> of the 13th century. For example, in 1207, soldiers were recruited across Lithuania to fight the German religious orders, and in 1212, Daugirutis' treaty with Novgorod shows that he exerted some degree of influence over a vast area. During the first twenty years of the 13th century, Lithuanians organized some thirty military expeditions to Livonia, Russia, and Poland. Historian Tomas Baranauskas argues that a Lithuanian state {{could be said to}} exist as early as 1183.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} set on the fictional world of Prester, where its {{inhabitants}} use aerial vehicles known as vanships {{as a means of}} transportation. On this world which is divided in eternal conflict between the nations of Anatoray and Disith, sky couriers Claus Valca and Lavie Head must deliver a girl who holds the key to uniting the two factions. Although Prester itself is not a representation of Earth, it features technology reminiscent of nineteenth-century Europe <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> of the Industrial Revolution. Many of its designs were also inspired by Germany's technological advances during the interwar period.|$|E

5|$|Also <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> {{of the new}} century, however, rising {{demand for}} coffee and rubber gave the Brazilian {{government}} an influx of revenue. Contemporary writers estimated that seventy-five to {{eighty percent of the}} world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil. Prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and the Baron of Rio Branco, moved to have the country recognized as an international power, as they believed that the short-term windfall would continue. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal. The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered. While they first ordered three small battleships, the launch of the revolutionary British Dreadnought—which heralded a new and powerful type of warship—caused the Brazilians to cancel their order in favor of two dreadnoughts, with a third to follow.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{there are}} twelve monarchies in Europe, of which seven {{are members of}} the European Union: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and five are not: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway and the Vatican City. All seven monarchies in the European Union are {{constitutional}} monarchies. In all seven monarchies that are in the EU, the monarch is legally prohibited from using political power, or the monarch does not utilise the political powers vested in the office by convention. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> of the 20th century, France was the only republic among the future members states of the European Union; the ascent of republicanism to the political mainstream only started {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. In Belgium, the monarchy enjoys a lower degree of support than in other European monarchies, and is often questioned. Popular support for the monarchy has historically been higher in Flanders and lower in Wallonia; however, in recent decades these roles have reversed.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> of the 19th century, {{less than}} a handful of academically trained architects were active in Norway, most of them {{military}} officers having studied civil engineering. The market for architects was limited in a sparsely inhabited country with no capital city, no court and no important government institutions. Architecture was of interest mainly to a limited group of wealthy merchants and landowners. However, toward the close of the previous century, this group saw a remarkable increase in prosperity. Large fortunes were made by a few, who then sought to surround themselves with buildings and gardens appropriate to their social position. Well connected internationally, these people were acquainted with the latest trends in architecture. Neoclassical structures were much in demand.|$|E

5|$|By 1940, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> of {{the freeway}} era, {{the state was}} making plans to convert the Bayshore Highway into a ten-lane Bayshore Freeway between San Francisco and Palo Alto. The first piece built was from Peninsula Avenue at the San Mateo-Burlingame line to South San Francisco. This six-lane freeway, {{completed}} in 1949, followed the existing highway to Broadway in Burlingame, but then took a more inland alignment past the San Francisco International Airport, and crossed the old road at South San Francisco, running just east of it to near {{the south end of}} the cut at Sierra Point. Construction began inside San Francisco in 1950 and was completed in 1958; the new causeway across Candlestick Cove, connecting the completed section in South San Francisco with San Francisco, was dedicated in mid-1957. In 1951, the state legislature renamed the portion within San Francisco after James Lick, a California pioneer and philanthropist.|$|E
5|$|Deparaja, {{a member}} of the royal family, {{authored}} Amaruka and a collection of romantic stories called the Sobagina Sone (1410), written {{in the form of a}} narration by the author to his wife. However, according to Kotraiah, Sobagina Sone was actually written by King Deva RayaII. The writing contains interesting details on the king's hunting expeditions and on the professional hunters who accompanied him. In 1525, Nanjunda Kavi, a feudatory prince wrote on local history, published a eulogy of prince Ramanatha (also called Kumara Rama) titled Ramanatha Charite (or Kumara Rama Sangatya) in the sangatya metre. The poem is about the prince of Kampili and his heroics <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> of the Muslim invasion into southern India. This work combines folk and epic literature. The protagonist rejects the advances of his stepmother, only to be condemned to death. He is rescued by a minister, but eventually achieves martyrdom fighting Muslim invaders at the capital.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise was {{the second}} Star Trek series to be {{released}} in high definition on Blu-ray following the earlier releases of Star Trek: The Next Generation, with season one delivered on March 26, 2013. The fans of the franchise were asked for feedback on potential covers for the first season release, but as there was no clear winner, a new design was created based on the feedback received. The second season was released on August 20, 2013, the third season was on January 7, 2014, and the final season on April 29, 2014. The Blu-ray releases featured both the same additional features as the DVD release, in addition to new features exclusive to these releases. In January 2017 a new 24 disc Blu-ray set of the whole series was released. This set includes the whole series in 1080p with a screen size ratio of 1.78:1 (widescreen) and with the sound in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (5 channels plus subwoofer). The set includes 97 episodes from its original broadcast run <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> of the 21st century and features like a cast reunion. Note that the Blu-ray release in 1080p is actually higher than its original broadcast resolution which ranged from 720p to 1080i.|$|E

5|$|Roddenberry {{had first}} {{proposed}} a Star Trek feature at the 1968 World Science Fiction Convention. The movie {{was to have}} been set before the television series, showing how the crew of the Enterprise met. The popularity of the syndicated Star Trek caused Paramount and Roddenberry to begin developing the film in May 1975. Roddenberry was allocated $3 to $5 million to develop a script. By June 30, he had produced what he considered an acceptable script, but studio executives disagreed. This first draft, , featured a grounded Admiral Kirk assembling the old crew on the refitted Enterprise to clash with a godlike entity many miles across, hurtling towards Earth. The object {{turns out to be a}} super-advanced computer, the remains of a scheming race who were cast out of their dimension. Kirk wins out, the entity returns to its dimension, and the Enterprise crew resumes their voyages. The basic premise and scenes such as a transporter accident and Spock's Vulcan ritual were discarded, but later returned to the final script. The film was postponed until spring (March/April) 1976 while Paramount fielded new scripts for Star Trek II (the working title) from acclaimed writers such as Ray Bradbury, Theodore Sturgeon and Harlan Ellison. Ellison's story had a snake-like alien race tampering with Earth's history to create a kindred race; Kirk reunites with his old crew, but they are faced with the dilemma of killing off the reptilian race in Earth's prehistory just to maintain humanity's dominance. When Ellison presented his idea, an executive suggested Ellison read Chariots of the Gods? and include the Maya civilization into his story, which enraged the writer because he knew Maya did not exist <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> of time. By October 1976, Robert Silverberg had been signed to work on the screenplay along with a second writer, John D. F. Black, whose treatment featured a black hole that threatened to consume all of existence. Roddenberry teamed up with Jon Povill to write a new story that featured the Enterprise crew setting an altered universe right by time travel; like Black's idea, Paramount did not consider it epic enough.|$|E
