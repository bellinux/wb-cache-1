40|$|We {{have studied}} the Zn content of spinel group mineral and daubreelite in {{primitive}} <b>achondrites</b> in order to clarify how the content of Zn, a moderately volatile element, reflects their formation process. Primitive <b>achondrites</b> have achondritic texture and chondrite-related chemistry and mineralogy. Because of these characteristics, primitive <b>achondrites</b> are thought to represent the transition from chondrites to <b>achondrites.</b> We have compared the Zn content in spinel group minerals of primitive <b>achondrites</b> with those of chondrites and ureilites. Although Zn is a moderately volatile element, the Zn content in spinel group mineral of primitive <b>achondrites,</b> ureilites and metamorphosed chondrites is higher than unmetamorphosed chondrites. This fact suggests that high Zn content in spinel group mineral of primitive <b>achondrites</b> may result from secondary crystallization or reequilibration of spinel mineral from a sulfide melt containing Cr, Mn and Zn which was partially melted during thermal metamorphism. We {{also found that the}} Zn content in spinel group minerals decreases from primitive <b>achondrites</b> and ureilites to HED and Martian meteorites. We suggest that Zn was significantly volatilized from completely molten magma in these meteorites. We found that spinel group minerals and daubreelites appear to be the major reservoir of Zn in most meteorites. Zn may be preferentially retained in the tight spinel structure...|$|R

5000|$|Primitive <b>achondrites</b> are a {{subdivision}} of meteorites. They are classified {{on the same}} rank (historically called [...] "Class") and lying between chondrites and <b>achondrites.</b> They are called primitive because they are <b>achondrites</b> that have retained much of their original chondritic properties. Very characteristic are relic chondrules and chemical compositions close to the composition of chondrites. These observations are explained as melt residues, partial melting, or extensive recrystallization.|$|R

40|$|Mid-infrared (5 – 25 μm) transmission/absorption {{spectra of}} {{differentiated}} meteorites (<b>achondrites)</b> were measured to permit comparison with astronomical observations of dust in {{different stages of}} evolution of young stellar objects. In contrast to primitive chondrites, <b>achondrites</b> underwent heavy metamorphism and/or extensive melting and represent more advanced stages of planetesimal evolution. Spectra were obtained from primitive <b>achondrites</b> (acapulcoite, winonaite, ureilite, and brachinite) and differentiated <b>achondrites</b> (eucrite, diogenite, aubrite, and mesosiderite silicates). The ureilite and brachinite show spectra dominated by olivine features, and the diogenite and aubrite by pyroxene features. The acapulcoite, winonaite, eucrite, and mesosiderite silicates exhibit more complex spectra, reflecting their multi-phase bulk mineralogy. Mixtures of spectra of the primitive <b>achondrites</b> and differentiated <b>achondrites</b> in various proportions show good similarities to the spectra of the few Myr old protoplanetary disks HD 104237 A and V 410 Anon 13. A spectrum of the differentiated mesosiderite silicates {{is similar to the}} spectra of the mature debris disks HD 172555 and HD 165014. A mixture of spectra of the primitive ureilite and brachinite is similar to the spectrum of the debris disk HD 113766. The results raise the possibility that materials produced in the early stage of planetesimal differentiation occur in the protoplanetary and debris disks...|$|R
25|$|About 8% of the meteorites are <b>achondrites</b> (meaning they do {{not contain}} chondrules), {{some of which are}} similar to {{terrestrial}} igneous rocks. Most <b>achondrites</b> are also ancient rocks, and are thought to represent crustal material of differentiated planetesimals. One large family of <b>achondrites</b> (the HED meteorites) may have originated on the parent body of the Vesta Family, although this claim is disputed. Others derive from unidentified asteroids. Two small groups of <b>achondrites</b> are special, as they are younger and do not appear to come from the asteroid belt. One of these groups comes from the Moon, and includes rocks similar to those brought back to Earth by Apollo and Luna programs. The other group is almost certainly from Mars and constitutes the only materials from other planets ever recovered by humans.|$|R
