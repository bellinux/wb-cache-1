A very acute point angle has more web surface area presented to the work at any one time, requiring an aggressive lip angle, where a flat bit is extremely sensitive to small changes in lip angle due to the small surface area supporting the cutting edges.|$|E

500|$|Springsteen and {{the band}} {{returned}} to the U.S. to make their first-ever appearance at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, as the headlining act on June 13, 2009. Playing before festival audiences who were not guaranteed to be fans of his music was largely new to Springsteen, but after a slow start the show captured {{over most of the}} Bonnaroo audience. [...] The following night, Springsteen joined the recently reunited and headlining Phish for three songs, [...] "Mustang Sally", [...] "Bobby Jean", and [...] "Glory Days". [...] Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio said later, [...] "I got to play with Bruce. That's my hero." [...] The Bonnaroo performance of [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] was included on a Fuse TV show of festival highlights, and the performance of [...] "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" [...] included <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>with</b> Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog singing along that was included on a Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien segment. [...] Springsteen subsequently reflected, [...] "We played festivals {{for the very first time}} on this tour, and that was one of the greatest experiences of all of them. That was an eye-opener. When we played Glastonbury [...] you come out and there's like 100,000 kids in their 20s and under. It was fun playing on bills with other bands, and it's something I'd do again in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{felt that the}} album was overly ambitious and that the band's musical {{departure}} may alienate listeners. Chad Grischow of IGN felt that the album's dramatic hooks seem [...] "bloated" [...] at times: [...] "The band does a great of focusing on what they do best, but the album does drown itself <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>with</b> all the overwhelming enormity of it all." [...] Scott Shetler of Slant disliked the [...] "melodramatic" [...] undertones of [...] "I've Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers" [...] and [...] "Golden", writing [...] "they don't handle that style quite as well as Panic! at the Disco". Cory Apar of AllMusic opined that the album's pop direction contradicts the band's lyrical claims of wishing to stick to their roots. He called the album's various styles [...] "hit and miss", yet commented that [...] "Once Infinity on High sinks in, it's indeed a fun record. But for a band that was once so self-assured and able to utilize its talents so compellingly, the album is regrettably haphazard." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian believed that the album was overly sullen, but noted that [...] "They may not be happy, but they haven't forgotten to be catchy." [...] Barry Nicholson of NME found the amount of guest producers to be unnecessary and disliked some of the songs, but admired the album's [...] "infectious" [...] nature.|$|E

500|$|Until the Whole World Hears {{met with}} an overall mixed to {{positive}} response from critics. Several critics regarded the musical aspects of the album as mediocre or sub-par, while others praised the album's lyrical content. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and described it as a [...] "powerful worship experience", but also stated that [...] "some might wonder how a little more variety would sound from such experienced professionals... the band's core sound continues to land in the AC cross hairs". Andrew Greer of CCM Magazine commented that the album [...] "ups the musical ante <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>with</b> some borderline poetic verses and interesting musical riffs", but also commented that [...] "many of these tracks still suffer from the 'Crowns Cliché Syndrome,' using lyrical Christian-ese to produce trite rhymes that seem hard-pressed to energize a ready-to-worship crowd". Robert Ham of Christianity Today criticized the album for using what he deemed as a repetitive musical formula, but also praised the song [...] "Joyful, Joyful", which he compared to Coldplay's song [...] "Viva la Vida", as well as Megan's Garrett's vocals on [...] "Mercy". He concluded that Until the Whole World Hears [...] "feels like a step backward creatively". At Cross Rhythms, Tony Cummings rated the album seven out of ten squares, saying [...] "this album is a little disappointing considering some of the glories that preceeded [...] it." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of TV Squad {{said that}} the lack of the writing staff in the second season was [...] "disappointing". He [...] "love how this show is about NBC and really set at NBC", but was worried about the misuse of guest stars. Robert Canning of IGN said that for the first time, Jenna's storyline was the [...] "most {{entertaining}} of the night". He felt that first half of the episode was [...] "tightly written and very funny", but the second half [...] "waned <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>with</b> less than stellar conclusions to the stories and far less funny bits". Canning said that Jack's storyline was the [...] "most disappointing", and hoped that future guest stars were used properly, rather than for the sake of having a name guest star. George Freitag of BuddyTV said that although Tracy was [...] "not as strong as the previous two episodes", he was [...] "still terrific and the nod to his old SNL skit was a nice touch". He felt {{that the lack of}} focus on the personal life of Liz seemed to give the series [...] "a lack of focus". Freitag hoped that her private issues would be further explored, as [...] "her approachable yet successful persona {{was one of the main}} draws to the series in the first place". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that the episode [...] "fell a bit flat", and that the season lacked the other TGSers, Lonny, Frank, Twofer and [...] "director guy". He did not enjoy Jack's storyline, but said that Jenna's storyline [...] "ultimately won a thumbs-up from me for her getting turned on by Kenneth's rudeness".|$|E
