30|$|Another {{approach}} for acoustic cloaking inspired from carpet cloaking suggested by Li and Pendry in electromagnetic field [73]. With this concept, the first experimental 2 D <b>acoustic</b> <b>carpet</b> cloaking was demonstrated by Popa et al. [74]. Subsequently, a 3 D carpet cloaking {{which is an}} extension of the 2 D one was demonstrated by Zigoneanu et al. [75]. The setups of 2 D and 3 D carpet cloaking are made of arrays of the perforated plastic plates with sub-wavelength holes that allow the penetration of airborne sounds. Metamaterials with highly anisotropic mass density are required for this approach so that it can uncover high-loss scattering on the perforated plastic plates. For example, a 3 D omnidirectional <b>acoustic</b> <b>carpet</b> cloaking was designed with a pyramid-shaped structure (Fig.  10 d). The scheme of experimental setup is illustrated in Fig.  10 e and the results of instantaneous scattered pressure field are shown in Fig.  10 f. Besides the cloaking devices based on transformation acoustics, acoustic cloaking can also be realized by using scattering cancellation method to eliminate the scattered acoustic field between background and system [76 – 82].|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{metasurface}} (AMS) is a {{good candidate}} to manipulate acoustic waves due to special acoustic performs that cannot be realized by traditional materials. In this paper, we design the AMS by using circular-holed cubic arrays. The advantages of our AMS are easy assemble, subwavelength thickness, and low energy loss for manipulating acoustic waves. According to the generalized Snell’s law, acoustic waves can be manipulated arbitrarily by using AMS with different phase gradients. By selecting suitable hole diameter of circular-holed cube (CHC), some interesting phenomena are demonstrated by our simulations based on finite element method, such as the conversion of incoming waves into surface waves, anomalous reflections (including negative reflection), acoustic focusing lens, and <b>acoustic</b> <b>carpet</b> cloak. Our results can provide a simple approach to design AMSes and use them in wavefront manipulation and manufacturing of acoustic devices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} recent propagation {{studies conducted}} at Gulfstream Aerospace for acoustic signatures propagated from quiet supersonic jets in steady, level flight. Data {{presented in this}} paper includes how atmospheric variability influences the propagation of acoustic signatures whose shaping features were achieved due to the Gulfstream Quiet SpikeTM. Two different vehicle configurations were propagated through a wide variety of non-standard atmospheric conditions. Results from that study show that Gulfstream shaped signatures exhibit seasonal and geographic variations in loudness levels between 4 to 10 dB with most of the loudness variation being quieter than the level for the standard atmosphere. Additionally, this paper provides estimates for the number of these quiet acoustic signatures per day that might occur on the continental U. S. if supersonic business jets were permitted to operate over populated areas. Estimates for the number of occurrences show that most of the continental United States would be exposed to two or less acoustic signatures per day from the primary <b>acoustic</b> <b>carpet.</b> I...|$|E
50|$|An {{empty room}} with cement floor and ceiling, cinderblock walls, and no {{flammable}} materials would have approximately zero fire loading; any fire entering such a room from elsewhere will find nothing to feed on. However, nearly anything {{that makes a}} room useful (such as furniture, electrical appliances, or computer equipment), or attractive (such as wood panelling, <b>acoustic</b> tile, <b>carpeting,</b> curtains, or wall decorations), will increase the fire loading. Some usages inherently carry high fire loading as a side effect (an art gallery and studio, for example, is likely to contain large amounts of canvas, paints, solvents, and wooden framing). Buildings under construction or renovation tend to carry high fire loads {{in the form of}} construction materials, solvents, and fuel for generators.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, the Foundation began is [...] "Friends of the Theater" [...] {{campaign}}. {{the campaign}} {{set out to}} raise $50,000, one-quarter of the $200,000 {{needed to make a}} theatre renovation requested by the school. The campaign raised $72,700 by mid-March 2008. The $282,000 renovation was completed to the theater by the end of March 2009. The renovations included wider seats, wall-to-wall <b>carpeting,</b> <b>acoustic</b> wall treatments and handicapped-accessible seating. The foundation also assists the school by providing scholarships for students. A recent scholarship drive between local business and the foundation raised $44,000 for local area high school students.|$|R
40|$|Hospitals have complex soundscapes {{that create}} {{challenges}} to patient care. Extraneous noise and high reverberation rates impair speech intelligibility, {{which leads to}} raised voices. In an unintended spiral, the increasing noise may result in diminished speech privacy, as people speak loudly {{to be heard over}} the din. The products available to improve hospital soundscapes include construction materials that absorb sound (<b>acoustic</b> ceiling tiles, <b>carpet,</b> wall insulation) and reduce reverberation rates. Enhanced privacy curtains are now available and offer potential for a relatively simple way to improve speech privacy and speech intelligibility by absorbing sound at the hospital patient′s bedside. Acoustic assessments were performed over 2 days on two nursing units with a similar design in the same hospital. One unit was built with the 1970 s′ standard hospital construction and the other was newly refurbished (2013) with sound-absorbing features. In addition, we determined the effect of an enhanced privacy curtain versus standard privacy curtains using acoustic measures of speech privacy and speech intelligibility indexes. Privacy curtains provided auditory protection for the patients. In general, that protection was increased by the use of enhanced privacy curtains. On an average, the enhanced curtain improved sound absorption from 20 % to 30 %; however, there was considerable variability, depending on the configuration of the rooms tested. Enhanced privacy curtains provide measureable improvement to the acoustics of patient rooms but cannot overcome larger acoustic design issues. To shorten reverberation time, additional absorption, and compact and more fragmented nursing unit floor plate shapes should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Efficacy of {{chlorine}} dioxide (CD) gas generated by two distinct generation systems, Sabre (wet system with gas generated in water) and ClorDiSys (dry system with gas generated in air), was evaluated for inactivation of Bacillus anthracis spores on six building interior surfaces. The six building materials included <b>carpet,</b> <b>acoustic</b> ceiling tile, unpainted cinder block, painted I-beam steel, painted wallboard, and unpainted pinewood. There was {{no statistically significant}} difference in the data due to the CD generation technology at a 95 % confidence level. Note that a common method of CD gas measurement was used for both wet and dry CD generation types. Doses generated by combinations of different concentrations of CD gas (500, 1, 000, 1, 500, or 3, 000 parts per million of volume [ppmv]) and exposure times (ranging between 0. 5 and 12 h) were used to evaluate the relative role of fumigant exposure period and total dose in the decontamination of building surfaces. The results showed that the time required to achieve at least a 6 -log reduction in viable spores is clearly a function of the material type on which the spores are inoculated. The wood and cinder block coupons required a longer exposure time to achieve a 6 -log reduction. The only material showing a clear statistical difference in rate of decay of viable spores as a function of concentration was cinder block. For all other materials, the profile of spore kill (i. e., change in number of viable spores with exposure time) was not dependent upon fumigant concentration (500 to 3, 000 ppmv). The CD dose required for complete spore kill on biological indicators (typically, 1 E 6 spores of Bacillus atrophaeus on stainless steel) was significantly less than that required for decontamination of most of the building materials tested...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research project is to design, develop and validate an innovative vehicle floor carpet system with improved acoustic performance, and thus reduce noise levels inside the vehicle cabins. The proposed solutions are expected to improve vehicle floor carpet product in areas of acoustic performance, cost, weight and waste reduction, to be environmentally friendly and sustainable in manufacturing. The following are main research outcomes of the project. • Acoustically improved vehicle floor carpet with higher sound transmission loss and in-cabin sound absorption coefficient, compared to current production carpet designs. • Vehicle floor carpet designs that introduce minimum weight and cost penalty for the acoustic performance improvement obtained. • Material database, i. e. measured acoustic parameters for mathematical modelling, of different vehicle carpet layers. • Virtual modelling and validation method for design evaluation at component and vehicle levels. • In-situ vehicle on-road validation test methods for carpet designs • Optimization methods for further improving the design The following are identified as recommendations for future design work in improving vehicle <b>carpet</b> <b>acoustics.</b> • Introducing air-gaps {{in the range of}} 10 mm in between the heavy layers by use of a honey-comb structure improves the transmission loss by up to 20 dB in the frequency range of 1 kHz – 2 kHz, and up to 10 dB in the frequency range of 500 Hz – 1 kHz, and achieves the best sound transmission loss in these frequency ranges. • The introduction of honey-comb structure as an air-gap structure does not add any over-head in terms of weight or thickness, compared to foam, nor affects the total absorption of the carpet system. • Special tuned absorber layers like the perforated facing foam Helmholtz resonator and the corrugated foil faced foam membrane absorbers are excellent in extending the noise reduction frequency ranges to specific low frequency ranges of interest...|$|R
