500|$|Trespass to land {{involves}} the [...] "unjustifiable interference with land {{which is in}} the immediate and exclusive possession of another"; it is both a tort and, in certain circumstances, a crime under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim, and is instead actionable per se. While most trespasses to land are intentional, the courts have decided that it could also be committed negligently. <b>Accidental</b> <b>trespass</b> also incurs liability.|$|E
500|$|In English law, {{trespass}} to land {{involves the}} [...] "unjustifiable interference with land {{which is in the}} immediate and exclusive possession of another". It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim, and is instead actionable per se. While most trespasses to land are intentional, in League Against Cruel Sports v Scott, the courts decided that it could also be committed negligently. <b>Accidental</b> <b>trespass</b> also incurs liability, with an exception for entering land adjoining a road unintentionally (such as in a car accident), as in River Wear Commissioners v Adamson. Although previously a pure tort, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 created some circumstances in which {{trespass to land}} can also be a crime.|$|E
50|$|Section 213 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows anyone (not only citizens) {{witnessing}} {{any crime}} in progress {{to make an}} arrest. This is called genkouhan (現行犯, meaning in flagrante delicto). Most criminals who attempt to flee, or refuse to identify themselves, can be held until police arrive. However, making a citizen's arrest to prevent petty crime (e.g. illegal assembly, accidental injury, <b>accidental</b> <b>trespass,</b> defamation of character, leaving a parking lot without paying) is false imprisonment per Section 220 of the Criminal Code.|$|E
50|$|The {{pastoral}} {{structure of}} the festival is {{carried out by the}} shepherd himself. After the sheep pen had been decorated with green branches and a wreath draped on the gate, the remainder of the ceremony took place in sequence. At the first sign of daylight, the shepherd would purify the sheep: by sweeping the pen and then constructing a bonfire of straw, olive branches, laurel, and sulfur. The noises produced by this burning combination were interpreted as a beneficial omen. The shepherd would jump through this flame, dragging his sheep along with him. Offerings of millet, cakes, and milk were then presented before Pales, marking the second segment of the ceremony. After these offerings, the shepherd would wet his hands with dew, face the east, and repeat a prayer four times. Such prayers requested Pales’s assistance in freeing the shepherd and the flock from evils brought about by <b>accidental</b> wrongdoings (e.g. <b>trespassing</b> on sacred grounds and removing water from a sacred water source). The final portion of the rural festival made use of the beverage burranica, a combination of milk and sapa (boiled wine). After consumption of this beverage, the shepherd would leap through the fire three times, bringing an end to the ceremony.|$|R
