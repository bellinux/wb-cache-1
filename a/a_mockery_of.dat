5|$|The Virgin release {{had been}} timed to {{coincide}} with the height of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee celebrations. By Jubilee weekend, {{a week and a half}} after the record's release, it had sold more than 150,000 copies—a massive success. On 7 June, McLaren and the record label arranged to charter a private boat and have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing down the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event, <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the Queen's river procession planned for two days later, ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the gangplanks at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Westwood, and many of the band's entourage were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Phan was {{transferred}} to the Huế court {{as a member of the}} censorate, a watchdog body that monitored the work of the mandarinate. He earned the ire of many of his colleagues, but the trust of the emperor, by revealing that the vast majority of the court mandarins were making <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice. Tự Đức later dispatched Phan on an inspection trip to northern Vietnam. His report led to the ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent, including the viceroy of the northern region. He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct. Phan openly criticised Tôn Thất Thuyết, the foremost mandarin of the court, believing him to be rash and dishonest. Aside from his work in rooting out corruption, Phan also compiled a historical geography of Vietnam, which was published in 1883.|$|E
5|$|Camping for {{the night}} on a riverbank, Andrei and Foma are {{collecting}} firewood for their group when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods. Going to investigate he encounters {{a large group of}} naked pagans, who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer. Andrei is intrigued and excited by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love, is tied to the crossbeam of a hut in <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> Jesus' crucifixion and is threatened with drowning in the morning. A woman named Marfa (Nelly Snegina), dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei. After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her coat, kisses Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away, and is lost in the dense woods, scratching his face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, including Daniil, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa. Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei’s boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.|$|E

5|$|She then {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Michelle McCool, later called LayCool. They began a feud with Mickie James in October, making <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> her weight and vowing to make her leave SmackDown. At the Survivor Series, McCool's team lost to James' team. At , Layla interfered in the WWE Women's Championship match between McCool and James by helping McCool retain the title. In January 2010, at Royal Rumble, Layla {{came out in a}} fatsuit, mocking James prior to the title match between McCool and James; however, the mockery backfired, as James attacked Layla and used that as a distraction to quickly defeat McCool to win the title. On the 12 February episode of SmackDown, Layla and McCool defeated James in a handicap match made by Official SmackDown Consultant Vickie Guerrero, who had been accidentally humiliated by James backstage. Guerrero then began managing LayCool, accompanying them to the ring and regularly interfering in their matches. At the Elimination Chamber, Layla and McCool defeated Raw's Gail Kim and Maryse in an inter-brand tag team match. At WrestleMania XXVI, Layla was on the winning team in an inter-brand tag team match.|$|E
25|$|In {{his letter}} of resignation, Ritter said the Security Council's {{reaction}} to Iraq's decision earlier that month to suspend co-operation with the inspection team made <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the disarmament work. Ritter later said, in an interview, that he resigned from {{his role as}} a United Nations weapons inspector over inconsistencies between United Nations Security Council Resolution 1154 and how it was implemented.|$|E
25|$|In the post-race interviews, the Ferrari drivers {{changed their}} {{story of what}} had {{happened}} at the finish with each telling. Other teams insisted that Ferrari had made <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the sport again, while some said Schumacher had simply bungled an improvised formation finish. Earlier in the year Barrichello had been ordered to let Schumacher past on the final lap so he could win the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. So many saw this result as Schumacher returning the favour.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, 25 {{military}} personnel, {{including several}} generals and colonels, and one civilian were charged {{for the murders}} of Benigno Aquino Jr. and Rolando Galman. President Marcos relieved Ver as AFP Chief and appointed his second cousin, General Fidel V. Ramos as acting AFP Chief. The accused were tried by the Sandiganbayan (special court). After a brief trial, the Sandiganbayan acquitted all the accused on December 2, 1985. Immediately after the decision, Marcos re-instated Ver. The Sandiganbayan ruling and the reinstatement of Ver were denounced as <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> justice.|$|E
25|$|Enlightenment attitudes after 1700 made <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> {{beliefs in}} witches. The Witchcraft Act of 1735 marked a {{complete}} reversal in attitudes. Penalties {{for the practice}} of witchcraft as traditionally constituted, which by that time was considered by many influential figures to be an impossible crime, were replaced by penalties for the pretence of witchcraft. A person who claimed to have the power to call up spirits, or foretell the future, or cast spells, or discover the whereabouts of stolen goods, was to be punished as a vagrant and a con artist, subject to fines and imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|On {{their way}} through the Dravanian Forelands, they vanquish Ravana, the primal of the insectoid Gnath beast tribe. Emboldened by the Ascians, the Gnath had been {{encroaching}} on dragon territory to fuel their primal. Hraesvelgr's daughter Vidofnir allows them up the Sohm Al peak as thanks. Upon reaching the summit of the Churning Mists, they encounter an idiosyncratic tribe of moogles who claim the patronage of Hraesvelgr. In exchange for completing dozens of menial tasks, the moogles agree to call for the great wyrm. At their meeting, Ysayle invokes the name of Hraesvelgr's beloved Shiva, but he rebukes her, calling the primal <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> Shiva's memory.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1977 season, Finley {{attempted}} to trade Blue to the Reds for a player of lesser stature and cash, but Kuhn vetoed the deal, claiming that it was tantamount to a fire sale similar to the sales he voided a year earlier. He also claimed that adding Blue to the Reds' already formidable pitching staff would make <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the National League West race. Later, the Commissioner approved a trade of relief pitcher Doug Bair to the Reds in a deal that resembled a true trade. At the same time, Blue was traded across the bay to the San Francisco Giants in a multi-player trade that likewise received the Commissioner's blessing.|$|E
25|$|Gloucestershire bowlers Steve Kirby, Jon Lewis and Malinga Bandara {{threatened}} to make <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> Shaun Udal's {{decision to have}} a bat at Bristol, as Hampshire fell to 81 for 7, with five batsmen out for single-figures. However, a 257-run partnership - a Hampshire record for the eighth wicket - between Nic Pothas and Andy Bichel turned the match around, as Lewis was carted for 112 runs in his 20 overs, despite five of them being maiden overs. Hampshire finished their innings on 385 all out, after Pothas had made 139 and Bichel 138, and Gloucestershire struggled initially with the bat, losing their first two wickets for 25 runs (admittedly with Kirby filling the role of nightwatchman).|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match against Ireland at R.Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Watson opened the bowling and took 3–26 (the wickets of opener-captain William Porterfield, keeper-batsman Niall O'Brien and all-rounder Kevin O'Brien); he then scored 51 from 30 balls {{to help his}} side win the match in 15.1 overs. He was {{subsequently}} named as Man of the Match. In the next match against the West Indies he again opened the bowling and batting, taking 2–29 from 4 overs (the wickets of Chris Gayle & Kieron Pollard). He then scored 41 not out from 24 balls to win the Man of the Match award as his side won by 17 runs (by the Duckworth-Lewis method). Against India, he was used as second change bowler and took 3–34. It was he who had changed the game by taking the wickets of Yuvraj Singh and opener Irfan Pathan in the 11th over. He also dismissed Suresh Raina in the last over. He followed it up with 72 from 42 balls (7 sixes and 2 fours) making <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the target 141. Against South Africa he took 2–29 (the wickets of Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers), following it up with 70 from 47 balls to win his fourth consecutive Man of the Match award. At {{the completion of the}} group stages and Super Eight stages, Watson had the most runs, wickets and sixes. His dominance with both bat and ball made him the unanimous choice of the experts to be named Player of the Tournament.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "White Paternoster" [...] {{was used}} by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807–82) as <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the mass by Lucifer, {{described}} as the [...] "Black Paternoster" [...] in his narrative poem The Golden Legend (1851). It was also {{the title of a}} short story by Theodore Francis Powys (1875–1953) published in 1930. A four-part choir setting of the Black Paternoster text was produced by Gustav Holst (1874–1934) in early 20th-Century Britain, while contemporary countryman Henry Walford Davies (1869–1941) composed an equivalent setting of the White Paternoster.|$|E
500|$|Article 15(1) of the Constitution {{lays down}} the general {{principle}} guaranteeing {{the freedom of}} religion, while Article 15(4) allows {{an exception to the}} general principle if any religious act is contrary to any general law relating to public order, health or morality. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, Chief Justice Yong stated that acts flowing from religious beliefs must [...] "conform" [...] to general legislation. This implies that legislation derogating from rights is presumptively constitutional, and Article 15(4) restrictions take precedence over fundamental liberties. Thio has criticized this, stating that [...] "exceptions swallowing up general principles can make <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> any constitutional liberty".|$|E
50|$|The Gytrash's {{emergence}} as Rochester's innocuous dog Pilot {{has been interpreted}} as <b>a</b> subtle <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the mysteriousness and romanticism that surrounds his character and clouds Jane's perception.

Backstage, Tracy shows Liz his gun, which she takes away from him. She fires it by {{accident}} and ends up shooting Steven in the buttocks. He thinks she shot him because he was going through her purse and calls her a racist. Following this, Ridikolous comes in and says that Jack has made <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> the award, adding: [...] "Wait until I tell Tupac about this!".

500|$|For her live performances, {{which she}} calls dinner theatre {{because of her}} {{practice}} of throwing tea and tea-time snacks offstage, Autumn makes use of burlesque—"a show that was mainly using humour and sexuality to make <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> things {{that were going on}} socially and politically"—to counterbalance the morbid topics such as abuse and self-mutilation. She incorporates handmade costumes, fire tricks, theatrics, and a female backing band, The Bloody Crumpets: Veronica Varlow, Jill Evyn (Moth), and formerly The Blessed Contessa, Lady Aprella, Little Lucina, Lady Joo Hee, Captain Vecona, Little Miss Sugarless, Mistress Jacinda, and the model Ulorin Vex. Another crumpet, Captain Maggot, has taken a leave. Her wish for the live shows is to be an [...] "anti-repression statement" [...] and empowerment.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that {{the names of}} the scriptores themselves are also a form of literary playfulness, not only mocking both legitimate authors and historians, but also the narrative itself. The names Trebellius Pollio and Flavius Vopiscus are sourced in various ways from Cicero's writings, as is the name Capitolinus. Further, the word vopiscus is a rare Latin term, referring to a twin who survives, while its sibling died in utero; this has been interpreted to refer to [...] "Flavius Vopiscus" [...] as being the final one to survive from the six authors of the History. Vulcacius is believed to be <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> Volcatius Sedigitus, who was a historical literary critic with some association with humor. The meanings behind the other two scriptores (Spartianus and Lampridius) have eluded interpretation.|$|E
