Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Goebel was {{a friend}} of Gerald R. Ford's mother and {{stepfather}} in Grand Rapids. Goebel {{played an important role in}} guiding Ford to the University of Michigan.

5|$|Pierce {{was finally}} {{allowed to return}} to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's welcome in his home state and issued his {{resignation}} from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long follow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz, but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> military commander.|$|E

5|$|Precisely because Prince Yelü Bei {{exemplified}} both Chinese and Khitan values, Empress Shulü Ping {{objected to}} Bei assuming {{the role of}} Emperor. The Empress believed that Bei's openness to Chinese culture detracted from his leadership <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Khitan, and she instead favored Emperor Taizu's more traditionalist second son, Yelü Deguang. Deguang enjoyed not only {{the support of his}} mother, but also of the Khitan nobility. Realizing that he could not assume the throne, {{and that it would be}} dangerous to try, Bei campaigned in favor of allowing his younger brother to assume the throne, and by the end of 927, formally stated to his mother that Deguang's qualifications were superior to his own, functionally ending his ability to challenge Deguang's ascension to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Singers {{and players}} admired Britten's conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough {{to offer him}} the musical {{directorship}} of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952. Britten declined; he was not confident of his <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conductor and was reluctant to {{spend too much time}} performing rather than composing. As a conductor, Britten's repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust; Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Introduction and Allegro; Holst's Egdon Heath and short pieces by Percy Grainger.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} also of {{historical}} importance {{because of the}} Welsh tactics employed. In the 1886 Home Nations Championship Wales had trialled the four three-quarter system, wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine, and instead employ an extra centre three-quarter. The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould, whose formidable <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward. With Gould working in the West Indies, Wales again tried the four three-quarter system against the Natives, and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system. Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three-quarter style of play.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{novel was}} based on events from the childhood of the author's son, screenwriter David Paterson. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed {{in part because of}} his <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> playwright. Production began in February 2006, and the film was finished by November. Principal photography was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took several months. This was Michael Chapman's last film as cinematographer before his retirement.|$|E
5|$|When {{profiling}} Kane in February 2013, Talksport {{said that}} he was best as a second striker, despite also having <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> centre forward or in a wide position. They wrote that he preferred to place his shots, although he could also score from distance. The report also noted that he had good pace, but was weak in the air and had not scored on his loan at Norwich. Initially a back-up to £26million Spanish import Roberto Soldado and frequently loaned out, Kane was eventually made Tottenham's starting forward by manager Mauricio Pochettino.|$|E
5|$|After {{his army}} crossed the Euphrates, {{following}} a route opened up by Lucullus {{over a hundred}} years before, he received envoys from Tiridates and Vologases. At the approach of such a large force, and aware of Corbulo's <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> general, the two Arsacids were anxious to negotiate. Indeed, Corbulo, no doubt on instructions from Nero, reiterated the old Roman position: if Tiridates would accept his crown from Rome, then renewed war could be averted. Tiridates readily agreed to negotiations, and Rhandeia, the scene of last year's Roman defeat, was agreed upon as a meeting place. To the Armenians, this place was intended as a reminder of their strength, while Corbulo agreed to it because there he hoped to expunge the earlier disgrace, by peace or war. Once there, Corbulo put Paetus' son, who served under him as a legate, in charge of a party that was to gather the remains of the Roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial. On the agreed day, both Tiridates and Corbulo, each accompanied by 20 horsemen, met between the two camps. Tiridates agreed to travel to Rome and seek confirmation of his crown from Nero. In sign of this agreement, a few days later, both armies put on a display, arrayed in full parade gear. Tiridates approached the Roman camp, where a statue of the Emperor Nero had been erected upon a raised platform, and placed his royal diadem at its feet in submission.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Percy Frank Chapman (3 September 1900 – 16 September 1961), usually {{known as}} Percy Chapman, was an English {{first-class}} cricketer who captained England between 1926 and 1931. A left-handed batsman, he played 26 Test matches for England, captaining the side in 17 of those games. Chapman was appointed captain for the final, decisive Test of the 1926 series against Australia; under his captaincy, England defeated Australia {{to win the}} Ashes {{for the first time}} since 1912. Holding amateur status, Chapman played Minor Counties cricket for Berkshire and first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Kent. Never a reliable batsman, Chapman nevertheless had a respectable batting record. He could score runs very quickly and was popular with spectators. As a fielder, contemporaries rated him extremely highly. Although opinions were divided on his tactical <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> captain, most critics accepted he was an inspirational leader.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge visited Kentucky in May 1843. His {{efforts to}} mediate between {{his mother and}} the Breckinridges {{extended}} his visit and after he contracted influenza, he decided to remain for the summer rather than returning to Iowa's colder climate. While at home, he met Bullock's cousin, Mary Cyrene Burch, and by September, they were engaged. In October, Breckinridge went to Iowa to close out his business, then returned to Kentucky and formed a law partnership with Samuel Bullock, Thomas's cousin. He married on December 12, 1843, and settled in Georgetown, Kentucky. The couple had six children – Joseph Cabell (b. 1844), Clifton Rodes (b. 1846; later a Congressman from Arkansas), Frances (b. 1848), John Milton (b. 1849), John Witherspoon (b. 1850) and Mary Desha (b. 1854). Gaining confidence in his <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lawyer, Breckinridge moved his family back to Lexington in 1845 and formed a partnership with future U.S. Senator James B. Beck.|$|E
5|$|Christy is {{the oldest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were {{inherited}} from her maternal grandmother, making her a carrier of the genes determining magical <b>ability.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects {{through the use of}} a crystal pendant, and communicate with the dead. She also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to Buffy the Vampire Slayer character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E
