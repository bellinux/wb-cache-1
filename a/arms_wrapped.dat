As a glide ended, the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through {{an opening in the}} wing and land on his feet with his <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.|$|E
25|$|Kelvin's clothed {{body was}} found by a {{geologist}} on 24 July 1983. Little effort was put into concealing the body; Kelvin was found wearing the same Channel 9 shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers which he wore {{on the day of}} his abduction, together with the dog collar fitted around his neck. The {{body was found}} placed in the fetal position, with his legs bent towards his chest and his head forwards and his <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> around his legs. This made police suspect that Kelvin had been dumped by a single person, most likely after nightfall in order to avoid detection.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} water around weirs can often appear {{relatively}} calm, {{they can be}} extremely dangerous places to boat, swim, or wade, as the circulation patterns on the downstream side—typically called a hydraulic jump— can submerge a person indefinitely. This phenomenon is so well known to canoeists, kayakers, and others who spend time on rivers that they even have a rueful name for weirs: [...] "drowning machines". [...] If caught in this situation, the Ohio DNR recommends that a victim should [...] "tuck the chin down, draw the knees up to the chest with <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> around them. Hopefully, conditions will be such that the current will push the victim along {{the bed of the}} river until swept beyond the boil line and released by the hydraulic." [...] The Pennsylvania State Police also recommends to [...] "curl up, dive to the bottom, and swim or crawl downstream". [...] As the hydraulic entrains air, the buoyancy of the water between the dam and boil line will be reduced by upwards of 30%, and if a victim is unable to float, escape {{at the base of the}} dam may be the only option for survival.|$|E

2500|$|There is also, however, a {{cultural}} dimension to anti-Americanism among religious and conservative {{groups in the}} Middle East. It may have its origins with Sayyid Qutb. Qutb, an Egyptian who was the leading intellectual of the Muslim Brotherhood, studied in Greeley, Colorado from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, The America I Have Seen (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts. Wrote Qutb, [...] "They danced to the tunes of the gramophone, and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire..." [...] He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women: [...] "The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it". He was particularly disturbed by jazz, which he called the American's preferred music, and which [...] "was created by Negroes to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires ..." [...] Qutb's writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as {{a cultural}} temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals, especially {{with respect to the}} relations between the sexes.|$|E

He began with a rasping chuckle that gradually formed itself into words.|$|E
60|$|But here Nature was omnipotent.

Yet, even in his prostration, Catron made one more despairing appeal for mental sympathy from his host.|$|E

6000|$|Halbert Glendinning briefly {{told the}} story. The Earl rode {{forward to the}} place where the body of Julian Avenel lay, with his unhappy companion's <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> around him like the trunk of an uprooted oak borne down by the tempest with all its ivy garlands. Both were cold dead. Murray was touched in an unwonted degree, remembering, perhaps, his own birth.

6000|$|At [...] "nine" [...] {{the referee}} gave Rivera a sharp thrust back. It was unfair, but it enabled Danny to rise, the smile {{back on his}} lips. Doubled partly over, with <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> about face and abdomen, he cleverly {{stumbled}} into a clinch. By all {{the rules of the}} game the referee should have broken it, but he did not, and Danny clung on like a surf-battered barnacle and moment by moment recuperated. The last minute of the round was going fast. If he could live to the end, he would have a full minute in his corner to revive. And live to the end he did, smiling through all desperateness and extremity.|$|E
60|$|The {{operation}} {{was done at}} home. A capable, fair-complexioned nurse took possession of us; and my study, because it has the best light, was transfigured into an admirable operating-room. All its furnishings were sent away, every cloth and curtain, and the walls and floor were covered with white sterilized sheets. The high little mechanical table they erected before the window seemed to me like an altar on which I had to offer up my son. There were basins of disinfectants and towels conveniently about, the operator came, took out his array of scalpels and forceps and little sponges from the black bag he carried, put them ready for his hand, and then covered them from your sight with a white cloth, and I brought you down in my <b>arms,</b> <b>wrapped</b> in a blanket, from your bedroom to the anæsthetist. You were beautifully trustful and submissive and unafraid. I stood by you until the chloroform had done its work, and then left you there, lest my presence should in the slightest degree embarrass the surgeon. The anæsthetic had taken all the color out of your face, and you looked pinched and shrunken and greenish and very small and pitiful. I went into the drawing-room and stood there with your mother and made conversation. I cannot recall what we said, I think {{it was about the}} moorland to which we were going for your convalescence. Indeed, we were but the ghosts of ourselves; all our substance seemed listening, listening to the little sounds that came to us from the study.|$|E

6000|$|Only Youth could rise, and Sandel rose. At {{the fourth}} second {{he rolled over}} {{on his face and}} groped blindly for the ropes.

[...] Sandel stood upright, in proper {{stalling}} position, his left <b>arm</b> <b>wrapped</b> about his face, his right wrapped about his stomach.

6000|$|... 'He {{continued}} {{all night}} under <b>arms,</b> <b>wrapped</b> {{up in his}} cloak, and generally sheltered under a rick of barley which {{happened to be in}} the field. About three in the morning he called his domestic servants to him, of which there were four in waiting. He dismissed three of them with most affectionate Christian advice, and such solemn charges relating to the performance of their duty, and the care of their souls, as seemed plainly to intimate that he apprehended it was at least very probable he was taking his last farewell of them. There is great reason to believe that he spent the little remainder of the time, which could not be much above an hour, in those devout exercises of soul which had been so long habitual to him, and to which so many circumstances did then concur to call him. The army was alarmed by break of day by the noise of the rebels' approach, and the attack was made before sunrise, yet when it was light enough to discern what passed. As soon as the enemy came within gun-shot they made a furious fire; and it is said that the dragoons which constituted the left wing immediately fled. The Colonel at the beginning of the onset, which in the whole lasted but a few minutes, received a wound by a bullet in his left breast, which made him give a sudden spring in his saddle; upon which his servant, who led the horse, would have persuaded him to retreat, but he said it was only a wound in the flesh, and fought on, though he presently after received a shot in his right thigh. In the mean time, it was discerned that some of the enemy fell by him, and particularly one man who had made him a treacherous visit but a few days before, with great professions of zeal for the present establishment.|$|E
