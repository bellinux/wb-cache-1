5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> {{attempt at}} radio {{communication}} with a fisherman on Earth who speaks only Eskimo–Aleut, Stone resigns herself to being stranded and shuts down the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide. As {{she begins to}} lose consciousness, Kowalski enters the capsule. Scolding her for giving up, he tells her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing jets to propel the capsule toward Tiangong. Stone then realizes that Kowalski's reappearance was a hallucination, but has nonetheless given her the strength of will to continue. She restores the flow of oxygen and uses the landing jets to navigate toward Tiangong on momentum.|$|E
5|$|The seven-minute long video depicts Beyoncé {{playing a}} beauty pageant contest {{representing}} Third Ward, Houston, {{the area in}} which she grew up. It opens with the sound of <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> piano and shots of Beyoncé sporting short hair, looking at herself in the mirror. It transitions to a segment of her fellow contestants preparing for the pageant backstage, combing their hair, fitting their dresses and analyzing their bodies; one scene during the preparations shows Beyoncé arguing with another contestant over a hair dryer. Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict her sitting on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E
5|$|The viewers' {{confused}} {{reaction to}} their story {{based on the}} first half, disappointed and frustrated Sato and Ibira. Sato explained the first two episodes were to capture the viewers' attention, and remaining episodes would reveal greater details of the story. Mania complained this franchising tactic is a poor excuse for initial episodes lacking substance. They said although the later half answered much of the questions raised in the first, it created unanswered questions of its own. IGN and DVD Talk felt the story was darker and flowed better in the later half than the first, but IGN felt the revelation of details came {{too late in the}} show. DVD Verdict felt the story was pointless. Despite the protagonist reaffirming himself as a protector of the city, his showdown with the antagonist reduced most of Shinjuku to ruins. Reviewers found if they stripped the plot to its basics, it is a shallow good-versus-evil story made complex by its presentation in the first half. They, however, appreciated the surprising deaths of certain characters whose sacrifice in vain rendered <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> emotion at that point of story.|$|E

25|$|General Felix Barriaux - the {{dictator}} {{of the country}} who orders the crucifixion. For a dictator, he is <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> and witty character who holds some sympathy for the audience despite his obsession with money and power.

25|$|The {{children}} return home, {{where they}} meet Arthur Spiderwick, {{who had been}} living with the elves and so had not aged.

25|$|King Dutugemunu did {{not live}} to see his beloved Ruwanweliseya completed, dying before the plaster work was finished.

There he also encounters his old colleague Theraputtbhya, now a monk. After some discussion of the mortality of men, the aged monarch passes away and is immediately reborn in the heavenly realm of Tusita.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{acted in}} West Coast stage {{companies}} before joining Columbia Pictures in 1939. His stage name {{came from his}} father's hometown of Glenford, Alberta. His first major movie part was in the 1939 film, Heaven with a Barbed Wire Fence. Top Hollywood director John Cromwell was impressed enough with his work to borrow him from Columbia for the independently produced drama, So Ends Our Night (1941), where Ford delivered <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> portrayal of a 19-year-old German exile on the run in Nazi-occupied Europe.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} moving {{artifacts}} at the Elgin Military Museum is the Vimy Poppy, picked by a soldier from St. Thomas on that famous Ridge a few short weeks after that momentous battle began on April 9, 1917 in memory of his fallen comrades. One of these comrades was Lance Corporal Ellis Sifton who won the Victoria Cross that day but lost his life. The tiny box in which his effects were posted to his parents is part of <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> display in his honour.|$|E
25|$|It is {{traditional}} in productions of Peter Pan for Mr. Darling (the children's father) and Captain Hook {{to be played}} (or voiced) by the same actor. Although this was originally done simply to make full use of the actor (the characters appear in different sections of the story) with no thematic intent, some critics have perceived a similarity between the two characters as central figures {{in the lives of}} the children. It also brings <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> juxtaposition between Mr. Darling's harmless bluster and Captain Hook's pompous vanity.|$|E
25|$|The {{final test}} of the series was <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> and {{emotional}} affair – {{it was the first}} Test match to take place at the Galle stadium since it had been destroyed by the tsunami three years prior. The teams of ground staff had worked tirelessly on getting the stadium ready for the match, and heavy rainfall a few days before did not stop them achieving this memorable feat. Following the match, both the teams and all the officials were quick to congratulate them on their fantastic work that allowed the match to go ahead.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Sakura ~Hanagasumi~' is best {{described}} as an adult contemporary ballad with <b>a</b> more <b>poignant</b> mood than 'Sakurairo Maukoro.'

60|$|The Duchess glanced {{towards her}} protégé, who {{had risen to}} his feet and stood facing his newly arrived host. There was <b>a</b> moment's <b>poignant</b> silence. The two men, for some reason or other, seemed to regard each other with no common interest.|$|R

25|$|The same museum houses another {{triptych}} by {{the same}} painter: The Haneton Triptych. This triptych was commissioned by Philippe Haneton, first secretary in the Secret Counsel of Charles V. The middle panel depicts <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> pietà against an archaic golden background, painted in a very personal style with influences of the Flemish Primitives and Albrecht Dürer. Bernard van Orley was, together with Jan Gossaert, {{among the first to}} introduce strong musculature in Flemish paintings. The left panel shows Philippe Haneton and his sons, and the right panel his wife and her daughters.|$|E
25|$|His {{depiction}} of suburban late Victorian {{culture in the}} novel was an accurate reflection of his own experiences {{at the time of}} writing. In the late 19th Century the British Empire was the predominant colonial and naval power on the globe, making its domestic heart <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> and terrifying starting point for an invasion by Martians with their own imperialist agenda. He also drew upon a common fear which had emerged in the years approaching the turn of the century, known at the time as fin de siècle or 'end of the age', which anticipated apocalypse at midnight {{on the last day of}} 1899.|$|E
25|$|Maranello Motorsport took <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> {{win in the}} 2014 event—the team's former driver Allan Simonsen {{was killed}} in a crash at the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans—with V8 Supercar driver Craig Lowndes holding off a late charge from German driver Maximilian Buhk to take victory. 2014 also saw the {{introduction}} of the Allan Simonsen Pole Position Trophy, named in honour of Simonsen, to be awarded to the fastest car in qualifying. The 2015 race featured a record twenty safety car periods, the last coming just minutes {{from the end of the}} race. Katsumasa Chiyo, driving a Nissan GT-R, took the lead with two laps remaining to give Nissan its first major victory at Mount Panorama since the 1992 Bathurst 1000.|$|E

The World at War (1973-74) is one famous exception, where {{in a few short}} minutes <b>an</b> especially <b>poignant</b> moment is featured; after the title sequence, the events that explain the episode are outlined more fully.|$|R
50|$|The Symposium runs {{each year}} {{over the course of}} the Spring semester, as a {{counterpart}} to the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium.

25|$|Reichart {{utilizes}} {{techniques in}} her novel {{that are similar}} to other Austrian authors from both the early 20th century and the early 1980s. Similar to Franz Kafka, Reichart employs alternating run-on and fragmented sentences to display the emotions of her character, and also creates <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> plot by using ambiguous words which could potentially possess multiple meanings in the text. Like Ödön von Horváth, Reichart has the ability to uproot and publicly display difficult events through dramatized means. In the novels authored by Peter Handke, the use of extreme psychological activity drives the plot, which is also congruent with Reichart's novel. Her use of key themes and phrases which represent innate emotional processes can also be seen in the writings of one of her famous contemporaries, Thomas Bernhard.|$|E
25|$|The 1/5th mobilised in Edinburgh in August 1914, {{and were}} {{assigned}} to the 29th Division. <b>A</b> <b>poignant</b> Christmas card was produced by the Edinburgh artist Walter Balmer Hislop who served with the 5th Battalion 'D' Company (Queen's Edinburgh Rifles). They fought at the Battle of Gallipoli, then to France via Egypt, and saw action on the first day on the Somme. The 1/6th had mobilised {{at the same time and}} been dispatched to Egypt in 1915 for the Western Frontier Force; it too was withdrawn to France for the Somme. The two heavily depleted battalions were amalgamated in July 1916, and spent the remainder of war on the Western Front as the 5/6th. After the war, it remained in Belgium until January 1919 when it moved into Germany, and was reduced to a cadre in October 1919 and sent home to be disbanded.|$|E
25|$|The Hartford circus fire {{occurred}} on July 6, 1944, in Hartford, Connecticut, during an afternoon performance that {{was attended by}} approximately 7,500 to 8,700 people. It {{was one of the}} worst fire disasters in the history of the United States. Although the Hartford Fire Department responded quickly, the fire was fanned by the fact that the canvas circus tent had been waterproofed through a mixture of highly flammable paraffin and gasoline. During the ensuing panic Emmett Kelly, the tramp clown, threw a bucket of water at the burning canvas tent, and <b>a</b> <b>poignant</b> photograph of his futile attempt was transmitted around the world as news spread of the disaster. At least 167 people were killed in the disaster, and hundreds more were injured. Some of the dead remain unidentified to this day, even with modern DNA techniques.|$|E

50|$|In {{the arcade}} and Mega Drive versions, Lancer returns safely to Earth after having {{defeated}} the Black Nebula.

5000|$|The Agent Intellect was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from contemporary reviewers. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 85, which indicates [...] "Universal acclaim", based on 20 reviews. The Guardian critic Kate Hutchinson thought: [...] "This isn’t spiky postpunk like their last album - it’s more unhinged: they’ve swapped hooks for a dirgy epicness, distortion bulldozes through, sometimes flaring angrily, punctured by driving, truly affecting drums. <b>As</b> <b>poignant</b> as those images of a decrepit Motor City, once brilliant, now decayed." [...] Sam Lefebvre of Paste magazine described the album as [...] "an album of spindly bass, needling guitar and economical drums." [...] Lefebvre further added [...] "And yet, with Protomartyr’s inventive ensemble flare, it sounds like much more." ...|$|R
