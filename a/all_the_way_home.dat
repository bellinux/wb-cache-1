25|$|Pride's {{rejection}} of every method {{of family planning}} in The Way Home was soon noticed by prominent members of the Couple to Couple League, a Catholic natural family planning (NFP) movement. John and Sheila Kippley in their The Art of Natural Family Planning describes how representatives of the organization contacted Pride to express concerns over her position. In 1989, Pride in her HELP for Growing Families periodical published portions of the correspondence between the Kippleys' and herself, during which Pride accepted NFP use only for couples who wished to remain healthy until {{they were ready to}} use no fertility control at all. Sheila Kippley credits the correspondence as the reason why Pride accepted NFP in such circumstances in her sequel, <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Home.</b>|$|E
500|$|Homeless, Apu {{moves into}} the {{apartment}} complex where Kirk Van Houten lives. The octuplets then speak their first words, which put together, say [...] "Mommy, will you let daddy come back...cookie!" [...] Marge and Manjula go to Apu's and arrive in time {{to prevent him from}} committing suicide by hanging. Apu is then subjected to several tasks to redeem himself (such as eating a light bulb), though Manjula says it will take time for everything to get back to normal. In bed, Manjula, finally satisfied with what he has done, kisses Apu while Homer watches from the window, on a ladder. The couple continues and Homer, traumatized, hops backwards on the ladder <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>home,</b> without falling, mimicking what he did earlier.|$|E
500|$|Apu sells Homer a beer keg for the American Civil War reenactment of the Battle of Springfield. At the reenactment, Principal Skinner {{watches as}} Springfielders disobey him {{and hold a}} rather {{inaccurate}} battle (featuring an orange plaid clad [...] "East" [...] faction, a roller skating Stone Wall Jackson, and a giant robotic spider made by Professor Frink). After the battle, Homer brings the empty, dented keg back to Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart {{in an attempt to}} get the deposit. There, he hears a giggle coming from a closet and finds Apu making love with the woman who delivers Squishees to Kwik-E-Mart. He then walks backwards in shock <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>home</b> to his bed and then dreams about walking backwards when he falls asleep.|$|E

500|$|Several {{other ideas}} were then proposed. One {{involved}} Seven's Borg implants suffering severe side effects {{from being in}} the slipstream, but this was discarded as it felt similar to the episode [...] "", which was due to air immediately prior to the finale. An alternative involved a battle in the slipstream with an alien vessel, which results in that crew abandoning it and Seven suggesting that they use the new ship to take the crew <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>home.</b> Janeway disagrees, but somehow Seven ends up {{in command of the}} alien vessel and for some sort of dangerous situation to occur which Janeway must save her from. It was proposed that there was some reason why they attacked Voyager, and Taylor suggested [...] "vengeance", which was well received by the others.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Stewie misinterprets {{the meaning}} of his {{birthday}} and assumes that the same mysterious [...] "Man in White" [...] who delivered him as an infant will be returning to force Stewie back into Lois' womb from which he escaped just one year ago. Meg cries <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>home</b> to Peter from cheerleading practice, and has been having trouble fitting in at school. Later, she discovers a new friend named Jennifer. Meanwhile, Stewie {{makes it all the}} way to the airport looking for tickets but then is stopped by a member of staff. The man then gives Stewie some advice saying that running from your problems never solves anything. Stewie then reflects on this, deciding to finally face [...] "The Man in White". But before he leaves, he wishes the man luck before freezing him in carbonite.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] {{was directed by}} Walter Stern and filmed on June 26–27, 1998 at London's Claridge's Hotel and Piccadilly Circus. It includes cameo appearances by Anita Pallenberg and Steve Strange. It was released in September 1998, and features Madonna leaving her home and being chased by paparazzi. Dressed in black, she is constantly running, even from the other celebrities in a hotel bar. Except for Madonna's, everyone else's face is distorted. In another sequence of the clip, Madonna passes a hotel maid smiling at her. The singer returns the smile when the flash of a camera goes off; the maid has just taken a picture of her. Madonna flees again, running <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>home</b> to her daughter's arms, singing that she has [...] "changed her mind" [...] about being a celebrity.|$|E
60|$|And for <b>all</b> I know <b>the</b> {{travelling}} servant {{is there}} to this day.

6000|$|With this warning {{he turned}} contemptuously and passed out, leaving the discomfited rowdy to settle {{accounts}} with his friends.

2500|$|SpongeBob {{is going}} about his usual {{day at work}} at the Krusty Krab. [...] All of a sudden, his employer, Mr. Krabs, fires him {{from his job as}} a fry cook. According to Mr. Krabs, he can save a nickel if he cuts SpongeBob's salary completely. SpongeBob offers to work for free, but Mr. Krabs said that he {{considered}} that, but learned that it would be illegal and that he could lose his vending license. Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob's apathetic co-worker, asks if he can be fired as well, but Mr. Krabs refuses, because Squidward has more seniority. SpongeBob cries in depression <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>home.</b> Squidward, although gleeful over SpongeBob not working at the Krusty Krab anymore, asks Mr. Krabs who will be the new fry cook. His boss informs him that to save money, he'll take over the kitchen—much to Squidward's dismay.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1946, the twice married Pasternak met Olga Ivinskaya, a 34 {{year old}} single mother {{employed}} by Novy Mir. Deeply moved by her resemblance {{to his first}} love Ida Vysotskaya, Pasternak gave Ivinskaya several volumes of his poetry and literary translations. Although Pasternak never left his wife Zinaida, he started an extramarital relationship with Ivinskaya that would last {{for the remainder of}} Pasternak's life. Ivinskaya later recalled, [...] "He phoned almost every day and, instinctively fearing to meet or talk with him, yet dying of happiness, I would stammer out that I was [...] "busy today." [...] But almost every afternoon, toward the end of working hours, he came in person to the office and often walked with me through the streets, boulevards, and squares <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>home</b> to Potapov Street. 'Shall I make you a present of this square?' he would ask." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Take Out," [...] Don {{must see}} a {{therapist}} who is {{led to believe}} that he is [...] "trigger happy." [...] His father noted that this may be true, as he often shoots first. Further, Alan recalled how Don would take on others' burdens as a child and told him to get counseling, which he later willingly sought, especially considering that he viewed his life's work as a series of dirty deeds. In [...] "One Hour", Don expressed that he doesn't have to trust his team, they have to trust him. [...] The exception to this may be Charlie, whom the therapist identified {{as a member of the}} team to Don's initial confusion. [...] It appears that Don considers Charlie more of an extension of himself than a member of his team, which may be true: [...] Charlie would likely not be involved in the volume of cases that he is if not for Don's continued requests for his assistance, despite the team's respect for Charlie's contributions. He also confessed to his psychiatrist that he [...] "respects the Hell out of" [...] Charlie for all that his brother does for the FBI, and that Charlie has never let them down despite often having the team's and Don's lives in his hands. When the psychiatrist pushes Don about his relationship with Charlie, indicating first that Don resents Charlie's presence at the FBI and then that Don enjoys having his little brother as his 'employee', Don vehemently snaps back and defends Charlie. This shows how far the relationship between the brothers has come, especially since being damaged by the unusual pressures of their childhood and the three months near the end of their mother's life that Charlie spent working on P vs. NP. The therapist reveals that Don has deep-seated fears of losing what he has worked for, together with self-esteem issues from growing up in Charlie's shadow and likely some abandonment issues as well. In [...] "Money for Nothing", he acquiesces to the counselor's request to ask Charlie to come in for a visit. A looming issue was the day Charlie walked <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>home</b> from a camping trip at the age of 8 (taken for Don's 13th birthday) just to get away from Don who did not want him sticking around. During the meeting, he learns that his brother was not as inept as he and his father thought and stated he likes working with Charlie. Both Don's therapist and Edgerton himself bring up the incident in which a suspect was tortured that nearly took Don over the edge ("One Hour" [...] and [...] "Pandora's Box"), but given the fact that it was done to obtain the whereabouts of a missing FBI agent, Don and Ian's superiors appear to be overlooking the matter for now.|$|E

The jump, when completed, was approximately 140 feet high, 430 feet long, and set at a 38 degree incline.

50|$|Since the 1990s {{there has}} been an ongoing effort to supply fiber to the home (FTTH). Using fiber to deliver signals <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to <b>the</b> <b>home</b> {{provides}} the same advantages as it does on the longer hauls, namely much higher bandwidth, lower costs, and less interference with other sources. However, given the deliberate lack of flexibility of the cable, these installations generally end in a utility room where they are converted to copper for distribution within the home.|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes, {{the action}} of the head {{separating}} from the body is seen as the soul wandering away from the body i. e. somnambulism. For example, in the Sorori Monogatari (曾呂利物語, 1663 CE), in the chapter, A Woman's Wild Thoughts Wandering Around (女の妄念迷ひ歩く事, Onna no Mōnen Mayoiaruku Koto) the head separating from the body interpreted to be the woman's soul wandering while asleep. In the same book, a man saw a nukekubi that changed into a chick and a woman's head, so he took his sword and chased the head. The head fled into a home, and people said that they heard a voice from inside say, [...] "I had a scary dream. I was chased by a man with a sword.
