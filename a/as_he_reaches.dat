Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. He checks the motels, and Norman's evasive and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicions. After hearing that Marion had met Norman's mother, he asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses.

500|$|Oviri (...) is an 1894 ceramic {{sculpture}} by French artist Paul Gauguin, the original cast {{is in the}} Musée d'Orsay. Gauguin shows her with long pale hair and large wild eyes. In Tahitian mythology Oviri was the goddess of mourning. Gauguin shows her either smothering or embracing a wolf with her feet, as she tightly clutches another wolf cub in her arms. Art historians have presented multiple interpretations of the work; usually that he intended it as an epithet to reinforce his self-image as a [...] "civilised savage". Tahitian goddesses of her era had passed from folk memory by 1894, yet Gauguin romanticises the island's past <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> towards more ancient sources, including an Assyrian relief of a 'master of animals' type and Majapahit mummies. Other possible influences include preserved skulls from the Marquesas Islands, figures found at Borobudur, and a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple in central Java.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stone was}} later passed to Harry through Dumbledore's will, hidden inside the Golden Snitch Harry caught with his mouth, nearly {{swallowing}} it, in his first-ever Quidditch match. The Snitch revealed the message [...] "I {{open at the}} close" [...] when touched by Harry's lips. Harry is unable to open the Snitch until {{he is about to}} die in the Forest, and realizes then [...] "the close" [...] means the end, or his death. Harry uses the Stone to summon his deceased loved ones - his parents, his godfather Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin - to comfort him and strengthen his courage, before he goes to meet his death at Voldemort's hand. The stone falls unseen from Harry's numb fingers in the Forbidden Forest <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> Voldemort's encampment. Harry survives the encounter and he and Dumbledore's portrait later agreed that Harry will neither search for it nor tell others where it is. In a 2007 interview, Rowling said she would like to believe a centaur's hoof pushed it into the ground, burying it forever.|$|E

60|$|That is why small frogs are so deadly {{afraid if}} you take them outside the fringe of lily pads.

60|$|Beowulf plunges {{into the}} horrible place, while his companions {{wait for him}} oh the shore. For a long time he sinks through the flood; then, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> bottom, Grendel's mother rushes out upon him and drags him into a cave, where sea monsters swarm at him from behind and gnash his armor with their tusks. The edge of his sword is turned with the mighty blow he deals the merewif; but it harms not the monster. Casting the weapon aside, he grips her and tries to hurl her down, while her claws and teeth clash upon his corslet but cannot {{penetrate}} the steel rings. She throws her bulk upon him, crushes him down, draws a short sword and plunges it at him; but again his splendid byrnie saves him. He is wearied now, and oppressed. Suddenly, as his eye sweeps the cave, he catches sight of a magic sword, made by the giants long ago, too heavy for warriors to wield. Struggling up he seizes the weapon, whirls it and brings down a crashing blow upon the monster's neck. It smashes through the ring bones; the merewif falls, and the fight is won.|$|E
