5|$|Actinium {{is found}} only in traces in uranium ores – one tonne of uranium in ore {{contains}} about 0.2 milligrams of 227Ac – and in thorium ores, which contain about 5 nanograms of 228Ac per one tonne of thorium. The actinium isotope 227Ac is <b>a</b> <b>transient</b> member of the uranium-actinium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope 235U (or 239Pu) and ends with the stable lead isotope 207Pb. The isotope 228Ac is <b>a</b> <b>transient</b> member of the thorium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope 232Th and ends with the stable lead isotope 208Pb. Another actinium isotope (225Ac) was transiently present in the neptunium series decay chain, beginning with 237Np (or 233U) and ending with thallium (205Tl) and near-stable bismuth (209Bi), but this chain existed only in the early Solar System, due to the short half-life of neptunium-237.|$|E

5|$|Resonance was noticed {{early on}} in {{experiments}} with the Leyden jar, invented in 1746. The Leyden jar stores electricity due to its capacitance, and is, in fact, an early form of capacitor. When a Leyden jar is discharged by allowing a spark to jump between the electrodes, the discharge is oscillatory. This was not suspected until 1826, when Felix Savary in France, and later (1842) Joseph Henry in the US noted that a steel needle placed close to the discharge does not always magnetise in the same direction. They both independently drew the conclusion that there was <b>a</b> <b>transient</b> oscillation dying with time.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{ends with}} the narrator turning towards his own fate, {{accepting}} his life and accomplishments. The poem, like many of Gray's, incorporates a narrator who is contemplating his position in <b>a</b> <b>transient</b> world that is mysterious and tragic. Although the comparison between obscurity and renown is commonly seen as universal and not within a specific context with a specific political message, there are political ramifications for Gray's choices. Both John Milton and John Hampden spent time near the setting of Stoke Poges, which was also affected by the English Civil War. The poem's composition could also have been prompted by the entrance of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland into London or by a trial of Jacobite nobility in 1746.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of methane and possibly nitrogen suggests that Makemake could have <b>a</b> <b>transient</b> atmosphere {{similar to that}} of Pluto near its perihelion. Nitrogen, if present, will be the dominant component of it. The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the nitrogen depletion: because the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that of Pluto, Eris and Triton, a large amount of nitrogen was probably lost via atmospheric escape; methane is lighter than nitrogen, but has significantly lower vapor pressure at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (32–36K), which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance of methane. However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by New Horizons suggest that methane, not nitrogen, is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of nitrogen may be more complicated.|$|E

A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as <b>a</b> <b>transient</b> in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.|$|E

5|$|An {{elevated}} core temperature, {{leading to}} increased symptom presentation {{has been noted}} during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS {{during the course of}} exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause <b>a</b> <b>transient</b> nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.|$|E
5|$|In the South of China Sea on December11, Amy quickly slowed in {{forward motion}} {{and began to}} execute a {{cyclonic}} loop. Late that day, the typhoon strengthened back to Category2 intensity, and as such concurrently attained a tertiary peak intensity with winds of 160km/h (100mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 968mbar (hPa; 28.59inHg). Late on December13, Amy weakened back to a Category1 typhoon for <b>a</b> <b>transient</b> period of time before restrengthening and reaching a quaternary peak intensity as a Category3 typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). Afterwards, the typhoon began to weaken, and at 0900UTC on December17, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam issued their last bulletin on the tropical cyclone. Upon the issuance of the last advisory, Amy set records for most typhoon bulletins issued at 58, and most reconnaissance fixes at 25. However, Amy continued to persist through the next day before degenerating into a remnant low-pressure area late on December18. The following day, the associated remnants of Amy dissipated east of Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The KIT gene encodes {{a protein}} called steel factor receptor, which is {{critical}} to the differentiation of stem cells into blood cells, sperm cells, and pigment cells. A process called alternative splicing, which uses the information encoded in the KIT gene to make slightly different proteins (isoforms) for use in different circumstances, may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells, sperm cells, or pigment cells. Steel factor receptor interacts chemically with steel factor or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages. These messages are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes (pigment cells) from the neural crest tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer. The neural crest is <b>a</b> <b>transient</b> tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line. Melanocytes migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites: near the eye, near the ear, and the top of the head; six sites along each side of the body, and a few along the tail. At these sites, the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation, and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds.|$|E
40|$|Objective(s) : In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on c-myb immunoreactivity as well as neuronal damage/death after <b>a</b> subsequent lethal <b>transient</b> ischemia in gerbils. Materials and Methods: IPC was subjected to a 2 min sublethal ischemia and <b>a</b> lethal <b>transient</b> ischemia was given 5 min transient ischemia. The animals {{in all of the}} groups were given recovery times of 1 day, 2 days and 5 days and we examined change in c-myb immunoreactivity as well as neuronal damage/death in the hippocampus induced by <b>a</b> lethal <b>transient</b> ischemia. Results:A lethal <b>transient</b> ischemia induced <b>a</b> significant loss of cells in the stratum pyramidale (SP) of the hippocampal CA 1 region at 5 days post-ischemia, and this insult showed that c-myb immunoreactivity in cells of the SP of the CA 1 region was significantly decreased at 2 days post-ischemia and disappeared at 5 days post-ischemia. However, IPC effectively prevented the neuronal loss in the SP and showed that c-myb immunoreactivity was constitutively maintained in the SP after <b>a</b> lethal <b>transient</b> ischemia. Conclusion: Our results show that <b>a</b> lethal <b>transient</b> ischemia significantly decreased c-myb immunoreactivity in the SP of the CA 1 region and that IPC well preserved c-myb immunoreactivity in the SP of the CA 1 region. We suggest that the maintenance of c-myb might be related with IPC-mediated neuroprotection after a lethal ischemic insult...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} on visual processing {{has suggested that}} colour and contrast manipulations may benefit students with <b>a</b> suspected <b>transient</b> deficit while reading. The removal of long wavelengths (red) from the display {{and the removal of}} high to medium spatial frequencies work on different underlying mechanisms in order to balance the relative timing of the two visual processing streams. Three out of six experiments were conducted to investigate visual manipulations on reading components of rate, accuracy and comprehension. Two experiments investigated visual manipulations on reading activities related to learning to read. One experiment investigated visual manipulations on a pure perceptual task. All experiments were presented on a computer monitor and the colour and contrast of the background were manipulated. Results for the reading component experiments indicated, in general, that students with <b>a</b> suspected <b>transient</b> deficit can improve their reading through the use of colour or contrast. Their performance for comprehension during oral reading improved with a blue background, whereas their performance for comprehension during silent reading improved with low contrast. Accuracy of word reading improved with both blue and low contrast material. However, using these two manipulations together, ie., blue, low contrast background, showed more conflict than assistance. Activities, with limited dynamic visual processing, that are used to develop reading showed that the performance of students with <b>a</b> suspected <b>transient</b> deficit. did not differ from those students with normal transient processing and that visual manipulations made no difference to their performance. The performance on the perceptual task showed that students with <b>a</b> suspected <b>transient</b> deficit improved with the assistance of a blue background. Findings suggest that, a blue background or a low contrast background, used separately, may provide assistance for students with <b>a</b> suspected <b>transient</b> deficit on reading and perceptual tasks that require transient type processing. It was concluded that for students with <b>a</b> suspected <b>transient</b> deficit and <b>a</b> reading disability the use of colour and contrast can be used to augment reading strategies and assist these students to realise their full reading potential...|$|R
