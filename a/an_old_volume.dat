500|$|Holmes's fame {{continued}} through his later years. The Poet at the Breakfast-Table {{was published in}} 1872. Written fifteen years after The Autocrat, this work's tone was mellower and more nostalgic than its predecessor; [...] "As people grow older," [...] Holmes wrote, [...] "they come at length to live so much in memory that they often think {{with a kind of}} pleasure of losing their dearest possessions. [...] Nothing can be so perfect while we possess it as it will seem when remembered". In 1876, at the age of seventy, Holmes published a biography of John Lothrop Motley, which was an extension of an earlier sketch he had written for the Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings. The following year he published a collection of his medical essays and Pages from <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Volume</b> of Life, a collection of various essays he had previously written for The Atlantic Monthly. He retired from Harvard Medical School in 1882 after thirty-five years as a professor. After he gave his final lecture on November 28, the university made him professor emeritus.|$|E

60|$|The Compleat Fortune-Teller was <b>an</b> <b>old</b> thick <b>volume,</b> {{which lay}} on a table at her elbow, so worn by {{pocketing}} that the margins had reached {{the edge of the}} type. Tess took it up, and her mother started.|$|R
60|$|I had {{borrowed}} {{the book from}} the Library, to which I have been a subscriber in secret for some time past. It was <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>volume,</b> full of what we should now call Gossip; relating strange adventures, and scandalous incidents in family history which had been concealed from public notice.|$|E
60|$|The Sabbath wore away lazily, and {{therefore}} wickedly. The heavy caravan-man inquired for some book of light reading, and, having obtained <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>volume</b> {{of a literary}} paper, betook himself to {{the seat of his}} wagon, to read. At other times he smoked, and talked sensibly enough with anybody that offered. He is a man of sense, though not quick, and seems to be a fair man.|$|E
60|$|I lately {{met with}} <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>volume</b> from a London bookshop, {{containing}} the Greek Minor Poets, {{and it was}} a pleasure to read once more only the words, Orpheus, Linus, Musaeus,--those faint poetic sounds and echoes of a name, dying away on the ears of us modern men; and those hardly more substantial sounds, Mimnermus, Ibycus, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Menander. They lived not in vain. We can converse with these bodiless fames without reserve or personality.|$|E

60|$|She {{begins the}} day by the fireside with the New Testament in her hands, <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>volume</b> with its loose pages beautifully refixed, and its covers sewn and resewn by her, so that you would say it can never fall to pieces. It is mine now, and to me the black threads with which she {{stitched}} it are {{as part of the}} contents. Other books she read in the ordinary manner, but this one differently, her lips moving with each word as if she were reading aloud, and her face very solemn. The Testament lies open on her lap long after she has ceased to read, and the expression of her face has not changed.|$|E
60|$|Upon one {{of these}} {{occasions}} they had talked about supernatural appearances; and as they were coming through the somewhat neglected God's Acre, the clergyman said he had read, in <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>volume,</b> that to anyone who dared, after the performance of certain ghastly ceremonies, wait in the church porch on Christmas-eve, the features {{of those who were}} to die during the following year would be revealed, and that he intended upon the night before the coming festival to try the spell. The old man at once expressed a wish {{to take part in the}} trial, and before the two parted it was agreed that both should go through the preliminary charms, and keep the vigil.|$|E
60|$|What was I {{to do to}} {{pass away}} the {{long-lived}} day? I was sadly nervous and lonely; and every thing about an inn seems calculated to make a dull day ten times duller. Old newspapers, smelling of beer and tobacco-smoke, and which I had already read half-a-dozen times--good-for-nothing books, that were worse than rainy weather. I bored myself to death with <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>volume</b> of the Lady's Magazine. I read all the commonplaced names of ambitious travellers scrawled on the panes of glass; the eternal families of the Smiths, and the Browns, and the Jacksons, and the Johnsons, {{and all the other}} sons; and I deciphered several scraps of fatiguing inn-window poetry which I have met with {{in all parts of the}} world.|$|E
6000|$|Young Dare sat thoughtfully at {{the window}} of the studio in which Somerset had left him, till the gay scene beneath became embrowned by the twilight, and the {{brilliant}} red stripes of the marquees, the bright sunshades, the many-tinted costumes of the ladies, were indistinguishable from the blacks and greys of the masculine contingent moving among them. He had occasionally glanced away from the outward prospect to study <b>a</b> small <b>old</b> <b>volume</b> that lay before him on the drawing-board. Near scrutiny revealed the book to bear the title 'Moivre's Doctrine of Chances.' ...|$|R

Now I've <b>a</b> most curious <b>old</b> <b>volume</b> here--on Chinese temples. It's rare--but not too old. You can peruse it thoroughly. It's what I call {{a book to}} browse on just suit your palate. Funny {{principle}} they built those things on," [...] he added, opening the volume at an engraving, [...] "in layers. We don't build like that in England." ...|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile {{it occurs}} to me that by a remote New England fireside an unsophisticated young person of either sex is reading in <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>volume</b> of travels or an old romantic tale some account of these anniversaries and {{appointed}} revels as old Catholic lands offer them to view. Across the page swims a vision of sculptured palace-fronts draped in crimson and gold and shining in a southern sun; of a motley train of maskers sweeping on in voluptuous confusion and pelting each other with nosegays and love-letters. Into the quiet room, quenching the rhythm of the Connecticut clock, floats an uproar of delighted voices, a medley of stirring foreign sounds, an echo of far-heard music of a strangely alien cadence. But the dusk is falling, and the unsophisticated young person closes the book wearily and wanders to the window. The dusk is falling on the beaten snow. Down the road is a white wooden meeting-house, looking grey among the drifts. The young person surveys the prospect a while, and then wanders back and stares at the fire. The Carnival of Venice, of Florence, of Rome; colour and costume, romance and rapture! The young person gazes in the firelight at the flickering chiaroscuro of the future, discerns at last the glowing phantasm of opportunity, and determines with a wild heart-beat to go and see it all--twenty years hence! ...|$|E
6000|$|Quick as we were, we did {{not arrive}} at Castlewood too soon. I {{was looking at the}} {{fountain}} in the court, and listening to that sweet sad music of its plashing, which my grandfather tells of in his memoires, and peopling the place with bygone figures, with Beatrix in her beauty; with my Lord Francis in scarlet, calling to his dogs and mounting his grey horse; with the young page of old who won the castle and the heiress--when Sampson comes running down to me with <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>volume</b> in rough calf-bound in his hand, containing drafts of letters, copies of agreements, and various writings, some by a secretary of my Lord Francis, some in the slim handwriting of his wife my grandmother, some bearing the signature of the last lord; and here was a copy of the assignment sure enough, as it had been sent to my grandfather in Virginia. [...] "Victoria, Victoria!" [...] cries Sampson, shaking my hand, embracing everybody. [...] "Here is a guinea for thee, Betty. We'll have a bowl of punch at the Three Castles to-night!" [...] As we were talking, the wheels of postchaises were heard, and a couple of carriages drove into the court containing my lord and a friend, and their servants in the next vehicle. His lordship looked only a little paler than usual at seeing me.|$|E
60|$|But towards little Ned {{the grim}} Doctor adopted a far {{different}} system. No sooner had he reached the age when the soft and tender intellect of the child became capable of retaining impressions, than he took him vigorously in hand, assigning him such tasks as were fit for him, and curiously investigating what were the force and character of the powers with which the child grasped them. Not that the Doctor pressed him forward unduly; indeed, {{there was no need}} of it; for the boy manifested a remarkable docility for instruction, and a singular quickness in mastering the preliminary steps which lead to science: a subtle instinct, indeed, which it seemed wonderful a child should possess for anything as artificial as systems of grammar and arithmetic. A remarkable boy, in truth, he was, to have been found by chance in an almshouse; except that, such being his origin, we are at liberty to suppose for him whatever long cultivation and gentility we may think necessary, in his parentage of either side,--such as was indicated also by his graceful and refined beauty of person. He showed, indeed, even before he began to read at all, an instinctive attraction towards books, and a love for and interest in even the material form of knowledge,--the plates, the print, the binding of the Doctor's volumes, and even in a bookworm which he once found in <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>volume,</b> where it had eaten a circular furrow. But the little boy had too quick a spirit of life to be in danger of becoming a bookworm himself. He had this side of the intellect, but his impulse would be to mix with men, and catch something from their intercourse fresher than books could give him; though these would give him what they might.|$|E
60|$|The white-bearded palmer withdrew {{into the}} half {{concealment}} of the oratory {{which we have}} already mentioned, and then, putting {{on a pair of}} spectacles, betook himself to the perusal of <b>an</b> <b>old</b> folio <b>volume,</b> the leaves of which he turned over so gently that not the slightest sound could possibly disturb the patient. All his manifestations were gentle and soft, but of a simplicity most unlike the feline softness which we are apt to associate with a noiseless tread and movement in the male sex. The sunshine came through the ivy and glimmered upon his great book, however, with an effect which a little disturbed the patient's nerves; besides, he desired to have a fuller view of his benign guardian.|$|R

Is the toddy to the squire's relish?" ...|$|R
6000|$|During {{the next}} two days we were very busy--too busy to tell tales or listen to them. Only in the frosty dusk did we have time to wander afar in realms of gold with the Story Girl. She had {{recently}} been digging into <b>a</b> couple of <b>old</b> <b>volumes</b> of classic myths and northland folklore which she had found in Aunt Olivia's attic; and for us, god and goddess, laughing nymph and mocking satyr, norn and valkyrie, elf and troll, and [...] "green folk" [...] generally, were real creatures once again, inhabiting the orchards and woods and meadows around us, until {{it seemed as if the}} Golden Age had returned to earth.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have told}} how after my fifteenth anniversary, when I {{first began to}} reflect seriously on my future life, the idea still persisted that my {{perpetual}} delight in Nature {{was nothing more than}} a condition or phase of my child's and boy's mind, and would inevitably fade out in time. I might have guessed at an earlier date that this was a delusion, since the feeling had grown in strength with the years, but it was only after I took to reading at the beginning of my sixteenth year that I discovered its true character. One of the books I read then for the first time was White's Selborne, given to me by an old friend of our family, a merchant in Buenos Ayres, who had been accustomed to stay a week or two with us once a year when he took his holiday. He had been on a visit to Europe, and one day, he told me, when in London on the eve of his departure, he was in a bookshop, and seeing this book on the counter and glancing at a page or two, it occurred to him that it was just the right thing to get for that bird-loving boy out on the pampas. I read and re-read it many times, for nothing so good of its kind had ever come to me, but it did not reveal to me the secret of my own feeling for Nature--the feeling of which I was becoming more and more conscious, which was a mystery to me, especially at certain moments, when it would come upon me with a sudden rush. So powerful it was, so unaccountable, I was actually afraid of it, yet I would go out of my way to seek it. At the hour of sunset I would go out half a mile or so from the house, and sitting on the dry grass with hands clasped round my knees, gaze at the western sky, waiting for it to take me. And I would ask myself: What does it mean? But there was no answer to that in any book concerning the [...] "life and conversation of animals." [...] I found it in other works: in Brown's Philosophy--another of the ancient tomes on our shelves--and in <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>volume</b> containing appreciations of the early nineteenth-century poets; also in other works. They did not tell me in so many words that it was the mystical faculty in me which produced those strange rushes or bursts of feeling and lifted me out of myself at moments; but what I found in their words was sufficient to show me that the feeling of delight in Nature was an enduring one, that others had known it, and that it had been a secret source of happiness throughout their lives.|$|E

60|$|That {{evening the}} farmer's {{daughter}} set herself to clearing off all those odd jobs which accumulate {{in a large}} household. She polished the dark, old-fashioned furniture in the sitting-room. She cleared out the cellar, re-arranged the bins, counted up the cider, made a great cauldron full of raspberry jam, potted, papered, and labelled it. Long after the whole household was in bed she pushed on with her self-imposed tasks until the night was far gone and she very spent and weary. Then she stirred up the smouldering kitchen fire and made herself a cup of tea, and, carrying it up to her own room, she sat sipping it and glancing over <b>an</b> <b>old</b> bound <b>volume</b> of the Leisure Hour. Her seat was behind the little dimity window curtains, whence she could see without being seen.|$|R

An English tun (<b>an</b> <b>old</b> wine cask <b>volume</b> measurement equivalent to 954 litres) of wine weighs roughly a tonne, 954 kg if full of water, a little less for wine.|$|R
6000|$|Sitting {{there one}} day, {{thinking}} of nothing, I was gradually awakened to a feeling almost of astonishment {{at the sight}} of the extraordinary number of memorial tablets of every imaginable shape and size which crowd the walls. So numerous are they and so closely placed that you could not find space anywhere to put your hand against the wall. We are accustomed to think that in cathedrals and other great ecclesiastical buildings the illustrious dead receive burial, and their names and claims on our gratitude and reverence are recorded, but in no fane in the land is there so numerous a gathering of the dead as in this place. The inscription-covered walls were like the pages of <b>an</b> <b>old</b> black-letter <b>volume</b> without margins. Yet when I came to think of it I could not recall any Bath celebrity or great person associated with Bath except Beau Nash, who was not perhaps a very great person. Probably Carlyle would have described him as a [...] "meeserable creature." ...|$|R
