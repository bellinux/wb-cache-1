50|$|Batroxobin {{could be}} used as a medical {{adhesive}} against bleeding injuries. A study was done, where researchers aimed to examine the effects of batroxobin-containing adhesive for hemostasis. The fibrinogen conversion ability of batroxobin was evaluated by a fibrinogen clotting assay and a whole blood clotting assay. Both results proved that batroxobin containing adhesive forms blood clots. Higher concentrations of batroxobin more rapidly induced hemostasis. Another study has tested the effects of 2 units of batroxobin on perioperative blood loss and coagulation in patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), while undergoing a hip replacement. This is done by giving 240 patients LMWH, 12 hours previously to the hip operation. These patients were randomly divided into a testing group (120 patients) and a control group (120 patients). The testing group and the control group received 2 units of batroxobin and 50 mg mannitol respectively 10 minutes before incision. There is tested on perioperative blood loss, postoperative 24 drainage and blood routine test, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen. The study showed that the perioperative blood loss in the test group was 422,64 mL, which is less than the 667,67 mL blood loss of the control group. Red blood cell, hemoglobin and red blood cell volume and platelet were decreasing after the operation in both groups, but not significant different between the two groups. Also were there no drug-related adverse effects found in both groups, nor were there differences found in hospitalization between the two groups. The study concludes that 2 units of batroxobin could reduce the perioperative blood loss in patients getting a hip replacement operation with LMWH. There has also been studies done to examine the effects of batroxobin with continuous transcranial doppler monitoring in patients with <b>acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>stroke.</b> The aim was to find out whether the effect of continuous transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring could be increased by the use of batroxobin on patients suffering from an <b>acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>stroke</b> beyond the thrombolytic time window. In this study 90 patients were analyzed within twelve hours of the beginning of the symptoms. The patient were divided into a target and a control group which respectively got batroxobin with and without one hour of continuous TCD monitoring. Clinical sereneness of the strokes were based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Barthel index (BI), Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia score (TIBI), the incidence of advancing stroke, and the recurrence of cerebral infarction. The target group showed a significant better NIHSS score 57 days after the treatment, when compared with the control group. Also the incidence of advancing stroke one week afterwards and the incidence of stroke iteration after three months were significantly reduced in the target group. Safety of TCD monitoring in the clinical use for the groups was confirmed because no significant difference between the groups of the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage had shown one week after the use of TCD monitoring. The study concludes that the use of batroxobin combined with continuous TCD monitoring reduced the chance of advancing stroke and stroke recurrence after the treatment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We have {{developed}} a new three dimensional (3 -D) conductivity imaging approach and have used it to detect human brain conductivity changes corresponding to <b>acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>stroke.</b> The proposed Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance Tomography (MREIT) approach {{is based on the}} J-Substitution algorithm and is expanded to imaging 3 -D subject conductivity distribution changes. Computer simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate the present MREIT imaging approach. Simulations of both types of cerebral stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke, were performed on a four-sphere head model. Simulation results showed that the correlation coefficient (CC) and relative error (RE) between target and estimated conductivity distributions were 0. 9245 ± 0. 0068 and 8. 9997 %± 0. 0084 %, for hemorrhagic stroke, and 0. 6748 ± 0. 0197 and 8. 8986 %± 0. 0089 %, for ischemic stroke, when the SNR (signal-to-noise radio) of added GWN (Gaussian White Noise) was 40. The convergence characteristic was also evaluated according to the changes of CC and RE with different iteration numbers. The CC increases and RE decreases monotonously with the increasing number of iterations. The present simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed 3 -D MREIT approach in hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke detection and suggest that the method may become a useful alternative in clinical diagnosis of <b>acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>stroke</b> in humans...|$|E

40|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>stroke</b> is {{the leading}} cause of adult {{disability}} worldwide. Motor dysfunction is particularly common and causes severe disability in many cases. Complete recovery of physical function is likely in only 14 % of stroke survivors, 25 to 50 % require assistance for fulfillment of Activities of Daily Living (ADL), others develop serious long-term problems. Several instruments or scales that assess ADL are currently available in rehabilitation, Barthel Index (BI) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) being most widely accepted, best validated and reliable. We studied 60 acute stroke patients with various degrees of motor deficiency. 26 patients were treated by standard rehabilitation protocol; 34 patients underwent neuro-muscular electric stimulation (NMES) in addition to standard rehabilitation regimen. Functional independence was measured by BI and FIM instruments, prior to rehabilitation course and at the end of acute stage. BI increased in both groups, but the increase was more prominent in NMES group and this difference was statistically significant (p< 0. 01). FIM increased in both groups as well and improvement was more apparent in NMES group (15. 0 vs 9. 7), although in this case this difference was not quite significant statistically (p= 0. 12). We conclude that neuro-muscular electric stimulation exerts a positive effect on ADL performance in the patients with post-stroke motor disorders. Lesser sensitivity of FIM instrument in given situation can be explained by its extensive cognitive-behavioral component.

Results. In ischemic stroke, hyperuricemia reflects the severity of cerebral metabolic disturbances, hemodynamic instability, hypercoagulation susceptiility, {{and the extent of}} neurological deficit. In ischemic stroke, hyperuri-corachia is accompanied by the higher spinal fluid levels of adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine and it is an indirect indicator of respiratory disorders of central genesis, systemic acidosis, hypercoagulation susceptibility, free radical oxidation activation, the intensity of a stressor response to cerebral ischemia, cerebral metabolic disturbances, the depth of reduced consciousness, and the severity of neurological deficit.

Materials and methods The CT examinations of 654 patients with symptoms related to <b>acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>stroke</b> were retrospectively reviewed. DW-MRI confirmed recent stroke in 175 patients. Two expert neuroradiologists analysed the CT examinations of these patients in four phases. Sensitivity, specificity and interobserver reliability was evaluated. Patients were divided into three groups according to the HMCAS site (M 1 -M 2 -M 3) and the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on DW-MRI was calculated. The ASPECTS average score was correlated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 3 months. Results In 41 patients, the presence of HMCAS was confirmed (71 % sensitivity; 100 % specificity; Interobserver reliability k, 84 %). An inverse correlation was found by comparing the ASPECTS and NIHSS scores (Rsq = - 0. 206). After logistic regression analysis, HMCAS was found to be independently associated with a poor outcome (mRS > 2) at 3 months after adjusting for age, NIHSS on admission, risk factors and aetiology of stroke. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that HMCAS obtained with multidetector CT can be detected in more than 70 % of patients with large acute ischaemic lesion and it is an unfavourable prognostic sign. © 2014 Italian Society of Medical Radiology...|$|E
40|$|Basal ganglia are {{traditionally}} related to motor disorders; the most typical confirm of this thought {{has been the}} sentence reported in the Essay on the Shaking Palsy, by James Parkinson. His patients have been described completely from a motor perspective, but Dr. Parkinson concluded that “senses and intellect are uninjuried”. More than 50 years after that book, Jean Charcot examined different patients suffering from Parkinson’ Disease, and his conclusions are far from those of Parkinson; he wrote: “In general, psychic faculties are definitely impaired; at a given point, the mind becomes cloud”. Till Parkinson and Charcot, many Autohors have tried to describe what they find during their long-time observational periods at the bed of different patients, with <b>acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>stroke</b> in the basal ganglia regions, or affected by cerebral tumours. The traditional view of simple motor coordinator-centre has been challenged, mainly for the anatomical liaison with cerebral cortex and cerebellum nuclei and cortex. These connections, organized into discrete anatomical loops, control different cerebral regions, involved in motor sequence, in behaviour or even in higher-functions, such as cognition. The properties of neurons within the basal ganglia resemble the properties of neurons within the cortical areas subserved by the specific loop; in so far, neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with areas of the motor cortex is highly correlated with motor parameters, and damage to these neurons leads to motor symptoms; neuronal activity within basal ganglia with areas of the prefrontal cortex is more related to voluntary deliberation, motivation and complex perception of the self, and the disruption of these circuits lead to higher –order deficits (Middleton and Strick, 2000). The myriad of symptoms described in basal ganglia pathologies seem {{to be determined by}} the maintenance of many of the physiological and behavioural properties of the cortical areas that they subserve, but also by the possible influence of reward on neurons within prefrontal-basal ganglia circuits. Moreover, it must be considered the effective role of white matter alterations, often seen in basal ganglia alteration (mainly in tumour, traumatic lesions and cerebrovascular accident), which might exert an extension or a modification of the possible confined effect due to a limited and selected lesion of one of the nuclei of the basal ganglia domain...|$|E

Aim: To improve diagnostics and treatment of patients with acute stroke of various types through assessment of haemostasis system and pathophysiological mechanisms of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Materials and methods: One hundred and forty five (145) patients with <b>acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>stroke</b> (mean age, 69 ± 13. 2  years; 75  male and 70   female) were included into the study. All patients were admitted to the neuroresuscitation unit within 6 to 24  hours from manifestation; the diagnosis was verified by multiaxial computerized tomography. One hundred and four (104) (71. 7 %) of patients had ischemic stroke, 41  (28. 3 %) of patients had hemorrhagic stroke. At admittance, all patients had a  certain level of consciousness derangement. All patients were monitored by means of computerized tomography, general and neurological assessment, functional assessment, chest X-ray, ultrasound examination of extremities and assessment of haemostasis (screening and direct thrombodynamics test). Results: In 95 %  of cases, VTE risk factors were found; VTE developed in 40   (27. 6 %) of patients. The most frequent complication was pulmonary embolism (90 %  of all VTE and 24. 8 %  of 145   patients). In-hospital mortality was 44. 1 %  (n= 64) and correlated with VTE (r= 0. 384; р< 0. 01). Outcomes of ischemic stroke depended mainly on VTE (at autopsy, they were found in 58. 5 %  of patients with ischemic stroke and in 26. 1 %  of those with hemorrhagic stroke) and other complications. Outcomes of hemorrhagic insult depended {{on the size of}} the lesion that correlated with severity of clinical symptoms. Screening coagulation parameters were not informative enough for the assessment of haemostasis. Development of VTE correlated with some hypercoagulation in the first days after stroke that were quickly transformed into hypocoagulation.

In recent decades, there has been significant progress in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} atherosclerosis. Intravascular ultrasound imaging provides detailed information on the anatomy of the plaque and it has been used in several studies to evaluate the results. Atherosclerosis destabilizes the normal protective mechanism provided by the endothelium and this mechanism has been involved in the pathophysiology of acute coronary disease and brain stroke. Main efforts focus on prevention, especially at early ages. This paper is a review of 68 updated bibliographic citations in order to show the current options available for the prevention and reversal of the atherosclerotic process...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Studies on Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} {{and risk of}} ischemic stroke yielded variable results. Infection with more virulent H. pylori strains, such as cytotoxin-associated gene-A (CagA) –bearing strains, may be of particular relevance for ischemic diseases. We investigated whether H. pylori and CagA seropositivity are independent risk factors for cerebral ischemia or its etiologic subtypes. Methods—We determined IgG antibodies against H. pylori and CagA protein (enzyme immunoassays) in 190 patients with <b>acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> ischemia and in 229 age- and sex-matched control subjects selected randomly from the general population. Results—CagA seropositivity was more common in patients (114 / 190; 60. 0 %) than in control subjects (99 / 229; 43. 2 %; odds ratio, 1. 97; 95 % CI, 1. 33 to 2. 91; P 0. 001). This result remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, vascular risk factors and diseases, and childhood and adult social status (odds ratio, 1. 84; 95 % CI, 1. 13 to 3. 00; P 0. 015). Subgroup analyses yielded similar results in all etiologic stroke subtypes. In contrast, H. pylori seropositivity in general {{was not associated with}} increased risk of stroke or its etiologic subtypes. Conclusions—Our results support the hypothesis of an association between infection with CagA-positive H. pylori strains and <b>acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> ischemia.

40|$|Caloric {{stimulation}} induced {{a transient}} reversal of multimodal hemispatial cognitive deficits in an 81 -year-old {{woman with an}} <b>acute</b> left <b>cerebral</b> hemisphere <b>stroke.</b> The patient had unawareness of her right hand (asomatognosia), right-sided visual unawareness (hemineglect), aphasia and right-sided weakness (hemiplegia) prior to the stimulation. Transient improvements in impaired sensory, motor, linguistic and cognitive function developed within 30 s following application of the caloric stimulus and onset of horizontal nystagmus. The effect persisted for 3 min and ceased completely after 5 min. While several recent reports have described the capacity of caloric stimulation to transiently improve or reverse {{a wide range of}} attentional, cognitive and motor impairments, most examples are in right-hemisphere-damaged patients with long-standing brain injury.

40|$|Nimodipine is a 1, 4 -dihydropyridine-derivative Ca(2 +) -channel blocker {{developed}} approximately 30 years ago. It {{is highly}} lipophilic, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and reaches brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Early treatment with nimodipine reduces {{the severity of}} neurological deficits resulting from vasospasm in subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) patients. In SAH, nimodipine reduced spasm-related deficits of all severities, but no spasm-unrelated deficits. This paper has reviewed preclinical studies {{on the influence of}} nimodipine in various animal models of cerebral ischemia, with particular attention toward investigations published in the last 10 years. These studies further support the main indication of nimodipine, by clarifying some mechanisms of the anti-ischemic activity of the compound. Papers reporting a possible role of nimodipine in epileptogenesis were also examined. Clinical studies on nimodipine were grouped into subarachnoid hemorrhage, <b>acute</b> ischemic <b>stroke,</b> <b>cerebral</b> ischemia without <b>stroke,</b> dementia disorders, and migraine. Clinical investigations have shown that the drug improves neurological outcome by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits in patients with SAH from ruptured intracranial berry aneurysms regardless of their post-ictus neurological condition. No relevant effects of treatment with nimodipine were reported for <b>acute</b> ischemic <b>stroke,</b> <b>cerebral</b> ischemia without <b>stroke,</b> and migraine, except than for cluster headache. The less pronounced cardiovascular effects of nimodipine compared to other dihydropyridine-type Ca(2 +) -channel blockers probably accounts for its use out of label for treating patients affected by chronic cerebral ischemia and vascular cognitive impairment. However, the blood pressure-lowering effects of nimodipine should not be minimized, as clinical studies have documented lowering blood pressure in small groups of patients, including cases of withdrawn due to pronounced hypotension induced by nimodipine administration. In the area of vascular cognitive impairment, short-term benefits of nimodipine do not justify its use as a long-term anti-dementia drug, and benefits obtained in elderly patients affected by subcortical vascular dementia require to be confirmed by other groups and in larger scale trials. In conclusion, nimodipine is a safe drug with an important place in pharmacotherapy and with the main documentation for reduction in the severity of neurological deficits resulting from vasospasm in SAH patients...|$|R
40|$|In <b>acute</b> ischemic <b>stroke,</b> <b>cerebral</b> {{blood supply}} is {{regionally}} challenged, typically {{as a result}} of arterial occlusion. In a subgroup of patients, however, sufficient blood supply may still be available to these challenged regions via collateral vascular pathways. 1, 2 This collateral blood supply, in particular via the leptomeningeal route, is an important and independent prog-nostic factor for patient outcome. 1, 3 – 5 Collateral blood flow is also an independent prognostic factor for successful throm-bolytic therapy. 3, 6, 7 Imaging of collateral blood supply can be divided in 2 main approaches: visualization of the collateral vessels directly or assessment of the effectiveness of collateral perfusion. 8 Visualization of collateral vessels is typically per-formed using digital subtraction angiography, MR angiography, or computed tomography angiography (CTA).

40|$|Transportation of {{patients}} requiring multiple diagnostic and imaging-guided therapeutic modalities is unavoidable in current radiological practice. This clinical scenario causes time delays and increased {{risk in the}} management of stroke and other neurovascular emergencies. Since the emergence of flat-detector technology in imaging practice in recent decades, studies have proven that flat-detector X-ray angiography in conjunction with contrast medium injection and specialized reconstruction algorithms can provide not only high-quality and high-resolution CT-like images but also functional information. This improvement in imaging technology allows quantitative assessment of intracranial hemodynamics and, subsequently in the same imaging session, provides treatment guidance for patients with neurovascular disorders by using only a flat-detector angiographic suite—a so-called one-stop quantitative imaging service (OSIS). In this paper, we review the recent developments in the field of flat-detector imaging and share our experience of applying this technology in neurovascular disorders such as <b>acute</b> ischemic <b>stroke,</b> <b>cerebral</b> aneurysm, and stenoocclusive carotid diseases...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) {{has shown}} high {{sensitivity}} {{in the diagnosis}} of acute arterial strokes. The pathophysiology of cerebral venous thrombosis with associated venous stroke appears to differ from that of arterial strokes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe DWI findings in venous strokes. Methods. The authors reviewed 3 adults with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis who underwent DWI and magnetic resonance imaging within 24 hours of symptom onset. DWI was obtained at 1. 5 T using the multishot echo planar technique (TR = 8000, TE = 97, field of view = 30 ? 19 cm, slice thickness = 6. 0 mm, interslice gap = 0. 5 mm, matrix 128 ? 128, NEX = 1). The diffusion gradients were applied in 3 orthogonal directions with 3 increasing b values (0 – 1000 s/mm 2) to create average (trace) DWI images. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis and displayed as ADC maps. Results. DWI showed hyperintensities in patients 1 and 2 and hypointensity in patient 3 in corresponding to parenchymal lesions on conventional images. As compared to the homologous uninvolved location in the contralateral hemisphere, ADC values were decreased (0. 53 ? 10 − 3 mm 2 /s [patient 1] and 0. 68 − 3 mm 2 /s [patient 2]) and increased (1. 1 ? 10 − 3 mm 2 /s [patient 3]). The ADC ratio of the lesion in the involved to uninvolved side was 88 % (patient 1), 81 % (patient 2), and 120 % (patient 3). Conclusion. <b>Acute</b> <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>strokes</b> may contain cytotoxic edema and/or vasogenic edema on DWI scans.

40|$|Background Malignant middle {{cerebral}} artery infarct syndrome is a potentially fatal complication of stroke that is poorly understood in children. We studied the frequency, associated characteristics, and outcomes of this condition in children. Methods Children, aged two months to 18  years with <b>acute</b> middle <b>cerebral</b> artery infarct diagnosed at our center between January 2005 and December 2012 were studied. Associations with malignant middle {{cerebral artery}} infarct syndrome were sought, including age, seizures, neurological deficit severity (Pediatric National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Score), stroke etiology, fever, blood pressure, blood glucose, infarct location, infarct volume (modified pediatric Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score), and arterial occlusion. Death and neurological outcomes were determined. Results Among 66 children with middle <b>cerebral</b> artery <b>stroke,</b> 12 (18 %) developed malignant middle cerebral artery infarct syndrome, fatal in three. Prolonged seizures {{during the first}} 24  hours (odds ratio, 25. 51; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 10 to 334. 81; P =  0. 005) and a higher Pediatric National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Score (odds ratio, 1. 22; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 08 to 1. 45; P =  0. 006) were independently associated with malignant middle cerebral artery infarct syndrome. All children aged greater than two years with a Pediatric National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Score ≥ 8 and initial seizures ≥ 5  minutes duration developed malignant middle cerebral artery infarct syndrome (100 %). Conclusions Malignant middle cerebral artery infarct syndrome affects nearly one in five children with <b>acute</b> middle <b>cerebral</b> artery <b>stroke.</b> Children with higher Pediatric National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Scores and prolonged initial seizures are at greatly increased risk for malignant middle cerebral artery infarct syndrome.

40|$|CT {{perfusion}} imaging {{constitutes an}} important contribu-tion {{to the early}} diagnosis of <b>acute</b> <b>stroke.</b> <b>Cerebral</b> blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and time-to-peak (TTP) maps are used to estimate the severity of <b>cerebral</b> damage after <b>acute</b> ischemia. We introduce functional cluster analysis as a new tool to evaluate CT perfusion {{in order to identify}} normal brain, ischemic tissue and large vessels. CBF, CBV and TTP maps represent the basis for cluster analysis applying a partitioning (k-means) and density-based (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, DBSCAN) paradigm. In patients with transient ischemic attack and stroke, cluster analysis identified brain areas with distinct hemodynamic properties (gray and white mat-ter) and segmented territorial ischemia. CBF, CBV and TTP values of each detected cluster were displayed. Our preliminary results indicate that functional cluster anal-ysis of CT perfusion maps may become a helpful tool for the interpretation of perfusion maps and provide a rapid means for the segmentation of ischemic tissue.
