5|$|The {{architect}} of Bush House was Richard Shackleton Pope, who constructed first the south {{part of the}} warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835–1836. Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D., E. & A. Acraman. The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with <b>arched</b> ground level entrances and <b>arched</b> windows above. This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s. Later conversion to a tea warehouse added interstitial floors.|$|E
50|$|The through <b>arch</b> bridge usually {{consists}} of two ribs, although there are examples like the Hulme <b>Arch</b> Bridge of through <b>arches</b> with a single rib. When the two <b>arches</b> are built in parallel planes, the structure is a parallel rib <b>arch</b> bridge. When the two <b>arch</b> ribs lean together and shorten {{the distance between the}} <b>arches</b> near the top, the span is a basket handle <b>arch</b> bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} true <b>arch</b> {{configurations}} are the fixed <b>arch,</b> the two-hinged <b>arch,</b> and the three-hinged <b>arch.</b>|$|R
25|$|This type of bridge {{comprises}} an <b>arch</b> {{where the}} deck is completely above the <b>arch.</b> The {{area between the}} <b>arch</b> and the deck {{is known as the}} spandrel. If the spandrel is solid, usually the case in a masonry or stone <b>arch</b> bridge, the bridge is called a closed-spandrel deck <b>arch</b> bridge. If the deck is supported by a number of vertical columns rising from the <b>arch,</b> the bridge is known as an open-spandrel deck <b>arch</b> bridge. The Alexander Hamilton Bridge is an example of an open-spandrel <b>arch</b> bridge. Finally, if the <b>arch</b> supports the deck only {{at the top of the}} <b>arch,</b> the bridge is called a cathedral <b>arch</b> bridge.|$|R

40|$|In-Plane finite {{deformation}} {{theory of}} the rib <b>arch</b> as a main structure of <b>arch</b> bridge has been developed to require arbitrariness and generality in regard to loading condition, variable cross section, plane /shape of the <b>arch</b> axis and boundary condition.

40|$|SUMMARY: The term “bovine <b>arch</b> ” {{is widely}} used to {{describe}} a common anatomic variant of the human aortic <b>arch</b> branching. This so-called bovine aortic <b>arch</b> has no resemblance to the bovine aortic <b>arch.</b> We describe the most common human aortic <b>arch</b> branching patterns and compare these with the bovine aortic <b>arch.</b> One {{of the most widely}} used misnomers in the medical lit-erature is that of the “bovine aortic <b>arch</b> ” in humans. 1, 2 This term refers to a common anatomic configuration of the aortic <b>arch.</b> By its name, the bovine aortic <b>arch</b> in humans would presumably resemble the aortic <b>arch</b> branching pattern found in the family of ruminant animals, including cattle and buffalo. However, the bovine aortic <b>arch</b> configuration as-cribed to the most common human aortic <b>arch</b> variants bears no resemblance to the aortic <b>arch</b> branching pattern found in cattle. We describe the specific anatomic appearance of hu-man and bovine aortic <b>arch</b> branching patterns and propose a simple nomenclature scheme that should supplant {{the use of the term}} “bovine aortic <b>arch</b> ” in humans...|$|R

30|$|The greater <b>arch</b> width {{that was}} seen for the {{swimmers}} represents {{the most significant}} of the results in the present study, and particularly for the upper <b>arch.</b> Only 10 swimmers had an upper <b>arch</b> reduction, with 54 with maxillary <b>arch</b> increases. Indeed, the significant correlation of the within-subject comparisons of {{the dimensions of the}} upper and lower <b>arches</b> showed more swimmers than non-swimmers with harmonious development of both dentoalveolar <b>arches.</b> Thus, significantly more of the non-swimmers showed differential development between one <b>arch</b> and the antagonist <b>arch,</b> indicating that the swimmers show significantly improved within-subject development of the upper and the lower dentoalveolar <b>arches.</b>|$|R

5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or <b>arched</b> line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, {{because of the lack}} of stopover or feeding sites, or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} (rear) of the Ellwood House, the {{circular}} limestone water tower is about 50 feet (15.2 m) tall {{and has a}} diameter of 18 feet (5.5 m). The tower has windows occurring at different levels, which are <b>arched</b> and include keystones in their design. The water tower was built in 1879, {{the same year as}} Ellwood House, and at that time the structure was topped with a wooden water tank with a conical roof. Between 1897 and 1910 the wooden tank was removed and replaced with an additional 30 courses of stone which matched the original structure. The <b>arched</b> door {{at the base of the}} water tower was replaced with a larger square-shaped double door. The roof remained conical and of wood construction until about 1950 when it was replaced with sheet metal.|$|E

More than 150 {{concrete}} <b>arch</b> bridges and more than 130 CFST <b>arch</b> bridges with a span over 100 m have been built. Great developments of <b>arch</b> bridges have been taking place since 1990. The three main kind <b>arch</b> bridges with world span records were built in this period, i. e., 550 m Lu Pu Bridge for steel <b>arch</b> bridge, 420 m Wanxian Yangtze River Bridge for reinforced concrete <b>arch</b> bridge and 460 m Wu-shan Yangtze River Bridge for concrete filled steel tubular <b>arch</b> bridge. <b>Arch</b> bridge is still developing.

5|$|Pursuit-deterrent {{signals are}} {{behavioral}} signals used by prey that convince predators {{not to pursue}} them.

40|$|ObjectiveOpen total <b>arch</b> {{procedures}} {{have been associated}} with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple comorbidities. Aortic <b>arch</b> debranching with endovascular graft placement, the hybrid <b>arch</b> procedure, has emerged as a surgical option in this patient population. This study evaluates the outcomes of a contemporary comparative series from one institution of open total <b>arch</b> and hybrid <b>arch</b> procedures for extensive aortic <b>arch</b> pathology. MethodsFrom July 2000 to March 2009, 1196 open <b>arch</b> procedures were performed, including 45 elective and 7 emergency open total <b>arch</b> procedures. From 2005 to 2009, 64 hybrid <b>arch</b> procedures were performed: 37 emergency type A dissections and 27 elective open <b>arch</b> debranchings. Hemiarch procedures were excluded. ResultsThe hybrid <b>arch</b> cohort was significantly older (P = . 008) and had greater predominance of atherosclerotic pathophysiology (P < . 001). The incidence of permanent cerebral neurologic deficit was similar at 4 % (1 / 27) for the hybrid <b>arch</b> cohort and 9 % (4 / 45) for the open aortic <b>arch</b> cohort. In-hospital mortality was similar at 11 % (3 / 27) for the hybrid <b>arch</b> cohort and 16 % (7 / 45) for the open aortic <b>arch</b> cohort. However, in the open <b>arch</b> group, {{there was a significant difference}} in mortality between patients aged less than 75 years at 9 % (3 / 34) and patients aged more than 75 years at 36 % (4 / 11) (P = . 05). ConclusionsHybrid <b>arch</b> procedures provide a safe alternative to open repair. This study suggests the hybrid <b>arch</b> approach has a lower mortality for high-risk patients aged more than 75 years. This extends the indication for the hybrid <b>arch</b> approach in patients with complex aortic <b>arch</b> pathology previously considered prohibitively high risk for conventional open total <b>arch</b> repair...|$|R
