5|$|Studies on {{embryogenesis}} {{and developmental}} biology. Mutants {{are created by}} adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting. By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> go wrong in this process. These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the homeobox genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach {{focuses on the}} links between this form of castle <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> be termed a feudal mode of society. The spread of motte-and-bailey castles was usually {{closely tied to the}} creation of local fiefdoms and feudal landowners, and areas without this method of governance rarely built these castles. Yet another theory suggests that the design emerged {{as a result of the}} pressures of space on ringworks, and that the earliest motte-and-baileys were converted ringworks. Finally, there may be a link between the local geography and the building of motte-and-bailey castles, which are usually built on low-lying areas, in many cases subject to regular flooding. Regardless of the reasons behind the initial popularity of the motte-and-bailey design, however, there is widespread agreement that the castles were first widely adopted in Normandy and Angevin territory in the 10th and 11th centuries.|$|E

In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E

5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> only be conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-Medieval painter.|$|E

25|$|Food versus fuel is {{the dilemma}} {{regarding}} {{the risk of}} diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production {{to the detriment of}} the food supply. The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature. There is disagreement about the significance of the issue, what is causing it, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> or should be done to remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects. The academic side of the debate is also blurred by the use of different economic models and competing forms of statistical analysis.|$|E

They write that [...] "the crucial unifing and distinctive feature of these contributions <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> properly be said to mark them out as a 'political turn' {{is the way in which}} they imagine how political institutions, structures and processes might be transformed so as to secure justice for both human and nonhuman animals".|$|E

[...] This motto serves as a constant reminder {{of the history of the}} parish. The beauty of the Mellon Mansion was restored by {{the congregation}} and turned into a House of God. This was done through a strong love of Christ, faith, and neighbor. The names of the volunteers who helped build the church are carved in the marble inside the main entrance of the church and serve as a token of the congregation's appreciation. Many of today's parishioners are descendants of those volunteers and are proud to tell the story of their forefathers who gave them this church in which to practice their faith.|$|E
500|$|Turn Based - Much like in Dungeons and Dragons {{this method}} of {{conflict}} resolution is taken in turns. This combat format is the primary system used in Theater-style LARPs. How turns work <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> be done during each turn {{is determined by the}} creator's of the game. Generally, who goes first is determined by some form of indicator {{and in the case of}} LARPs it is usually who acts first, this begins the engagement, essentially giving them an opportunity attack. Movement during a turn is determined by that character's movement speed, while actions are can be either consistent and unchanged rules or character specific. Each individual in the conflict has certain actions they can take on their turn. Chess is an example of a turn based game where who goes first is determined by the color of the pieces. That player now gets to make their movement, which in this case movement is synonymous to action. After their action resolves the other player's turn begins. This differs from the 'No-Touch' System, because a Turn Based LARP does not also mean no touching, although it can. An action from one character could end with their hand on the other character's shoulder. An example of a LARP that utilizes this system is the Otakon convention which also has its [...]|$|E

Uncut magazine's Simon Reynolds found most of the songs brilliant and highlighted by what he called an unparalleled use of vocal samples by West, while Josh Tyrangiel from Time said the sampling and string arrangements on [...] "Gone" [...] may persuade listeners to believe West's own hype. In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis praised West's topicality and subversive studio production, writing that [...] "Late Registration suggests an artist effortlessly outstripping his peers: more ideas, better lyrics, bigger hooks, greater depth." [...] The Observer viewed the album as a significant milestone in hip hop while calling West [...] "the Brian Wilson of hip-hop" [...] because he [...] "plays up the struggle between conscience and covetousness, the pop mainstream <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> be achieved within the notional boundaries of hip hop". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times compared West's dignified execution of pop crossover to that of The Beatles, Johnny Cash, and Bob Marley. Sean Fennessey from Pitchfork felt West avoided the sophomore slump with an [...] "expansive, imperfect masterpiece" [...] that drew on his enthusiastic, ambitious, and scattered personality. Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, praised the album's [...] "exquisite details", both lyrical and musical, and concluded that West is [...] "as good as he thinks he is... He wants everybody to buy this record. So do I"; he would later assign it an [...] "A+" [...] grade.|$|E

For several years, {{it was difficult to}} participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied.
