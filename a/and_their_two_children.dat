She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of Lifes July 1964 issue.|$|E
5|$|Mitt Romney {{wanted to}} pursue a {{business}} career, but his father advised him that a law degree would be valuable to his career even if he never practiced law.

He was nonideological and did not involve himself in the political issues of the day.
