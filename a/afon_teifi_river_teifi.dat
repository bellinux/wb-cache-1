25|$|The Cors Caron {{sequence}} of peat domes (also known as Tregaron Bog) developed on the floodplain of the <b>Afon</b> (<b>River)</b> <b>Teifi</b> in mid-Wales now represents the most intact surviving {{example in the}} UK of a raised bog landscape (macrotope). The three main extant domes are hydrologically isolated by the <b>River</b> <b>Teifi</b> and associated surface drainage features, and all three have suffered extensive damage as a con{{sequence of}} past drainage and peat-cutting. The river terraces associated with the component bog mesotopes are regularly flooded and support vegetation that includes reed canary-grass Phalaris arundinacea, soft rush Juncus effusus, purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea and, more rarely, water sedge Carex aquatilis. Substantial areas of the surface of each of the three component bogs still retain good quality active raised bog vegetation mainly referable to NVC type M18 Sphagnum papillosum – Erica tetralix community, with frequent bog-rosemary Andromeda polifolia and white beak-sedge Rhynchospora alba and, more locally, the bog-mosses Sphagnum magellanicum and S. pulchrum. Extensive areas with a high cover of heather Calluna vulgaris and deergrass Trichophorum cespitosum are also present, while purple moor-grass M. caerulea is particularly prominent on the more modified bog margins. Although present as an important peat-former until as recently as the 18th century, Sphagnum imbricatum is absent from the contemporary bog flora.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a geomorphological and sedimentological investigation of former glacial meltwater drainage in the region of the lower <b>Afon</b> <b>Teifi,</b> one of the major rivers of southwest Wales. Former drainage characteristics in the region are reconstructed concentrating on palaeo-drainage routes associated with successive Pleistocene glaciations and their role in the Quaternary evolution of the lower Teifi. Mapping of these features throughout a c. 100 km 2 area reveals a complex evolution in the establishment of the present-day drainage system, with evidence for the following surface channel types: (i) type 1 channels of primary subglacial origin cut during the late Devensian (late Wisconsinan/late Weichselian) glaciation; (ii) type 2 channels representing either pre-late Devensian subaerial fluvial run-off unconnected to the course of the preglacial <b>Afon</b> <b>Teifi,</b> or originating as subglacial chute channels; (iii) type 3 channels developed as subglacially modified pre-late Devensian tributaries of the <b>Afon</b> <b>Teifi.</b> Two further features are also described: (iv) type 4 channels are drift-plugged abandoned preglacial courses of the <b>Afon</b> <b>Teifi,</b> and (v) type 5 channels formed as lateglacial and post-late Devensian gorges which bypass type 4 channels. A relative chronostratigraphy based on channel geomorphology and sedimentology reveals an evolutionary sequence considerably more complicated than identified in previous studies, with extensive modification of the lower <b>Afon</b> <b>Teifi</b> region by glacial meltwater during at least two periods of Pleistocene glaciation.
