2500|$|The lead ship {{is named}} [...] for Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, and carries the hull number DDG-1000. Originally 32 ships were planned, with $9.6 billion {{research}} and development costs spread across the class. [...] As costs overran estimates, the quantity was reduced to 24, then to 7, and finally to 3, significantly increasing the cost-per-ship to $3.96 billion (excluding R costs)well-exceeding the per-unit cost of a nuclear-powered [...] ($2.688 billion). [...] The dramatic per-unit cost increases eventually triggered a Nunn-McCurdy <b>Amendment</b> breach <b>and</b> <b>cancellation</b> of further production. [...] In April 2016, the total program cost was $22.5 billion with an average cost of $7.5 billion per ship.|$|R
40|$|A {{stator flux}} {{oriented}} {{synchronous reference frame}} - phase locked loop (SRF-PLL) is proposed for the precise computation of rotor speed and position of permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). A direct method of rotational speed computation based on the stator electromotive force (EMF) is initially formulated. Using the speed as a reference to the inverse Park and Clarke transformation blocks, the three-phase positive sequence stator flux is derived. A pre-stage low pass filter (LPF) is implemented to cancel out the ripples in the d-q components of the stator flux introduced by the dynamic operating conditions of inverter non-linearities and grid disturbances. The estimated three-phase positive sequence stator flux is used to compute the rotor position by aligning the total stator flux along the direct axis through a PLL block. Provision of the frequency <b>amendment</b> <b>and</b> ripple <b>cancellation</b> outside the PLL block results in a fast-dynamic response with an enhanced frequency adaptable capability. To validate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, the sensorless vector control of grid integrated PMSM based wind-driven generator (WG) is analytically verified using the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation tool under various dynamic operating conditions such as wind speed variation and grid disturbances...|$|R
