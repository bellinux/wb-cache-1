On 28 May, the Great Barrier Reef was sighted; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the launch into <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> lagoon.

5|$|After delays, {{the voyage}} began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years.

He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship.

The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E
