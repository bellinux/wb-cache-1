5|$|After the 1942 season, Lavelli {{was drafted}} by the U.S. Army as American {{involvement}} in World War II intensified. After basic training {{and a number of}} other specialized courses on land-sea assaults, he was sent with the 28th Infantry Division to fight in the European Theatre of World War II. There his division landed on Omaha Beach, part of the Allied invasion of Germany-occupied France in 1944. He was involved with <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> Germany's Battle of the Bulge offensive and in the Siege of Bastogne later the same year. One in five members of his division was killed in battle.|$|E

5|$|The goal of <b>American</b> armed <b>forces</b> was to {{reinforce}} {{the remnants of the}} South Korean Army (ROK) in fighting back the North Korean invasion (but only in the southeastern part of South Korea, around the major seaport of Pusan) to prevent the complete collapse of the South Korean Army and of the South Korean Government. However, the <b>American</b> armed <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> the Orient had been decreasing steadily since the end of World War II, by mid-1950, there were no American troops in South Korea, and the <b>American</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> Japan had dwindled drastically.|$|R
5|$|<b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> Iraq were {{withdrawn}} {{in large}} numbers in 2009 and 2010, {{and the war in}} the region was declared formally over in December 2011. The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency, leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region. In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba {{for the first time since}} 1961. The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran's nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|Another radical leader, Communist {{spokesman}} and one-time {{leader of}} <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> the Spanish Civil War Harry Haywood, {{was born in}} 1898 in South Omaha as Haywood Hall to parents who were former slaves. In 1913 his father was beaten by a white gang at the South Omaha meatpacking plant where he worked, forcing the family {{to move from the}} city. The African Blood Brotherhood, started in Omaha, contributed to radicalizing Haywood when he joined it the group in Chicago, where his family had moved in 1915.|$|E
5|$|By 23 August, the {{remainder}} of the Wehrmacht's Seventh Army had entrenched itself along the Seine River, in preparation for the defence of Paris. Simultaneously, elements of Army Group G—including the German 15th Army and the 5th Panzer Army—moved to engage <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> the south. In the following week, elements of the Canadian 1st Army repeatedly attacked these German units on the Seine in attempts to break through to the Channel Ports. On the evening of 23 August, French and American Army units entered Paris.|$|E

Tens of thousands of miners and associated people arrived during the California Gold Rush, and their activities in some areas meant {{the end of the}} Californios' ranching lifestyle. Many of the English-speaking 49ers turned from mining to farming and moved, often illegally, onto land granted to Californios by the former Mexican government.|$|R
50|$|Underwater warfare was {{especially}} dangerous; of the 16,000 Americans {{who went out}} on patrol, 3,500 (22%) never returned, the highest casualty rate of any <b>American</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> World War II. The Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee assessed U.S. Submarine credits. The Japanese losses, 130 submarines in all, were even higher.|$|R

Departing Washington, D.C. by air on 14 January 1942, Johns arrived in Surabaya nine days later. His first mission was to provide airfield facilities on Java for 2,000 aircraft. Tapping into the vast resources of labour available in one of the world's most densely populated regions, Johns set about readying the required airfields. However, Java was captured by the Japanese before the aircraft arrived.|$|E

He was {{captured}} by <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> June 1945, who tried to use him to assist in setting up a counterintelligence network in Germany, the Gehlen Organization. After he was caught trying to defraud the network, he fled to Peru. Although he periodically acted as an informant for Peruvian intelligence, {{he was arrested for}} currency smuggling and selling state secrets. After a two-year prison sentence, he was deported to West Germany where he was tried for a wartime murder in 1979; he was given a suspended sentence for manslaughter.|$|E

There, he met Anna Purnell, {{the daughter of a}} Chicago businessman, who was there as a YMCA volunteer. The two were married in August 1919. They had three children together, all daughters. While in Germany, Somervell also met Walker D. Hines, a prominent New York corporate lawyer, whom he assisted with a survey of shipping and navigation on the Rhine River. Somervell reverted to the permanent rank of major on 1 July 1920.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{thrust into}} the Pacific region had begun in early December 1941 with attacks against British and Commonwealth forces in the Battle of Hong Kong and the Malayan campaign, and against the US Pacific Fleet, much of which was caught at anchor in Pearl Harbor. They rapidly {{advanced}} south, overwhelming resistance in Malaya, capturing Singapore in February 1942, and successfully occupying Timor, Rabaul and the Dutch East Indies. While a Japanese naval operation aimed at capturing Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May, elsewhere <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> the Philippines capitulated, and Japanese forces advanced towards India through Burma.|$|E
5|$|The accords {{had been}} {{negotiated}} by United States National Security Advisor Kissinger and North Vietnamese politburo member Lê Đức Thọ. South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu {{was not involved}} in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of <b>American</b> <b>forces.</b> <b>In</b> multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend Thieu's government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.|$|E
5|$|To {{supplement}} the defences of Fiji, the brigade group was reinforced from New Zealand with the 14th Brigade.

5|$|When Luna {{saw that}} the American advance had halted, mainly to {{stabilize}} their lines, he again mobilized his troops to attack La Loma on February 10. Fierce fighting ensued but the Filipinos were forced to withdraw thereafter. Caloocan was left with <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> control of the southern terminus of the Manila to Dagupan railway, along with five engines, fifty passenger coaches, and a hundred freight cars. After consolidating control of Caloocan, the obvious next objective for American forces would be the Republic capital at Malolos. However, General Otis delayed for almost a month in hopes that Filipino forces would be deployed in its defense.|$|E
5|$|Brereton sent Haynes to Dinjan Airfield in the Indian {{state of}} Assam to {{continue}} his supply-line work under the name Assam-Burma-China Ferry Command, or ABC Ferry Command, with the mission of supplying <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> China. This air organization was formed to carry supplies over the Hump, the air route replacement for the enemy-held Burma Road. At first, Haynes worked with only two C-47 transports, and was accompanied on some missions by just one P-40 Warhawk fighter flown by the outfit's executive of operations, Colonel Robert Lee Scott, Jr., who had shifted to flying a fighter once HALPRO was canceled. When Burma appeared to be falling to the Japanese, Haynes {{and a handful of}} other airmen of the Chinese National Aviation Corporation and the Royal Air Force flew hundreds of evacuation missions from April to mid-June, bringing some 4,500 passengers westward to safety in India. The American ferry aircraft would typically deliver supplies to China then stop in Burma on the way back to Assam.|$|E
5|$|Eichelberger's {{period in}} command of the 77th Infantry Division was brief, for on 18 June 1942 he became {{commander}} of I Corps, with Byers as his chief of staff. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service with the 77th Infantry Division. I Corps consisted of the 8th, 30th and 77th Infantry Divisions. Eichelberger was given the initial task of arranging a demonstration for dignitaries including Winston Churchill, Marshall, Henry Stimson, Sir John Dill and Sir Alan Brooke. The demonstration was judged a success, although the trained eyes of Brooke and Lesley McNair noted flaws. Within days, two of the division commanders were relieved of their commands. Eichelberger was nominated to command <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> Operation Torch, and he was ordered to conduct training in amphibious warfare with the 3rd, 9th and 30th Infantry Divisions in Chesapeake Bay in cooperation with Rear Admiral Kent Hewitt.|$|E

5|$|In December 1776, British forces {{occupied}} Newport, Rhode Island. <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> New England {{were not}} strong enough to dislodge the garrison there, which was also supported by Royal Navy vessels that used Newport as a base. This situation changed in 1778, following the entry of France into the war, when the French and Americans agreed to embark on joint operations against the British. The French sent a fleet under the command of French Admiral comte d'Estaing to provide troops and naval support. The fleet arrived off the coast of New York City in July 1778 but found the port well-defended, and d'Estaing further believed that its bar would be too shallow for his largest ships to cross. He then sailed instead for Newport, where he and General John Sullivan prepared to besiege the British garrison.|$|E
5|$|South Korean forces, meanwhile, had emplaced in {{the wrong}} position, a mile too far south, and were not in contact with 19th Infantry. The South Korean forces were {{subsequently}} hit with friendly and enemy fire, and in the confusion the 19th Infantry attempted to block the South Koreans from advancing, thinking them enemy forces. North Korean snipers were able to infiltrate {{the rear of the}} position and kill five UN soldiers with shots {{to the back of the}} head. However American forces repelled several advances on the right flank. The M4 Shermans gave the American force a superiority in armor over the North Koreans for the first time, and were crucial in pushing back each attempted North Korean advance. North Korean infantry, unsupported by armor of their own, suffered heavy casualties from the <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> their positions on the high ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight was}} one of the first {{victories}} for <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> repelling the North Korean advance. In stopping the North Korean advance at the Notch and around Masan, the UN forces were able to halt the progress of the North Korean 4th and 6th Divisions, grounding their flanking moves to a halt and forcing them to withdraw to rebuild and re-supply. In the meantime, the American forces along the perimeter were being reinforced by heavier infantry and armor formations every day. The North Korean defeat and retreat around the Masan region allowed both sides several critical days of reprieve from battle. This would end when the North Korean force began its final offensive on the UN forces in its coordinated assault on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
