5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> the remains by an assailant.|$|E

However, the couple {{mutually}} agrees to end their long-running relationship after realizing that Richard does not want children, while Monica aspires to eventually raise a family of her own one day. While in England attending Ross' second wedding, to Emily (Helen Baxendale), Monica sleeps with Chandler. Initially supposed to have been a casual, one-time thing which grew more recurrent, Monica and Chandler eventually develop feelings for each other, but <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> it from their friends for as long as possible. After finally revealing their relationship to their friends, who are delighted by the news, Monica proposes to Chandler, and they marry.|$|E
5|$|The sisters {{participated in}} the Battle of Midway in June 1942, {{although}} they did not see any combat. Mutsu saw more active service than her sister because {{she was not a}} flagship and {{participated in the}} Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August before returning to Japan in early 1943. One of Mutsus aft magazines detonated in June, killing 1,121 crew and visitors and destroying the ship. The IJN conducted a perfunctory investigation into the cause of her loss and concluded that it was the work of a disgruntled crewmember. They dispersed the survivors in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> the sinking to keep up morale in Japan. Much of the wreck was salvaged after the war and many artifacts and relics are on display in Japan.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, the Jewels went {{on public}} {{display in the}} Jewel House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a {{cupboard}} {{and showed it to}} visitors for a small fee. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and, with the help of three accomplices, stole a crown, a sceptre and an orb. They were apprehended at the perimeter, and the items were recovered, though some had been damaged: the crown was flattened with a mallet in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> it, and there was a dent in the orb. Blood was not only pardoned, but also given land and a pension. It has been suggested that he was a government spy. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.|$|E

5|$|In the East, Diocletian {{engaged in}} {{diplomacy}} with desert tribes {{in the regions}} between Rome and Persia. He might have been attempting to persuade them to ally themselves with Rome, thus reviving the old, Rome-friendly, Palmyrene sphere of influence, or simply attempting to reduce the frequency of their incursions. No details survive for these events. Some of the princes of these states were Persian client kings, a disturbing fact in light of increasing tensions with the Sassanids. In the West, Maximian lost the fleet built in 288 and 289, probably {{in the early spring}} of 290. The panegyrist who refers to the loss suggests that its cause was a storm, but this might simply have been an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> an embarrassing military defeat. Diocletian broke off his tour of the Eastern provinces soon thereafter. He returned with haste to the West, reaching Emesa by 10 May 290, and Sirmium on the Danube by 1 July 290.|$|E
5|$|On September 5, 1920, Polish Foreign Minister Eustachy Sapieha {{delivered}} a diplomatic {{note to the}} League of Nations asking it {{to intervene in the}} Polish–Lithuanian War. He claimed that Lithuania allowed free passage through its territory for Soviet troops and therefore violated its declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. The next day Lithuania responded with a direct note to Poland in which Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Purickis proposed to negotiate a demarcation line and other issues in Marijampolė. On September 8, during a planning meeting for what later was the Battle of the Niemen River, the Poles decided to maneuver through the Lithuanian territory {{to the rear of the}} Soviet Army. In an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> the planned attack, Polish diplomats accepted the proposal to negotiate. The negotiations started on September 16 in Kalvarija, but collapsed just two days later.|$|E

On June 7, 2013, federal prosecutors indicated that they sought a four-year prison sentence for Jackson. On August 14, 2013, Jackson was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison, while wife Sandi was sentenced to 12 months in prison for filing false tax returns in <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> the crimes. The two sentences did not run concurrently. Rather, Jackson initially served prison time and upon his release, his wife was to begin her prison sentence shortly thereafter. The staggered sentences allowed for the Jackson children {{to have access to}} at least one parent during the time each is in prison.|$|E

5|$|Many Public Storage {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public Storage representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their storage units then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public Storage. For example, claims {{have been denied}} because the storage unit had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of insurance companies affiliated with Public Storage. An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public Storage misleads consumers into thinking that insurance premiums are charged at cost, whereas {{a substantial amount of}} those premiums are retained as profits by Public Storage. Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E

25|$|The castle is an {{excellent}} example of social control manifested in architectural space. Low-ranking visitors were received in the outer regions of the Ninomaru, whereas high-ranking visitors were shown the more subtle inner chambers. Rather than <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> the entrances to the rooms for bodyguards (as was done in many castles), the Tokugawas chose to display them prominently. Thus, the construction lent itself to expressing intimidation and power to Edo-period visitors.|$|E

Mr. Pigeon's name had been mentioned {{in connection with a}} 2007 election scandal of the county executive campaign of former West Seneca Supervisor Paul T. Clark. Erie County’s Republican elections commissioner alleged that former Democratic Chairman G.

According to Cerf, the panel could often determine {{the identities of the}} mystery guests early, as they knew which celebrities were in town, or which major movies or plays were about to open.

25|$|Unlike the pre-{{invasion}} period, certain Israeli Defense Force (IDF) {{actions on}} the eve of and after the invasion aimed at driving out the Arab population from villages close to Jewish settlements or adjacent to main roads. These measures appeared necessary in face of the looming military threat by the invading Arab armies. The Israelis held the Palestinians responsible for the distress that the invasion caused and believed they deserved severe punishment. The local deportations of May–June 1948 appeared both militarily vital and morally justified. Confident that their conduct was indispensable, the troops did not <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> harsh treatment of civilians in their after-action reports.|$|E
25|$|The {{gas line}} {{from the back of}} the house's furnace had been pulled out in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> {{evidence}} of the homicide. The accumulating gas was later ignited by a candle that Fisher had allegedly lit, waiting for the gas to accumulate and descend to the flame hours after being lit. This delayed fuse would have given Fisher an approximate 10 hour head start in his successful attempt to evade law enforcement. Burned bodies of a woman and two children were found lying in bed in the remains of the burnt out house. They were identified as Mary (age 38), and her two children, Brittney (age 12) and Bobby (age 10). Investigators have theorized that Fisher murdered his family because he felt threatened by Mary's intent to divorce him, and didn't want his children to go through what he did as a child.|$|E
25|$|An {{incident}} {{regarding the}} character of Sidney Dillon (or William S. Paley) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon {{is said to have}} told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood stain on the sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends {{the rest of the night}} and early morning manually washing the sheet with scalding water in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning. In the end, Dillon falls asleep on a damp sheet and wakes up to a note from his wife telling him she had arrived while he was sleeping, did not want to wake him, and that she would see him at home.|$|E
