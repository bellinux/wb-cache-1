40|$|A {{computer-assisted}} teleoperator {{control system}} for making comparative performance evaluations is described. A local and {{a remote control}} station, each with decision-making capability, {{communicate with each other}} through a simulated time delay. Supervisory control at three increasingly automatic levels is possible. The highest level of programmed control is facilitated through the <b>ARM</b> <b>language</b> which was developed to permit easily readable program manuscripts to be written and assembled into programs of motions by novice programmers. Experimental results show the advantage of this form of supervisory control with both direct and delayed (3 sec) manipulation tasks. In addition, two systems to measure and reproduce force distributions have been designed. One system reproduces contact on the external surfaces of the remote hand using 21 airjet simulators. Another system reproduces the shape of the contact between object and jaws using 288 piezoelectric (bimorph) stimulators...|$|E

50|$|RISC OS was a rapid {{development}} of Arthur 1.2 after {{the failure of}} the ARX project. The first release was to be called Arthur 2, but was renamed to RISC OS 2, and was first sold as RISC OS 2.00 in April 1989. The operating system implements co-operative multitasking with some limitations but is not multi-threaded. It uses the ADFS file system for both floppy and hard disc access. It initially ran from a 512 KB set of ROMs. The WIMP interface offers all the standard features and fixes many of the bugs that had hindered Arthur. It lacks virtual memory and extensive memory protection (applications are protected from each other, but many functions have to be implemented as 'modules' which have full access to the memory). At the time of release, the main advantage of the OS was its ROM; it booted very quickly and while it was easy to crash, it was impossible to permanently break the OS from software. Its high performance was due to much of the system being written in <b>ARM</b> assembly <b>language.</b>|$|R

Therefore, {{in order to}} improve the method of monitoring the velocity of vehicles on road, this paper has designed a new radar velocity-measuring system which is based on ARM processor. This system is based on Doppler principle and spectral estimation algorithm, in its hardware design part, and it takes full use of the underlying resources of ARM processor, to achieve sample, digital signal processing and peripheral control in the separate ARM core. In the software design part, it analyses the main program flow, at the same time, since the ARM processor does not support hardware floating-point operations, it puts forward the usage of fixed-point numbers to store and calculate floating-point numbers, Which makes the data loading and storage minimization And it uses <b>ARM</b> assembly <b>language</b> to write the core algorithm and takes full advantage of the 5 -stage pipeline of ARM processor, to achieve the right register allocation and instruction scheduling for fine-grained control, and also to avoid the pipeline inter locks.

40|$|Abstract—When a high-energy {{particle}} {{such as a}} proton {{strikes a}} CPU, the impact may result in the corruption of a data register on the CPU. Such a single-event upset (SEU), in which a random bit is flipped {{in the content of}} a data register, can lead to critical errors in the execution of a program. This is particularly problematic for security- or safety-critical systems where such errors may have grave consequences. In this paper we develop a formal semantic framework for easy formal modelling of a large variety of SEUs in a core assembly language capturing the essential features of the <b>ARM</b> assembly <b>language.</b> We use this framework to formally prove the soundness of a static analysis enforcing so-called blue/green separation in a given program. Blue/green separation is a replication based technique for making a program fault-tolerant with respect to data-flow SEUs; however, full coverage requires special hardware support. We further use our semantic framework for deriving program fragments, so-called gadgets, for partial blue/green separation without special hardware. Finally, we illustrate how to apply statistical model checking in our framework to model and quantify faults that go well beyond data-flow SEUs and can provide statistics on the level of fault-tolerance of a program. We use this to provide evidence that our suggested program modifications significantly decrease the probability of such errors going undetected...|$|R
