40|$|The {{majority}} of laboratory animals were transported from commercial breeders to a research facility by ground transportation. During the transportation, many biological functions and {{systems can be}} affected by stress. In this experiment, the change of body weight during the transportation was measured and the recovery periods from the transportation stress established based on the body weight changes. Total 676 laboratory animals which were aged between 3 to 9 wk old were studied. The transportation time taken from container packing to unpacking the container was approximately 24 h. The temperature of <b>animal</b> <b>container</b> was constantly maintained by air-conditioning and heating equipment. Rats {{were found to be}} more sensitive than mice. The body weight of rats was significantly decreased 3. 71 % (p< 0. 05) compared to the body weight of mice which decreased 0. 9 % There {{was no significant difference between}} the strains in the same species. When the changes of body weights were compared between delivery days, C 57 BL/ 6 mice showed the most variable changes compared to other species and strains. Consequently, C 57 BL/ 6 was more sensitive to stress than the other strains and the transportation process needs to be standardized to reduce between day variability. To establish the recovery periods from transportation stress, the body weight changes were measured during the acclimation period. Although the body weight of animals decreased during transportation, animals recovered their weight loss after the next day...|$|E

50|$|Controlled {{atmosphere}} killing (CAK) or {{controlled atmosphere}} stunning (CAS) {{is a method}} for slaughtering animals such as chickens by placing the <b>animals</b> in a <b>container</b> in which the atmosphere lacks oxygen and consists of an asphyxiant gas (one or more of argon, nitrogen or carbon dioxide), causing the animals to lose consciousness. Argon and nitrogen are important components of a gassing process which seem to cause no pain, {{and for this reason}} many consider some types of controlled atmosphere killing more humane than other methods of killing. If carbon dioxide is used, controlled atmosphere killing {{is not the same as}} inert gas asphyxia, because carbon dioxide at high concentrations (above 5%) is not biologically inert, but rather is toxic and also produces initial distress in a number of animal species. The addition of toxic carbon dioxide to hypoxic atmospheres used in slaughter without animal distress is a complex and highly species-specific matter, which also depends on concentration of carbon dioxide.|$|R

40|$|Dairy {{producers}} must increasingly {{comply with}} environmental regula-tions at the federal, {{state and local}} levels. A key {{to many of the}} regula-tions is the development of manure management plans to protect air, water and soil quality. Information on complete nutrient balances and excretion is necessary to control or minimize the loss of nutrients to the environment. Data from 51 ran-domly selected dairy farms in Merced County, in California’s Central Valley, was used to evaluate the impact of minerals in drinking water on nutri-ent balances and to characterize the mineral composition of manure from lactating dairy cows. We found that a lactating dairy cow producing ap-proximately 66 pounds of milk daily might excrete 750 ± 117 grams of minerals daily, while the proportion of these minerals attributed to water ranged from 0. 3 % to 20 %. On some dairies, controlling these minerals could reduce manure production and subsequent land applications. IN recent years, environmental regulations have been applied to the U. S. dairy industry. These regula-tions are aimed at protecting air, water and soils from excess nutrients excreted by cattle and manure applications. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimina-tion System (NPDES) prohibits the dis-charge of pollutants into waters of the United States unless a special permit is issued by the U. S. Environmental Pro-tection Agency (EPA). In 2003, this law was extended to confined animal feed-ing operations (CAFOs), including most dairies; many of the deadlines were extended to 2007. In general, this permit system is enforced by California’s Regional Water Quality Control Boards and various county ordinances. All dairy farms represent possible “discharges”; most producers have submitted Waste Management Plans to their regional board providing a complete evaluation of the existing dairy (facilities, <b>animals,</b> waste <b>containers,</b> flood protection, and so on) (US EPA 2004).

Comprehensive analysis of movement requires detection and analysis of relations that occur between moving objects and elements of the context in the process of the movement. We suggest a conceptual model in which movement is considered as a combination of spatial events of diverse types and extents in space and time. Spatial and temporal relations occur between movement events and elements of the spatial and temporal contexts. The model gives a ground to a generic approach based on extraction of interesting events from trajectories and treating the events as independent objects. By means of a prototype implementation, we tested the approach on complex real data about movement of wild animals. The testing showed the validity of the approach...|$|R

40|$|During {{the period}} from December 2014 to April 2015, a {{mosquito}} survey (Diptera: Culicidae) was conducted at Al Rayyan Municipality, western region of Qatar. The survey aimed to identify the most common mosquitoes species {{in the study area}} and assess their potential in transmitting malaria. In all, 37 collection sites were visited throughout the study period revealing 312 mosquitoes. Larvae were collected as well as adults. The pH of larvae breeding sites was also measured in the laboratory. Also, Several maps have been produced using GIS, showing sampling locations. Species identification was carried out using the available standard keys. The survey revealed the presence of four mosquito species representing three genera: Culex 91 % (3 species), Anopheles 6 % (1 species) and Coquillettidia 3 %. The species encountered were: Culex vagans (Wiedemann 1828), Culex mimeticus (Noe 1899), Culex bitaeniorhynchus (Giles 1901) and Anopheles stephensi (Liston 1901). Results showed that the most abundant mosquitoes were Culex, although there was no previous record of the new encountered species. Encountered breeding sites were sewage waste water bonds, construction water tanks, <b>animals</b> drinking <b>containers</b> and abundant small containers. Malaria in Qatar is not endemic, however, {{it is one of the}} utmost frequently introduced communicable diseases. The presence of malaria vector borne diseases (Anopheles stephensi), availability of breeding sites, and the presence of individuals who are infected with malaria protozoans (Plasmodium spp.), states the risk of a reintroduction of malaria to Qatar. اجريت هذه الدراسة المسحية بهدف معرفة اجناس) انواع(البعوض الاكثر انتشارا في بلدية الريان بدولة قطر وذلك في الفترة من شهر ديسمبر 2014 م الي شهر ابريل 2015 وخلال هذه الدراسة تم جمع العينات من 37 موقعا واشتملت العينات اليرقات بالاضافة الى البعوض البالغ والذي وصل عدده 312 فرد) بعوضة(كما قيست درجة حموضة مياه التوالد في المعمل. وبالاضافة الى ذلك تم تقديم خرائط لتوزيع الانواع المختلفة وذلك باستخدام احد برامج نظم المعلومات الجغرافية. وبناء علي احدث المفاتيح التصنيفية للبعوض تم تعريف ثلاثة اجناس: Culex, Anopheles and Coquillettidia واربعة انواع Culex vagans Culex bitaeniorhynchus Culex, mimeticus and Anopheles stephensi.. كما اظهرت النتائج ان بعوض Culex هو الاكثر انتشارا في منطقة الدراسة. ان وجود بعوض Anopheles stephensi المدرج كعامل اساسي لمرض الملاريا يمثل خطورة ويجعل دولة قطر عرضة لظهور مرض الملاريا مجددا به...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S) - Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical and Computer EngineeringRFID is a {{well known}} acronym for Radio-Frequency Identification, which is a {{technology}} similar to the existing bar code identification. This particular technology is capable of uniquely identifying tagged objects, which can be either living or inanimate. Items such as documents, people, <b>animal,</b> vehicles, <b>containers</b> and practically everything on this planet are capable of being tagged. With the enhancement of condensing the size and the cost, RFID has become a promising technology and has created infinite opportunities for new and improved services for consumers. In particular, RIFD technology will have an extensive variety of positive impacts in the supply chain. The main mechanism by which this will take place is the EPCglobal network, originally proposed by EPCglobal, Inc. The {{primary purpose of the}} EPCglobal network is to share product data in the supply chain. The current architecture of the EPCglobal network presents exceptional opportunities for all- from manufacturers to retailers, to overcome challenges in the supply chain. It is designed to function as a robust, extensible, scalable, and platform independent system. Even though it does achieve the majority of its objectives, it has some limitation when it comes {{to address the issue of}} data aggregation methods. In this thesis, the author analyses the current architecture of the EPCglobal network and provides a detailed explanation of the proposed solution in order to address the issues in the existing EPCglobal network. As the Author states, the current network does achieve the most of its duty, but there are some limitations related to data aggregation at the EPCIS of the retailer. Since every query goes out to the internet in order to retrieve its master information from the manufacturer’s database, this introduces a significant delay as well as consumes existing bandwidth of the EPCglobal network. The proposed technique introduces a method for aggregating data based on the information in each query and will be aggregated in order to enhance the performance of the existing EPC network. In this thesis, it has been proved that the proposed data aggregation method have enhanced the performance of the EPCglobal network...|$|R

It is unclear whether the benefit from animal detritus to larvae results from greater microorganism growth, direct ingestion of animal detritus by larvae, or some other mechanism. We tested alternative mechanisms by which animal detritus may benefit the invasive container-dwelling mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae). In the laboratory, larvae were reared under three conditions with access to 1) detritus, but where microorganisms {{in the water column}} were reduced through periodic flushing; 2) water column microorganisms, but larvae had no direct access to detritus; or 3) both water column microorganisms and detritus. Access treatments were conducted for three masses of animal detritus: 0. 005, 0. 010, and 0. 020 g. Water column bacterial productivity (measured via incorporation of [H- 3]leucine) decreased significantly with flushing and with larval presence. Removing microorganisms through flushing significantly reduced mass of adult mosquitoes (both sexes), and it significantly prolonged developmental times of females compared with treatments where water column microorganisms or microorganisms and detritus were available. Survival to adulthood was greatest when larvae had access to both water column microorganisms and 0. 020 g of detritus, but it declined when only water column microorganisms were available or when 0. 005 g of detritus was used.
