40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{transition}} to first year in a diverse, multi-campus, multimodal university provides significant difficulty and disorientation for school leavers and mature age and international students. Consequently, curriculum design for first year students requires {{an awareness of the}} need to provide commencing students with a framework for meeting the requirements of the academic environment. This paper illustrates how the successful practice of teaching first year students addresses the learning issues and needs of first year university students through the use of scaffolding and developmental assessment. The case study is from a first year Faculty of Business core course at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia. It provides a range of examples of successful pedagogical practices, including examples of scaffolding and developmental assessment embedded within the course materials to support and meet student needs. The strategies to embed these support mechanisms included spreading the assessment across the semester using two assignments and a final examination. In the second <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> we utilise an incremental research and assignment process that includes an exercise to deconstruct the assignment question, a short annotated bibliography, the concept mapping of the assignment argument and the assessment of a supplied essay before the writing and submission of the student’s final essay.

Trata-se de uma pesquisa de cunho qualitativo, cujos dados foram produzidos e analisados sob a perspectiva histórico-cultural da Teoria da Atividade, que apresenta o conceito de atividade prática como princípio explicativo do desenvolvimento humano e foca a atenção principalmente em três aspectos: a mediação de artefatos culturais, as relações intersubjetivas e as condições de legitimação das ações desenvolvidas.

Likewise, exposure was related to performance of male students in <b>the</b> <b>assignments</b> and examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courses</b> 416 and 485 respectively: The hypothesized relationship also did not hold up with any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance criteria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> 402. Almost same results were found in the partial "rs" controlling for <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test variables on the zero order and specified for. students' gender and residence groups. <b>The</b> non-existence <b>of</b> relationship between exposure and performance in <b>the</b> <b>course</b> 402 {{is due to the fact}} that majority of students did not watch TV programs. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons is <b>the</b> unsuitability <b>of</b> broadcast day and airtime. Whereas, the relationship was correlated (though not very strong) with <b>the</b> performance criteria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courses</b> 484 and 485 because television programs for most of these courses were telecast on Sundays and Fridays as being the holidays and half days in the government and private offices. In the AIOU's teaching system, students concentrate mostly on the provided textbooks. Since these textbooks cover both assignments and examination, students do not take TV programs seriously into account as most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TV programs are not integrated with the assignments and final examination couple with other reasons. Consequently, students' exposure to AIOU TV programs is very low and in some cases very discouraging, particularly, TV is usually ignored as a source of learning where textbooks explain the concepts and learning points in understandable and easy language. This might be the reason in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> "Economics" 402 Students' low exposure to TV programs was mainly due to <b>the</b> unsuitability <b>of</b> airtime and broadcast day. Students demanded for weekly re-telecast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TV programs. Besides, students also wanted to have TV programs watched at the beginning and before submitting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assignments</b> as majority <b>of</b> students like to write assignments after watching TV programs. The study revealed that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students attend tutorial meetings during the semester but "they occasionally discuss TV programs with the teacher and students. Those students who did not attend tutorials opined that TV programs made up the deficiency to some extent for the missed tutorials. <b>The</b> overall quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TV programs in <b>the</b> selected <b>courses</b> was average as opined by the students. Quality and even contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> programs, therefore, did not matter in ensuring great academic benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students. Since these programs, along with other reasons, had no integration with the AIOU teaching modes, they did not attract students at a larger scale...|$|R
