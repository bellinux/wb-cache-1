5|$|In November 1943, Landis agreed {{after some}} persuasion that black sportswriter Sam Lacy {{should make a}} case for {{integration}} of organized baseball before the owners' annual meeting. Instead of Lacy attending the meeting, actor Paul Robeson did. Robeson, though a noted black actor <b>and</b> <b>advocate</b> of civil rights, was a controversial figure due to his affiliation with the Communist Party. The owners heard Robeson out, but at Landis's suggestion, did not ask him any questions or begin any discussion with him.|$|E
5|$|In Taylor's view, {{the best}} way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery {{question}} out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway {{at the time of}} his inauguration, and California's population was exploding. The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters <b>and</b> <b>advocate</b> on behalf of statehood, knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was already underway, and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.|$|E

5|$|Like the Stimson Doctrine, Welles' {{declaration}} {{was largely}} symbolic in nature, although it offered some material benefits {{in conjunction with}} Executive Order 8484. It enabled the diplomatic representatives of the Baltic states in various other countries to fund their operations and protected the ownership of ships flying Baltic flags.

5|$|From 1945 onwards, Britain {{conducted}} {{a number of}} studies into the properties and use of variable geometry wings. The noted British engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis began exploring the concept during the Second World War and became an early pioneer <b>and</b> <b>advocate</b> for the variable geometry wing, conceiving of an aircraft consideration that lacked conventional features such as a vertical stabiliser and rudder, instead using variable geometry wings to provide primary controllability in their place. In 1946, Wallis published a paper upon this research, which was quickly hailed as being a major scientific breakthrough in the aviation industry. Wallis proceeded to advocate for the production of an aircraft, military or civil, that would take advantage of a variable geometry wing. The Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Defence arranged for a series of tests to demonstrate the application of the technology to projectiles, both for research purposes and a potential form of anti-aircraft defence; while Wallis worked upon this research programme, he continued to promote the concept of a manned variable geometry aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In November 1909, Crowley and Neuburg {{travelled}} to Algeria, {{touring the}} desert from El Arba to Aumale, Bou Saâda, and then Dā'leh Addin, with Crowley reciting the Quran {{on a daily}} basis. During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of Enochian magic, with Neuburg recording the results, later published in The Equinox as The Vision and the Voice. Following a mountaintop sex magic ritual, Crowley also performed an invocation to the demon Choronzon involving blood sacrifice, considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career. Returning to London in January 1910, Crowley found that Mathers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in The Equinox; the court found in favour of Crowley. The case was widely reported in the press, with Crowley gaining wider fame. Crowley enjoyed this, and played up to the sensationalist stereotype of being a Satanist <b>and</b> <b>advocate</b> of human sacrifice, despite being neither.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus {{that there is no}} convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher <b>and</b> <b>advocate,</b> has said that the media has a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation.|$|E
5|$|No {{drawings}} or {{paintings of}} Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing {{a sense of}} humor. Sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer <b>and</b> <b>advocate</b> Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up {{in an effort to}} remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits, in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis. As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity <b>and</b> <b>advocate</b> for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation.|$|E

5|$|The Union Greenback {{convention}} had reconvened {{at nearby}} Farwell Hall and sent an emissary to the National Greenbackers. The delegates voted {{to join the}} other faction in a special conference committee to work for reunification, then adjourned until 7:30 that evening. While {{they waited for the}} committees to finish their work, the delegates listened to speeches by several prominent Greenbackers, including Denis Kearney, a California labor leader, and William Wallace, a Canadian parliamentarian <b>and</b> <b>advocate</b> for currency reform. Meanwhile, the Credentials Committee voted narrowly to admit the Union Greenbackers, as well as a delegation from the Socialist Labor Party. The Committee on Permanent Organization voted to recommend Richard F. Trevellick, a Michigan trade union organizer, as the permanent chairman of the convention. None of the reports were finished by the appointed time, so the convention adjourned again until 10:45 Thursday morning.|$|E
5|$|The {{enhanced}} {{police presence}} {{throughout the city}} during the strike helped to keep the calm, and the restrained approach of the police officers generally won praise from all sides, {{even though many of}} the policemen were seen as sympathetic to the striking white workers. The administration of Philadelphia's Republican mayor Bernard Samuel was also seen as quietly sympathetic to the strikers. Throughout the strike, Mayor Samuel, who was {{also a member of the}} PTC board of directors, avoided any attempts of mediation. He refused to call a meeting of the PTC board of directors or to discuss the crisis with the TWU leaders. The mayor denied police protection to the two TWU officials who were willing to travel throughout the city <b>and</b> <b>advocate</b> an end to the strike. Samuel also refused to grant air time to War Production Board representatives who wanted to make a radio plea to end the strike. On August 2, the mayor declined, without an explanation, the NAACP request for permission to send two sound-trucks into black neighborhoods to broadcast appeals for calm. The city's black population felt disappointed and disenchanted with the actions of the local administration.|$|E
5|$|The toxins in A.muscaria are water-soluble. When sliced thinly, or {{finely diced}} and boiled in {{plentiful}} water until thoroughly cooked, {{it seems to}} be detoxified. Although its consumption as a food has never been widespread, the consumption of detoxified A.muscaria has been practiced in some parts of Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Félix Archimède Pouchet was a populariser <b>and</b> <b>advocate</b> of A.muscaria consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that must be detoxified before consumption.|$|E

5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie <b>and</b> <b>advocate</b> William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging.|$|E
