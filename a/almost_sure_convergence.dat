40|$|Computational {{intelligence}} approaches is {{a relatively}} new interdisciplinary field of research with many promising application areas. Although the computational intelligence approaches have gained huge popularity, it is difficult to analyze the convergence. In this paper, a computational model is built up for a class of computational intelligence approaches represented by the canonical forms of generic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and particle swarm optimization in order to describe the common features of these algorithms. And then, two quantification indices, that is, the variation rate and the progress rate, are defined, respectively, to indicate the variety and the optimality of the solution sets generated in the search process of the model. Moreover, we give four types of probabilistic convergence for the solution set updating sequences, and their relations are discussed. Finally, the sufficient conditions are derived for the <b>almost</b> <b>sure</b> weak <b>convergence</b> and the <b>almost</b> <b>sure</b> strong <b>convergence</b> of the model by introducing the martingale theory into the Markov chain analysis...|$|R

For Hankel and Toeplitz matrices generated by i. i. d. random variables {X_k} of unit variance, and for symmetric Markov matrices generated by i. i. d. random variables {X_ij}_j>i of zero mean and unit variance, scaling the eigenvalues by √(n) we prove the <b>almost</b> <b>sure,</b> weak <b>convergence</b> of the spectral measures to universal, nonrandom, symmetric distributions γ_H, γ_M and γ_T of unbounded support. The moments of γ_H and γ_T are {{the sum of}} volumes of solids related to Eulerian numbers, whereas γ_M has a bounded smooth density given by the free convolution of the semicircle and normal densities. For symmetric Markov matrices generated by i. i. d. random variables {X_ij}_j>i of mean m and finite variance, scaling the eigenvalues by n we prove the <b>almost</b> <b>sure,</b> weak <b>convergence</b> of the spectral measures to the atomic measure at -m.
