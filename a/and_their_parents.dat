5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1999, a live {{production}} of Blue's Clues toured the U.S. to positive reviews. Johnson compared the show's audience participation {{with that of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of the TV show were involved {{in all aspects of}} the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both children <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> could enjoy.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Cadet Movement is {{sponsored}} by the CF/DND and the civilian Air Cadet League, along with the Navy League and Army Cadet League. Each cadet unit is supported by a local Squadron Sponsoring Committee responsible to the National League through each of the Provincial Committees. The basic Air Cadet program is provided at no cost, including uniforms and activities. Most Air Cadet squadrons are sponsored by a local service organization or club such as a Royal Canadian Legion Branch, Royal Canadian Air Force Association Wing, Rotary Club, Lions Club, or a locally established committee. The local civilian sponsors must raise money to provide for accommodation, utilities, liability insurance, local awards, and additional training resources or special activities, such as mess dinners, band instruments or squadron excursions and trips, not funded by the CF/DND. Cadets <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> are encouraged to participate in fund-raising activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{evening before}} Fischer's burial, over 600 people {{attended}} a Catholic service at St. Mary's Church in Brownsville. His parents {{decided to have}} an open casket to allow attendees to kneel and pray next to the coffin. The funeral {{took place in the}} same church. Many people were in attendance including Buddy and Corinne's acquaintances, and Fischer's high school classmates. His girlfriend Marianela Caballero and her mother attended both services. Cristina, his ex-girlfriend, was also at the services, but her mother was not present. Fischer was buried at the Mont Meta Memorial Park in San Benito, Texas. In the days after the funeral, several of Fischer's longtime friends <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> gathered at Buddy's house for moral support. Fischer's family moved out of the house where he was killed, and went to live with Corinne's mother. The day of the murder, the Brownsville police offered a reward of US$5,000 to anyone who could assist in the arrest of any individual involved in the murder. A week later the reward was increased to US$20,000. Five months after the murder, Fischer's house was sold at a US$18,000 loss.|$|E
