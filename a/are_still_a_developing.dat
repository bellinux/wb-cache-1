40|$|Abstract: Field gravity fractal cosmological model, {{based on}} the field {{approach}} to gravity and on the fractal distribution of matter are presented. The field gravity fractal (FGF) model <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> subject. Within its framework a new qualitative pic-ture of the structure and evolution of the Universe has emerged, with some quantitative results that may be tested by current and forthcoming observations. 1. Initial hypotheses of the Field Gravity Fractal cosmology framework The basic feature of the modern version of the big bang model is that the observed luminous matter, which is distributed inhomogeneously in the Universe, contributes only 0. 5 {{percent of the total}} homogene-ously distributed unseen mass. Hence in the general relativistic homogeneous world model (Friedmann model) one considers that the uniform dark matter and dark energy determine the dynamics of the whole Universe. However the observed spatial distribution of galaxies is well described by a fractal density law. Then in preceding paper (Baryshev 2008 a) we described the field gravity theory, which has passed all weak-field tests and will be tested soon in strong-gravity regimes. Therefore it is natural to inspect as an alternative cosmological framework the field-gravity fractal cosmological model, {{based on the}} field approach to gravity and on the fractal distribution of matter. The field gravity-fractal model (FGFM) <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> subject...|$|R

The substrates of occupation (form, function, and meaning) are difficult to observe, and require a multidisciplinary approach.

For instance, disciplines such as biomechanics and psychology inform occupational science but, themselves, are not necessarily holistic in nature. Clinical practice can prompt new ideas and spark potential research within the discipline of occupational science.|$|R
