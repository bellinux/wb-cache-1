The Japanese economy had outgrown the US for several decades, and the appreciation of the yen had pushed Japanese per capita income (calculated on an exchangerate basis) almost 50 per cent above US levels in 1995. Japanese export industries generated massive export surpluses, despite the <b>appreciated</b> <b>currency.</b> The Japanese success was considered {{nothing less than a}} miracle.

40|$|We {{present a}} two-country {{extension}} of Lucas' (1988) work on how cash-in-advance constraints in asset markets affect the pricing of financial assets. In the model, {{there is some}} degree of separation between the goods markets and the assets markets, and money is used for transactions in both markets. The main results of the paper are the following. First, the equilibrium level of the exchange rate depends on the share of money used for asset transactions; a greater share corresponds to a more <b>appreciated</b> <b>currency.</b> Second, under uncertainty the liquidity effects deriving from stochastic shocks to bond creation lead to an "excess" volatility of nominal exchange rates, even when the "fundamental" value of the exchange rate is constant. Third, capital controls {{in the form of}} taxes on foreign asset acquisitions tend to appreciate the exchange rate. Fourth, the maturity structure of the public debt affects the equilibrium exchange rate. In particular, a move towards a longer maturity structure will tend to depreciate the exchange rate.

It presents new evidence that, along with high rates of credit expansion and low ratios of international reserves to short-term debt, the combination of substantially <b>appreciated</b> <b>currencies</b> and large current account deficits {{played an important role in}} the crises' severity. Furthermore, the paper concludes that pre-crisis over-optimism rather than panic caused financial markets to behave imperfectly and that perverse financial liberalization and limited flexibility of exchange rates generated moral hazard problems of more importance than those generated by prospects of international bailouts.

In contrast to newly industrialized economy MNEs (e.g., those from South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan) whose international expansion has been largely triggered by “push” factors such as <b>appreciating</b> <b>currencies,</b> rising labor costs and shortages, escalating operating costs, and smaller home markets, EM MNEs’ global expansion has been driven mainly by “pull” factors such as securing critical capabilities and resources, circumventing host country trade barriers, upgrading home-market capabilities, and seeking international reputation.|$|R
40|$|Tepid trade growth {{since the}} 2008 / 2009 global {{financial}} crisis (GFC) has been partly attributed to sluggish demand from developed countries. However, data reveals that developing countries play {{a bigger role}} in holding back trade growth, while developed countries show quite robust import growth. Post-GFC, the exchange rate volatility has grown significantly. As decomposion of country groups by changes in currency valuation shows, however, local currency depreciation is not contributing to export growth as much as conventional wisdom dictates. On the other hand, countries with <b>appreciating</b> <b>currencies</b> show rising import intensity and significant export growth.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal appreciation path of an undervalued currency {{in the presence}} of speculative capital inflows that are endogenously affected by the appreciation path. A central bank decides its appreciation policy based on three costs: (i) misalignment costs associated with the gap between the actual and long-run equilibrium exchange rates, (ii) short-term adjustment costs due to resource reallocation, and (iii) capital losses due to speculative capital inflows. Our model finds (1) when speculators face no liquidity shocks, the central bank tends to <b>appreciate</b> the <b>currency</b> quickly to discourage speculative capital; (2) when speculators face liquidity shocks, the central bank optimally pre-commits to a slower appreciation path, and the appreciation takes the longest time when the probability of liquidity shocks takes intermediate values; (3) the central bank tends to <b>appreciate</b> the <b>currency</b> more quickly when it conducts discretionary policy. ...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{appreciation}} of the Swiss franc provoked opposition based on the conventional view that currency appreciations reduce domestic output. An alternative, supplyside view, however, is that an <b>appreciating</b> <b>currency</b> is evidence that policy changes have improved inflation, investment, productivity and output. This article reviews the two views, then shows that the Swiss evidence rejects the conventional hypothesis of a negative relationship between movements in a currency's value and output, based on tests {{of the existence of}} cointegrating relationships between measures of the exchange rate and various measures of output and productivity, as well as measures of nominal exports. Statistically significant long-run relationships are found that generally support the alternative view. Policies that boost investment, productivity and real income also raise the currency's value, so the latter rise has been a signal of enhanced prosperity instead of a cause of its demise. ...|$|R

Here, in the framework of the Vector Error Correction Model, we analyse the impulse response function and variance decomposition of the inflation variable. We show that the developing economy of Ecuador is importing inflation from its main trading partners, most of them emerging countries with <b>appreciated</b> <b>currencies.</b> We argue that if Ecuador recovered both its monetary and exchange rate instruments it would be able to fight against inflation.

40|$|Coffee and cocoa are Cote d'Ivoire's {{two most}} {{important}} commodity exports, accounting for about 50 percent of total exports. Falling world prices and an <b>appreciating</b> <b>currency</b> have cut into sales of Ivorian coffee and cocoa {{at the same time}} that international supplies have mounted. As several major producers backed up their export efforts with aggressive exchange rate policies, Cote d'Ivoire's exporters lost their competitive position. To offset the slump in revenues, the government needs to reverse this decline in competitiveness. A study under different pricing and subsidy policies confirms that coffee production should be increased, even at the cost of some reduction in the output of cocoa. This will avoid large government subsidies to cocoa growers and will increase future exports of both products. Under current market conditions, government-established producer prices are no match for rapidly changing world markets and exchange rates. Unless Cote d'Ivoire adopts a flexible pricing policy, the country may face continuing problems in international competitiveness.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} corporate {{credit risks}} in the Netherlands at the industry-level, addressing two key questions. First, {{to what extent}} are corporate credit risks driven by idiosyncratic financial factors or systematic macroeconomic factors? Second, did debt financing in the late 1990 s indeed push a large number of firms into bankruptcy in the subsequent years? To this end, bankruptcy rates are regressed on a number of industry-specific financial ratio's and macroeconomic variables in a panel-regression framework covering six industries from 1992 to 2005. I find that an industry's bankruptcy rate rises with an increase in leverage and a decrease in profitability and liquidity. Adding macroeconomic variables shows that lower GDP growth, higher interest rates, and an <b>appreciating</b> <b>currency</b> raise credit risks. Applying a model with parameter heterogeneity illustrates that systematic factors primarily account for the overall rise in bankruptcy rates between 2000 and 2003, but that idiosyncratic factors dominate in the worst-affected industries. This includes the IT industry where the build-up of debt was most pronounced and compounded losses. ...|$|R

We estimate a multivariate probit model that links the likelihood of banking problems to a set of macroeconomic variables and institutional characteristics. The model predicts a high probability of banking sector distress in Japan in the early 1990 s. In particular the likelihood of an episode of banking distress rose in line with the sharp drop in asset prices, deepening recession and a "moral hazard' problem (financial liberalization combined with explicit deposit insurance). The Japanese case is also noteworthy by the long duration of the banking crisis, the length of the coincident recession and general malaise over the economy, the slow regulatory response, and the long delay in the commitment of public funds to re-capitalize the banking sector.

40|$|Should {{monetary}} policy be preoccupied with large current account imbalances and extremely volatile exchange rates? Using a standard open economy model of pricing-to-market with incomplete asset markets and nominal rigidities, {{we show that}} the answer is yes. In our framework, supply shocks trigger important movements in demand via changes in wealth, which lead to large changes in current accounts and currency values, in line with the data. These substantial wealth effects also work to bring about significant departures from complete risk sharing and thus, combined with nominal rigidities, create a second distortion that pushes the economy away from the first-best allocation. We show that under cooperation, the optimal {{monetary policy}} largely corrects the distortions due to incomplete risk sharing, by reducing the shocks' wealth effects, and thus the movements in current account balances and exchange rates. In addition, we show that a simple Taylor rule that also responds to movements in the exchange rate comes close to replicating the optimal policy. Overall, our model suggests that a large current account deficit combined with an <b>appreciating</b> <b>currency</b> is a sign of excessive demand (relative to first best) and that monetary policy should be more restrictive as a result...|$|R

30|$|Compared {{with the}} general impacts of oil {{structural}} shocks on exchange rates, the extreme impacts at the lower and upper quantiles express more significance statistically. For oil supply shocks, the general impacts tend to not be statistically significantly distinguishable from zero. However, the estimated coefficients on the oil supply variable in quantile regression at extreme quantiles are significant negative for oil-exporting countries. Moreover, the oil supply shocks have positive and significant impacts on exchange rate returns in Australia and Japan at the upper quantiles and negative and significant impacts in the EU at the lower quantile. Not surprisingly, the lower quantile levels represent significant US dollar depreciation. A significant US dollar depreciation should lead to {{a situation in which}} consumers with <b>appreciated</b> <b>currencies</b> find oil less expensive, thus increasing their demand for oil, which would induce an improvement in the real trade balance and current account surplus for oil-exporting economies; it would also induce a deterioration of the terms of trade and a current account deficit for oil-importing economies. This may amplify the impact of the oil supply on exchange rates and make the impact of shocks more significant statistically. Taken together, there is strong evidence that important information is essentially hidden behind the simple OLS coefficients.|$|R
40|$|After a fixed {{exchange}} rate regime is abandoned during a financial crisis, policymakers in crisis-hit countries face the challenging task of managing exchange rates and conducting monetary policies conductive for growth while combating inflation. This paper studies how crisis-hit countries respond differently {{in the aftermath of}} currency crises by analyzing exchange rates, money supplies, inflation and interest rates in two Asian countries—Korea and Thailand—and two Latin American countries—Argentina and Mexico. Their post-crisis policy responses result in three different scenarios: (1) an <b>appreciating</b> <b>currency</b> in a low interest rate and low inflation environment as in the Asian economies; (2) leaving the currency depreciated in a low interest rate and extremely high inflation environment as in Argentina; (3) further currency depreciation in a high interest rate and inflationary environment as in Mexico.

40|$|The {{aftermath}} of the global financial crisis of 2007 – 2009 has called the export-led growth model of Asian economies into question. This paper describes the contribution that macroeconomic policy can make to promote a rebalancing of growth away from dependence on exports to developed economies to a more sustainable pattern of growth centered on domestic and regional demand. This represents {{a significant departure from}} the traditional uses of macroeconomic policy to stabilize the economic cycle and achieve stable and low inflation. The evidence suggests that macroeconomic policy can successfully contribute to growth rebalancing. Policy measures not only can affect aggregate demand directly, but can also affect it indirectly via their “microeconomic” impacts on private sector behavior. Although in the long-term fiscal policy should be balanced to maintain government debt stability and avoid crowding out of private investment, there may be substantial scope to expand monetary and fiscal policy in the medium-term to offset the deflationary effects of an <b>appreciating</b> <b>currency</b> during periods of current account reversal. Previous experience suggests that most of the needed stimulus can be provided by monetary policy, with only a supplementary role to be played by fiscal policy. Moreover, Asian economies with large current account surpluses tend to have sufficient fiscal space. economic growth rebalancing; macroeconomic policy; sustainable economic growth...|$|R
