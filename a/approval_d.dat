Brigadier Peter de la Billière the Director Special Forces and Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Rose, the Commander of 22 SAS Regiment, petitioned for the regiment {{to be included in}} the task force. Without waiting for official <b>approval</b> <b>D</b> Squadron which was on standby for worldwide operations, departed on 5 April for Ascension Island. They were followed by G Squadron on 20 April. As both squadrons sailed south the plans were for D Squadron to support operations to retake South Georgia while G Squadron would be responsible for the Falkland Islands. By virtue of a 1981 transfer from A Squadron to G squadron, John Thompson was the only one of the 55 SAS soldiers involved in the Iranian siege to also see action in the Falklands.|$|E

40|$|We discuss sincere voting {{when voters}} have {{cardinal}} preferences over alter- natives. We interpret sincerity {{as opposed to}} strategic voting, and thus define sincerity as the optimal behaviour when conditions to vote strategically vanish. When voting mechanisms allow for only one message type we show that this op- timal behaviour coincides with an intuitive and common definition of sincerity. For voting mechanisms allowing for multiple message types, such as <b>approval</b> vot- <b>ing</b> (AV), there exists no conclusive definition of sincerity in the literature. We show that for AV, voters' optimal strategy tends {{to one of the}} existent definitions of sincerity, consisting in voting for those alternatives that yield more than the average of cardinal utilities. sincere and strategic voting, approval voting...|$|R
40|$|When {{purchasing}} a home, buyer considerations include {{price of the}} home, credit rating, mortgage type, and lending agency. The purpose of this phenomenological {{study was to explore}} the loan options successful business leaders consider when shifting loan lending from prime mortgage loans to subprime mortgage loans. Systems theory formed the conceptual framework for the study. A purposive sample of 20 participants from Gwinnett County, Georgia completed semistructured interviews and described their personal experiences. Data analysis incorporated van Kaam 2 ̆ 7 s technique to code and cluster information into topics. The following themes emerged from the analysis indicating what these business leaders considered when they established subprime mortgage loans: (a) creditable subprime mortgage lending, (b) preferred subprime mortgage type, (c) length of the <b>approval</b> process, (<b>d)</b> pressures and limited options, and (e) the benefits of a subprime mortgage. The findings indicated these creditworthy subprime borrowers received better loans options. Findings also showed that subprime mortgage borrowers preferred fixed rate mortgages, creditworthiness determined the extent of their subprime process, the number of first time homebuyers increased, and mortgage borrowers with credit problems preferred subprime mortgage loans. The information from this study could assist mortgage borrowers looking for loan options and mortgage lenders looking to build stronger relationships with the borrowers and communities they serve. Implications for positive social change include the possibility to lower foreclosures in Gwinnett County, Georgia and increase the mortgage knowledge of future borrowers...|$|R

40|$|Background. Third world {{communities}} like Las Malvinas, {{located in the}} Dominican Republic (DR), often face public health challenges. Instituting healthy communities requires collaborative public health services. The US has used evidence-based initiatives including the CDC’s CHANGE tool to address community health. There {{is a need to}} adapt these initiatives to other contexts. Clemson University (CU) students have partnered with Dominican University (UNIBE) and the Las Malvinas community to improve the community’s health and well-being. Methods. The team’s ACTION steps include: assembling a community team and strategy, reviewing the CHANGE sectors, and gathering the data to use in the CHANGE tool. The Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) will be developed from that data. After reviewing reports on Las Malvinas and site visits alongside public health theory, students modified CHANGE data tools both culturally and linguistically. Results. Five public health priorities for Las Malvinas were identified: sanitation, education, unwanted pregnancies, vaccine-preventable diseases, and chronic diseases. CU students will travel to Las Malvinas and collect data via focus groups, interviews, and GIS household survey, created by CU students. Discussion. Adapting and translating evidence-based practices across cultures poses opportunities and challenges. CU research team designed this project by relying on expertise and collaboration with a local university and neighborhood organization. Challenges included: (a) working from abroad, (b) language barriers, (c) binational IRB <b>approval,</b> (<b>d)</b> adapting CHANGE tool, and (e) limited community organizations. Despite these challenges, this project showed the value of cross-cultural collaboration and use of public health assessment tools to reach communities worldwide...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to ascertain the thinking styles of a selected sample group of cooperating teachers and university supervisors and to denote the differences between the thinking styles. The populations included 122 selected cooperating teachers and 31 selected university supervisors. Cooperating teachers and university supervisors completed the Level 1 : Life Styles Inventory which contained 240 short phrases and words producing a twelve-dimension thinking style. Seventy-two cooperating teachers and twenty-five university supervisors were included in data analysis. Thinking style profiles of cooperating teachers and university supervisors were derived from mean and standard deviation scores on twelve thinking style scales. Twelve null hypotheses were tested to identify thinking style differences between cooperating teachers and university supervisors on twelve scales. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) followed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were the statistical treatments utilized to analyze data at the. 05 level. Analysis of data relevant to total Level 1 : Life Style Inventory responses and to each hypothesis resulted in the following findings: 1. Mean responses of participating cooperating teachers and university supervisors indicated strong orientations toward humanistic-helpful, affiliative, achievement, and self-actualized dimensions of thinking style. 2. No significant differences existed between cooperating teachers and university supervisors on the twelve thinking style scales considered collectively. 3. Individual thinking style scales with no significant differences were:(a) humanistic-helpful, (b) affiliative, (c) <b>approval,</b> (<b>d)</b> dependent, (e) avoidance, (f) oppositional, (g) power, (h) competition, (i) competence, (j) achievement, and (f) self-actualization. 4.

40|$|This {{environmental}} {{baseline survey}} (EBS) report documents the baseline environmental conditions of five land parcels {{located near the}} U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), including West Black Oak Ridge, East Black Oak Ridge, McKinney Ridge, West Pine Ridge, and Parcel 21 d. The goal is to obtain all media no-further-investigation (NFI) determinations for the subject parcels considering existing soils. To augment the existing soils-only NFI determinations, samples of groundwater, surface water, soil, and sediment were collected to support all media NFI decisions. The only updates presented here are those that were made after the original issuance of the NFI documents. In the subject parcel where the soils NFI determination was not completed for <b>approval</b> (Parcel 21 <b>d),</b> the full process has been performed to address the soils as well. Preparation of this report included the detailed search of federal government records, title documents, aerial photos that may reflect prior uses, and visual inspections of the property and adjacent properties. Interviews with current employees involved in, or familiar with, operations on the real property were also conducted to identify any areas on the property where hazardous substances and petroleum products, or their derivatives, and acutely hazardous wastes may have been released or disposed. In addition, a search was made of reasonably obtainable federal, state, and local government records of each adjacent facility {{where there has been}} a release of any hazardous substance or any petroleum product or their derivatives, including aviation fuel and motor oil, and which is likely to cause or contribute to a release of any hazardous substance or any petroleum product or its derivatives, including aviation fuel or motor oil, on the real property. A radiological survey and soil/sediment sampling was conducted to assess baseline conditions of Parcel 21 d that were not addressed by the soils-only NFI reports. Groundwater sampling was also conducted to support a Parcel 21 d decision...|$|R
40|$|Stable externalizing {{behavior}} in childhood places {{children at risk}} {{for the development of}} a chronic and persistent pattern of {{externalizing behavior}} problems. Preventive interventions that aim to interrupt this developmental trajectory are crucial. Until now, no evidence-based intervention for children with elevated levels of externalizing behaviors existed in the Dutch School context. First, we conducted a meta-analysis on international studies of school-based indicated interventions and found that individually delivered interventions are effective in reducing externalizing behavior (d =. 28), increasing prosocial behavior (d =. 43) and changing social cognitive functioning (d =. 82). Next we examined the effectiveness of Stay Cool Kids, a preventive intervention for externalizing behavior. Moreover, we tested for whom and how the intervention works. This study used a cluster Randomized Controlled Trial with 48 elementary schools (264 fourth-grade children with elevated levels of externalizing behavior) in the Netherlands, that were randomly assigned to the intervention or no-intervention control condition. Results showed that Stay Cool Kids reduced reactive and proactive aggressive behavior (mean effect sizes on aggressive behavior were. 22,. 29,. 25 and. 21 according to children, teachers, mothers, and fathers, respectively). Moreover, the effect of the intervention was clinically significant, because participation in the intervention resulted in differences in the child’s functioning from clinical to sub-clinical or normative levels of externalizing behavior according to teachers. Some aspects of problems in social cognitive functioning were reduced (<b>approval</b> of aggression, <b>d</b> =. 22) and children showed more positive self-perception (d =. 49). The results of follow-up assessment showed that Stay Cool Kids resulted in sustained reduction in teacher reported aggression, when children moved to fifth grade. Results from the moderation analyses showed that boys, immigrant Dutch children, children who are moderately conscientious (organized and planful) and less extraverted (sociability and agency) benefitted more from the intervention on specific outcomes at short-term. In addition, less extraverted children showed stronger intervention effects immediately after the intervention, and effects at follow-up were stronger for these children. Tests of the theoretical model of Stay Cool Kids, proposing that changes in social cognitions would lead to changes in behavior, revealed that an increase in positive self-perception resulted in a decrease in child aggressive behavior. Child participation in the intervention resulted in an increase in maternal involvement, which in turn resulted in decreases in aggression. Altogether, the studies in this dissertation show that Stay Cool Kids can reduce externalizing behavior (reactive and proactive aggression, clinical externalizing behavior) across settings (school and home), in boys and girls and in children with different ethnic backgrounds. Effect sizes of Stay Cool Kids were similar to findings in international meta-analyses and can be considered as small to medium. It is important to realize that (maintenance of) effects of the intervention were not the same for all children. These results underline the importance of personalized mental health care adapted to children’s specific needs...|$|R
