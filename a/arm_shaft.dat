30|$|The {{main problem}} {{for using the}} {{framework}} oil-seal of ranging arm’s high-speed shaft is its premature failure, i.e., the failure before the service life of the framework oil-seal. The main causes of the premature failure for the framework oil-seal at the ranging <b>arm</b> <b>shaft</b> I are as follows: poor quality framework oil-seal, e.g., poor quality port, and defects; poor quality of self-tightening spring; the magnitude interference between port inner diameter and shaft I outer diameter is too small, which results in low radial pressure; and the material of framework oil-seal is not good, which results in wearing out at port. Design and machining: there are some misalignments at some positions, such as ranging <b>arm,</b> <b>shaft</b> I and bearing cup; there is a low degree of finish at shaft I that amounted with framework oil-seal; and inappropriate heat treatment, etc. Assembly: damage on the port of framework oil-seal, inclination of bearing cup, loose spring, different type of grease or different quantify of grease on oil-seal port and shaft surface. To overcome {{the problems associated with}} the framework oil-seal of ranging <b>arm</b> <b>shaft</b> I, and to increase the sealing reliability of high-speed shaft of ranging arm, the following measures were taken: select high quality framework oil-seals; maintain the machining precision of key components; checking and maintenance on oil leakage of the framework oil-seal.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} failure of a rocker <b>arm</b> <b>shaft</b> of a {{passenger}} car. The shaft failed by brittle fracture across one of the four holes supporting the shaft into the cylinder head. The running distance of the engine just before failure was 40, 626 km. Visual examinations of etched sections of the failed shaft and a new one revealed four distinct zones of darker etching appearance. These zones correspond to the four locations where the rocker arms fit the shaft. Microscopic observations of the failed shaft revealed that the four dark-etching areas are surface hardened zones of martensitic microstructure. Furthermore, scanning the microstructure along the failed shaft showed that the heat treatment was so mistakenly extended by excessive heating so that the structure of the shaft near the supporting holes contains considerable content of martensite phase. This conclusion has been confirmed by the results of hardness measurements along the surface of the shaft. Microscopic investigations of the failed shaft revealed the presence of microcracks close to the supporting holes. These cracks may have been induced in the shaft by the non-uniform cooling during quenching in the course of heat treatment, or may be nucleated by repeated loading during service. This premature failure has occurred by the rapid crack propagation because of the lower fracture toughness of the martensite...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB in Södertälje at the engine development department, NMKA and at Scania Latin America in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Scania {{is a global}} company with operations in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Scania is the world’s third largest manufacturer for heavy trucks and heavy bus segment. The constant development of new design solutions demands more stable mounting in Scanias production. Assemblies with new screw joints with different parameters affect {{the value of the}} clamping force for the joint and consequently the final product. It is critical that the screw joint has the right clamping force to assure that it fulfils its purpose. Large deviations can result in total loss of clamping force and engine breakdown. The purpose with this master thesis was to find the most important factors that affect the clamping force and form the basis of how different screw joints should be handled. Knowledge about Scania screw joints were collected by working in the production, observing drawings, a thorough literature study and by interviewing representatives from different departments. The problems regarding screw joints were found to be rather different at the departments and the problems had been an issue {{for a longer period of}} time. The mapping of screw joints resulted in a number of interesting screw joints with different kinds of problems. A discussion about the interesting screw joints was held in order to select joints to take a closer look at. By focusing on area of interest, area of responsibility and resources, five screw joints were selected, rocker <b>arm</b> <b>shaft,</b> main bearing cap, connecting rod and the oil sump in both aluminum and steel. The chosen screw joints represented specific types of screw joints on which the chosen parameters were tested. The important parameters that were tested are driver speed, friction and settlement. The equipment that was used throughout the work was the Ultrasonic, which measures the length of a screw with ultrasound. The authors feel that the equipment has given reliable results and that it has been easy and convenient to use during the tests since time consuming strain gages were avoided. The test results shows that the speed of the nut runner has a great influence on the clamping force and torque. Depending on the nut runner and which kind of screw joint that is examined the clamping force and torque varies. The friction affects the result of the tightening substantially, especially when tightening by torque. If torque and angle tightening is used it is an advantage to keep the initial torque as low as possible but high enough to keep the surfaces tight together before applying the angle. The test results regarding settlement show that the settlement is extremely dependent on the ingoing parts in the screw joint. Parameters such as screw and clamped parts affect both the tightening procedure and degree of settlement. The authors recommendations are that a decision has to be made about what information is important for each department. Furthermore, as the tightening procedure is really important for the final clamping force it is advisable to decide which department that is responsible of making the correct tightening parameters of a specific screw joint in the production. Hopefully this master thesis has woken an interest which in the future can make a difference for an even more stable production and in the end an even better quality at Scania CV AB.

40|$|A beam {{is defined}} as a {{structure}} having one of its dimensions much larger than the other two. The axis of the beam is defined along that longer dimension, and a crosssection normal to this axis is assumed to smoothly vary along the span or length of the beam. Civil engineering structures often consist of an assembly or grid of beams with cross-sections having shapes such as T's or I's. A large number of machine parts also are beam-like structures: lever <b>arms,</b> <b>shafts,</b> etc. Finally, several aeronautical structures such as wings and fuselages can also be treated as thin-walled beams. The solid mechanics theory of beams, more commonly referred to simply as “beam theory,” {{plays an important role in}} structural analysis because it provides the designer with a simple tool to analyze numerous structures. Although more sophisticated tools, such as the finite element method, are now widely available for the stress analysis of complex structures, beam models are often used at a pre-design stage because they provide valuable insight into the behavior of structures. Such calculations are also quite useful when trying to validate purely computational solutions...|$|R
