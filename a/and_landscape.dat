5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they have to provide detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself. They also have to submit photographs of the site, and a site plan sketch.|$|E

5|$|After earning enough money, Kertész quickly {{bought his}} first camera (an ICA box camera) in 1912, despite his family's protests to {{continue}} his career in business. In his free time, he photographed the local peasants, gypsies, <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> of the surrounding Hungarian Plains (the puszta). His first photograph {{is believed to be}} Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912. His photographs were first published in 1917 in the magazine Érdekes Újság, during World War I, while Kertész was serving in the Austro-Hungarian army. As early as 1914 (for example, Eugene, 1914), his distinctive and mature style was already evident.|$|E
5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|Australia Day is the {{official}} National Day of Australia.

She also studied botany and horticulture under Charles Sprague Sargent at the Arnold Arboretum. One of her formative influences at MIT was Guy Lowell, the director of the landscape design program there, who was an advocate of the classical values of balance, order, proportion and harmony taught by the French Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Lowell was best known for his book American Gardens, published in 1902, which influenced many landscape architects to adopt his principles to design symmetrical, axial gardens that combined architectural features with classical garden ornaments with vegetation, following the tradition of Italian villas.|$|E
5|$|Cracking {{along the}} {{vertical}} join {{of the wooden}} panels was severe enough to warrant a third restoration in 1982. Raking light revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E
5|$|Dreyfuss {{announced}} that unlike established wooden ballparks {{such as the}} Polo Grounds, he would build a three-tiered stadium out of steel and concrete to increase longevity—the {{first of its kind}} in the nation. Charles Wellford Leavitt, Jr. was contracted to design the stadium's grandstand. A civil engineer, Leavitt had founded an engineering <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> architecture firm in 1897. He had gained experience in steel and concrete constructs while designing the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks. Based on Dreyfuss' architectural requirements, Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field—the only ballpark he would design. Pirates' manager Fred Clarke also had input into the stadium's design, giving groundskeepers advice on the field, in addition to designing and patenting a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over the infield in case of rain.|$|E

5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate <b>and</b> <b>landscape.</b> However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
5|$|From its {{establishment}} in 1967 to its abolition in 1992, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation created {{by far the}} largest and most ambitious of the British new towns: indeed its objective was to build a new city of 250,000 people. Many of Britain's most acclaimed building <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> architects contributed to what was to be a show-piece of British design. Unlike previous new towns, Milton Keynes has a preponderance of privately funded development but these developments were subject to an exacting design brief in line with the design principles laid out in The Plan for Milton Keynes.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{regarded}} {{during her}} active {{career as a}} portrait <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> painter, by 1914 Fuller was represented in four public galleries—three in Australia and one in South Africa—a record {{for a woman who}} was an Australian painter at that time. In 1927 she began almost twenty years of institutionalization in a mental asylum, however, and her death went without notice. After her death, information about her was frequently omitted from reference books about Australian painters and knowledge of her work became obscure despite her paintings being held in public art collections including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Australia's National Portrait Gallery.|$|E

5|$|His most {{significant}} influence was {{the introduction of}} the idea of wild gardening, which first appeared in The Wild Garden and was further developed in The English Flower Garden. The idea of introducing large drifts of native hardy perennial plants into meadow, woodand, and waterside is taken for granted today, but was revolutionary in Robinson's time. In the first edition, he happily used any plant that could be naturalised, including half-hardy perennials and natives {{from other parts of the}} world—thus Robinson's wild garden was not limited to locally native species. Robinson's own garden at Gravetye was planted on a large scale, but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards, where the 'garden' is designed to appear to merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow. Robinson's ideas continue to influence gardeners <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> architects today—from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens.|$|E
5|$|Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{as part of}} a wider trend in the 1980s of so-called 'heritage cinema': period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> of France. It was the official policy of President François Mitterrand, elected in 1981, and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to promote these kinds of films through increased funding of the ailing French film industry. Berri's pair of films stand as the most prominent example of this effort. It has also been suggested that the treatment given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was symbolic of the growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.|$|E
5|$|Marian Cruger Coffin (September 16, 1876 – February 2, 1957) {{was one of}} {{the first}} American women to work as a {{professional}} landscape architect, and became famous for designing numerous gardens for members of the East Coast elite to whom she had connections through her mother's side of the family. As a child, she received almost no formal education but was home-tutored while living with her mother's relatives in upstate New York. Coffin was determined to embark on a career despite the social problems that it would cause for a woman of her class and enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied between 1901–4 as one of only four women in architecture <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> design.|$|E

5|$|Operation Barbarossa was {{the largest}} {{military}} operation in human history — more men, tanks, guns and aircraft were committed than had ever been deployed before in a single offensive.

More people died fighting on the Eastern Front than in all other fighting across the globe during World War II.

5|$|Originally {{announced}} in 2009, The Witness had a lengthy development period. Blow started {{work on the}} title in 2008 shortly after releasing Braid. The financial success of Braid allowed him to hire a larger production team without ceding control over the final product. In order to create the game's visual language, the team developed their own game engine and retained artists, architects, <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> architects to design the structures on the island. This required a protracted development process, and the game's release was delayed from 2013 to 2016. Original plans for release on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were abandoned as the game engine became more demanding, and the team ultimately opted for an initial release on Windows and the PlayStation 4, with support for other platforms following.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{continued}} to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with William Gear (1916–97) and Stephen Gilbert (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde COBRA group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution. Also a visitor to Paris was Alan Davie (b. 1920-2014), who was influenced by jazz and Zen Buddhism, and moved further into abstract expressionism. Ian Hamilton Finlay's (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially concrete poetry) <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> architecture. His most ambitious work, the garden of Little Sparta opened in 1960.|$|E
