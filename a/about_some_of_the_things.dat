The old talk of [...] "literary bravoes," [...] "men in masks," [...] "anonymous assassins," [...] and so forth, is out of date. Longer experience has only confirmed the present writer's opinion, expressed here from the very beginning: [...] "Everybody who knows the composition of any respectable journal in London knows very well that the articles which those of our own way of thinking dislike most intensely are written by men whom to call bravoes in any sense whatever would be simply monstrous. Let us say, as loudly as we choose, if we see good reason, that they are half informed <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> which they so authoritatively discuss; that they are under strong class feeling; that they have not mastered the doctrines which they are opposing; that they have not sufficiently meditated their subject; that they have not given themselves time to do justice even to their scanty knowledge. Journalists are open to charges of this kind; but to think of them as a shameless body, thirsting for the blood of better men than themselves, or ready to act as an editor's instrument for money, involves a thoroughly unjust misconception." ...|$|E

As a result, acting-Chancellor Schroeder announced that in effect he [and the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) ] had won the election, because they lost less votes than expected. This resulted in a situation where the two prominent party leaders were in turmoil over the process of establishing a grand coalition.

40|$|Frank Smets {{has written}} an {{interesting}} and thought-provoking paper {{on the role of}} asset prices in the formulation of monetary policy. Of particular interest is his comparative analysis of Australia and Canada – two commodity-exporting economies that one might have thought would behave similarly, but which in fact differ in interesting ways. In my comments, I want to talk <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that Smets discusses in his paper, as well as some things that he does not discuss. Let me begin with the things he discusses. When thinking about asset prices and monetary policy in a small open economy like Australia, perhaps the first asset price that comes to mind is the exchange rate. Policyinduced changes in the exchange rate are an important transmission channel through which monetary policy affects both inflation and activity. The most rapid transmission channel from monetary policy to inflation in an open economy occurs via the exchange rate’s effect on import prices. Other transmission channels eventually have a much larger impact on inflation, but they occur more gradually. The effect of changes in the exchange rate on activity arises, of course, because of the exchange rate’s effect on the volume of exports and imports and, therefore, on activity in the export and import-competin...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{awareness}} of the health inequalities experienced by people with intellectual disability, their health status remains poor. Inequalities in health outcomes are manifest in higher morbidity and rates of premature death. Contributing factors include the barriers encountered in accessing and receiving high-quality health care. AIMS: This paper outlines health inequalities experienced by people with intellectual disability and focuses on the opportunities medical education provides to address these. Strategies to ensure that health professional education is inclusive of and relevant to people with disabilities are highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: The barriers experienced by people with intellectual disabilities to the receipt of high-quality health care include the attitudes, knowledge and skills of doctors. Improving medical education to ensure doctors are better equipped is one strategy to address these barriers. Improving health enhances quality of life, enables engagement and optimizes opportunities to participate in {{and contribute to the}} social and economic life of communities. ACCESSIBLE ABSTRACT: People with intellectual disabilities sometimes find it difficult to get the healthcare they need to stay well. Teaching student doctors about what people with disabilities want and need can help these students become better doctors. Good doctors help people get well and stay healthy and active. When people feel well they can enjoy their lives and join in activities in their community. This article talks <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> doctors need to learn, and some ways to teach them. People with disabilities have a very important role in teaching student doctors...|$|E
40|$|Ken Russell (1927 - 2011) was {{a renegade}} talent and the self-styled enfant terrible of British cinema. His legacy as a {{film-maker}} {{consists of a}} large number of films on the lives of artists, mainly composers. But Russell’s approach to artist biography was highly unorthodox: rather than reconstruct a factual account he offered a deeply personal interpretation of artists’ lives based on his own understanding of their work. In a programmatic text for his film on Mahler (1974), Russell explained that his films ‘evolve through a stream of consciousness in which the man and the myth, the music and its meaning, time, place, dream and fact all flow and blend into the mainstream of the film itself’ and that ‘my film is simply <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I feel when I think of Mahler’s life and listen to his music’. This book is an attempt to explain what that statement means and to unpack its implications for the practice of life writing. It takes a baroque approach to performance and performativity to show how Russell not simply made highly inventive films on other artists, but also constructed those films as a kind of self-portrait. Russell’s work then becomes a performance of self through art. In four chapters of detailed analysis this book reconstructs Russell’s method, from the very first films he made for the BBC in the early 1960 s through his major feature films of the 1970 s and 1980 s.

Whether {{with the}} expectant, half-frightened freshman, the senior, {{worried about his}} {{preparation}} now that. he must get out and meet competition, or the graduate student interested in new discoveries, I {{like to work with}} all of them. I have been teaching a long time now. As has always been the case when one generation is thinking of turning over its work to the next, I am glad {{to have the opportunity to}} talk <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that I consider important in this job of teaching. The most varied and the most acute problems of teaching in college are met with freshmen and sophomores. As a student advances in college he becomes less dependent on the teacher, though a good teacher is important at any stage of a student 2 ̆ 7 s education. It is during the earlier years of education that the influence of the teacher is greatest. My remarks will be directed chiefly to the problems of teaching the physical sciences to freshmen. Many of these problems are, however, common to the teaching of all subjects to all students. Let us take a look at these freshmen. What are they like and why are they as they are? What can we expect of them? What should be our objectives in teaching them? How does science lend itself to the attaining of these objectives? Whatever these boys and girls are now, we must accept them as they are and do our best to help them to richer lives...|$|E
40|$|Whe' yu' from?" The {{question}} {{was put to}} me as I wandered, camera in hand, in the old square of Spanish Town, Jamaica's former capital. The local man, lounging {{in the shade of}} one of the colonial Georgian buildings that enclose the square, was mildly curious about what he took to be a typical white tourish photgraphing the sights of the decayed historic town. At that time, my home was in Kingston where i lived with my wife and baby son. I was then working in the Jamaican Government Town Planning Department in a job that took me all over the island. Turning to my questioner, I replied, "Kingston". There was a brief pause, and then the man spoke again: "No Man! Whe' yu' really from?" I still have difficulties when asked this question. Where am I from? What does this question mean? Does it refer to where I was born, where I spent my previous life or where I live now? Does it have a broader meaning, an enquiry about my origins in terms of background and previous experience? The following chapters are my attempt to answer these questions for my own satisfaction and, I hope, for the amusement of others who may be interested in the life of an ordinary English boy whose dream to travel and see the world was realized in ways he could not possibly have imagined. Finding an appropriate title for this book was difficult. Thursday's Child, North and South and War and Peace all came to mind but, unfortunately for me, those titles had been appropriated by other writers. Thursdays's Child is quite a popular book title, presumably because people who were born on that day and, {{in the words of the}} nursery rhyme, had 'far to go', are especially likely to have travellers' tales to tell or life stories of the rags-to-riches variety. Born on a Thursday, I have travelled a lot and I suppose that I have gone far in life. Coming from a working class family, I 'got on' by 'getting a good education' and a 'good job'. I decided against adding to the list of Thursday's Children. North and South would have reflected my life in Britain, spent in both the North and South of England, and my later years, divided between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres of the globe, as well as in countries commonly referred to as the 'advanced' North and the 'underdeveloped' South. North and South has already been appropriated by Mrs Gaskell, something that did not deter one popular American writer from using the title for a book of his. My memories of World War Two and the years afterwards made War and Peace a possible candidate, but readers expectnig an epic tale of Tolstoyan proportions may have been disappointed. To my knowledge, no other book has the title "Whe' Yu' From?". I am grateful to the Jamaican man whose question lingered in my memory and provided the title of this memoir, written decades later. This book is a word picture. It is, in a sense, a self-portrait, and like all portraits, it captures something of the character, it attempts to tell the truth, but it is not the whole truth. This is because it is not my intention to write my entire life story; rather I wish to tell <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> in my experience of life that have seemed important or interesting to me. Unlike a painted portrait, the picture I have created is intended to suggest the passage of time. While, for most of us in Western society, time is linear and unidirectional, like the flight of an arrov or the trajectory of a bullet, memory rearranges things, calling up images of the past in no particular order, making connections that may link events in various patterns, circular, web-like, superimposed. The stream of consciousness is very unlike that of streams we encounter in the physical world. Connections are made in all directions; thoughts hop back and forth in time and space, from topic to topic. My book is a composition drawn from periods, events and thoughts as I remember them. Like life itself, it is made up of patches, some good, some bad, but in my experience, always fascinating. In recording my memories, I have been as accurate as possible. Little of what I have written is about spectacular sights and strange customs. Much of it focuses on my more modest explorations includng observations of everyday things that have attracted my attention. Reading through the chapters, I am struck by my childhood freedom to roam and engage in 'dangerous' activities like climbing trees and playing beside streams, things that many children today are no longer allowed to enjoy. Also noticeable is the survival of traditions and superstitions from the distant past. Obvious too, is my preoccupation with place names, both official ones that appear on maps and sign boards and those used by locals and children, names rarely seen in print. If there is any uniting theme to be found in what I have written, it must be my education in the fields, woods and streets of my English homeland, in the various other countries in which I have lived and travelled, as well as more formally from books and in classrooms. Much of my book is concerned with people and places. Many of the people I mention are among those who have been, and often have remained, important and close to me. Others I remember from only the briefest of encounters, but they remain in my memory because of some specific incident or circumstance that fixed a lasting image in my mind. Some of my closest friends and relatives, however, appear nowhere in these pages or they receive only the slightest mention. This is not because they played an unimportant roles in my life. It is because this book is not the whole story. Among those whe receive little or no mention are some who are especially close to me, with whom I have shared happy and sad times and who have shown me and my family much kindness, giving support when this was needed. Some I have known since childhood and have popped up at various times in my life, often in different parts of the world. Although years may pass without me seeing them, in an important sense they are always with me. These people know who they are. I hope that they know how much I love and appreciate them. When writing my memoir, I consulted a few of the people mentioned in this book, but in the main, I have relied on my own memory, asided by daiary and notebook entries and old correspondence. In the preparation of this manuscript, I benefited greatly from the expert advice and encouragement of Neil Marr of BeWrite Books. My wife Anne, inspiration for this book, also contributed in the valuable role of critic. She has my undying gratitude. ...|$|E
