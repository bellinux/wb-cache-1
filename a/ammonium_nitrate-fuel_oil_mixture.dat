In order to detect both anions and cations simultaneously, the electromagnetic flow was reversed {{by the addition}} of cetryltrimethylammonium hydroxide (CTAH). The parameters which influenced the separation of inorganic ions such as electrolyte pH, concentration of PDC, applied voltage and temperature were investigated.

40|$|Abstract. Non-ideal high {{explosives}} {{are typically}} porous, low-density materials {{with a low}} detonation velocity (3 ~ 5 km/s) and long detonation reaction zone (~ cms). As a result, the interaction of a non-ideal high explosive with an inert confiner can be markedly different than for a conventional high explosive. Issues arise, for example, with light stiff confiners where the confiner can drive the high explosive (HE) through a Prandtl-Meyer fan at the HE/confiner interface rather than the HE driving the confiner. For a non-ideal high explosive confined by a high sound speed inert such that the detonation velocity {{is lower than the}} inert sound speed, the flow is subsonic and thus shockless in the confiner. In such cases, the standard detonation shock dynamics methodology, which requires a positive edge-angle be specified at the HE/confiner interface in order that the detonation shape be divergent, cannot be directly utilized. In order to study some implications for detonation shock dynamics in such cases, experiments and numerical simulations of the detonation of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate-fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (ANFO) confined by aluminum 6061 are conducted...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} results of the exploratory study of two-phase systems consisting of 150 µm diameter aluminum powder mechanically mixed with 30 nm and 30 µm diameter SiC and Al 2 O 3 powders (in volume fractions of 2, 4, and 21 percent). Powders were mechanically mixed and green compacted to ∼ 80 % theorical density in a series of cylindrical fixtures (steel tubes). The compacted arrangements were explosively consolidated using <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate-fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (ANFO) to form stacks of two-phase systems. As result, successfully consolidated cylindrical monoliths of 50 mm (height) x 32 mm (in diameter) were obtained. By taking advantage of the use of SWC (shock wave consolidation) and WEDM (wire-electric discharge machining), the heterogeneous systems were machined in a highly efficiency rate. The sample cuts used for characterization and mechanical properties testing, require the use of less that 10 cc of each monolith, in consequence there was preserved an average of 60 % of the obtained system monoliths. Consolidated test cylinders of the pure Al and two-phase composites were characterized by optical metallography and TEM. The light micrographs for the five explosively consolidated regimes: aluminum powder, nano and micron-sized Al/Al 2 O 3 systems, and the nano and micron-sized Al/SiC systems exhibit similar ductility in the aluminum grains. Low volume fraction systems exhibit small agglomerations at the grain boundaries for the Al/Al 2 O 3 system and the Al/SiC system reveal a well distributed phase at the grain boundaries. Large and partially bonded agglomerations were observable in the nano-sized high volume fraction (21 %) systems, while the micron-sized Al/ceramic systems exhibit homogeneous distribution along the aluminum phase grains. TEM images showed the shock-induced dislocation cell structure, which has partially recrystallized to form a nano grain structure in the consolidated aluminum powder. Furthermore, the SiC nano-agglomerates appeared to have been shock consolidated into a contiguous phase regime bonded to aluminum grains in the nano-sized Al/SiC systems. ^ Mechanical properties were measured from the pure Al powder reference monoliths showing that the starting Al powder had a Vickers hardness of ∼ 24 HV 25; in contrast to pure Al explosively consolidated reference cylinders that had a residual hardness of ∼ 43 HV 25. Average Rockwell hardnesses were also compared with room temperature stress-strain data measured for tensile specimens cut from the test cylinders. The results were compared with rule-of-mixtures formalisms applied to these novel two-phase systems. Correspondingly the Rockwell hardness for 21 % SiC and Al 2 O 3 mixtures in Al increased by ∼ 60 %, from the Al reference (single-phase) monolith; while the elongation declined by ∼ 60 %. The prominent Al intergranular-like fracture within the 21 % (volume) SiC or Al 2 O 3 phase regime was observed by SEM. At 21 % (volume) SiC a distinct 2 -phase Al/SiC regime was formed with fracture occurring prominently in the SiC consolidated phase. The fracture surface features are somewhat characteristic of the signature variation in the stress-strain diagrams. The aluminum ductile-dimple fracture characteristics, the failure around the SiC particles and particle agglomerates producing the discontinuous yield-like phenomenon and the poor mechanical behavior of the nano-sized Al/SiC systems are characteristic of the significantly different fracture features. ...|$|R
40|$|High {{explosives}} (HE) {{are used}} in many fields where the energy liberated by the combustion process is used to perform useful work. High explosives normally burn via a detonation; a supersonic wave consisting of a shock wave coupled to chemical energy release. Detonations in conventional HE (CHE) propagate with a typical velocity of 6 - 8 km/s. Insensitive HE (IHE) and non-ideal HE (NIHE) are of particular interest as they are harder to initiate and thus safer to store and transport. Detonations in IHEs and NIHEs are characterized by longer reaction time and length scales than detonations in CHE. NIHEs are typically characterized by their porous, granular structure. Detonations in NIHEs have lower detonation velocities (4 - 6 km/s) than those in CHEs or IHEs due to their lower initial densities. The short time scales (O(ns ??? ??s)), length scales (O(??m ??? mm)) and the opaque nature of HEs and their products make experimental observations, required to calibrate detonation models for reaction flow modelling, challenging. Currently used reactive burn models assume a two component, mechanically equilibrated mixture of reactants and products. Individual components are modelled with an empirical equation of state (EOS). The set of relations which uniquely determine the mixture-averaged state {{in terms of the}} states of the mixture constituents, the mixture closure conditions, are also often of a pressure-temperature equilibrium form. The chemical reaction rate law(s) are mostly based on preconceptions of how a detonating HE burns. Typically, such engineering style models are complex and contain a large number of fitting parameters that are calibrated in some form to a limited set of experimental data. Minimal attention has been devoted to the physical and mathematical implications of the fitting process and reactive burn model structure (such as the choice of closure condition) to issues such as detonation stability and interacting oblique shock structure. For a well-posed reactive burn model, such properties should be understood. A majority of this thesis research is devoted to formulating and studying the shock and detonation properties of reactive burn models based on the use of stiffened-gas (SG) equations of state. A SG model allows an appropriate initial sound speed of a material to be set, an important improvement over ideal gas models when applied to condensed phase reactive burn models. Due to its relative simplicity, a semi-analytical understanding of reactive burn models based on the use of SG EOS models for its constituent components can be obtained. Furthermore, changes in physical aspects of the reactive burn model, such as detonation stability and interacting oblique shock structure, with changes in calibrated fitting parameters, can be better understood. In this context, we establish the ability of SG EOS models to reasonably formulate a reactive burn model for the IHE PBX 9502. The model is designed to capture the fast and slow reaction stages inherent in PBX 9502 detonation using a two-stage reaction model. Different mixture closure conditions are examined, namely the classical pressure-temperature equilibrium assumption and a constant solid entropy closure condition. The stability characteristics of SG EOS based detonation models are examined in the context of varying EOS properties of the reactants and products, as well as closure conditions. The SG EOS based structure of oblique shock and detonation waves are also examined. Finally, in a separate exercise, the implemetation and results of a series of large cylindrical rate-stick experiments with the NIHE <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate-fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (ANFO) is reported.

40|$|MSc (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 <b>Ammonium</b> <b>Nitrate-Fuel</b> <b>Oil</b> (ANFO) is the {{explosive}} generally {{used in the}} mining industry to blast ore from the rock face. The use and detonation of ANFO explosives in an underground mine is an intrinsically hazardous process. The by-products formed during blasting have been well studied {{over the years and}} modern mining techniques and methods have evolved to mitigate the inherent blasting and gas emission risks. However, there is insufficient research and quantitative data on mine workers’ respiratory exposure to blasting gasses under realistic underground conditions. Aim: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether blasting gasses such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ammonia (NH 3) pose an inhalation health risk to underground mine workers cleaning at the blasting panels approximately three hours after the detonation of ANFO explosives. Scraper Winch Operators’ (SWOs) respiratory exposure to selected blasting gasses was simultaneously sampled by means of active and passive sampling methodologies. Method: Personal exposures to NO, NO 2 and NH 3 were measured and analysed in accordance with NIOSH methods 6014 and 6015. Along with the active air samplers, respiratory exposure to NO 2 and NH 3 were measured by means of radial symmetry diffusive samplers (Aquaria® RING). Measurements were taken over an 8 -hour period, where this was not applicable; results were time weighed to an average 8 -hour exposure concentration in order to compare the Scraper Winch Operators’ (SWOs) respiratory exposure to the Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) contained in the Regulations of the Mine Health and Safety Act (No. 29 of 1996). Results: The active air sampling results indicated that the SWOs’ respiratory exposure to NO, NO 2 and NH 3 complied with their respective OELs contained in the Regulations of the Mine Health and Safety Act (No. 29 of 1996). However, one of the SWOs had an exposure which exceeded the action level (50 % of OEL) at which level the implementation of control measures are recommended to reduce the SWO’s exposure. Based on the results of the Wilcoxon matched pairs test, statistical significant differences were observed between the exposure results of the two sampling methodologies for NO 2 (p = 0. 00078) and NH 3 (p = 0. 044), with the passive diffusive sampling technique under sampling when compared to the active sampling method. This was also confirmed by a Spearman rank order correlation which indicated a poor relationship between the two sampling methods for NO 2 (r = - 0. 323) and NH 3 (r = 0. 090). Environmental conditions (i. e. temperature and humidity), as presented in an underground mine, may have been a major factor for the variation between the two sampling methods, mostly affecting the passive samplers. Conclusion: It was established that engineering and administrative control measures implemented at the underground mine were effective to control SWOs’ respiratory exposure to NO, NO 2 and NH 3 below their respective OELs. An acute health risk pertaining the inhalation of blasting gasses was, therefore, not presented to mine workers cleaning at the blasting panels approximately three hours after the detonation of ANFO explosives. However, long-term exposure to blasting gasses at low concentrations may present SWOs with a health risk if such exposures are not adequately controlled or mitigated. The dilution and production of blasting gasses also varied from one blasting level to another. Geological formation, explosive charge-up and loading practices, the amount of water vapour inside the stopes and ventilation parameters are among the factors that may have affected the amount of blasting gasses produced underground. In addition, a drop in the carbon monoxide levels as indicated by the mine’s central gas monitoring system would not necessarily mean a lowering in other blasting gas concentrations (i. e. elevated ammonia gas concentrations as identified in the present study). The personal exposure levels between the active and passive sampling measurements also differed considerably. This may be ascribed to the impact underground mining conditions and processes had on the sampling media as well the complexities involved when sampling blasting gasses in general. Master...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The health {{benefits}} of increased intakes of omega- 3 fatty acids are well established but palatability often presents a problem. The process of emulsification {{is used in the}} food industry to provide a wider spectrum of use, often with the result of increased consumption. Moreover, as emulsification is an important step in the digestion and absorption of fats, the pre-emulsification process may enhance digestion and absorption. In this study the levels of plasma fatty acid and triacylglycerol (TAG) following the ingestion of either an <b>oil</b> <b>mixture</b> or an emulsified <b>oil</b> <b>mixture</b> have been compared. Methods In this randomised cross-over study, 13 volunteers received the <b>oil</b> <b>mixture</b> and 11 received the oil emulsion as part of an otherwise fat free meal. Blood samples were collected at 0, 1. 5, 3, 4. 5, 6, 7. 5 and 9 hours after ingestion of oil, separated and stored at - 20 °C. Plasma triacylglycerols were assessed spectrophotometrically and fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography. Following a washout period of twenty days the procedure was repeated with the assignments reversed. Results The postprandial plasma TAG and the C 18 : 3 (n- 6), C 18 : 3 (n- 3), C 20 : 5 (n- 3) and C 22 : 6 (n- 3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels for the emulsified oil group were increased significantly (P = 0. 0182; P = 0. 0493; P = 0. 0137; P Conclusion Pre-emulsification of an <b>oil</b> <b>mixture</b> prior to ingestion increases the absorption of longer chain more highly unsaturated fatty acids (especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) but does not affect absorption of shorter chain less saturated fatty acids, suggesting that pre-emulsification of fish oils may be a useful means of boosting absorption of these beneficial fatty acids.
