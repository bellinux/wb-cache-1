40|$|Recreational {{architecture}} is {{a branch of}} <b>architectural</b> <b>activity</b> whose main object is formation of recreational spaces (territories, buildings, complexes) and equipment. The goal of recreational {{architecture is}} to create optimal (comfortable, lovely and realizable) environment for all recreation types and forms. This goal is realized by projects {{which are based on}} scientific research and recommendations. This activity needs more than casual work and living environment. It needs special space and equipment: territory, water area, buildings, and rooms. Everything can be called recreational environment. Recreational environment can be of various dimensional scales: enormous seaside or lake areas intended for recreation, resorts, recreational institution complexes and many single buildings, beaches, forest parks, pools. Recreational environment is possible not only out of town but in town as well.

50|$|In {{addition}} to his <b>architectural</b> <b>activities,</b> Jones was a keen photographer in the very earliest days of the medium.

Some of Jones' photographs of his own buildings and of York city, the earliest dating back to 1851, {{are to be found}} in the City of York Libraries and Archives; others at the City Reference Library, Leeds. A vast body of his photographic work, dating from the very earliest days of photography, now resides at the National Media Museum, Bradford. 2,100 negatives, along with some prints, have been meticulously catalogued in a 340-page index. Scenes include some of his earliest commissions, at Castle Oliver, Parlington Hall, Garforth Church and Aberford Almshouses. The collection spans Jones' entire career and includes considerable numbers of images shot in Scotland, Ireland, Corsica, Belgium, Norway, Sweden and even New Zealand. Clearly Jones had a fondness for travel. Within the collection are several large negatives which Jones' records as being Fox Talbot's work, although this has been disputed by Larry Schaaf, author & expert on Fox Talbot.|$|E
5000|$|John Verge {{was born}} in Christchurch, Hampshire. Many generations of the Verge family had been {{bricklayers}} and stonemasons. Verge married to Catherine Bowles {{at the age of}} twenty-two and went to London. From 1804 to 1828, he worked in London in the building trade, becoming a man of means. Verge's marriage eventually failed and, in 1828, he migrated to Sydney, Australia with his son George Philip, intending to take up a land grant. [...] The First land grant in 1829, he took up land on the Williams River, south of Dungog, New South Wales called Lyndhurst Vale. The second land grant in 1838, he took up land on the Macleay River named Austral Eden. Having insufficient capital to pursue pastoralism, Verge returned to the building industry between 1830 and 1837, fortuitously {{at a time when the}} colonial economy was prospering and designers and builders were in high demand. Between 1830 and 1834 was his maximum <b>architectural</b> <b>activities.</b> He was patronised by many of prominent businessmen and colonists.

In 1858, Verge married Mary, 50-year-old daughter of John Alford at Austral Eden. Verge died on 9 July 1861 at the age of 79 in Austral Eden.

50|$|Buddhism was co-existent {{with the}} {{indigenous}} Dravidian {{cultural and social}} practices of Kerala. Early Tamil Sangam literature says that by the First century A.D. the Cheras all of present-day Kerala, parts of Tulunadu and Kodagu, and the Kongu lands (present Salem and Coimbatore region). It had multiple capitals simultaneously administered by different lineages of the Family, its main capital being Vanchi, identified with the Thiruvanchikulam near Kodungallur. At this time, the two extremities of the Kerala region were administered by two Velir families. The southernmost part administered by the Ay chieftains of Thiruvananthapuram and the northernmost parts by the Nannans of Ezhilmalai. The Nannan line was {{a branch of the}} Ay originating in the Thiruvananthapuram area and both were representatives (or vassals) under the suzerainty of the Cheras (and sometimes the Pandyas or Cholas or Pallavas). Brahmanas appeared to have settled in Kerala and established their religion. The amalgamation of different cultures and religious philosophies helped to evolve the architectural styles of Kerala temples. This was highly conducive of architectural development and renovation {{of a large number of}} temples. After the decline of the Cheras several small principalities developed all over Kerala. By fifteenth century, Kerala was broadly covered by the suzerainty of four principal chieftains - Venad rulers in the south, Kochi Maharajas in the centre, Zamorins of Kozhikode in the north and Kolathiri Rajas in the extreme north. They were rulers who patronized <b>architectural</b> <b>activities.</b> It was this period, Kerala Architecture started shaping its own distinctive style. A regional character in construction incorporating the Dravidian craft skills, unique forms of Buddhist buildings, design concepts of vedic times and canonical theories of Brahmanical Agamic practices in locally available materials and suited to the climatic conditions was finally evolved in Kerala. The theory and practice of architectural construction were also compiled during this period.|$|E
