25|$|Ferdinand's {{policy of}} {{centralization}} was continued {{during the reign}} of his son Alfonso X; during a period of unrest in Compostela, with the city council confronted with the archbishop, he introduced an alcalde or representative of the Crown into the local government, later delivering the see of Compostela to a Castilian, after forcing archbishop Gonsalvo Gomes to flee to France; thus starting a process that eventually led to the replacement of Galician bishops, abbots and noblemen, by Castilians during 15th, 16th, and successive centuries. Anyway, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> his father, he again usually favoured the bourgeois through the concession of numerous constitutional charters to new towns, angering the nobility.|$|E

Recovered as editor of the newspaper Libertatea, Ștefan Baciu became affiliated to the Social Democratic anti-communist faction, and, appointed to a diplomatic posting in Bern, defected to the West. He worked as a writer and academic in Latin America, Seattle, and ultimately Honolulu. He was kept under surveillance by the Securitate, which repeatedly claimed that he was secretly an Iron Guard affiliate.|$|E

60|$|Hetty nodded sympathetically, for she {{had seen}} the great desolate room at Fremont where Grant and Breckenridge passed the bitter nights alone.

6000|$|The {{existence}} of a single race, remarkably constant in form during the whole Neolithic period, is an interesting fact in contrast with what we see of the changes which the races underwent {{during the period of}} the successive Egyptian monuments, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> our existing dogs. The character of this animal during the Neolithic period, as given by Rutimeyer, supports De Blainville's view that our varieties have descended from an unknown and extinct form. But we should not forget that we know nothing with respect to the antiquity of man in the warmer parts of the world. The succession of the different kinds of dogs in Switzerland and Denmark is thought to be due to the immigration of conquering tribes bringing with them their dogs; and this view accords with the belief that different wild canine animals were domesticated in different regions. Independently of the immigration of new races of man, we know from the wide-spread presence of bronze, composed of an alloy of tin, how much commerce there must have been throughout Europe at an extremely remote period, and dogs would then probably have been bartered. At the present time, amongst the savages of the interior of Guiana, the Taruma Indians are considered the best trainers of dogs, and possess a large breed which they barter at a high price with other tribes.

60|$|Later in the evening, on his {{way from}} the night-school, {{he was at the}} door again to leave a parish {{magazine}} with a list of services that ought to have rejoiced Armine's heart, if he had felt capable of enjoying anything at St. Cradocke's, and at which Babie looked with some dismay, as if fearing that they would all be inflicted on her. He was in a placid, martyr-like state. He had made up his mind that the air was of the relaxing sort that disagreed with him, and no doubt would be fatal, though as he coughed rather less than more, he could hardly hope to edify Bobus by his death-bed, unless he could expedite matters by breaking a blood-vessel in saving someone's life. On the whole, however, it was pleasanter to pity himself for vague possibilities than to apprehend the crisis as immediate. It was true that he was very forlorn. He missed the admiring petting by which Miss Parsons had fostered his morbid state; he missed the occupations she had given him, and he missed the luxurious habits of wealth far more than he knew. After his winters under genial skies, close to blue Mediterranean waves, English weather was trying; <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> southern scenery, people, and art, everything seemed ugly, homely, and vulgar in his eyes. Gorgeous Cathedrals with their High Masses and sweet Benedictions, their bannered processions and kneeling peasantry, rose in his memory as he beheld the half restored Church, the stiff, open seats, and the Philistine precision of the St. Cradocke's Old Church congregation; and Anglicanism shared his distaste, in spite of the fascinations of the district Church.|$|E
6000|$|There are two {{subjects}} in the modern English school that stand by themselves <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> anything one finds in the records of ancient and oriental schools, as a very integral {{part of what is}} regarded as our elementary general education. They are of very doubtful value in training the mind, and most of the matter taught is totally forgotten in adult life. These are history and geography. These two subjects constitute, with English grammar and arithmetic, the four obligatory subjects for the very lowest grade of the London College of Preceptors' examinations, for example. The examination papers of this body reveal the history as an affair of dated events, a record of certain wars and battles, and legislative and social matters quite beyond the scope of a child's experience and imagination. Scholastic history ends at 1700 or 1800, always long before it throws the faintest light upon modern political or social conditions. The geography is, for the most part, topography, with a smattering of quantitative facts, heights of mountains, for example, populations of countries, and lists of obsolete manufactures and obsolete trade conditions. Any one who will take the trouble to run through the text-books of these subjects gathered together in the library of the London Teachers' Guild, will find that the history is generally taught without maps, pictures, descriptive passages, or anything to raise it above the level of an arid misuse of memory; and the highest levels to which ordinary school geography has attained {{are to be found in}} the little books of the late Professor Meiklejohn. These two subjects are essentially [...] "information" [...] subjects. They differ in prestige rather than in educational quality from school chemistry and natural history, and their development marks the beginning of that great accumulation of mere knowledge which is so distinctive of this present civilization.|$|E
