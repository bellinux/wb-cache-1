5|$|With Rashad narrating the film's final scene, Teddy {{opens his}} own {{business}} concerning the production of gold teeth, as Big Gipp makes a cameo appearance in his shop, Brooklyn finds {{a job at a}} Krystal restaurant, while Esquire receives a mysterious letter of recommendation (presumably from Garnett) and is able to attend his college. The twins Veda and Star remain in the old neighborhood and hang out at Cascade on Sundays, while Erin goes to Spelman College, the school she wanted to attend, in which Rashad appreciates a lot more because she's still close. Uncle George starts attending church more often and finds <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>woman</b> to date. Ant changes direction, discarding the notion of drug dealing, finds a new girlfriend and begins to focus on his studies in school. Rashad, lastly, becomes a comic artist for the Sunday edition of the Atlanta Evening Standard, the city's newspaper. The film ends with Rashad leaving his skates in Cascades, and the building's lights go off.|$|E
25|$|Lizzie Hexam also {{objects to}} her {{marriage}} to Eugene Wrayburn. She does not aspire to marrying Wrayburn even though she loves him and would be elevated in society simply by marrying him, which almost any woman would have done at the time. Lizzie feels that she is unworthy of him. Wrayburn, however, feels that he is unworthy of such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>woman.</b> He also knows that his father would disapprove of her low social status. Therefore, both of them end up going against expectations by marrying each other.|$|E

500|$|... "Once the {{manuscript}} was complete, he [...] sat opposite Richards {{and read the}} entire book aloud to him ... He {{turned out to be}} a really natural editor. He cut according to the sound of it." [...] Rebecca Dana of The Daily Beast said of Life that it [...] "covers all the bases: sex, drugs, guitar riffs, the size of Mick Jagger’s endowment. It also digs down into softer spots, including Richards’ tumultuous relationship with Anita Pallenberg and the death of their son. The book, which already seems to have earned a place in the admittedly small canon of genuinely great rock lit, is dishy but not lurid, technical but not wonky. Richards’ voice, filtered through Fox’s brain, is so relentlessly endearing, no less a critic than Maureen Dowd has declared the prince of darkness a [...] "consummate gentleman." [...] Time's Richard Corliss writes [...] "Confessional autobiographies, unless they're by William Boroughs, tend to have inspirational endings: salvation through strong will or <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>woman.</b> Life has both." ...|$|E
500|$|The central {{action of}} Love's Last Shift {{is a celebration}} of the power of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>woman,</b> Amanda, to reform a rakish husband, Loveless, by means of sweet {{patience}} and a daring bed-trick. She masquerades as a prostitute and seduces Loveless without being recognised, and then confronts him with logical argument. Since he enjoyed the night with her while taking her for a stranger, a wife can be as good in bed as an illicit mistress. Loveless is convinced and stricken, and a rich choreography of mutual kneelings, risings and prostrations follows, generated by Loveless' penitence and Amanda's [...] "submissive eloquence". The première audience is said to have wept at this climactic scene. The play was a great box-office success and was for a time the talk of the town, in both a positive and a negative sense. Some contemporaries regarded it as moving and amusing, others as a sentimental tear-jerker, incongruously interspersed with sexually explicit Restoration comedy jokes and semi-nude bedroom scenes.|$|E
500|$|As a final {{tribute to}} Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special {{television}} programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional {{look back at}} Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>woman,</b> she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family. That {{was the most important}} thing in her life." ...|$|E
