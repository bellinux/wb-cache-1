5|$|Aluminum {{production}}, shipbuilding, {{and nuclear}} {{production at the}} Hanford site contributed to a rapid increase in regional demand for electricity. By 1943, fully 96 percent of Columbia River electricity was being used for war manufacturing. The volume of water at Celilo Falls made The Dalles an <b>attractive</b> <b>site</b> for a new dam {{in the eyes of}} the Corps of Engineers.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Lees Ferry {{served as}} a gateway for the {{expansion}} of white settlement from Utah south into Arizona. Most of the settlers were Mormons, who had been long established in the Utah Valley near present-day Salt Lake City, and were looking for additional land. Although the river at Lee's Ferry is too deep to ford for most of the year, its relatively calm current presented an <b>attractive</b> <b>site</b> for crossing by boat. Jacob Hamblin successfully crossed the river here in 1864, and during the next few years the Mormon presence swelled to the scale of a small military outpost (Fort Meeks) in order to defend against Navajo raids. However, these works eventually fell into disrepair as a result {{of not being able to}} sustain themselves in the valley.|$|E
25|$|The Seaway, {{along with}} the Saint Lawrence River it passes through also {{provides}} opportunities for outdoor recreation, such as boating, camping, fishing, and scuba diving. Unfortunately invasive species and artificial water level controls imposed by the Seaway have had {{a negative impact on}} recreational fishing. Of note, The Old Power House near Lock 23 (near Morrisburg, Ontario) became an <b>attractive</b> <b>site</b> for scuba divers. The submerged stone building has become covered with barnacles and is home to an abundance of underwater life.|$|E

25|$|Cricinfo's {{significant}} {{growth in}} the 1990s made it an <b>attractive</b> <b>site</b> for investors during {{the peak of the}} dotcom boom, and in 2000 it received $37 million worth of Satyam Infoway Ltd. shares in exchange for a 25% stake in the company (a valuation of around £100 million). It used around $22m worth of the paper to pay off initial investors but only raised about £6 million by selling the remaining stock. While the site continued to attract more and more users and operated on a very low cost base, its income was not enough to support a peak staff of 130 in nine countries, forcing redundancies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{powerful}} Duck River {{made the}} Old Stone Fort's peninsula an <b>attractive</b> <b>site</b> for mills {{as early as}} 1823, when Samuel Murray built a rope factory on the Little Duck River. Although the factory burned in 1847, {{it was followed by}} W.S. Whitman's paper mill further downstream in 1852. In 1862, Whitman built a powder factory adjacent to his paper mill to supply the Confederacy during the Civil War; it was destroyed by Union troops the following year. In 1879, the Stone Fort Paper Company built a large mill near Big Falls on the Duck River. The mill supplied paper to newspapers throughout the Southeast including the Nashville Banner and the Atlanta Constitution until the early 20th century. [...] The mill's foundations are on the bluffs overlooking Big Falls, and can be accessed via the Old Stone Fort Loop Trail.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991 NSB {{decided to}} build a new station in Sandvika and chose Arne Henriksen's design. The station saw the tracks raised through Sandvika, {{allowing}} the town to be freed from the bonds of a railway running through it. Work was combined with {{the construction of a new}} bus terminal and a parking garage. In addition to increasing capacity, the goal was also to make Sandvika a more <b>attractive</b> <b>site</b> to travel through. NSB hoped that the new station would contribute to make Sandvika [...] "softer". This saw the road past the station closed for traffic, shorter transfer distance between trains and buses. Construction commenced in late 1991. A controversy arose over the fate of Hoel's station building. Several locals wanted to preserve the building, but it was in the way for the design of the new station. Both it and the platform building from 1961 were demolished. The Airport Express Train started services on 27 September 1998.|$|E

2500|$|Turnagain Arm {{is one of}} {{only about}} 60 bodies of water {{worldwide}} to exhibit a tidal bore. The bore may be more than six feet high and travel at 15 miles per hour on high spring tides. Turnagain Arm sees the largest tidal range in United States, with a mean of 30 feet (9.2 m), and the fourth highest in the world, behind Bay of Fundy (11.7m), Ungava Bay (9.75m), and Bristol Channel (9.6m). The ocean's natural 12-hour 25-minute tidal cycle is close to Turnagain Arm's natural resonance frequency, which then reinforces the tide similar to water sloshing in a bathtub. [...] Tidal fluctuations in the main body of Cook Inlet, while not as extreme as the shallow and narrow Turnagain Arm, regularly reach [...] and exhibit currents in excess of [...] at full tidal flow. [...] The inlet and its arms have been proposed as a potentially <b>attractive</b> <b>site</b> for the generation of tidal power.|$|E

During the late 1980s and early 1990s the number of ten-pin bowling alleys across the UK rose to over two hundred. This was higher than it had ever been in the 1960s, then the peak of the sport's popularity.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{to estimate the}} temperature dependent interaction between two uncharged point defects in Si based on DFT calculations. As an illustration, {{the formation of the}} uncharged di-vacancy V 2 is discussed, based on the temperature dependent attractive field between both vacancies. For that purpose, all irreducible configurations of two uncharged vacancies are determined, each with their weight given by the number of equivalent configurations. Using a standard 216 -atoms supercell, nineteen irreducible configurations of two vacancies are obtained. The binding energies of all these configurations are calculated. Each vacancy is surrounded by several <b>attractive</b> <b>sites</b> for another vacancy. The obtained temperature dependent of total volume of these <b>attractive</b> <b>sites</b> has a radius that is closely related with the capture radius for the formation of a di-vacancy that is used in continuum theory. The presented methodology can in principle also be applied to estimate the capture radius for pair formation of any type of point defects...|$|R
