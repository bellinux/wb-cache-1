Sources disagree on matriculation and graduation dates, as well as Crittenden's age and the duration of his studies at the other institutions.|$|E
5|$|The Queen of Somnia {{tells the}} Hero to {{discover}} who he really is. The quest leads {{the party to}} Arkbolt, where a terrible monster is blocking a nearby cave. The reward for defeating the monster is the famed Sunderbolt Blade, but before the party can strike the final blow, a warrior {{by the name of}} Terry kills the monster, winning the sword. After traveling both worlds, the party learns that Murdaw was not the only evil in the world, having fought several other monsters that <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be connected.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, The Amazing Maleeni, a small-time magician, performs an amazing feat to impress a heckler—he turns his head 360 degrees. So when he is later found without a head at all, Mulder and Scully arrive on the case and discover an angry ex-con, an unimpressed rival, and Maleeni’s twin brother. <b>All</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{have something to do}} with a plan to rob a major bank.|$|E
5|$|The {{jewellery}} {{consists of}} three gold pendants, two glass beads, one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair pin. The pendants and beads <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been strung together, probably forming a necklace that was in place {{around the neck of}} the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon pendants inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel inlaid with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of gold leaf to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of jewellery, as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E

Moreover, {{unlike many other}} African Muslims, Sudanese Muslims did not <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{feel the need to}} identify with one or another tariqa, even if the affiliation were nominal. Many Sudanese Muslims preferred more political movements that sought to change Islamic society and governance to conform to their own visions of the true nature of Islam.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} of El Jebha {{is known for}} its clean and natural beaches, which <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have a different appearance. The bays behind the eastern mountain are ideal to enjoy the sun and the beach in absolute solitude. On the other hand, the beaches {{on the west side of}} El Jebha are more accessible and characterised by a somewhat rough surface and grey sand. The beaches of the west are more crowded than the bays of the east.|$|E

25|$|Other authors {{speculate}} that turacos and other birds employing {{the use of}} turacoverdin may derive a physiological and biochemical benefit from synthesizing the pigment. Copper, like porphyrins, can be damaging to birds when accumulated at high concentrations. Turacos may detoxify {{the high levels of}} copper ingested in a diet rich with porphyrins, thereby advertising the protection they've granted themselves by depositing the copper-rich pigments in their feathers. It also may be of some biological significance that turacos <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be pigmented with turacin and turacoverdin in exactly the same regions of the wing feathers.|$|E

He is bored with everyone; <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be paying obeisance {{to his wife}} because they regard her as the more powerful, his title and power having come only from his marriage to her: “Such torment and such martyrdom I cannot bear much longer”. His sycophantic courtiers tell him how much they sympathize but wonder why he does not break free given his position as Duke. Also, they warn {{him that if he}} does not act, Beatrice's servants may well begin plotting against him.|$|E
25|$|Although popularly {{associated}} with China the incense clock is believed {{by some to}} have originated in India, at least in its fundamental form, if not function. Early incense clocks found in China between the 6th and 8th centuries CE <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have Devanāgarī carvings on them rather than Chinese seal characters. To explain this, Edward Schafer asserts that incense clocks were probably an Indian invention, transmitted to China. Silvio Bedini {{on the other hand}} asserts that incense clocks were derived in part from incense seals mentioned in Tantric Buddhist scriptures, which first came to light in China after those scriptures from India were translated into Chinese, but holds that the time-telling function of the seal was incorporated by the Chinese.|$|E

25|$|The {{assumption}} of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions {{of what is}} aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> agree {{in at least one}} point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but {{they do not have to}} do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human.|$|E
25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> require the reader/writer {{to know something about}} the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access to}} the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must know something about the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E
500|$|Ill from {{drink and}} {{suffering}} from smoker's cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles. He {{seems to have}} moved with thoughts of founding an art colony. The Danish artist Christian Mourier-Petersen became his companion for two months, and at first Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he {{described it as a}} foreign country: [...] "The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> me creatures from another world." ...|$|E

500|$|Bertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine {{and colleagues}} {{compared}} Jeanne Calment {{with a list}} of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. [...] "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end".|$|E
500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and he came over and said 'You <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be having a good time, can I buy you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. He felt as if he had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E
500|$|In 1947 Michael Pertwee, a {{scriptwriter}} at Ealing Studios, {{suggested an}} adaptation of a 1907 Roy Horniman novel, Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal. The reviewer Simon Heffer observes that {{the plot of the}} source novel was dark in places—it includes the murder of a child—and differed in several respects from the resulting film. A major difference was that the main character was the half-Jewish (as opposed to half-Italian) Israel Rank, and Heffer writes that Mazzini's [...] "ruthless using of people (notably women) and his greedy pursuit of position <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> conform to the stereotype that the anti-semite has of the Jew". The change from Israel Rank to Louis Mazzini was brought about by the [...] "post-war sensitivity about anti-Semitism", and the moral stance of the films produced by Ealing. According to the British Film Institute (BFI), the novel is [...] "self-consciously in the tradition" [...] of Oscar Wilde, which is reflected in the snobbery and dandyism portrayed in the film.|$|E
