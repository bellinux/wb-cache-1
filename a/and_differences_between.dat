5|$|Classic TV Press {{published}} the book Worlds Apart: an unofficial and unauthorised {{guide to the}} BBC's remake of Survivors (March 2010), written by Rich Cross, shortly after transmission of the second series completes. The book incorporates: in depth synopses and reviews for all the episodes from Series 1 and 2; insights into {{the making of the}} series; examination of the similarities <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the new series and the 1970s series; a photographic guide to filming locations; and exclusive production shots.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E

Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences.

5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out similarities <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that {{this might have been}} a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} the turnpike in the Philadelphia area had become a {{congested}} commuter road by the 1980s. In 1983, funding was approved to widen the turnpike to six lanes between the Valley Forge and Philadelphia interchanges. This planned project was put on hold because of disagreements between Governor Dick Thornburgh and the turnpike commission members, <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the commissioners. The Pennsylvania Legislature approved the project in 1985; the road would be widened between the Norristown and Philadelphia interchanges. Construction on the widening began on March 10, 1986, and was completed on November 23, 1987 with a ribbon-cutting at the Philadelphia interchange. The widening project cost $120 million. An interchange to serve the New Cumberland Defense Depot near Harrisburg was planned in the 1980s. In 1992, the turnpike commission decided not to build it because it would instead build a connector road to the depot between PA 114 and Old York Road that would parallel the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{among both}} ancient authors and modern scholars about the ethnic {{identity of the}} ancient Macedonians. Ernst Badian notes that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of Arrian, who lived {{at the time of}} the Roman Empire, when any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible. Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected hegemon PhilipII, when he was not a member of the league itself). Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou, Malcolm Errington, and Craige B. Champion.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the viewer is left to interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, as the boy character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey through Hell to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his sister or both are dead. Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting as the boy travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or the similarities <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could be human remains stand in their places.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} is young and predominantly rural, with a density {{among the highest}} in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the Banyarwanda, although within this group there are three subgroups: the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by an ordered administrative hierarchy since pre-colonial times; there are five provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the debate}} that {{immediately}} followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on the similarities <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> humans and modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order {{from any of the}} other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for all the differences between humans and apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.|$|E

40|$|The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> {{the time}} scales of {{consumer}} and resource dynamics {{is a critical}} factor for the coexistence of consumers that occupy different temporal niches in a seasonal environment. Its significance is investigated using a general discrete cyclic model involving two consumers competing for the exploitation of one resource. Simulations confirm and extend previous analytical results. Temporal overlap <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> consumer efficiencies play roles that are in general qualitatively {{similar to those of}} niche overlap <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> carrying capacities in the classical theory of competition in a constant environment. But the relative time scale of resource dynamics plays a crucial role which does not have an analogue in the classical theory: coexistence at the consumer level is possible only above threshold values of both frequency and speed of dynamics at the resource level. © 1992.
