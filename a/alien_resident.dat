5000|$|English common law, under {{principles}} of jus sanguinis, viewed English persons {{and their children}} in the colonies as full subjects of the king. [...] English common law was less clear on the status of <b>alien</b> <b>residents</b> in the colonies, who generally faced a difficult naturalization process to obtain the same legal rights inhered to natural-born English and their descendants. Issues in early naturalization policy stemmed from the legal relationships between England and its colonies. [...] The strongest legal bonds between England and the American colonies lay in the colonial charters, many of which professed <b>alien</b> <b>residents</b> in the colonies would eventually become “Our Loving subjects and live under Our Allegiance.” [...] Ambiguity in the colonial charters created uncertainty as to whether the authority to naturalize <b>alien</b> <b>residents</b> resided within the colonies themselves or emanated directly from Parliament in London. Legislative bodies from both locations ultimately issued separate and sometimes conflicting naturalization laws, the interaction of which influenced early patterns of non-English immigration to the American colonies.|$|R
50|$|Russians in Taiwan form a small community. As of April 2013, {{statistics}} of Taiwan's National Immigration Agency (NIA) showed 363 Russians holding valid <b>Alien</b> <b>Resident</b> Certificates. Informal estimates claim that their population {{may be as}} large as one thousand people.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Alien</b> <b>Resident</b> Certificate (...) , or ARC, {{is given}} to foreign {{residents}} in Taiwan, while the nearly identical Taiwan Area Resident Certificate (...) , or TARC, {{is given to}} nationals of the Republic of China resident in Taiwan without National Identification Cards, namely overseas Chinese, recently naturalized nationals. Residents from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau (i.e. nationals of the People's Republic of China) are given separate resident certificates.|$|E
50|$|The {{taxation}} {{of income}} for H-1B employees depends on whether they are categorized as either non-resident <b>aliens</b> or <b>resident</b> <b>aliens</b> for tax purposes.

50|$|Alien {{registration}} (gaikokujin tōroku) was {{a system}} used to record information regarding <b>aliens</b> <b>resident</b> in Japan. It was handled at the municipal level, parallel to (but separately from) the koseki (family register) and juminhyo (resident register) systems used to record information regarding Japanese nationals.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{in charge}} of {{emergency}} services, such as the Paris Fire Brigade, and performs administrative duties, such as issuing ID cards and driver licenses or monitoring <b>alien</b> <b>residents.</b> The Prefecture of Police also has limited security duties in the wider Île-de-France région.|$|R

5000|$|Private naturalization before Parliament {{afforded the}} highest legal status an <b>alien</b> <b>resident</b> could obtain in the colonies. However, {{it was an}} {{expensive}} process, costing applicants upwards of 50 pounds during the 1670s. Further, it was exclusive, in that embedded sacramental tests were designed to bar Catholics from subjectship, yet restricted other non-Christians from the benefits of parliamentary naturalization as well. [...] Alternatively, aliens could seek royal denization, which was a more accessible path to permanent residency yet conferred a lesser form of citizenship than private naturalization.|$|E
5000|$|ROC {{nationals}} with household registration in Taiwan {{are known}} as [...] "registered nationals". ROC nationals {{who do not have}} household registration in Taiwan (known as [...] "unregistered nationals") do not qualify for the Identification Card and its associated privileges (e.g., the right to vote and the right of abode in Taiwan), but qualify for the Republic of China passport, which unlike the Identification Card, is not indicative of residency rights in Taiwan. If such [...] "unregistered nationals" [...] are resident in Taiwan, they will hold a Taiwan Area Resident Certificate as an identity document, which is nearly identical to the <b>Alien</b> <b>Resident</b> Certificate issued to foreign nationals/citizens resident in Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|The {{end of the}} 37th weekly Torah portion Shlach Lecha (Lev. 15.22-31) again, {{deals with}} sacrifices for {{inadvertent}} violations: they are applicable for all laws, apply to both Israelites and <b>alien</b> <b>residents,</b> but exclude expiation of defiant, willful violations of ritual law (cf. Kareth).|$|R
50|$|U. S. noncitizen {{nationals}} may reside {{and work}} in the United States without restrictions, and may apply for citizenship under the same rules as <b>resident</b> <b>aliens.</b> Like <b>resident</b> <b>aliens,</b> they are not presently allowed by any U.S. state to vote in federal or state elections, although, as with <b>resident</b> <b>aliens,</b> there is no constitutional prohibition against their doing so. Like U.S. citizens, U.S. noncitizen nationals may transmit their U.S. noncitizen nationality to children born abroad, although the rules are somewhat different from those for U.S. citizens.|$|R
50|$|In Japan the koseki {{system is}} used to record Japanese {{families}} and the juminhyo system {{is used to}} record individual residents.

50|$|In Taiwan, most {{teachers}} work in cram schools, {{known locally as}} bushibans or buxibans. Some are part of chains, like Hess and Kojen. Others operate independently. Such schools pay around US$2,000 per month. End-of-contract bonuses equivalent to an extra month's pay are not mandated by law as in South Korea, and are uncommon in Taiwan. Also, under current law it is illegal for foreigners to teach English in pre-schools or kindergartens, though it is almost always overlooked by both the schools and the government, thereby making the practice common and accepted. To teach English and live in Taiwan, {{you must be a}} holder of an <b>Alien</b> <b>Resident</b> Card (ARC), which is supplied to passport holders of native English speaking countries by hiring schools. ARC candidates must hold a bachelor's degree from a university.|$|E
50|$|Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, then {{president}} John F. Kennedy imposed travel restrictions on February 8, 1963, and the Cuban Assets Control Regulations were issued on July 8, 1963, under the Trading with the Enemy Act {{in response to}} Cubans hosting Soviet nuclear weapons. Under these restrictions, Cuban assets in the United States were frozen and the existing restrictions were consolidated in an embargo, known as el bloqueo, Spanish for blockade. Those who wished to leave Cuba were considered refugees, and were offered <b>alien</b> <b>resident</b> status in a US sponsored resettlement program transported on {{what became known as}} Freedom Flights (1965-1974). As they were unable to take any assets or personal belongings this often was only possible for those with friends, family, or sponsors in the United States and the path to citizenship. (Children born in the USA automatically became US citizens).|$|E
5000|$|The National Identification Card {{is issued}} to ROC {{nationals}} 14 {{years and older}} who have household registration in the Taiwan Area. Establishing household registration is required for a national over 14 years of age to possess a National Identification Card. Since the nationality law of the Republic of China makes no provision for [...] "citizens" [...] (公民) but merely defines those with ROC nationality as [...] "nationals" [...] (國民), ROC law makes a distinction between [...] "registered nationals" [...] (有戶籍國民) and [...] "unregistered nationals" [...] (無戶籍國民), with the former having the right of abode, right to vote, and other benefits of citizenship in Taiwan, while the latter are subject to deportation from Taiwan and need an entry permit to visit Taiwan. While [...] "registered nationals" [...] are entitled to hold the National Identification Card, [...] "unregistered nationals" [...] may only hold the Taiwan Area Resident Certificate. Both groups are eligible to hold the Republic of China passport. The Taiwan Area Resident Certificate is nearly identical to the <b>Alien</b> <b>Resident</b> Certificate (ARC) held by foreigners resident in Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|Though colonial naturalization laws {{differed}} {{in the political}} rights each bestowed to <b>alien</b> <b>residents,</b> they did generally confer the right to obtain land, which afforded each man the power to obtain the necessary voting qualifications for himself or, at the very least, for his heirs born in the American colonies.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{multitude}} of unique and highly complex U.S. domestic tax laws and regulations affecting the U.S. tax residency of foreign nationals, both nonresident <b>aliens</b> and <b>resident</b> <b>aliens,</b> in addition to income tax and social security tax treaties and Totalization Agreements.|$|R
5000|$|Non-Convention (or non-National) travel {{documents}} are travel documents issued by {{a country to}} non-citizen (also called <b>alien)</b> <b>residents</b> {{who do not have}} access to passport facilities from their own countries, are not recognized as either Convention refugees, and are not legally stateless under the 1954 Convention relating to the status of stateless persons (or the country they live in has not signed that convention).|$|R
50|$|As an <b>alien</b> <b>resident</b> of the Mindscape, Sleepwalker had {{exceptional}} visual abilities, {{being able}} to see over a much farther distance than an average human, as well as {{being able to}} see and follow energy trails, and see wavelength colors invisible to human eyes. Sleepwalker shares a mental link with the human Rick Sheridan that facilitates Sleepwalker's entry into Rick's mind. Instead of food, Sleepwalker fed on mental energy, needing to periodically return to Rick's mind to be able to regain his strength. When Rick appeared to be dead, Sleepwalker formed a temporary bond with a homeless man named Pike to borrow some of his mental energy, although he did this only with Pike's express permission. His training as a warrior of the Mindscape makes him skilled tracker and an expert in the combat use of his powers, and also gives him a certain amount of knowledge about various supernatural entities and the workings of the mind. Sleepwalker's presence could also strengthen the powers of psychic powers and mind-related magic, enhancing the mental abilities of Professor X, Moondragon, Jean Grey and Psylocke, enabling them to connect with the mind of every human on Earth to free the human race from mental enslavement by the Magus. Similarly, Sleepwalker's mere presence increased the power of Doctor Strange's mental spells and enabled him to imprison a mental demon released from a woman's mind by Nightmare. Continuing his supernatural 'expertise', Sleepwalker's nature also allows him to be aware of souls, allowing him to confirm that the natives of Counter-Earth did not have souls as they were nothing more than psychic manifestations created by Franklin Richards; he was also able to confirm that Jim Hammond had a soul despite his artificial origin.|$|E
40|$|Alteration {{of natural}} flow regimes is {{generally}} acknowledged to have {{negative effects on}} native biota; however, methods for defining ecologically appropriate flow regimes in managed river systems {{are only beginning to}} be developed. Understanding how past and present water management has affected rivers {{is an important part of}} developing such tools. In this paper, we evaluate how existing hydrologic infrastructure and management affect streamflow characteristics of rivers in the Central Valley, California and discuss those characteristics in the context of habitat requirements of native and alien fishes. We evaluated the effects of water management by comparing observed discharges with estimated discharges assuming no water management (‘full natural runoff’). Rivers in the Sacramento River drainage were characterized by reduced winter–spring discharges and augmented discharges in other months. Rivers in the San Joaquin River drainage were characterized by reduced discharges in all months but particularly in winter and spring. Two largely unaltered streams had hydrographs similar to those based on full natural runoff of the regulated rivers. The reduced discharges in the San Joaquin River drainage streams are favourable for spawning of many alien species, which is consistent with observed patterns of fish distribution and abundance in the Central Valley. However, other factors, such as water temperature, are also important to the relative success of native and <b>alien</b> <b>resident</b> fishes. As water management changes in response to climate change and societal demands, interdisciplinary programs of research and monitoring will be essential for anticipating effects on fishes and to avoid unanticipated ecological outcomes...|$|E
