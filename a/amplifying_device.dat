2500|$|Power {{amplifier}} circuits (output stages) {{are classified}} as A, B, AB and C for analog designs—and class D and E for switching designs. The power amplifier classes {{are based on the}} proportion of each input cycle (conduction angle) during which an <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> passes current. The image of the conduction angle derives from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. If the device is always on, the conducting angle is 360°. If it is on for only half of each cycle, the angle is 180°. The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier power efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{regenerative}} receiver the loop gain of the feedback loop {{was less than}} one, so the tube (or other <b>amplifying</b> <b>device)</b> did not oscillate but was close to oscillation, giving large gain. [...] In the super{{regenerative receiver}}, the loop gain was made equal to one, so the <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> actually began to oscillate, but the oscillations were interrupted periodically. [...] This allowed a single tube to produce gains of over 106.|$|E

40|$|Scientists and {{engineers}} are often {{confronted with the}} problem of detecting the presence of signal levels which approach the noise levels in available <b>amplifying</b> <b>devices.</b> This paper describes the factors which limit amplifier sensitivity and explains what the circuit designer can do to maximize sensitivity...|$|R
50|$|In the {{illustrations}} below, a {{bipolar junction transistor}} is shown as the <b>amplifying</b> <b>device.</b> However the same attributes are found with MOSFETs or vacuum tubes.|$|E
50|$|Active mixers use an <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> (such as a {{transistor}} or vacuum tube) {{to increase}} {{the strength of the}} product signal. Active mixers improve isolation between the ports, but may have higher noise and more power consumption. An active mixer can be less tolerant of overload.|$|E
5000|$|Gain {{compression}} is {{a reduction}} in [...] "differential" [...] or [...] "slope" [...] gain caused by nonlinearity of the transfer function of the <b>amplifying</b> <b>device.</b> This nonlinearity {{may be caused by}} heat due to power dissipation or by overdriving the active device beyond its linear region. It is a large-signal phenomenon of circuits.|$|E

50|$|Hooper's {{research}} and teaching experience was mainly {{in the area of}} transistor theory and characterization, pulse-forming circuits, wide band amplifiers, active filters and integrated circuit design. In 1968, Edward Moore Cherry and Daryl Hooper published their book on circuit design entitled <b>Amplifying</b> <b>Devices</b> and Low-Pass Amplifier Design. The book ran to 1036 pages and was regarded as the premier book on the design of transistor amplifiers.|$|R
50|$|In addition, active {{circuits}} {{with negative}} differential resistance {{can also be}} built with <b>amplifying</b> <b>devices</b> like transistors and op amps, using feedback. A number of new experimental negative differential resistance materials and devices have been discovered in recent years. The physical processes which cause negative resistance are diverse, and each type of device has its own negative resistance characteristics, specified by its current-voltage curve.|$|R
50|$|Parasitic {{oscillation}} is an undesirable electronic oscillation (cyclic {{variation in}} output voltage or current) in an electronic or digital device. It is often caused by feedback in an <b>amplifying</b> <b>device.</b> The problem occurs notably in RF, audio, and other electronic amplifiers {{as well as}} in digital signal processing. It is one of the fundamental issues addressed by control theory.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} {{electronic}} oscillation, motorboating occurs {{when some of}} the output energy from an <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> like a transistor or vacuum tube gets coupled back into the input circuit of the device (or possibly into an earlier stage of the amplifier circuit) with the proper phase for positive feedback. This indicates there is an unwanted feedback path through the circuit from output to input of an amplifying stage. The technical conditions for oscillation, given by the Barkhausen stability criterion, are that the total gain around the feedback loop (comprising the <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> and the feedback path) at the oscillation frequency must be one (0 dB), and that the phase shift must be a multiple of 360° (2π radians). Since most amplifying devices, transistors and tubes, are inverting, with the output signal 180° opposite in phase from the input, the feedback path must contribute the other 180° of shift.|$|E
50|$|Early {{developments}} of the integrated circuit go back to 1949, when German engineer Werner Jacobi (Siemens AG) filed a patent for an integrated-circuit-like semiconductor <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> showing five transistors on a common substrate in a 3-stage amplifier arrangement. Jacobi disclosed small and cheap hearing aids as typical industrial applications of his patent. An immediate commercial use of his patent has not been reported.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amplifying</b> <b>devices</b> {{may also}} have limits on their inputs, for example the maximum base current a bipolar {{transistor}} can take, and a vacuum tube may have problems with grid current if the input signal becomes too positive. These factors can distort (clip) the input signal, if {{it comes from a}} high enough impedance source, or destroy the device (and so the designer will probably employ other limiting circuits; see below).|$|R
50|$|<b>Amplifying</b> <b>devices</b> {{operating}} in class A conduct {{over the entire}} range of the input cycle. A class-A amplifier is distinguished by the output stage devices being biased for class A operation. Subclass A2 is sometimes used to refer to vacuum-tube class-A stages that drive the grid slightly positive on signal peaks for slightly more power than normal class A (A1; where the grid is always negative). This, however, incurs higher signal distortion.|$|R

50|$|Vacuum tubes {{remained}} the preferred <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> for 40 years, until researchers working for William Shockley at Bell Labs invented the transistor in 1947. In the following years, transistors made small portable radios, or transistor radios, possible {{as well as}} allowing more powerful mainframe computers to be built. Transistors were smaller and required lower voltages than vacuum tubes to work.|$|E
5000|$|The Audion (triode) {{vacuum tube}} invented by Lee De Forest in 1906 {{was the first}} {{practical}} <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> and revolutionized radio. [...] Vacuum tube transmitters replaced spark transmitters and made possible four new types of modulation: continuous wave (CW) radiotelegraphy, amplitude modulation (AM) around 1915 which could carry audio (sound), frequency modulation (FM) around 1938 which had much improved audio quality, and single sideband (SSB).|$|E
50|$|With the {{invention}} of FM by Edwin Armstrong, Fisher's desire to have a radio and <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> that could meet the goal of high fidelity became a reality. By the 1950s, the term receiver was used instead of radio for a unit that combined a tuner and an amplifier, but lacked speakers. In 1957, the Fisher Radio Company produced their first high fidelity FM/AM receiver, the monophonic 14-tube Fisher 500 (TA500).|$|E
5000|$|A {{multivibrator}} is {{an electronic}} circuit used {{to implement a}} variety of simple two-state devices such as relaxation oscillators, timers and flip-flops. It consists of two <b>amplifying</b> <b>devices</b> (transistors, vacuum tubes or other devices) cross-coupled by resistors or capacitors. The first multivibrator circuit, the astable multivibrator oscillator, was invented by Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch during World War I. [...] They called their circuit a [...] "multivibrator" [...] because its output waveform was rich in harmonics.|$|R
5000|$|The first radio {{receivers}} {{did not have}} to extract an audio signal but just detected the presence of the radio signal, and produced a sound during the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes".

50|$|Dr. Shane Todd was an American {{engineer}} who died under disputed circumstances in Singapore in June 2012. Local authorities said Dr. Todd had committed suicide, though his family {{insists that he}} was murdered, possibly {{in connection with the}} work he had been doing at the Institute for Micro Electronics ("IME"), part of the Singaporean government-run Agency for Science, Technology and Research ("A*STAR") involving a gallium nitride-based semiconductor <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> purportedly for the Chinese telecom company Huawei.|$|E
5000|$|In 1906 Lee De Forest added a third {{electrode}} and {{invented the}} first electronic <b>amplifying</b> <b>device,</b> the triode, which he named the Audion. This additional control grid modulates the current that flows between cathode and anode. The relationship between current flow and plate and grid voltage is often {{represented as a}} series of [...] "characteristic curves" [...] on a diagram. Depending on the other components in the circuit this modulated current flow can be used to provide current or voltage gain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{negative}} resistance oscillator model {{is not limited}} to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with two-port <b>amplifying</b> <b>devices</b> such as transistors and tubes also have {{negative resistance}}. [...] At high frequencies, transistors and FETs do not need a feedback loop, but with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable at the other port and show negative resistance due to internal feedback, causing them to oscillate. [...] So high frequency oscillators in general are designed using negative resistance techniques.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of integrated circuits (ICs) in the 1970s created another revolution, allowing an entire radio receiver {{to be put}} on a chip. ICs reversed the economics of radio design used with vacuum tube receivers. Since the marginal cost of adding additional <b>amplifying</b> <b>devices</b> (transistors) to the chip was essentially zero, the size and cost of the receiver was dependent not on how many active components were used, but on the passive components; inductors and capacitors, which could not be integrated easily on the chip.|$|R
50|$|The {{parasitic}} capacitance between the {{input and output}} electrodes of inverting <b>amplifying</b> <b>devices,</b> such as between the base and collector of transistors, is particularly troublesome because it is multiplied by the gain of the device. This Miller capacitance (first noted in vacuum tubes by John Milton Miller, 1920) is the major factor limiting the high frequency performance of active devices like transistors and vacuum tubes. The screen grid was added to triode vacuum tubes in the 1920s to reduce {{parasitic capacitance}} between the control grid and the plate, creating the tetrode, {{which resulted in a}} great increase in operating frequency.|$|R
5000|$|Like any <b>amplifying</b> <b>device,</b> valves add {{noise to}} {{the signal to}} be amplified. Even with a {{hypothetical}} perfect amplifier, however, noise is unavoidably present due to thermal fluctuations in the signal source (usually assumed to be at room temperature, T = 295 K). Such fluctuations cause an electrical noise power of , where kB is the Boltzmann constant and B the bandwidth. Correspondingly, the voltage noise of a resistance R into an open circuit is [...] and the current noise into a short circuit is [...]|$|E

A project proposal outline recovered from Dr. Todd's external hard drive found in his apartment showed {{that there was a}} proposal for IME and Huawei to co-develop an <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> powered by gallium nitride (GaN). Such devices have both commercial as well as military applications. Dr. Todd's research in GaN also involved traveling to New Jersey to procure the equipment necessary to further the GaN research from Veeco, a U.S. publicly listed technology company.|$|E

5000|$|Speech {{audiometry}} is {{a diagnostic}} hearing test designed to test word or speech recognition. It {{has become a}} fundamental tool in hearing-loss assessment. In conjunction with pure-tone audiometry, it can aid in determining the degree and type of hearing loss. Speech audiometry also provides information regarding discomfort or tolerance to speech stimuli and information on word recognition abilities. In addition, information gained by speech audiometry can help determine proper gain and maximum output of hearing aids and other <b>amplifying</b> <b>devices</b> for patients with significant hearing losses and help assess how well they hear in noise. Speech audiometry also facilitates audiological rehabilitation management.|$|R
50|$|Frequency {{multipliers}} {{have much}} in common with frequency mixers, and some of the same nonlinear devices are used for both: transistors operated in Class C and diodes. In transmitting circuits many of the <b>amplifying</b> <b>devices</b> (vacuum tubes or transistors) operate nonlinearly and create harmonics, so an amplifier stage can be made a multiplier by tuning the tuned circuit at the output to a multiple of the input frequency. Usually the power (gain) produced by the nonlinear device drops off rapidly at the higher harmonics, so most frequency multipliers just double or triple the frequency, and multiplication by higher factors is accomplished by cascading doubler and tripler stages.|$|R
5000|$|A class-D {{amplifier}} or {{switching amplifier}} is an electronic amplifier {{in which the}} <b>amplifying</b> <b>devices</b> (transistors, usually MOSFETs) operate as electronic switches, and not as linear gain devices as in other amplifiers. The signal to be amplified is a train of constant amplitude pulses, so the active devices switch rapidly {{back and forth between}} a fully conductive and nonconductive state. The analog signal to be amplified is converted to a series of pulses by pulse width modulation, pulse density modulation or other methods before being applied to the amplifier. After amplification, the output pulse train can be converted back to an analog signal by passing through a passive low pass filter consisting of inductors and capacitors.|$|R
