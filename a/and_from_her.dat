5|$|Only a {{few months}} later, on 14 December 1861, Albert died at Windsor Castle. During his final illness, Alice {{remained}} at his bedside. Alice sent for the Prince of Wales by telegram, without {{the knowledge of the}} Queen, who refused to notify him because she blamed him for Albert's death. The Queen was distraught by her husband's death, and the court entered a period of intense mourning. Alice became her mother's unofficial secretary, and for the next six months, the physical representation of the monarch. Through her passed the Queen's official papers to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> government ministers, while the Queen secluded herself from all public life. Alice was aided in this task by her younger sister Princess Louise. Although Princess Helena, Louise's elder sister, would normally have been selected to assist, her inability to go long without crying was held against her.|$|E
5|$|The album {{revealed}} {{a more personal}} side of the singer, illustrated in its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> personal and professional setbacks. Although it shared similar vocal production {{as well as an}} inclination to her signature pop and R ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. It {{was meant to be a}} continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC² included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns.|$|E
50|$|The myth {{recounts the}} following.

As they organized the universe horizontally and vertically, the four creator gods forged the pairs of gods who would control each area of power: the water (Tlaloc and Chalchiuhtlicue), the earth (Tlaltecuhtli and Tlalcíhuatl), fire (Xiuhtecuhtli and Chantico) {{and the dead}} (Mictlantecuhtli and Mictecacíhuatl).|$|R

25|$|Tohru {{describes}} herself as an excellent artist who loves cooking and cleaning. In the original Japanese, Tohru habitually speaks formally (see Honorific speech in Japanese), but not always correctly. She picked up this habit from her dead father, Katsuya, after he {{died when she was}} three, as a way of replacing him in her mother's eyes <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> father's family's statements that she was probably the daughter of a man her mother had an affair with. Tohru tends to be especially concerned for people with minor illnesses. This comes from the circumstances of her father's death, when Katsuya was originally diagnosed with a fever but eventually died of pneumonia.|$|E

Von Teese is known for her fascination with 1940s cinema and classic vintage style. This began at a young age and was fostered by her mother, who would buy clothes for her daughter to dress up. Her mother was a fan of old, Golden Age-era Hollywood films, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> Von Teese developed a fascination with the actresses of that day, especially Betty Grable.|$|E

After spending his childhood in Brazil, Batista and his family moved to Europe when he was a teenager, due to his father's occupation. They lived in Geneva, Düsseldorf and Brussels.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Ichijō's court, {{dominated}} by the powerful Fujiwara clan, was the seat of two rival imperial empresses, Teishi and Shōshi, each with ladies-in-waiting who were proficient writers producing works honoring their mistresses and the Fujiwara clan. The three most noteworthy Heian era diaries in the genre of Nikki Bungaku– Murasaki's Murasaki Shikibu nikki, Sei Shōnagon's The Pillow Book and Izumi Shikibu's (Izumi Shikibu Nikki)– came from the empresses's courts. Murasaki's diary covers a discrete period, most likely from 1008 to 1010. Only short and fragmentary pieces of the diary survive and its importance lies, in part, in the revelations about the author, about whom most of the known biographical facts come from it <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> c.1014 short poetry collection, the Murasaki Shikibu shū (or Poetic Memoirs).|$|E
25|$|When Emperor Xiaoming grew up, however, {{his mother}} refused to hand {{authority}} over to him. She successfully eliminated {{many of her}} opponents, including favourites of the emperor. The ancient Chinese historians who wrote the official history of the Northern Wei portrayed her as promiscuous. Both her lifestyle and her ruling style elicited widespread dissatisfaction among officials <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> son. Emperor Xiaoming gathered the people to oppose her and executed her lover Yuan Yi (元怿) in 520, causing deep hatred from his mother. After several failed attempts to overthrow the empress dowager, Xiaoming secretly ordered General Erzhu Rong to send troops to the capital Luoyang to coerce her into handing over the authority. When she learned about the plot, she discussed strategies with the officials who supported her.|$|E

500|$|Hügel-Marshall became {{active in}} the women's rights {{movement}} while in Frankfurt. But even among her feminist activist colleagues she felt isolated, {{because she was the}} only black woman there. She had never met another black German, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> years in the children's home she had learned to think of blacks (including herself) as inferior and immoral. Years later she commented that [...] "the most disastrous thing I learned at the home was self-hatred." [...] In 1986, she attended a meeting of Afro-Germans; she was 39 years old {{and it was the first}} time she had ever seen [...] "a black face that wasn't my own." [...] She was empowered by the sense of community and became an activist for Afro-Germans, studying their history and asserting their legitimacy in a society that still assumed that all Germans must be white.|$|E
500|$|Murray's {{theories}} {{never received}} support from {{experts in the}} Early Modern witch trials, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her [...] "factual errors and methodological failings". Indeed, the majority of scholarly reviews of her work produced during the 1920s and 1930s were largely critical. George L. Burr reviewed both of her initial books on the witch-cult for the American Historical Review. He stated {{that she was not}} acquainted with the [...] "careful general histories by modern scholars" [...] and criticised her for assuming that the trial accounts accurately reflected the accused witches' genuine experiences of witchcraft, regardless of whether those confessions had been obtained through torture and coercion. He also charged her with selectively using the evidence to serve her interpretation, for instance by omitting any supernatural or miraculous events that appear in the trial accounts. W. R. Halliday was highly critical in his review for Folklore, as was E. M. Loeb in his review for American Anthropologist.|$|E

500|$|Linois made {{determined}} {{efforts to}} turn Marengo {{away from the}} large British ship, but his flagship was too slow and London opened up a fierce fire. Linois responded in kind and a battle commenced in which both ships suffered serve damage to their masts and rigging. Belle Poule assisted Linois, but on the arrival of Amazon the French admiral gave orders for Bruilhac to escape. Turning to the northeast, Belle Poule pulled away with Amazon gaining rapidly. At 06:00, Linois tried to open some distance between Marengo <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> opponent, but found his flagship too badly damaged to manoeuvre, fire from London continuing unabated. At 08:30, Parker reached Bruilhac's frigate and opened fire, inflicting serious damage to Belle Poules rigging.

500|$|In March 1918, Rix Nicholas, {{along with}} her {{brother-in-law}} Athol Nicholas, left England and arrived in Melbourne on 10 May. There, with the encouragement of artist Henrietta Gulliver {{and the members of}} the city's Women's Art Club, Rix Nicholas began to reconstruct her career as a professional artist. It did not take long. In November, she was amongst the members of the Club whose works were displayed at the Athaeneum Hall, where a critic described her as the [...] "dominating personality of the show". At the same time, in Melbourne's Guild Hall she held a large exhibition of her European and north African paintings, sketches and drawings, with over a hundred works on display. Several were sold, including In Picardy, purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Noting the artist's success in Paris and London, the reviewer for The Argus admired her [...] "appreciation of character and talents for observation and representation", while The Age was struck by [...] "the influence of modern French Impressionism in [...] fearless handling of sunlight and open air effects." [...] When the exhibition travelled to Sydney in 1919, reviews were likewise positive both from newspapers <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> peers such as Julian Ashton, Antonio Dattilo Rubbo and Grace Cossington Smith.|$|E
500|$|Percy {{has been}} {{variously}} {{described as a}} belligerent and eccentric man, with [...] "surges of wild energy subsiding into sloth". [...] The Jesuit priest Father John Gerard wrote that in his youth Percy had [...] "been very wild more than ordinary, and much given to fighting", while the Jesuit Oswald Tesimond thought he had been [...] "rather wild and given to the gay life, a man who relied much on his sword and personal courage." [...] According to both men, Percy's conversion to Catholicism was a calming influence, but biographer Mark Nicholls, who calls Percy [...] "a pugnacious character", says that this was only true to a point. [...] His excesses did not prevent him from joining Northumberland during his command in the Low Countries, held from 1600–1601, {{for which he was}} rewarded with £200. [...] The earl also appointed Percy his receiver of rents in Cumberland and Northumberland, in 1603. [...] Henry Percy was considered a supporter of the Catholic cause, and on several occasions before 1603, suspecting that Queen Elizabeth I did not have long to live, he entrusted Thomas with the delivery of secret correspondence to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> probable successor, King James VI of Scotland. [...] Northumberland's uncle had been executed for his involvement in the Rising of the North, a plot to replace Elizabeth with James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots. [...] He planned to make up for his family's disgrace by building a strong relationship with James, but also wished to counter the influence of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, whose father (it was rumoured) James believed had been responsible for Mary's death.|$|E
