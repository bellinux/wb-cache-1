25|$|The figure {{behind the}} daughter, Clotilde Sorolla, also wears a white dress, her hips accented {{by a white}} belt. Thus both the breasts and the {{buttocks}} have clearer contours than the daughter's. Clothilde's dress has cropped sleeves, and she carries a jacket, also made of white fabric, on her left forearm {{in front of her}} abdomen. In her left hand she holds an open white parasol, which is angled to the ground on the left side. Under Clotilde's dress are two elegant white women's shoes with small heels. On her head Clotilde wears a straw hat, which is also decorated with purple colored flowers. In addition, a greenish-transparent veil is draped over the entire hat, and falls forward over her face and is blown backward almost horizontally in the wind. Clotilde has bent her right arm upward <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> lies on the veil. This creates the impression that she must adjust it due to the wind veil or even hold it in place. Of the head of Clotilde little can be seen. Large parts of face, depicted in profile, are in shadow and only the chin is in brighter sunlight. Also, the wide sweeping hat obscures the hair almost completely. Just behind a pearl earring is a bit of dark hair. While the young face of the daughter Maria is looks directly into the sun, the face of the mother is hidden by the shadow of the hat. The clothes and accessories show the two women to be members of the upper class spending their free time in the summer with mild temperatures and light winds.|$|E
500|$|In March 1809 {{a miracle}} was {{reported}} as occurring at the convent. It is recorded {{that one of}} the nuns, Sister Mary Ann Wood, sustained a deep cut across her arm while opening a sash window. She was attended by a local surgeon, who judged that the muscles, and most of the tendons had been severed. The wound healed over after three weeks, but she continued to suffer sharp pain for four months. During all this time, she was not able to use her hand or arm, and despite attempting a variety of different methods to repair the broken tendons, the doctor eventually declared that she may regain use of her forefinger and thumb, but not the rest of her fingers. By this time, her arm and hand had withered, and Sister Mary Ann decided to make a novena (nine prayers) to Saint Winifred. She began her prayers on 6 August, and placed a piece of moss on her arm; she said that she felt intense pain, and considered removing the moss, but opted not to. The following morning, she awoke, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and arm were returned to full strength. The surgeon who had been tending to her was said to have [...] "at first declared the case a miracle; but human respect prevented him from publicly attesting it." [...] The Right Reverend Peter Collingridge, Vicar Apostolic of the Western District, after consulting a Catholic surgeon in London, declared [...] "that the cure was supernatural and an evident miracle." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{also made}} some {{statements}} pointing to Westerfield's possible innocence. The strongest evidence against Westerfield {{was found in}} his RV, particularly a drop of van Dam's blood <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> print. That evidence could be innocently explained if, at some previous time while it was parked unlocked in the streets outside her home, van Dam had entered that vehicle, perhaps to explore it out of curiosity. There was no testimony she had done so, but Grace said she [...] "can imagine a little girl wandering into a RV and playing in it, much as if they saw a swimming pool, they might jump in, or a playground, they might play on it".|$|E
6000|$|... “Do {{you like}} London?” Lady Pimlico had asked of Bessie, {{after looking at}} her a good deal—at <b>her</b> face <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>her</b> dress <b>and</b> <b>her</b> hair.|$|R
60|$|Honora was {{trembling}} {{from head to}} foot, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> were cold.|$|R
60|$|He stopped, as {{her face}} paled again, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> dropped heavily at her side.|$|R
2500|$|French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville {{published}} {{notes on}} Baartman's dissection in 1816, which were republished by Cuvier in the Memoires du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in 1817. [...] "Her personality," [...] Cuvier wrote {{of her in}} his monograph, [...] "was lively, her memory good and, after a gap of some weeks, she recognised someone she had seen only the once. She spoke reasonable Dutch, which she had learned in The Cape, knew some English, and was beginning {{to say a few}} words in French. She danced according to the fashion of her own country, and played on the instrument they call the 'jew's harp' quite by ear ... her shoulders, back, and upper chest were graceful ... Her arms (rather slender) were very well-made, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> charming. Her foot was also very pretty..." [...] Despite his impressions of her, Cuvier interpreted her remains, in accordance with his theories on racial evolution, as evidencing ape-like traits. He thought her small ears were similar to those of an orangutan and also compared her vivacity, when alive, to the quickness of a monkey.|$|E
60|$|Her glance got wistful. She {{moved her}} plate <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> trembled.|$|E
60|$|She {{drew closer}} to Billy, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> passed around his arm, sought his hand.|$|E
60|$|A {{spasm of}} emotion {{passed over the}} woman's face <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> clenched white with passion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pray, {{what were}} you playing at with her {{yesterday}} morning, when I came in unexpectedly, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> cheeks were flushed, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> trembling? ...|$|R
60|$|Phoebe trembled, {{and said}} nothing. She sat with <b>her</b> head down, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> fast clasped together, {{resting on her}} lap.|$|R
60|$|She heard, a {{light of}} {{intelligence}} shone in her eyes, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> fell again.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite turned {{sick with}} horror, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> convulsively {{clutched}} the ring in her dress.|$|E
60|$|His wife's lips {{tightened}} <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{closed on}} the door; Mr. Hatchard put his foot in.|$|E
60|$|Reaching it she turned, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> still {{pressing}} the coarse blue gown against her heart, {{she leaned against}} the door.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted her}} face to the lonely sky, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> pressed to <b>her</b> breast where the deep ache throbbed heavily.|$|R
60|$|She turned quite pale, even in {{that light}} he could see <b>her</b> pallor, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> fell heavily on the keys.|$|R
60|$|She {{had drawn}} away from him, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{was on the}} door. He seized her arm.|$|E
60|$|She hesitated; her colour {{came and}} went, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> stole {{back again to}} the little album.|$|E
60|$|Yet Phyllis was {{discovered}} even here by an admirer, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> most unexpectedly asked in marriage.|$|E
60|$|His words {{shook her}} out of her calm. <b>Her</b> bosom rose <b>and</b> fell, <b>her</b> eyes seemed to grow haggard <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> were clasped convulsively.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good God! say at {{once that}} you are going to marry her," [...] she burst out, passionately, <b>her</b> knees shaking <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> tightly clasped.|$|R
60|$|Some discovery! thought Marian, transfixed {{with wonder}} and hope; Caroline sat still {{but for her}} trembling, her face bent down, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> nervously clasped together.|$|R
60|$|Miss Sally turned very pale. She {{passed her}} cobwebby {{handkerchief}} across her lips <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> trembled. Willard went on.|$|E
6000|$|Cissy flushed, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> involuntarily {{went to one}} of her long, {{distinguishing}} curls. It {{might be}} THAT. The preacher continued:-- ...|$|E
60|$|His {{eyes seemed}} to seek out Monsieur de Lamborne among the moving throngs. She laughed softly, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> brushed his.|$|E
60|$|Evelyn jumped up, {{with the}} color rushing to <b>her</b> face <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> clenched. The {{prudence}} {{she tried to}} exercise had given place to imperious anger.|$|R
6000|$|Mirah {{had sunk}} {{on the music}} stool again, with <b>her</b> eyelids down <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> tightly clasped; <b>and</b> Mrs. Meyrick, giving up the paper to Mab, said-- ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{finished}} buttoning <b>her</b> gloves, <b>and</b> {{looked up at}} me with a queer little smile at the corner of <b>her</b> lips <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> behind <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|June {{stood before}} him, her {{resolute}} small face raised from her little height to his great height, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> outheld.|$|E
6000|$|... "For your intimation that I am a {{handsome}} young man now," [...] said Moses, sitting with his arm around Mara, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in his.|$|E
60|$|Then it {{was that}} the blood surged into the woman's cold face, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> went out to the girl in the old, old way.|$|E
2500|$|... "Israel {{stands with}} <b>her</b> arms outstretched, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> held open to peace with all nations, with all Arab states, with all Arab people." [...] the {{president}} declared.|$|R
60|$|Cartwright {{nodded and}} Mortimer {{glanced at him}} sharply, but next moment looked imperturbable. Mrs. Cartwright's relief, however, was obvious. Her face had become {{animated}} <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> trembled.|$|R
6000|$|She stopped. Then {{suddenly}} the fountains {{in the deep}} of her blue eyes were broken up; she burst into a sob, <b>and</b> buried <b>her</b> head in <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> on his shoulder. [...] "Because--because"--she sobbed against him--"I WANTED YOU to come back!" ...|$|R
