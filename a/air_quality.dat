5|$|At {{the time}} of the 1966 smog, <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> {{measurements}} were recorded from only a single station, the Harlem Courthouse building on East 121st Street, run by Braverman and his staff of 15. Taking measurements from a single station meant that the index reflected conditions in that small area, but served as a poor, unrepresentative gauge of overall <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> across the entire city. The Interstate Sanitation Commission, a regional agency run by New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut and headquartered at Columbus Circle, also relied on the Harlem Courthouse laboratory. Formed in 1936, the advisory agency was authorized in 1962 by New York and New Jersey to oversee air pollution issues.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 Clean Air Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress who believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added public pressure spurred by the smog event, Congress passed and Johnson signed the 1967 <b>Air</b> <b>Quality</b> Act, which amended the 1963 Clean Air Act to provide for study of <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> and control methods.|$|E

The girls, however, referred to it as Clapham J. In 1853, when the site was purchased, it was because of its wide open aspect and country <b>air,</b> <b>qualities</b> that would later be lost.

5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the Twin Towers. Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E

A report shown on July 13, 2010 indicates that the <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> was rated at 95.07% in 2009, an increase of 12.01% since 2004; this improvement eventually cost authorities ￥24 billion.

40|$|This review briefly {{introduces}} {{current status}} of indoor and ambient air pollution originating from household coal and biomass combustion in mainland China. Owing to low combustion efficiency, emissions of CO, PM 2. 5, black carbon (BC), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have significant adverse consequences for indoor and ambient <b>air</b> <b>qualities,</b> resulting in relative contributions of more than one-third in all anthropogenic emissions. Their contributions are higher in less economically developed regions, such as Guizhou (61 % PM 2. 5, 80 % BC), than that in more developed regions, such as Shanghai (4 % PM 2. 5, 17 % BC).
