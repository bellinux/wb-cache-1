40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} <b>an</b> <b>angiographic</b> <b>score</b> was {{introduced}} in clinical practice to stratified different levels of risk after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with drug eluting stents. The SYNTAX score (SS) classified patients in three different risk levels and was included in revascularization guidelines that patients allocated with low SS could be equally treated with either PCI or CABG, whereas those with intermediate or high SS were better off with CABG. However, using original SS each coronary lesion with a diameter stenosis ≥ 50 % in vessels ≥ 1. 5 mm was scored. In ERACI IV registry we used a revascularization strategy during PCI where operators were advised to only treat lesions≥than 70 % in a≥ 2. 0 mm reference vessel; therefore, no intermediate lesions should be treated, and severe stenosis in vessels< 2. 0 mm was discouraged as well. If we recalculated SS using the above-mentioned operators' advices all intermediate lesions were not scored, and severe stenosis in vessels< 2. 0 mm were excluded for the analysis, including bifurcations, trifurcations and chronic total occlusions; after this new scoring, the original SS dropped significantly which is {{in accordance with the}} goal of complete functional revascularization strategy of the ERACI IV study and the low one year adverse events of such study. In conclusion, if we performed an SS scoring, only severe stenosis in vessels with a reference diameter ≥ 2. 0 mm would allow a more rational assessment of coronary anatomy, and the use of a more conservative PCI strategy...|$|R
40|$|Objective—Autologous {{bone marrow}} {{mononuclear}} cell (BM-MNC) implantation into ischemic tissues promotes angio-genesis, {{but a large}} amount of marrow aspiration is required, which is a major clinical limitation. Angiopoietin- 1 (Ang- 1) is requisite for vascular maturation during angiogenesis. We examined the impacts of combinatorial Ang- 1 gene transfer and low-dose autologous BM-MNC implantation on therapeutic angiogenesis in a rabbit model of hind limb ischemia. Methods and Results—Rabbits were divided into 4 groups: phosphate-buffered saline (control), 500 g Ang- 1 plasmid (Ang- 1), 1106 autologous BM-MNCs (BMC), and Ang- 1 plasmid plus BM-MNCs (combination). The Ang- 1 group had <b>a</b> greater <b>angiographic</b> <b>score</b> and capillary density compared with the control (P 0. 05), but the Ang- 1 gene therapy alone did not improve transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcO 2) and skin ulcer score. However, the combination group showed a significant improvement in not only <b>angiographic</b> <b>score</b> and capillary density (P 0. 05) but also TcO 2 (P 0. 05) and skin ulcer score. These efficacies were greater in the combination group compared with the BMC group. Conclusions—This Ang- 1 gene and BM-MNC combination therapy enhances not only quantitative but also qualitative angiogenesis in ischemic tissues. Moreover, the combination therapy will enable a reduction in the amount of BM aspiration required for significant therapeutic angiogenesis. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2006; 26 : 1465 - 1472.)

30|$|Because of {{the lack}} of better {{objective}} indicators for evaluating the coronary complexities, previous studies about the correlations between risk factors such as the hypertension and the severity and complexity of coronary arterial lesions (CAL) were few. The SYNTAX score (SS) is <b>a</b> lesion-based <b>angiographic</b> <b>scoring</b> system that was developed to quantify the number, complexity, and location of lesions in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Higher SS are related to more-complex diseases. Therefore, patients undergoing PCI with high SSs are likely to have worse prognosis. The SS is based on anatomical features of CAL and can be used to quantitatively evaluate the complexity of CAL according to anatomical features such as lesion location, severity, bifurcation, and calcification. Although its clinical applications have some limitations such as its inability to determine the characteristics of plaques and coronary flow reserve, a large number of studies have confirmed that the SS has strong clinical practicality when used as a risk assessment tool for coronary revascularization (Farooq et al. 2014; Head et al. 2014; Mohr et al. 2013).|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate <b>a</b> novel <b>angiographic</b> <b>scoring</b> system for peripheral artery disease. Methods: An <b>angiographic</b> <b>scoring</b> system (the ANGIO score) was developed and applied to a sample of patients from a single vascular surgical department who underwent CT angiography of the lower limbs. The reproducibility of the ANGIO score was compared with those of the Bollinger and Trans-Atlantic inter-Society Consensus (TASC) IIb systems in a series of randomly selected patients. Associations between the ANGIO score and lower-limb ischaemia, as measured by the ankle : brachial pressure index (ABPI), and outcome events (major lower-limb amputations and cardiovascular events – myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death) were assessed. Results: Some 256 patients undergoing CT angiography were included. The interobserver reproducibility of the ANGIO score was better than that of the other scoring systems examined (κ = 0 · 90, P = 0 · 002). There was a negative correlation between the ANGIO score and ABPI (ρ = − 0 · 33, P = 0 · 008). A higher ANGIO score was associated with an increased risk of major lower-limb amputation (hazard ratio (HR) for highest versus lowest tertile 9 · 30, 95 per cent c. i. 1 · 95 to 44 · 38; P = 0 · 005) and cardiovascular events (HR 2 · 73, 1 · 31 to 5 · 70; P = 0 · 007) following adjustment for established risk factors.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{association}} of all-cause death with the coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) -defined extent and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). BackgroundThe prognostic value of identifying CAD by CCTA remains undefined. MethodsWe examined a single-center consecutive cohort of 1, 127 patients ≥ 45 years old with chest symptoms. Stenosis by CCTA was scored as minimal (< 30 %), mild (30 % to 49 %), moderate (50 % to 69 %), or severe (≥ 70 %) for each coronary artery. Plaque was assessed in 3 ways: 1) moderate or obstructive plaque; 2) CCTA score modified from Duke coronary artery score; and 3) simple clinical scores grading plaque extent and distribution. A 15. 3 ± 3. 9 -month follow-up of all-cause death was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for pretest CAD likelihood and risk factors. Deaths were verified by the Social Security Death Index. ResultsThe CCTA predictors of death included proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis and number of vessels with ≥ 50 % and ≥ 70 % stenosis (all p < 0. 0001). A modified Duke CAD index, <b>an</b> <b>angiographic</b> <b>score</b> integrating proximal CAD, plaque extent, and left main (LM) disease, improved risk stratification (p < 0. 0001). Patients with < 50 % stenosis had the highest survival at 99. 7 %. Survival worsened with higher-risk Duke scores, ranging from 96 % survival for 1 stenosis ≥ 70 % or 2 stenoses ≥ 50 % (p = 0. 013) to 85 % survival for ≥ 50 % LM artery stenosis (p < 0. 0001). Clinical scores measuring plaque burden and distribution predicted 5 % to 6 % higher absolute death rate (6. 6 % vs. 1. 6 % and 8. 4 % vs. 2. 5 %; p = 0. 05 for both). ConclusionsIn patients with chest pain, CCTA identifies increased risk for all-cause death. Importantly, a negative CCTA portends an extremely low risk for death...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} evaluate whether the carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) measured by using an automated software (AtheroEdgeLink) could predict the SYNTAX score for coronary artery disease patients. Methods: We tested 370 consecutive patients (males 218, females 152; median age 69 years ± 11) who underwent carotid ultrasound and coronary angiography. The SXscore of the 370 patients was independently assessed by two experienced cardiologists, who calculated the SXscore by considering each coronary lesion producing ≥ 50 % diameter stenosis in vessels ≥ 1. 5 mm according to the algorithm available on the SYNTAX website. The CIMT values was measured by the automated system AtheroEdgeLink, which is based on a multi-resolution approach. Results: In our population we had 150 subjects (prevalence of 40. 5 %) with evidence of coronary artery disease and the SXscore was 8. 1 ± 14. 4, whereas the mean CIMT (obtained by averaging the left and right side) was 0. 86 mm ± 0. 23 mm. The Pearson correlation analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between the CIMT and SXscore (r value = 0. 323; p value = 0. 0001). Using the ROC analysis for presence/absence of coronary artery diseases versus CIMT, we observed that the presence of CIMT of 1 mm is associated with the presence Coronary Artery Disease with a specificity of 90. 52 %. Conclusions: Results: of our study using the fully automated AtheroEdgeLink algorithm showed a statistical significant association between CIMT and SXscore. This association was demonstrated by applying an automated strategy to an image database of patients with different risk factors. From a clinical point of view, results indicate that automatically measured CIMT may be considered a reliable parameter to predict the SXscore...|$|R

Control rats were fed a normal diet (n = 18); HC rats (n = 18) were fed 2 % cholesterol diet; and HC + folate (HC+F) rats were fed an HC diet with oral folate (0. 003 % in water). The left femoral artery and vein were surgically excised, and angiogenesis in the ischemic limb was evaluated. We also {{examined the effects of}} NΩ-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, on angiogenesis in the HC+F state.

Suitable biology marker to predict the severity of CAD and to have a treatment decision for revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or bypass surgery, is still unknown. Which biology marker can be a predictor for higher Syntax score remains unknown as well. METHODS: Severity of 105 patients who underwent coronary angiography, were evaluated with Syntax score. Laboratory tests were conducted for routine blood test, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney function, creatinine and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c). RESULTS: Ureum had significant correlation with Syntax score, p= 0. 016 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 05 - 0. 55. Result of logistic regression analysis showed that HDL and haematocrit had significant correlation with Syntax score, with cut off point 34 (p= 0. 02, p= 0. 0033, respectively). Based on multi-variate analysis, Syntax score 34 = 16 (HDL ≤ 40 + Ureum ≥ 23) + 10 (Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ≥ 3. 789) + 10 (HbA 1 c ≥ 7) + 13 (monocyte ≥ 9 %).

40|$|Background: SYNTAX <b>score</b> is <b>an</b> {{established}} <b>angiographic</b> <b>scoring</b> {{system for}} risk stratification {{of a patient}} undergoing coronary revascularization. There was always a theory between cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists that a good outcome after {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) operation needs at least one out of two limbs, either good contractility or good targets. If both are jeopardized the outcome will be suboptimal with considerable risky operation. We performed that study to confirm if vessels with poor distal run-off and high complexity of lesions might affect the outcome in those critical cohorts of patients with poor left ventricular function. Methods: This was a prospective observational non-randomized study. The study included 100 patients with jeopardized left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) 32). 30 days post-operative follow- up was done. The primary end point was the composite criteria of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Results: The mean SYNTAX score of the studied cases was 32. 03  ±  9. 62. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar among the three groups. The high SYNTAX score group showed more increase in total cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) time and cross-clamp time, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, inotropic support and postoperative blood transfusion than the other two groups. High SYNTAX score showed high positive correlation with the number of grafts. No statistically significant difference was found for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) among the three groups (p-value 0. 12). Conclusions: The complexity of coronary lesions and presence of poor targets were not associated with increased adverse outcomes in patients with low EF undergoing CABG.

The syntax score (SS) is <b>a</b> comprehensive <b>angiographic</b> <b>scoring</b> system that is derived entirely from the coronary anatomy and lesion characteristics. We investigated the relationship between severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) assessed with SYNTAX Score (SS) and GRACE Score (GS) in patients with AMI. Patients and MethodsFrom the obseRvatoire des Infarctus de Côte d’Or (RICO) survey, 614 consecutive patients hospitalized for an AMI from 1 st march 2011 to 30 august 2012 and who underwent coronary angiography were included. Patients were analyzed into 3 tertiles of risk based on GS. ResultsThe tertiles of risk were defined as low (n= 205) (GS 165). Age and co-morbidities increase gradually with increased GS risk. Also, the number of diseased vessels on coronary angiography increased across the tertiles (p< 0. 001). In-hospital mortality increased from the low to the highest tertile (0. 5 %, 2. 0 % and 11. 8 %, p< 0. 001). Patients at high risk had significantly higher SS values compared with the intermediate and low GS risk (median (IQR) SS: 13 (6 – 20) vs 9 (4 – 15) vs 7 (3 – 12), respectively, p< 0. 001). Moreover, SS was strongly correlated with GS (r=+ 0. 254, p< 0. 001), and remained significant in patients with multivessel disease. By logistic regression analysis, both GS and SS score are significant correlate of hospital mortality (OR(95 %CI) 1. 04 (1. 02 – 1. 05), p< 0. 001 and OR(95 %CI) 1. 11 (1. 07 – 1. 15)).

40|$|Objective—To {{devise a}} {{clinical}} prioritisation system for rationing {{access to a}} cardiac catheter waiting list and to describe its performance at predicting angiographic findings and selecting patients for angioplasty or {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery.  Setting—Tertiary level cardiology centre.  Methods—(1) 665  consecutive patients on an elective waiting list for coronary angiography were scored using a system derived from established clinical criteria for selecting patients for coronary surgery (New Zealand/Duke). The scores were compared with clinical outcome (referral for surgery, angioplasty, or medical management). (2) In a subset of 125  patients, scores derived from clinical criteria and exercise testing were compared with findings on coronary angiography. (3) Multivariate analysis was used in a new group of 178  patients to identify factors that would be better predictors of the <b>angiographic</b> <b>score.</b> (4) <b>A</b> new scoring system was devised based partly on the results of the multivariate analysis. It was applied to a new test group of 100  patients using clinical outcome and <b>angiographic</b> <b>score</b> as outcome measures.  Results—(1) Using the established clinical score, similar proportions of patients were referred after angiography for medical management, angioplasty, or coronary bypass grafting, irrespective of their original score. The exceptions were patients with a score <  20, who were more likely to continue medical management. (2) There was poor correlation (r =  0. 05) between the clinical score and the subsequent <b>angiographic</b> <b>score.</b> (3) Multivariate analysis identified age, male sex, previous myocardial infarction, high cholesterol, and diabetes as independent predictors of coronary score. (4) The modified scoring system, incorporating the predictors identified by multivariate analysis, performed better than the original scoring system in predicting coronary score when both were tested, but some patients had severe disease despite a low score.  Conclusions—Patients can be ranked using clinical and non-invasive criteria, and a rationing system implemented on this basis. With prioritisation by non-invasive criteria, the risk of missing serious coronary disease in patients with relatively mild symptoms must be accepted; this risk becomes greater the more stringently rationing is applied.    Keywords: prioritisation;  coronary angiograph...|$|R

We {{hypothesized that}} endogenous bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) dysfunction {{may contribute to}} the abrogated postischemic revascularization reaction associated with diabetes. We first analyzed the effect of diabetes (streptozotocin, 40 mg/kg) on BM-MNC pro-angiogenic potential in a model of surgically induced hindlimb ischemia. In nondiabetic animals, transplantation of BM-MNCs isolated from nondiabetic animals raised the ischemic/nonischemic <b>angiographic</b> <b>score,</b> capillary number, and blood flow recovery by 1. 8 -, 2. 7 -, and 2. 2 -fold, respectively, over that of PBS-injected nondiabetic animals (P < 0. 05). Administration of diabetic BM-MNCs also improved the neovascularization reaction in ischemic hindlimbs of nondiabetic mice but to a lesser extent from that observed with nondiabetic BM-MNC transplantation. In diabetic mice, injection of nondiabetic BM-MNCs was still more efficient than that of diabetic BM-MNCs. Such BM-MNC dysfunction was associated with the impairment of diabetic BM-MNC capacity to differentiate into endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in vitro and to participate in vascular-like structure formation in a subcutaneous Matrigel plug. Placenta growth factor (PlGF) administration improved by sixfold the number of EPCs differentiated from diabetic BM-MNCs in vitro and enhanced ischemic/nonischemic <b>angiographic</b> <b>score,</b> capillary number and blood flow recovery by 1. 9 -, 1. 5 - and 1. 6 -fold, respectively, over that of untreated diabetic animals (P < 0. 01). Endogenous BM-MNC pro-angiogenic potential was affected in diabetes. Therapeutic strategy based on PlGF administration restored such defects and improved postischemic neovascularization in diabetic mice...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{number of}} {{patients}} admitted to ICU who have liver cirrhosis is rising. Current prognostic <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> to predict ICU mortality have performed poorly in this group. In previous research from a single centre, a novel <b>scoring</b> <b>tool</b> which modifies the Child-Turcotte Pugh score by adding Lactate concentration, the CTP[*]+[*]L score, is strongly associated with mortality. This study aims to validate {{the use of the}} CTP[*]+[*]L <b>scoring</b> <b>tool</b> for predicting ICU mortality in patients admitted to a general ICU with cirrhosis, and to determine significant predictive factors for mortality with this group of patients. This study will also explore the use of the Royal Free Hospital (RFH) score in this cohort. Methods: A total of 84 patients admitted to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary ICU between June 2012 and Dec 2013 with cirrhosis were included. An additional cohort of 115 patients was obtained from two ICUs in London (St George’s and St Thomas’) collected between October 2007 and July 2009. Liver specific and general ICU <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> were calculated for both cohorts, and compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Independent predictors of ICU mortality were identified by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was utilised to determine the most predictive factors affecting mortality within these patient groups. Results: Within the Glasgow cohort, independent predictors of ICU mortality were identified as Lactate (p[*]< 0. 001), Bilirubin (p[*]=[*] 0. 0048), PaO 2 /FiO 2 Ratio (p[*]=[*] 0. 032) and PT ratio (p[*]=[*] 0. 012). Within the London cohort, independent predictors of ICU mortality were Lactate (p < 0. 001), PT ratio (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), Bilirubin (p[*]=[*] 0. 027), PaO 2 /FiO 2 Ratio (p[*]=[*] 0. 0011) and Ascites (p[*]=[*] 0. 023). The CTP[*]+[*]L and RFH <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> had the highest ROC value in both cohorts examined. Conclusion: The CTP[*]+[*]L and RFH <b>scoring</b> <b>tool</b> are validated prognostic <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> for predicting ICU mortality in patients admitted to a general ICU with cirrhosis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Coiling of {{intracranial}} aneurysms is both {{safe and}} effective but may be followed by recurrences. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the feasibility of endovascular treatment of aneurysms with high-concentration ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (HCEVOH), without the use of protection devices at the neck. METHODS: Wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms with a high propensity for recurrences were constructed in 22 dogs. HCEVOH embolization was performed with a dedicated high-pressure microcatheter in 12 animals. Angiographic results at 3 and 12 weeks and pathologic results at 12 weeks were compared with those of a separate group of 10 animals treated with platinum coils. We used a qualitative scoring system to grade angiographic results, neointima formation, and recanalization at the neck. RESULTS: Intraaneurysmal HCEVOH injections could be performed without carotid emboli and without a protection device in 11 of 12 animals. Fragments detached upon traction of the microcatheters at the end of the procedure on two occasions. Immediate and late angiographic results were not significantly different between the two groups (P. 807), with <b>a</b> tendency for <b>angiographic</b> recurrences at 3 months (<b>angiographic</b> <b>scores</b> were significantly worse in bot...|$|R

Methods: This was a 12 -month, single-centered prospective cohort study performed in a general, nontransplant ICU. Forty clinical and demographic variables were collected on admission to calculate 8 prospective <b>scoring</b> <b>tools.</b> Patients were followed up to obtain ICU and inhospital mortality. Receiver operating characteristic curve {{analysis was used to}} determine the discriminative ability of the scores. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify any independent predictors of mortality in these patients. The incorporation of any significant variables into the <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> was assessed.
