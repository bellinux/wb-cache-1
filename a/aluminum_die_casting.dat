40|$|The {{process of}} casting {{design in the}} {{automotive}} industry has been significantly refined over the years through the capabilities of advanced computer aided design and engineering tools. One of the significant benefits of these computer aided capabilities is the direct access to CAD geometry data, from which finite element models can be quickly developed.

The application of advanced finite element analyses such as structural modification and optimization are often used to reduce component complexity, weight and subsequently cost. Because the level of model complexity can be high, the opportunity for error can also be high. For this reason, some form of model verification is needed before design decisions made in the FEA environment can implemented in production with high confidence. Dynamic correlation, comparison of mode shapes and natural frequencies, is a robust tool for evaluating the accuracy of a finite element model.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of cost efficiency and lightweight design {{can be considered}} as major drivers for the introduction of new materials and material combinations in the aircraft industry. Consequently new joining technologies and welding approaches are needed. Friction stir welding is one of these new joining technologies and can help to overcome typical welding problems, which are present when fusion welding or similar melting based welding technologies are enabled for hard to weld alloys or mixed material joints. This technology offers a great potential, when new aluminum alloys or even dissimilar alloys have to be joined together. Fraunhofer IWS has been working on friction stir welding for several years. The introduction and enhancement of a cost-efficient parallel kinematics concept, a so-called Pentapod, is the basis for several studies on the field of friction stir welding. With a great space to working space ratio and its five-axis processing capabilities, this versatile machine concept is appropriate for welding parts with a great variation in size and shapes as well as for joining 3 -dimensionally curved weld lines. The machine was advanced with newly developed control algorithms to operate the friction stir welding process force-, torque- and position-controlled. Furthermore all milling operations for pre- and post-weld treatments can also be performed within this machine. A detailed overview about the capability and potential of the machine concept, especially in terms of potential aerospace application will be given.

40|$|<b>Aluminum</b> {{high-pressure}} <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> (HPDC) {{technology is}} particularly suitable for making complex part shapes in {{the automotive industry}} {{in order to reduce}} the cost and weight of various components. The automotive industry uses for anodized aluminum are endless. On the other side, diecastings pose some of the most challenging problems in anodizing. The main problem with HPDC components is related to inherent flaws like porosity, segregations and oxide films that are difficult to avoid, which cause a non-uniform thickness and an unfavourable appearance of the anodic oxide film. This work is aimed to understand some defects that may occur in the anodic oxide film due to different alloying elements and different surface finishing of various diecast Al alloys. Anodized HPDC components made of hypoeutectic and eutectic Al-Si-Cu alloys, AlSi 9 Cu 3 (Fe) (EN AC- 46000), AlSi 11 Cu 2 (Fe) (EN AC- 46100) and AlSi 12 Cu 1 (Fe) (EN AC- 47100) were considered. These components were studied at locations where different surface finishing and aesthetic defects were detected after visual testing. Microstructural investigations were carried out using an optical microscope and a field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS) detector. A casting substrate with a reduced eutectic Si segregation due to surface finishing operations showed greater anodizability and a thicker anodic oxide layer. On the contrary, asdiecast substrates show a poor anodizability and, sometimes, filling-related defects which induce a nonuniform oxide layer.

40|$|A new camera based {{machine vision}} {{system for the}} {{automatic}} inspection of surface defects in <b>aluminum</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> {{was developed by the}} authors. The problem of surface defects in <b>aluminum</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> is widespread throughout the foundry industry and their detection is of paramount importance in maintaining product quality. The casting surfaces are the most highly loaded regions of materials and components. Mechanical and thermal loads as well as corrosion or irradiation attacks are directed primarily at the surface of the castings. Depending on part design and processing techniques, castings may develop surface discontinuities such as cracks or tears, inclusions due to chemical reactions or foreign material in the molten metal, and pores that greatly influence the material ability to withstand these loads. Surface defects may act as a stress concentrator initiating a fracture point. If a pressure is applied in this area, the casting can fracture. The human visual system is well adapted to perform in areas of variety and change; the visual inspection processes, on the other hand, require observing the same type of image repeatedly to detect anomalies. Slow, expensive, erratic inspection usually is the result. Computer based visual inspection provides a viable alternative to human inspectors. Developed by authors machine vision system uses an image processing algorithm based on modified Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection method to detect defects with different sizes and shapes. The defect inspection algorithm consists of three parameters. One is a parameter of defects sensitivity, the second parameter is a threshold level and the third parameter is to identify the detected defects size and shape. The machine vision system has been successfully tested for the different types of defects on the surface of castings...|$|E

The design of the immersion test apparatus stylistically simulated <b>aluminum</b> alloy <b>dies</b> <b>casting</b> conditions. The testing phase was performed at 1850, 3000, and 5000 cycles. The samples were subjected to visual inspection after each phase of testing, before being examined for metallographic studies, surface crack measurement, and hardness characteristics. Furthermore, the samples were segmented and examined under optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The areas around the crack zones were additionally examined under Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS). The crack’s maximum length and Vickers hardness profiles were obtained; and from the metallographic study, {{an increase in the number}} of cycles during the testing phase resulted in an increase in the surface crack formation; suggesting an increase in the thermal stress at higher cycle numbers. The crack length of Region I (spherically shaped) was about 47 to 127 µm, with a high oxygen content that was analyzed within 140 µm from the surface of the sample. At 700 °C, there is a formation of aluminum oxides, which was in contact with the surface of the H 13 sample. These stresses propagate the thermal wear crack length into the tool material of spherically shaped Region I and cylindrically shape Region II, while hardness parameters presented a different observation. The crack length of Region I was about 32 % higher than the crack length of Region II...|$|R
