Human whole saliva and mucin-containing saliva substitutes appeared to be similar in their rheological properties. Both types of solution are viscoelastic solutions and adjust their <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> to their biological functions. Preparations containing CMC or PEO are non-Newtonian liquids. From this study it is concluded that mucin-containing saliva substitutes appear to be the best substitutes for natural saliva, as far as rheological properties are concerned...|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 {{shows the}} <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> {{of the four}} CWSs {{increasing}} {{with the increase of}} D. The <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> of BRYM, BR 1, BR 2, and BR 3 increase from 1544 to 2361, 420 to 1658, 735 to 1758 and 835 to 1925  MPa s at a low shear rate of 10  s− 1 respectively, while these increase from 730 to 1021, 240 to 815, 386 to 902 and 414 to 1102  MPa s at a high shear rate of 100  s− 1 respectively. The experimental results indicate that D of modified CWSs is smaller than that of raw brown CWS at the same grinding time, so that the <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the modified CWSs decrease. The first reason is that the pore volume and specific surface area both increase with the increase of D, resulting in a reduced free water amount among coal particles and an enhanced water–adsorption capacity of coal particles. More attention should especially be paid to the result which the raw brown coal is at the low rank with the above obvious characteristics. The other reason is that the volume–average particle size decreases with increasing D, which can increase free water among coal particles and volumetric particle amount, and this is beneficial to decreasing the <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the modified CWSs.|$|R

50|$|A single {{viscosity}} measurement at {{a constant}} speed in a typical viscometer is a measurement of the <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosity</b> of a fluid.

30|$|Another {{main reason}} for {{decreasing}} the <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the modified CWS is that the oxygen-containing functional groups decompose and macromolecular structure breaks in modification processing. Decreasing volatile matter causes the oxygen and hydrogen elements decrease sharply, but the carbon exists with a relatively stable aromatic carbon and these compounds are originated from the cleavage of covalent C=C bonds interconnecting bicyclic aromatic rings. As shown in Fig.  6, the basic group becomes more {{than that of the}} raw brown coal which can weaken the adsorption capacity of coal to water, therefore the <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the modified CWSs decrease.|$|R

The rheological properties of coatings containing different amounts of glass fibers were measured by R/S rheometer and the rheological behaviors of coatings were investigated. The {{results show that the}} <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> of coatings containing different amounts of glass fibers decrease with increasing shear rate, i. e., shear thinning behavior, {{similar to that of the}} coating without fibers. At the same shear rate, the <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> of coatings containing fibers are higher than that of the coating without fibers and the <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> of coatings containing 0. 3 % (mass fraction) fibers are higher than that of the others. The high shear viscosities of coatings containing fibers increase initially, but later decrease, with increasing amount of fibers. The high shear viscosity of the coating containing 0. 3 % fibers reaches a maximum value of 102. 6 &# 215; 10 - 3 Pa&# 183;s, increased by about 31. 9 %, in comparison to the coating without fibers. And this coating with a maximum thixotropical loop area value of 11. 8 Pa&# 183;s - 1 exhibits an excellent thixotropical behavior. However, it is not found that there is a noticeable effect of the amount of glass fibers on the yield stress or suspensibility of coatings...|$|R

Other <b>apparent</b> blood <b>viscosity</b> parameters such as, red cell filterability, red cell rigidity, hematocrit, plasma viscosity and biochemical parameters are evaluated and discussed. The cumulative effect of these parameters did not appear in terms of elevated whole blood viscosity in acute cases as compared to healthy controls since hematocrit value was on the lower side of the normal range. The whole blood viscosity in acute cases at any of the seven shear rates selected, was not significantly different from healthy controls.

40|$|Abstract: During polymerization, polymethyl {{methacrylate}} bone cements have complex viscoelastic characteristics. Within a short working time they transform from dough-like consistencies to solid cements. Therefore, {{the time at}} which a cement is introduced to cancellous bone surfaces and subjected to pressure is important, to achieve optimum flow and mechanical interdigitation. Achieving adequate mechanical interlock increases the area for load transfer and reduces localized bone–cement interface stresses. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the flow characteristics for commercial bone cements as a function of time and calculate the <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> for the curing bone cements. The capillary extrusion method was used to measure the rate of flow of the curing cement, by means of a melt flow index apparatus, which was manufactured in-house. The tests were conducted using nozzles of different lengths and under two loads. This enabled the power index value, n, and the pressure at the die entry, P 0, to be calculated for each material with respect to time. Once the flow characteristics were determined, a series of formulae were used to calculate the shear rates, c, the shear stresses, t, and the <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities,</b> ga, of the curing bone cements. The results indicated that acrylic bone cements are non-Newtonian, pseudoplastic materials, since the power index values are less than 1. 0 during the curing stage. The consistency indices, K, were calculated from the shear stress versus shear rate data. The <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the cements were found to increase with respect to increases in time. Clinically, it was considered desirable to inject and pressurize the cement into the medullary canal while its viscosity is relatively low in order to obtain maximum interdigitation into cancellous bone, provided adequate containment and a means of pressurization can be achieved. The pseudoplastic character of bone cements is responsible for their reduction in viscosity with increased shear rate, a property that may be exploited to enhance penetration with appropriate delivery...|$|R

Laboratory measurements of the rheological properties of basalts erupted on Mount Etna in 1983 were made at various crystal concentrations in a specially designed furnace using a Haake Rotovisco viscometer attached to a spindle designed to eliminate slippage at the melt-spindle interface. Measurements were made at strain rates between 0. 3 and 5 s− 1 over the range of eruption temperatures on Mount Etna (1084 – 1125 °C). At temperatures above 1120 °C, the 1983 lava behaves as a Newtonian fluid.

40|$|Non-vesicular basaltic melts {{behave as}} Newtonian fluids at {{temperatures}} above their liquidus and their viscosities {{can be calculated}} using a method developed by Shaw (1972) and Bottinga and Weill (1972). Because many igneous processes involve the flow of silicates at sub-liquidus temperatures, numerous {{attempts have been made}} to calculate the interactive effects of the crystal phase. However, current methods are appropriate only for relatively low crystal concentrations, and they assume Newtonian behaviour; we argue that this assumption is invalid when bubble or crystal concentrations exceed 30 %. At higher concentrations, factors other than concentration become increasingly important; these include particle shape and size distribution. A method which takes these factors into account is tested on a range of suspensions, including magmas at sub-liquidus temperatures, and rheological properties calculated using this method agree closely with the measured values. We also demonstrate that an equation which was introduced to explain large differences in measured <b>apparent</b> <b>viscosities</b> during the cooling and crystallisation of Mount St. Helens dacite (Murase et al., 1985), and which is currently used to calculate the rheological properties of crystallising lavas, generates viscosities which may be in error by several orders of magnitude.
