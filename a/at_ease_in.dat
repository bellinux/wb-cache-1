5|$|A {{member of}} the Romanov dynasty, she was the {{daughter}} of Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich and his wife, Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg. She spent her childhood in Saint Petersburg, Poland and the Crimea, and married King George I of Greece in 1867 at the age of sixteen. At first, she felt ill <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> the Kingdom of Greece, but she quickly became involved in social and charitable work. She founded hospitals and help centers, but her attempt to promote a new, more accessible, Greek translation of the Gospels sparked riots by religious conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Edwards is a far-right {{political}} activist from Memphis, Tennessee, {{described by the}} Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement. They write that he is articulate, charming, and <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> front of the public, {{as well as in}} television and radio studios. He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said led him into political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, who was on the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established The Political Cesspool.|$|E

25|$|Yaşar Nabi, {{a leading}} pro-Kemalist journalist, argued in the 1960s that the {{alphabet}} reform had been vital {{in creating a}} new Western-oriented identity for Turkey. He noted that younger Turks, who had only been taught the Latin script, were <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> understanding Western culture but were quite unable to engage with Middle Eastern culture. The new script was adopted very rapidly and soon gained widespread acceptance. Even so, the Turkish Arabic script nonetheless continued {{to be used by}} older people in private correspondence, notes and diaries until well into the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Helene was a pious, quiet young woman, {{and she and}} Franz Joseph felt ill <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> each other's company, but he was {{instantly}} infatuated with her younger sister. He did not propose to Helene, but defied his mother and informed her {{that if he could}} not have Elisabeth, he would not marry at all. Five days later their betrothal was officially announced. The couple were married eight months later in Vienna at the Augustinerkirche on 24 April 1854. The marriage was finally consummated three days later, and Elisabeth received a dower equal to today's 240,000 USD.|$|E
25|$|Maud's {{two sisters}} and brother {{were in the}} Dakota Territory. Maud, Frank, and her two sons moved to Aberdeen, South Dakota, on September 20, 1888, because Frank {{believed}} there would be better business opportunities in the West. In 1882, when Maud had traveled with Frank while he had been performing in The Maid of Arran, she had not felt <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> the western cities they visited. But scholar Katharine M. Rogers noted that Maud would have liked being close to her siblings and being afforded a chance at economic security. Frank started a dry goods store, Baum's Bazaar, on October 1, 1888, to make a stable living for his family. However, because he granted too much credit to his destitute customers, his store went out of business.|$|E

25|$|With fewer bouncers, flatter wickets and a {{requirement}} to score quickly, {{he was more}} <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> limited-overs cricket than perhaps any other batsman in the history other than Viv Richards with a record that was ahead of its era: His career was over by 1985 by which time, he had racked up over 2500 runs in just 60-odd games with 7 hundreds and a strike rate of 84 (over 5 runs an over) {{in an era when}} 4 runs an over was considered exceptional batting. He was at his peak during the 1982–83 season (already mentioned above) when he hit four one-day international hundreds, regularly reaching the three-figure mark off 70 to 80 balls effortlessly. His versatility lay in adapting his game according to the situation as Australians once found out when he calmly and quietly compiled a swift 84 off 100 odd balls without a boundary.|$|E
25|$|The {{isolated}} {{figures are}} given statuesque but largely unmodeled treatment, and their skin and their clothes are clean, with a waxy finish. They appear unselfconscious, <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> their environment, and—with {{the possible exception}} of the boy to the bottom right—are locked in a pensive and solitary reverie. Horizontal and vertical lines at the middle and far distance contrast with arched backs and the relaxed postures of the figures toward the front. These postures, angles of heads, directions of gaze, and positions of limbs are repeated among the figures, giving the group a rhythmic unity. Distinctively coloured forms in close proximity, such as the grouping of horse-chestnut colours of the clothes on the bank, and the grouping of oranges of the boys in the water, add to the stability of the work—an effect reinforced in the cluster of shadows to the left on the bank, and the un-verisimilar play of light around the bathing figures.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} a city of extreme social {{inequality}} between the so-called 'millocracy' and the workers; Elizabeth Gaskell once described an acquaintance attending a ball wearing £400 of lace and £10,000 in diamonds. The Gaskell family moved between the two worlds, allowing Gaskell not only to collect charitable subscriptions from their wide circle and promote longer-lasting changes from within the local bureaucracy, but also to understand the real concerns of those living in poverty, with whom he was probably more <b>at</b> <b>ease.</b> <b>In</b> 1833 he helped to found the non-denominational Manchester Domestic Home Mission, and he acted as its secretary for many years. Inspired by a visit from Boston minister Joseph Tuckerman, the mission gave practical assistance such as food and blankets to the poor. He {{was also a}}ctive in the District Provident Society, an organisation founded by James Kay and William Langton with similar pragmatic aims. Gaskell supported public health measures and housing reform, sitting on the committee of the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, as well as another committee formed to regulate beer halls in the area.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{depicts a}} younger {{generation}} of Indonesians (...) as being [...] "those who understand Dutch". Maier writes that this understanding {{is not limited to}} the language used, but also actions; this includes holding hands in public and drinking lemonade, activities which traditional Indonesian society does not involve. Student Hidjo also contrasts Dutch and Javanese peoples. Maier finds that, through its alternating events, the novel shows that the Dutch and Javanese are incompatible; Maeir sums it up as [...] "Javanese do not feel <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> Holland, [...] Dutch do not feel <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> Java." [...] According to Maier, the novel views the gap between the two cultures as [...] "unbridgeable".|$|E
500|$|In 1959, she {{appeared}} opposite Salvatori in the mafia film Vento del sud, {{and played the}} wife of Maurizio Arena in Luigi Zampa's Il magistrato. Cardinale also starred opposite Pietro Germi in his crime film Un maledetto imbroglio, an important assignment for her in mastering the craft of acting while learning to feel <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> front of the camera. Cardinale considered it to have been her first real test as an actress. She then {{played the role of}} Maria in Ralph Thomas's British film Upstairs and Downstairs, which starred Michael Craig and Anne Heywood. In her early roles, she was usually dubbed, as producers considered her voice too hoarse.|$|E
500|$|Ranaut {{followed}} {{the success of}} Tanu Weds Manu by starring {{in a series of}} brief, glamorous roles in four other films of 2011: Game, Double Dhamaal, Rascals and Miley Naa Miley Hum. With the exception of Double Dhamaal, none of these films performed well. In a review for Rascals, the critic Gaurav Malani wrote: [...] "Kangana Ranaut is ill <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> comedy. She struggles to hold her own and emerges as a bimbo in her act." [...] Ranaut later said that she did some of these films due to a dearth of film offers. The following year, Ranaut portrayed a supporting role opposite Ajay Devgn in Priyadarshan's action thriller Tezz, another box office flop.|$|E

John Fallon of JoBlo.com remarked that Larter also holds her own as a strong yet vulnerable character by conveying her underlying sadness perfectly, asserting it as a [...] "step up from the whip cream-bimbo she played in Varsity Blues." [...] Dustin Putman of TheMovieBoy.com praised her as effective; whereas Brett Gallman of Oh, The Horror! commended Larter for upstaging Sawa's performance and carrying the film. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle noted Larter and Sawa's relationship as appealing as the film progresses.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} India, Pownoll Phipps joined the force under command of Colonel Arthur Wellesley. He participated in Sir David Baird's {{expedition}} from India to Egypt in 1801, for which participation he {{eventually became a}} Knight of the Crescent. Phipps married Henrietta Beaunpaire; orphaned by the French Revolution, she had taken refuge {{with him and his}} siblings at the Hotel d'Harcout, on 10 August 1802, in Calcutta. Pownoll Phipps' second wife, Sophia Matilda Arnold, was Benedict Arnold's daughter. Phipps retired from the East India Company service on 1 July 1825, with the rank of colonel. Living for a time in London, he was a popular regular at Exeter Hall events. A well-versed, informed and articulate speaker and storyteller, Phipps was a gallant gentleman, readily <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> all society, and very friendly: [...] "a tall, stout, officer-like person, about 60-years of age, with white hair, short, sharp features, and a pleasant cast of countenance." [...] He also had a strict sense of honor. In 1857, a year before his death, he {{wrote a letter to the}} Editor of The Times, in which he asserted his belief in the good character and quality of the Sepoys, despite the popular outrage against them during the Indian Mutiny. Pownoll Phipps developed bronchitis after presiding over the closing of an art exhibit in Clonmel, Ireland; he died in November 1858. His funeral was attended by Protestant and Catholics, and the procession was over a mile long.|$|E
500|$|Asch's {{conformity}} {{experiment was}} conducted using 123 male {{participants who were}} told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each subject was put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive [...] "real" [...] participant). The group was shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked to say which line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a [...] "trial". The [...] "real" [...] participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel <b>at</b> <b>ease</b> <b>in</b> the experiment, as he and the other [...] "participants" [...] gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were the [...] "critical trials". [...] The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond {{the same way as the}} confederates or stick with what his eyes plainly told him.|$|E
