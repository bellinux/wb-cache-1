50|$|Lashing {{has been}} used as a means of {{installing}} communications cables since the process was developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories in the late 1940s. This process typically involves lashing one or more copper telephone cable, co-ax cable TV cable or fibre optic cable to a pre-installed steel messenger wire using a steel lashing wire and a device called a 'spinner' or 'lasher'. It is used to attach these types of cables to road-side utility pole lines and this type of installation is not covered by the term OPAC. OPAC specifically refers to fibre optic cables attached to overhead power lines where the host conductor is part of the overhead electricity system.Lashed communication cables on the ground wire or an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>grounded</b> wire were installed until the mid-1980s at several powerlines of former EVS (now EnBW) in Baden-Württemberg, Germany and are still used on some lines.|$|R

40|$|The mining {{industry}} uses {{a large amount}} of electric power. Their equipment is subject to extreme environmental conditions and mechanical shock. A significant number of electrical accidents are a result of improperly grounded electrical equipment. Federal regulations require the safety ground bed resistance to be measured once a year or after modifications for the Metal/Nonmetal Mining Industry. Coal mine regulations require connection to a low resistance ground medium. A ground resistance measurement can be accepted as evidence of compliance with these regulations. Most commercially available instruments used to measure the ground bed resistance require the ground conductor to be disconnected and the power system disconnected for safety reasons. The “fall of potential ” method requires <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ground</b> rods and approximately two hours to complete the test. Although a new instrument was initially thought to measure the ground bed resistance immediately without isolating the ground bed, field tests have shown this method is not accurate.

Since the ISUAL/FS 2 launch in 2004, ISUAL has continuously monitored TLE occurrences over pre-midnight regions in the past ten plus years. As of December 2015, more than forty thousand TLEs, including the sub-species like elves, sprites, sprite-halos, blue jets and gigantic jets, have been recorded from this space platform.

The analysis aimed to minimize the error sources from temporal discrepancies and from the differences in the field of view of OMI and its ground based reference data. As a result, OMI UV product was seen to overestimate surface UV index by 21 % in average and overcast UV index up to 56 %. The study confirms that OMI UV index is overestimated compared to ground based reference, and shows, that the bias is related to cloudiness and is higher during well defined overcast conditions...|$|E

The new year began with the ship still in port at San Diego. However, she embarked upon her first tow on 2 January 1976 and remained active - shuttling tows between various California ports for the first seven months of 1976. On 7 August, the ship left San Diego to join a Fijian minesweeper at Seattle, Wash., for the voyage to Fiji. The two ships got underway on 16 August and set a course for Pearl Harbor where they arrived on 24 August and remained a week for repairs to the minesweeper's communications equipment.

40|$|The {{heat losses}} from the {{envelope}} {{surface of a}} U. S. Navy K-type airship are evaluated {{to determine if the}} use of heat is a feasible means of preventing ice and snow accumulations on lighter-than-air craft during flight and when moored uncovered. Consideration is given to heat losses in clear air (no liquid water present in the atmosphere) and in probable conditions of icing and snow. The results of the analysis indicate that the amount of heat required in flight to raise the surface temperature of the entire envelope to the extent considered adequate for ice protection, based on experience with tests of heavier-than-air craft, is very large. Existing types of heating equipment which could be used to supply this quantity of heat would probably be too bulky and heavy to provide a practical flight installation. The heat requirements to provide protection for the nose and stern regions in assumed mild to moderate icing conditions appear to be within the range of the capacity of current types of heating equipment suitable for flight use. The amount of heat necessary to prevent snow accumulations on the upper surface of the airship envelope when moored uncovered under all conditions appear to be excessive for the heating equipment presently available for flight use, but could possibly be achieved with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ground</b> heating equipment...|$|E

It has however severe limitations {{when it comes to}} e. g. simulating quantum systems, a task quantum computers might be able to perform. In this project the possibility to create quantum hardware with the inorganic crystal Y 2 SiO 5 doped with triply charged europium of isotope 151, 151 Eu 3 + has been investigated. The ground level of Eu, which is a rare-earth element, is denoted 7 F 0 and consists of three hyperfine levels. These have lifetimes of several days at cryogenic temperatures, and the Eu-ions could therefore be used as semi-permanent quantum memory. The aim was to create a prototype qubit, in analogy to a classical bit, and to obtain as high transition fidelity as possible between the two qubit states | 0 〉 and | 1 〉. Transitions between two of the ground levels and one excited level were used for the two qubit states | 0 〉 and | 1 〉.

In this study, we carried out {{an analysis of the}} abundance and species composition of carabid beetles communities in fields managed according to the rules of organic and conventional farming. We aimed at identifying the relative contributions of the two farming systems to the production of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ground</b> beetles at local and landscape scale.

Analyses of the samples showed that the structure of carabid communities was mainly driven by the type and availability of food resources. Results suggest that organic farming rather act as a sink than as a source in spring because of its attractiveness for carabid beetles. However, the best quality of habitats provided by organic crops in spring and probably also by marginal areas associated with this system throughout the year, probably contributes to make organic farming a source at other periods of the year and at the scale of multiannual dynamics...|$|E

40|$|For {{state-of-the-art}} {{semantic segmentation}} task, training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) requires dense pixelwise ground truth (GT) labeling, which is expensive and involves extensive human effort. In this work, we study {{the possibility of}} using <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ground</b> truth, so-called pseudo ground truth (PGT) to improve the performance. The PGT is obtained by propagating the labels of a GT frame to its subsequent frames in the video using a simple CRF-based, cue integration framework. Our main contribution is to demonstrate the use of noisy PGT along with GT to improve the performance of a CNN. We perform a systematic analysis to find the right kind of PGT that needs to be added along with the GT for training a CNN. In this regard, we explore three aspects of PGT which influence the learning of a CNN: i) the PGT labeling has to be of good quality; ii) the PGT images have to be different compared to the GT images; iii) the PGT has to be trusted differently than GT. We conclude that PGT which is diverse from GT images and has good quality of labeling can indeed help improve the performance of a CNN. Also, when PGT is multiple folds larger than GT, weighing down the trust on PGT helps in improving the accuracy. Finally, We show that using PGT along with GT, the performance of Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) on Camvid data is increased by 2. 7 % on IoU accuracy. We believe such an approach can be used to train CNNs for semantic video segmentation where sequentially labeled image frames are needed. To this end, we provide recommendations for using PGT strategically for semantic segmentation and hence bypass the need for extensive human efforts in labeling.

40|$|Global {{geomagnetic}} field models {{are designed to}} represent the sources of Earth’s magnetic field and their variation in space and time. Such models are used to study {{the dynamics of the}} core, aid satellite operation and make global digital navigation possible – from smartphones to guided drilling. While current models capture the long-period and large-scale features and variations well, {{it is often difficult to}} represent the poorly understood small-scale and rapid behaviour of the field, thus making prediction difficult. The mantle and crust filter and mask small-scale spatial and temporal features and field sources external to the Earth contaminate the observations we have. Geomagnetic jerks represent the most rapid observed variations of the internal field, on the scale of months–years. With the prompt provision of ESA Swarm satellite constellation (< 4 days) and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ground</b> observatory measurements (3 months), it is possible to quickly construct up-to-date models of the {{geomagnetic field}} and its variations. We derive such a model based on Swarm era (2013 –present) data and investigate the occurrence and spatiotemporal characteristics of recent jerks. Previous reports suggest that global models show regions of high secular acceleration associated with the 2014 jerk and that expressions might be seen at European observatories post- 2014. We find limited evidence of a jerk in European observatories but do find globally widespread evidence, our models of this signal are in agreement with independent global geomagnetic field models. We also find evidence of a new jerk in 2015 in auxiliary observatory data. In response to these events we show the impact on early, and potential future, discrepancies between International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) predictions and observations in the period of 2015 - 2020 as a result of the unpredictable, non-linear secular variation of jerks. With the 2014 jerk occurring during / immediately after the data collection period for IGRF- 12 and the new 2015 jerk occurring within one year of release we highlight the deviation from observations, the comparable performance of both simple and complex predictive models and the importance of utilising the ability to regularly update field models. This is likely to remain the case until the rapid dynamics of the core are better understood. ...|$|E

In the construction discussed here, the auxiliary profiles a process, and (future) tense or modality. The infinitive accounts for most of the semantic content of the overall event structure. Both component structures contribute equally to the profile of the construction (the composite structure), in a complementary way, in contrast with a prototypical composite structure. I assume that the Hungarian auxiliary serves the function of imposing temporality on a nontemporal infinitive, and also that of the grounding predication, which marks a departure from Langacker’s English model. The Hungarian <b>grounding</b> predication (the <b>auxiliary)</b> and its head (the infinitive) do not belong to the same grammatical class, only the auxiliary+infinitive composite structure construes a process temporally. Also, degrees of subjectification contribute to types of construal, yielding a dimension of variation that cannot be derived from the deontic/epistemic distinction. Just like the semantic functions of the <b>auxiliaries,</b> subjectification and <b>grounding</b> show gradual characteristics...|$|R

To accelerate the number of American pilots, the report recommended that the best cadets then in ground schools be shipped to France to complete their primary flight training under French instructors. The report further recommended an air force of [...] "fighting airplanes and bombers" [...] well beyond the numbers of airplanes providing <b>auxiliary</b> support of <b>ground</b> forces by observation. In particular Bolling and his Army colleagues, Captains Edgar S. Gorrell and Virginius E. Clark, were impressed by the concept of long-range strategic bombing, influenced by the Italian use of Caproni bombers against Austrian targets. It {{was one of a}} number of aircraft the commission recommended for manufacture by American industry, including the Bristol and SPAD VII fighters, but of its recommendations, only the deHavilland DH-4 was suitable for American production methods or engines and thus built in quantity before the war ended. Bolling prepared the preliminary aeronautical contract with the French, calling for delivery of 5,000 airplanes by July 1, 1918, which was signed on August 30, 1917, by the French air minister and General Pershing, now in command of the American Expeditionary Force.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{methodology}} combing multi-temporal X-band SAR images (TerraSAR-X) with continuous ground thetaprobe measurements, for the retrieval of surface soil moisture and texture at a high spatial resolution. Our analysis is based on seven radar images acquired at a 36 ° incidence angle in the HH polarization, over a semi-arid site in Tunisia (North Africa). The soil moisture estimations are based on an empirical change detection approach using TerraSAR-X data and <b>ground</b> <b>auxiliary</b> thetaprobe network measurements. Two assumptions were tested: (1) roughness variations during the three-month radar acquisition campaigns were not accounted for; (2) a simple correction for temporal variations in roughness was included. The results reveal a small improvement in the estimation of soil moisture when a correction for temporal variations in roughness is introduced. By considering the estimated temporal dynamics of soil moisture, a methodology is proposed for the retrieval of clay and sand content (expressed as percentages) in soil. Two empirical relationships were established between the mean moisture values retrieved from the seven acquired radar images and the two soil texture components over 36 test fields. Validation of the proposed approach was carried out over a second set of 34 fields, showing that highly accurate clay estimations can be achieved. Maps of soil moisture, clay and sand percentages at the studied site are derived...|$|R

By combining it with the inverse distance weighting and ordinary kriging method, we constructed the SVM residual inverse distance weighting, {{as well as the}} SVM residual kriging precipitation interpolation model and compared them with the inverse distance weighting, ordinary kriging, linear regression residual inverse distance weighting and linear regression residual kriging interpolation methods. The TRMM 3 B 43 V 7 satellite precipitation information, which is processed by the latest revision algorithm, is used as the <b>auxiliary</b> variable for <b>ground</b> site precipitation interpolation along with latitude and elevation. Our results show that: (1) adding the TRMM 3 B 43 V 7 satellite precipitation data as an auxiliary variable significantly improves the interpolation accuracy of the linear regression equation and SVM model; (2) the support vector machine hybrid interpolation method obtains superior interpolation results compared to the inverse distance weighting method, ordinary kriging method and linear regression hybrid interpolation method; (3) the interpolation accuracy of the SVM hybrid interpolation method depends on the SVM fitting degree, so we should choose a suitable fitting accuracy rather than the highest fitting accuracy; (4) the linear regression equation has a greater degree of dependency on the TRMM data than the SVM. The SVM accepts the TRMM data information while better maintaining its independence, taking into account that the TRMM data linear regression and linear regression hybrid interpolation method are not suitable for TRMM data evaluation...|$|R
40|$|LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a {{routinely}} employed {{technology as}} a 3 -D data collection technique for topographic mapping. Conventional workflows for analyzing LiDAR data require {{the ground to}} be determined prior to extracting other features of interest. Filtering the terrain points {{is one of the}} fundamental processes to acquire higher-level information from unstructured LiDAR point data. There are many ground-filtering algorithms in literature, spanning several broad categories regarding their strategies. Most of the earlier algorithms examine only the local characteristics of the points or grids, such as the slope, and elevation discontinuities. Since considering only the local properties restricts the filtering performance due to the complexity of the terrain and the features, some recent methods utilize global properties of the terrain as well. This paper presents a new ground filtering method, Min-cut Based Filtering (MBF), which takes both local and global properties of the points into account. MBF considers ground filtering as a labeling task. First, an energy function is designed on a graph, where LiDAR points are considered as the nodes on the graph that are connected to each other as well as to two <b>auxiliary</b> nodes representing <b>ground</b> and off-ground labels. The graph is constructed such that the data costs are assigned to the edges connecting the points to the auxiliary nodes, and the smoothness costs to the edges between points. Data and smoothness terms of the energy function are formulated using point elevations and approximate ground information. The data term conducts the likelihood of the points being ground or off-ground while the smoothness term enforces spatial coherence between neighboring points. The energy function is optimized by finding the minimum-cut on the graph via the alpha-expansion algorithm. The resulting graph-cut provides the labeling of the point cloud as ground and off-ground points. Evaluation of the proposed method on the ISPRS test dataset for ground filtering demonstrates that the results are comparable with most current existing methods. An overall average filtering accuracy for the 15 ISPRS test areas is 91. 3 %...|$|R
