25|$|The narrow carbody {{provides}} for a catwalk along each side between the cabs, with fold back body panels for maintenance access. The cab {{is similar to that}} of the contemporary G class, with an <b>anti-climber</b> beam to prevent upward movement should a collision occur. Twin high impact windscreens are provided, with dual blade wipers. Each cab has room for a two-person crew, as well as an instructor if required. Air conditioning is provided, as well as an air-operated retention toilet at one end accessible from the catwalk. The locos were initially provided with automatic staff exchange equipment, but this was removed in the 1990s when the use of Electric Staff ended. The space remains in the cab side today.|$|E
2500|$|Former Conrail {{locomotives}} can {{be spotted}} by recognizing phase differences in engine models and numbering. Other spotting details can be inconsistent, but can include {{a number of}} the following: red marker lights, Leslie model RS3L or RS5T air horns (only a few original horns remain. Many have been replaced by K5LAs), former Conrail SD40-2s ride on Flexicoil [...] "C" [...] trucks and have anti-climbers, ditch lights mounted beneath the <b>anti-climber,</b> headlights above the cab (vs. CSX's standard practice of nose mounted headlights on all wide-nose GE units), and modified [...] "Bright Future" [...] paint with battery box faces painted yellow (instead of black or blue).|$|E
50|$|To {{protect the}} crew and passengers, most modern {{locomotives}} and passenger cars are fitted with a device known as an <b>anti-climber</b> above the coupler to prevent colliding objects from travelling up over the frame and through the locomotive cab area or through the passenger car. Where a pilot is not fitted, {{a different type of}} <b>anti-climber</b> may be used. This is to prevent one passenger car from riding up over another, or telescoping in a collision.|$|E

50|$|After a BC derailment, CN {{introduced}} ditch lights, lights {{mounted on}} or {{just below the}} <b>anti-climbers</b> on the front pilot of a locomotive. These are used to make trains more visible at grade-crossings, and to give better visibility around curves. Since then, ditch lights have become standard features on all North American locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Although the R33/36 World's Fair {{cars were}} later {{referred}} to as Redbirds, the cars were originally painted in a light turquoise blue and white upon delivery. This [...] "Bluebird" [...] paint color scheme was used until the mid-1970s when they were painted in the silver/blue MTA livery. Then they were painted a full white (roof, bonnets, sides were all painted white) from 1981 to 1982 to combat graffiti; since the white paint was a Teflon-based paint, the graffiti did not stick to it very well. The look was abandoned for the famous Redbird style. The Redbirds were painted between 1984 and 1989 to a deep maroon red body, black front bonnets and <b>anti-climbers,</b> and a silver roof.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the Hunter Railcars {{is derived from the}} Transwa Prospector - the major {{difference}} being the driving cars are each single-engined instead of dual-engined, due to the lower top speed requirement for the Hunter line. Reversible seating is covered with durable, vandal proof woollen moquette farbric in 3x2 formation, and have retractable footrests. CCTV is installed. The cars have been fitted with Dellner SP couplers. They are able to absorb the impact of a collision, and the <b>anti-climbers</b> will also reduce the force of impact. They also have a different body design. Instead of the entire body being of the same design, such as the Tangara, the driver's cab is built as a protective cage, made of fibreglass, which stretches {{to the end of the}} guard's door. The stainless steel paneling starts at the guard's door. The guard's door is designed to operate separately from the passenger doors.|$|R
50|$|The OSCARs {{also include}} several new safety features. The doors on older rolling stock such as V sets are all {{unlocked}} at every station (even short platforms). V Sets have doors {{which must be}} slid open for alighting/boarding and G Sets have push buttons. However, on the H set, the guard is able to select the number of doors to be opened at a station. This feature is aimed at preventing incidents where passengers may fall from the carriage when stopped at a short platform. The H sets have been fitted with Dellner SP couplings, compatible with the Millennium Trains and the Hunter railcars. They are able to absorb {{the impact of a}} collision, and the <b>anti-climbers</b> on the H Sets will also reduce the force of impact. The trains also have a different body design. Instead of the entire body being of the same design, such as the Tangara, the driver's cab is built like a protective cage, made of fibreglass and supported by a box section steel frame, which stretches {{to the end of the}} guard's door. The rest of the train is made from conventional stainless steel.|$|R
