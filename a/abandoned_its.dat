5|$|Lord Lane, then Lord Chief Justice of England, {{dismissed}} the applications on 13 December 1988, arguing of Raghip {{that the jury}} had had ample opportunity to form its own opinion of him. Amnesty International criticised the decision, pointing to the problems with confessions made {{in the absence of}} a lawyer, and was criticized in turn by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who said Amnesty had <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> impartiality.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 12th century, Angkor Wat {{gradually}} {{transformed from}} a Hindu centre of worship to Buddhism, which continues to the present day. Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was somewhat neglected after the 16th century it was never completely <b>abandoned,</b> <b>its</b> preservation being {{due in part to the}} fact that its moat also provided some protection from encroachment by the jungle.|$|E
5|$|After the 1998 {{death of}} Ruby, the zoo's famous {{painting}} elephant, the zoo <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> elephant breeding program {{and began to}} focus on elephant behavior. The zoo is currently home to three Asian elephants that have a variety of behavioral issues, the most common being aggression toward other elephants. One elephant is a former performer at a circus and was subject to mistreatment, while the other two were captured in remote regions where they were never properly socialized.|$|E
5|$|After the {{experience}} of World War II, Belgium <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> neutral stance in international politics, in favour of military, political and economic integration. In 1949, Belgium joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deployed troops to fight alongside other United Nations forces in the Korean War in 1950. Belgium was also {{a key player in}} the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s. Belgium was assigned a sector of the British zone in West Germany, around the city of Cologne, which it occupied from 1945. Belgian soldiers remained in Germany until their final withdrawal in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} {{formerly}} enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, {{such as the}} brothers Yeon Namsaeng (634–679) and Yeon Namsan (639–701). From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla began fighting the Tang forces there. At {{the same time the}} Tang faced threats on its western border when a large Chinese army was defeated by the Tibetans on the Dafei River in 670. By 676, the Tang army was driven out of Korea by Unified Silla. Following a revolt of the Eastern Turks in 679, the Tang <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> Korean campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed. In the end, the victorious {{imperial}} faction <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted {{a policy of}} continued modernization {{with an eye to}} eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the Western powers. Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E
5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E

5|$|On May 25, 1948, {{during the}} battle for the Old City, {{commander}} of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he would be forced to attack it. Moshe Russnak, commander of the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, {{the battle for the}} Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E

By early 2012 GM <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> sales target to deliver 45,000 Volts in the U.S and instead announced that production in 2012 will depend on demand.

5|$|Since 1992, {{the city}} has {{undergone}} several boundary expansions. One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast for an industrial park and a Louisiana-Pacific Canada veneer factory. The city extended sewer and water lines to the location; however, the area was not developed and with the factory only half-built, L-P Canada <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> plans. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005. Another expansion incorporated the existing oriented strand board factory in {{the northwest corner of}} the city, while further incorporations have included undeveloped land to the south and north.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in southeastern Laos was unlike any yet {{seen in the}} Vietnam War, since the PAVN <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> old hit-and-run tactics and launched a conventional counterattack. The PAVN first launched massed infantry attacks supported by armor and heavy artillery to crush ARVN positions on the flanks of the main advance. Coordinated anti-aircraft fire made tactical air support and resupply difficult and costly, with 108 helicopters shot down and 618 others damaged.|$|E
5|$|The repairs mainly {{involved}} {{fixing holes}} in the roof and preventing the ingress of rain water, as well as repairing the weatherboards on the sides. The intervention by English Heritage led to a protracted dispute over the £30,000 cost of the repairs that was scheduled to come to trial at the High Court of Justice in April 2012. In January 2012, a settlement was reached in which Harmondsworth Barn Ltd sold the barn to English Heritage for £20,000. By that time the government had <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> plans to expand Heathrow Airport and the barn had become a liability for the company.|$|E

5|$|Abd el-Hamid {{meanwhile}} {{reported the}} dire situation of his forces at 5:30 PM on October 17. The 16th Brigade {{had been in}} heavy combat for three consecutive days – ammunition was becoming scarce, and the brigade was heavily outnumbered and outgunned due to its losses, including the destruction of its artillery units. Abd el-Hamid received orders from 16th Division headquarters to retreat. His brigade <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> Chinese Farms positions and reinforced {{the lines of the}} 18th Mechanized Brigade to the north during the night of October 17/18. This finally opened the Tirtur and Akavish roads to Israeli forces, ensuring Operation Abiray-Lev would proceed. Missouri remained in Egyptian hands though, posing a threat to the Israeli corridor to the canal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} week of September, a cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States and stalled over the Atlantic Ocean. By September 8, a weak frontal wave began {{developing}} along the cold front. Late on September 9, convection increased over the broad low pressure area, and the overall system intensified beneath an upper-level low. Subsequently, the system <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> frontal features as its appearance became more circular. With persistent but limited convection near and {{to the west of the}} center, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September 10 about 375mi (604km) west-southwest of Bermuda; it was considered subtropical because the upper-circulation was believed to have been cold-core. Operationally, advisories on the system were not initiated until 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, SAS {{announced}} {{that it was going to}} reduce its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, to try to attract more business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway <b>abandoned</b> <b>its</b> old regime of negotiating prices with the airlines for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly. The contract was worth NOK500 million for SAS.|$|E
