Without valid identity cards Bahá'ís encounter difficulty registering their children in school, opening bank accounts, and establishing businesses. On 16 December 2006, after only one hearing, the High Court of Egypt ruled against the Bahá'ís, stating that the government would not recognize their religion in official identification cards. The ruling left Bahá'ís unable to obtain ID cards, birth certificates, or death certificates. However, on January 29, 2008 Cairo's court of <b>Administrative</b> <b>Justice,</b> ruling on two related court cases, ruled in favour of the Bahá'ís, allowing them to obtain birth certificates and identification documents, so long as they omit their religion on court documents. The ruling accepted the compromise solution offered by the Bahá'ís, allowing for them to obtain identification papers without the Bahá'í Faith being officially recognized.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second case}} {{involved}} two 14-year-old twins who {{were unable to}} obtain birth certificates unless they converted to a recognized religion. [...] While {{the father of the}} twins had originally obtained birth certificates when the children were born in 1993 with their religious affiliation as Bahá'í, he was unable to obtain new birth certificates which contain the national number. [...] Without the national number on the birth certificate, the children were unable to enroll in public schools. [...] Since the Supreme Administrative Court's decision in 2006 found that the government had the right to deny Egyptian Bahá'ís identity documents recognizing their religious affiliation, the EIPR modified the requested remedies in the case; the issue before the Court of <b>Administrative</b> <b>Justice</b> is whether Bahá'ís can obtain documents without any religious affiliation or without falsely identifying oneself as one of the recognized religions. This court case was also set to be decided up on September 5, 2007, but the decision has also been postponed to October 30, 2007. As with the other court case, Cairo's court of <b>Administrative</b> <b>Justice</b> also ruled in favour of the Bahá'ís, allowing them to obtain birth certificates, if they omit their religion on the documents. [...] The EIPR stated that they will immediately seek to obtain papers for the twins.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 November, The Court of <b>Administrative</b> <b>Justice</b> said {{it would}} hold a first hearing on 4 December in a case brought by lawyers and activists against the declaration. Morsi met {{with representatives of the}} Supreme Judicial Council in an effort to settle the crisis over the extent of his powers {{following}} his 22 November constitutional declaration. He agreed to limit his decree on his decisions related to [...] "sovereign matters" [...] only. Morsy [...] "did not give himself judicial power" [...] but did provide [...] "immunity for his presidential decisions," [...] said Jihad Haddad, a senior adviser in the Freedom and Justice Party. Haddad added that [...] "the president himself (is) not immune from judicial oversight," [...] though it wasn't clear in what circumstances that might apply, or if there was anything preventing Morsi from issuing a new decree to forestall that. According to Al-Jazeera [...] "sovereign matters" [...] were widely interpreted to cover the declaration of war, imposition of martial law, breaking diplomatic relations with a foreign nation, or dismissing the cabinet. Activists on Monday camped in Cairo's Tahrir Square for a fourth day, blocking traffic with makeshift barricades to protest against what they said was a power-grab by Morsi. Nearby, riot police and protesters clashed intermittently. In addition to popular outbursts on the street, Egypt's judges reacted. All but seven of Egypt's 34 courts and 90% of its prosecutors went on strike Monday in protest, according to Judge Mohamed al-Zind of the Egyptian Judge's Club. Muslim Brotherhood supporters staged a counter-demonstration, while they were relocated from central Cairo to a location in front of Cairo University in Giza. Egypt's stock market, which had seen a fall of almost 10% on 25 November 2012, recovered some ground on Monday morning. Islam Fathy Massoud member of the Muslim Brotherhood was killed during protests in Damanhour. Gaber Salah, a member of the April 6 Youth Movement, was pronounced dead. He had received a rubber bullet shot at close range during clashes with riot police in downtown Cairo. The funeral of Islam Fathy Massoud, who died in the Nile Delta town of Damanhour in a clash between the president's supporters and opponents, was held on Monday, while in Cairo thousands of people marched through Tahrir Square for the funeral of Gaber Salah.|$|E
