40|$|For {{years the}} {{literature}} has contained reports which {{have suggested that}} certain rheumatic diseases may be related, in some vague way, to {{the function of the}} endocrine glands. Some writers envisaged the possibility of an " endocrine rheumatism " and some even considered, along with other aetiological theories, that rheumatoid arthritis might be elicited through an obscure hormonal imbalance. Such ideas were ill-defined and lacked both experimental and direct clinical support. Recently, however, Hench, Kendall, Slocumb, and Polley, and subsequently others, have demonstrated that an <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>hormone</b> (cortisone) and a pituitary adrenocorticotrophic hormone(ACTH) exert strikingly beneficial effects on avariety of rheumatic diseases. These observations now serve as strong evidence to link the pathogenesis of certain rheumatic diseases with the function of the endocrine glands, especially the adrenal cortex...|$|E

40|$|Infants in {{the first}} week of life respond to ACTH {{administration}} with a smaller fall in circulating eosinophils and a smaller increase in urinary corti-costeroids than these same or other infants do when they are older (1, 2). Since these findings seem to validate the suggestions that certain infants suffer from transient adrenal failure and that others are unable to withstand the stress of surgery in the newborn period because of a lack of <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>hormones</b> (3, 4), the logical inference is that these infants should be treated with <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>hormones.</b> The administra-tion of these hormones to infants is dangerous. In this period particularly, in addition to all the potential dangers they possess in older children and adults, they inhibit growth, increase suscepti-bility to infection, and are associated with a high mortality (5, 6). It is important, therefore, that two questions be answered. Do newborn infants have a period of transient adrenal hypofunction and if so, does this have any clinical significance? This study at-tempts to answer the first question. Up to this time the evidence that the newborn infant has a period of depressed adrenal function for approximately a week has been indirect. Corti-costeroid excretion is affected by urinary clearance rates and methods and rates of hormonal degra-dation, etc. Recently, Bergstrand, Hillstrdm, and Jonsson have challenged the validity of the eosinophil measurements as evidence (7).

The literature on this subject has been reviewed previously ' and will not be repeated here. In a previous study ' it has been shown that, while certain hormone preparations do not influence experimental anthrax infection when given for a period prior to infection, others exert a highly protective effect, as high as 75 per cent of the treated animals surviving infection with 1000 minimum lethal doses of B. anthracis.

Subsequently, however, it was shown that patients with Addison's disease developed marked symp-toms of hypoglycemia following the administra-tion of small doses of insulin (3) and failed to show a rise of blood sugar as great as normnal subjects following the injection of a standard dose of epinephrin (4).

40|$|The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis {{operates}} {{to maintain}} the circulating concentration of thyroid hormones. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) is the major hypothalamic messenger controlling the pituitary-thyroid unit. However, the pituitary-thyroid unit responses to various modalities of TRH exposure are not well characterized. Also, interactions between the thyroid axis and other mammalian organ systems, specifically other hormone axes, {{to maintain the}} organism's homeostatic state are not well characterized. This work was designed to clarify {{the response of the}} pituitary-thyroid unit to TRH and to assess the effects of physiological levels of the rat's primary <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>hormone,</b> corticosterone, on the thyroid axis. Adult rats were given equal amounts of TRH by intravenous (I. V.) bolus injection or constant intraperitoneal (I. P.) infusion. Both methods resulted in significant increases in plasma thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), although the time course and peak plasma value varied with the TRH dosage and administration method. Despite the differences in plasma TSH elicited, the thyroid gland responses were similar. Thus, the pituitary is sensitive to the rate and dose of TRH administration. Also, the thyroid is sensitive to plasma levels of TSH but reaches maximum stimulation at submaximal circulating TSH levels. Adrenalectomized female rats, with I. P. and I. V. catheters, were infused with corticosterone (B) to achieve plasma levels within the rat's physiological range. Plasma samples were drawn before and after submaximal TRH (250 ng/ 100 g Body Weight) administration for assay of TSH and B concentrations. B in the lower half of its physiological range significantly inhibited the increase in plasma TSH observed 10 and 30 minutes after TRH administration. Also, direct stereotaxic infusion of B (50 ng) followed by TRH (1 ng) into the anterior pituitary inhibited the observed increase in plasma TSH. These studies indicate that homeostatic thyroid axis hormone concentrations are maintained by a feedback loop mechanism which is modulated by adrenal hormones. Specifically, physiological levels of corticosterone decrease pituitary sensitivity to TRH in the rat. In addition, the pituitary and thyroid gland exhibit different response patterns to hormonal stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis study {{concerns}} {{two aspects}} of <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>hormone</b> production; both are intended to contribute to an ultimate understanding of the mechanism of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) action. Since the corticosteroidogenic process is stimulated by ACTH, the chemical transformations involved in hormone synthesis must be understood. The first phase of this study utilized radiotracer techniques to resolve uncertainties which existed concerning the roles of 11 β-hydroxyprogesterone and 11 -deoxycorticosterone (DOC) as intermediaries {{in the formation of}} cortisol and corticosterone from progesterone. For this purpose, trace amounts of 11 β-hydroxyprogesterone- 4 -c^ 14 and DOC- 21 -C^ 14 were added to incubations of cell-free bovine adrenocortical tissue prepared in a variety of media. The cortisol and corticosterone, which are produced from both endogenous precursors and suitable exogenous precursors by these homogenates, were isolated from lipid extracts of the incubation mixtures by column and paper chromatography. Measurement of the amount and radioactive content of the corticoids formed permitted evaluation of the degree of conversion of DOC- 21 -C^ 14 and 11 β-hydroxyprogesterone- 4 -C^ 14 to cortisol and corticosterone, relative to that of a known intermediary, progesterone, incubated under identical conditions. It was found that DOC is converted in good yield to corticosterone, but not in detectable amounts to cortisol. The results support the postulation that cortisol and corticosterone are formed from progesterone via separate pathways. With regard to 11 β-hydroxyprogesterone, a limited conversion of this steroid to both cortisol and corticosterone was observed; however, the degree of this conversion relative to that of progesterone indicated that 11 β-hydroxyprogesterone is not a major intermediary in the formation of these corticoids from progesterone. The second aspect of this study was stimulated by observations of previous investigators that the responsivity of adrenocortical tissue to ACTH in vitro is related to the structural integrity of the tissue preparation. To investigate this possible relationship, a preparation of bovine adrenal cortical tissue was devised which is intermediate in structural organization between homogenized and sliced tissue. This preparation, which consisted of small clumps of cells, was incubated under a variety of conditions and compared to similar studies carried out on adrenocortical slices. The corticosteroid production of these preparations was determined utilizing paper chromatographic techniques. Evidence was obtained which indicated that certain cofactors and substrates which are necessary for corticoid formation were removed or destroyed in the preparation of these clumps of adrenocortical cells. Apparently as a consequence of this loss, the tissue no longer produced corticoids in significant amounts. However, corticosteroidogenic capabilities were restored in the presence of glucose by the addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPN) and fumarate to the incubation medium. Each of these cofactors contributed to the maximal corticosteroidogenic response, and ATP and DPN could be replaced by triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPN). This cell-clump preparation did not respond to the ACTH either in {{the presence or absence of}} cofactor-fumarate supplementation. In contrast, adrenal cortical slices were shown to respond both to cofactor-fumarate supplementation and to ACTH; however, these effects were not additive. These results indicate that cofactor availability is rate-limiting in the process of corticosteroidogenesis, and are consistent with the concept that the mechanism by which ACTH stimulates corticosteroidogenesis may in some manner be concerned with an increased supply of cofactors to specific localized sites of enzyme activity within adrenocortical cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{adrenal cortex}} in an animal's {{response}} to bacterial infections and to bacterial endotoxins {{has been the subject}} of much research and speculation. Just recently, Brooke, Kass, and Hechter (1) reported that adrenalectomized rats are killed by one one-thousandth the dose of endotoxin required to kill normal animals. This dramatic observation is far superior to any other in the literature in emphasizing the protection afforded by adrenal hormones against the toxic manifestations of an endotoxin. It conveys no information, however, as to why this should be true. In the preceding paper (2), it was indicated that the therapeutic action of cortisone in endotoxin-poisoned mice was linked, perhaps, to the higher levels of carbohydrate it produced. Since Long et al. (3) found that the glyconeogenesis initiated by <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>hormones</b> was accompanied by protein degradation and a negative nitrogen balance, it is to be assumed that the carbohydrate formed in mice given both endotoxin and cortisone is synthesized, at least in part, from body protein. This premise is subject to experimental verification. The classical relationship which permits urinary nitrogen excretion to b...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between plasma lipoprotein concentration and histologic myointimal proliferative lesions in the coronary vessels was examined in 37 freshwater Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The fish were obtained during the migrating, schooling, and spawning periods {{of the fourth}} year of life. Plasma apoB polypeptides were maximally elevated in the migrating fish in correlation {{with a high degree}} of coronary vascular disease. Both the relative incidence and the severity of lesions were greater in migrating salmon as compared with spawning fish. In contrast, plasma apoA polypeptides were maximally elevated in association with reduced levels of plasma apoB in spawning fish in which coronary lesions were reduced in severity and incidence. Simultaneous observations confirmed the relative decrease in circulating thyroid hormone and increase in <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>hormones</b> characteristic of the maturation process. These data in the mature freshwater Lake Michigan Chinook salmon provide direct support for the hypothesis that coronary proliferative atherogenesis proceeds in parallel with excessive exposure to apoB-containing lipoproteins and that reversal is associated with excessive exposure to apoA-containing lipoproteins. The temporal relationship to altered hormone status is described, but the pathophysiologic significance for atherogenesis cannot be determined from these data...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the year}} 2000, the South Korean {{government}} introduced {{a program for}} separation of drug prescribing and dispensing. The goals of the program are to reduce misuse of drugs and to contain drug expenditures. The government also designated exception regions for the program to reduce the inconvenience for people who reside in areas with a shortage of health care resources. However, according to government reports, many adverse events related to drug misuse occurred in these exception regions after the program reforms were introduced. Therefore, it is worth investigating the factors that relate to drug consumption so that misuse in exception regions can be reduced. Methods: Data from medical institutions, detailed drug supply data, and community health survey data {{were included in the}} analysis. Multilevel linear regression analysis using mixed models that included pharmacy—and regional-level variables were used to examine the associations regarding the percentages of drug types consumed (i. e., antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory drugs, psychotropic drugs, <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>hormones,</b> and antibiotics). Results: The data used in this analysis were from a total of 16, 455 pharmacies. There were 1. 9 % pharmacies from program exception regions and 98. 1 % pharmacies from program application regions. Compared with the pharmacies in the program application regions, the exception region pharmacies had higher values for percen...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{cortisone}} and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to protect experimental animals against the toxic and/or febrile effects of bacterial endotoxins {{has been reported}} {{by a number of}} investigators (1 - 8) and denied by others (9, 10). The underlying mechanism(s) responsible for this action of <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>hormones</b> remains obscure. It frequently is suggested, however, that protection against endotoxins is related to the anti-inflammatory effect of this group of steroids. If further study proves this to be the case, it would represent only one level of understanding. There would remain the need for a biochemical explanation of how the hormone protects and, ideally, why there may be exceptions to the protection. The present report, while not pretending to provide any final answers to this complex problem, does offer some insight into possible metabolic bases for the actions of endotoxin and cortisone. For several decades it has been known that endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria injected into experimental animals produce an initial hyperglycemia (11, 12). This is followed by a prompt fall in blood sugar to hypoglycernic levels with a concomitant decrease in liver glycogen (13). Cortisone, on the other hand, promotes a glyconeogenesis and a negative nitrogen balance (14). It is {{on the basis of these}} established facts that the experiments described below were undertaken...|$|R
