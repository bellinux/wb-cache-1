He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} depression of mothers with children in early childhood and to identify predictors by income level. Methods: The research was conducted with 1, 761 data from the 3 rd wave of the Panel Study of Korean Children(PSKC) data. Independent variables were socio-demographic data, self-esteem, normative life-events, non-normative life events, parenting stress, marital conflict, social support. Data were analyzed by t-test, ANOVA, hierarchical multiple regression analysis were conducted. Results: Significant factors of depression of female in low-income were non-normative life events, parenting stress, marital conflict. In middle class, significant factors were education, birth order of children, self-esteem, normative and non-normative life events, parenting stress, marital conflict, sociable support. At last, we found that marital conflict was the biggest factor for depression of female in low-income and parenting stress was the most powerful predictor in middle class. Conclusions: Mother's depression has <b>a</b> <b>enormous</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> development of children in early childhood. Therefore It is required to prevent depression in mothers and it is important to intervene at the early stage of depression.

40|$|The {{intensification}} of agricultural production systems {{during the last}} decades had <b>a</b> <b>enormous</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the landscape structure in agro-ecosystems. Landscape elements like hedges and vegetational rich fieldmargins dissapeared and crops are cultivated in large monocultures. To let beneficial insects {{play a role in}} these 'ecological deserts' and to fullfill their food requirements in form of pollen and nectar the establishment of flowering field edges gets increasingly popular. But not everything that flowers is naturally exclusively positive for beneficial insects. Pest insects can profit from flowering field edges as well. In my PhD research I analysed a number of nectar plants with respect to their potential benefit for cabbage pests and/or their natural enemies. In field studies I observed the attractivity of nectar plants for pest insects and beneficial insects. In the laboratory I studied in how far the plant species differ in their nectar accessibility and their <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> insect longevity. In addition, I examined the impact of different nectar and honeydew sugars on the gustatory response and the longevity of the insects. Based on the results I found, I conducted field experiments with plants that provide food for either the herbivores or for the beneficial insects. I collected individuals of the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella and its parasitoid Diadegma semiclausum and tested them for their sugar content. The results indicated food uptake in the field for both species. I also could show in a field experiment, that suitable nectar plants, such as buckwheat, have <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> longevity and fecundity of the parasitoid D. semiclausum. In addition, I could demonstrate that nectar plants that selectively are used by herbivores, such as Centaurea jacea by the cabbage white Pieris rapae, can lead to higher pest densities in adjacent cabbage plantings. My most important conclusion is therefore that a selective approach and a careful choice of plant species are necessary to achieve improved biological control by flowering field edges...|$|R

25|$|Regardless of {{the medium}} of introduction, {{biological}} invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote {{about the benefits of}} biotic and landscape diversity centuries ago.

European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species.
