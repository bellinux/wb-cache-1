5|$|John Parkinson (15671650; buried 6 August 1650) was {{the last}} of the great English {{herbalists}} {{and one of the first}} of the great English botanists. He was apothecary to James I and a founding member of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries in December 1617, and was later Royal Botanist to Charles I. He is known for two monumental works, Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris (Park-in-Sun's Terrestrial Paradise, 1629), which generally describes the proper cultivation of plants; and Theatrum Botanicum (The Botanical Theatre or Theatre of Plants, 1640), the most complete <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> presented English treatise on plants of its time. One of the most eminent gardeners of his day, he kept a botanical garden at Long Acre in Covent Garden, today close to Trafalgar Square, and maintained close relations with other important English and Continental botanists, herbalists and plantsmen.|$|E
5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E
25|$|In 1913 O'Reilly {{published}} Tears and Triumph, {{an expanded}} short story {{rather than a}} novel, in which O'Reilly shows a penetrating knowledge of the feminine view-point. It is a tragic little story, simply <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> told, with a running commentary by the author on the philosophy of sex, and it is unique in Australian literature.|$|E

25|$|Jassin {{wrote that}} Di Bawah Lindungan Ka'bah was {{interesting}} <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> written. Siregar found the novel to be a well-crafted story made more powerful by its writing style. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw described Hamka's work as too moralistic and sentimental; {{he wrote that}} a Western reader would at least provide a window into Indonesian culture in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples {{used the}} {{materials}} at hand {{to make their}} instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada. First Nations people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birch bark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs are the background for dances. Traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, the Soho Mint struck coins for the East India Company, Sierra Leone and Russia, while producing high-quality planchets, or blank coins, to be struck by national mints elsewhere.

500|$|Jason Ankeny of AllMusic {{gave the}} album five stars, lauding its [...] "lush string {{arrangements}} and gorgeous harmonies". Ankeny also compared {{the music on}} the album to The Band in their prime. Pitchfork writer Neil Lieberman praised how Wilco [...] "craft an album as wonderfully ambiguous <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> uncertain as life itself" [...] and how Bennett [...] "paint the album in Technicolor". Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention, calling it [...] "old-fashioned tunecraft lacking not pedal steel, who cares, but the concreteness modern popcraft eschews". The Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot championed the album in his review and ranked it the year's best album, calling it [...] "pop so gorgeous it belies the intricate studio experimentation that brought it to life".|$|E

Fan reaction to the character was generally negative as well. Ackles summed up the response as, [...] "No, no, we just {{want this to be}} about the boys." [...] Though Kripke believed that Tal was a [...] "terrific actress" [...] who [...] "did valiantly <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> with the part [...] gave her", he felt that introducing her as a love interest was a mistake and came to believe that women should only be introduced into the series as antagonists.

She portrayed Kathy Nicolo, an abandoned wife whose inherited house is sold at auction to the Iranian emigre and former colonel Massoud Amir Behrani (Ben Kingsley). After reading the script, Connelly said: [...] "(the story is) moving <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> written. I liked {{the fact that there is}} no good guy and bad guy. I found it really compelling that both sides do things that are morally questionable, because life is often like that." [...] Producer Michael London said about Connelly's portrayal: [...] "I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had. I don't think there is another actress who could have played Kathy with such power and grace." ...|$|E

500|$|The New York Times Will Hermes names Laurie Anderson an {{experimental}} pop pioneer whose signature song [...] "O Superman" [...] (1981) was a [...] "left-field new wave hit" [...] that [...] "conflated maternal succor with {{the psychology of}} the modern corporate state using electronically processed verse." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Jason Cowley described British singer-songwriter Kate Bush as [...] "an artist superbly articulate in the language of experimental pop music". [...] Paste Magazine credited My Bloody Valentine's 1988 album Isn't Anything with showcasing {{an experimental}} pop aesthetic, which drew on [...] "harsh, swirling guitar tones <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> dissonant distortion," [...] that would eventually develop into the genre known as shoegazing. Martin suggested that hip hop music, particularly released by artists such as Public Enemy and KRS-One, emerged as a new form of experimental pop, seeing a renewed merger of artistic and political innovation.|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of {{historian}} David Goodway, Read's [...] "remarkable career and formidable output have generated a surprisingly limited biographical and critical literature". Richard Wasson has commented that The Green Child [...] "though judged favorably by the few critics and scholars who give it serious study... is so vaguely and variously interpreted that {{it would seem to}} lack both the form and the content which justify such praise". The critic Richard E. Brown, writing in 1990, considered the work to be [...] "an important attempt by one of [...] most influential English critics to integrate his wide-ranging thoughts into a complex interpretation of experience", but added that it divided commentators, appearing to some to be [...] "fascinating but inscrutable". Reviewing the first American edition in 1948, Professor of English Robert Gorham Davis commented that the novel [...] "baffled some English critics when it arrived in 1935", but that it was [...] "beautifully imagined <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> written".|$|E

She said that, [...] "because the episode is stylish <b>and</b> <b>beautifully</b> paced, the morality play doesn't get too heavy-handed or silly", but {{felt that it was}} one-sided {{because of the lack of}} information on the Skagarans. She summed up the [...] "North Star" [...] by describing it as a [...] "fun, throw away" [...] episode. Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] described it as a [...] "shallow Trek adventure by the numbers" [...] which was [...] "all about setting and rarely about substance". He gave it a score of two out of four. When Epsicokhan was summing up the whole of season three, [...] "North Star" [...] was described as one of the mediocre episodes in the season.|$|E
