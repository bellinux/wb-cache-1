40|$|Abnormalities {{found with}} <b>anuscopy</b> under colposcopic vision, anal {{cytology}} and anal biopsy were evaluated in 21 men with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) at the Federal University of Pernambuco Hospital in Brazil. Mean age was 38. 4 ± 6. 0 years, and mean time of HIV infection was 8. 3 ± 5. 1 years; 95. 2 % {{of the patients}} had been on {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) for an average of 6. 6 ± 4. 5 years. Mean CD 4 + cell count was 482. 2 ± 173. 75 cells/mm 3, and 80. 9 % presented a HIV viral load of < 5, 000 copies/mL. Reported sexual preference was 52. 4 % homosexuals, 28. 6 % bisexuals, and 19. 0 %heterosexuals; 81 % reported having had receptive anal intercourse and 61. 9 % reported more than 10 sexual partners of the same sex. Results of <b>anuscopy</b> under colposcopic vision revealed 17 (81. 0 %) low-grade lesions and/or condylomata or micropapillae and four (19. 0 %) high-grade lesions with or without condylomata. Among the 21 anal cytology examinations, seven (33. 3 %) revealed low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL); three (14. 3 %) presented atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and 11 (52. 4 %) were normal. Seventeen patients were submitted to anal biopsy with the following findings: three patients (17. 6 %) with normal epithelium, one (5. 9 %) with infection by HPV, three (17. 6 %) with condylomatas, two (11. 8 %) with AIN 1, four (23. 6 %) with AIN 2, three (17. 6 %) with AIN 3, and one (5. 9 %) with PAIN 2. <b>Anuscopy</b> under colposcopic vision was found to be useful for detecting anal lesions and for guiding ana...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) {{infection}} {{is one of}} the Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) of greatest incidence and prevalence worldwide, and it is presently considered to be a pre-neoplastic lesion. Human Papillomavirus infection has totaled 23. 4 % of the sexually transmitted diseases reported to the Department of Health, and it is currently the most common in our country. Many patients are asymptomatic carriers. Methods: Twenty patients who had been previously treated for HPV due to genital lesions were referred for the conduction of <b>anuscopy</b> and colposcopy of the perianal region. Results: Males (80 %) prevailed over females (20 %). Of the total number of patients, only 2 showed lesions as examined by <b>anuscopy</b> (10 %). However, 3 other patients showed lesions by means of colposcopy, thus increasing to 5 (25 %) the total number of asymptomatic patients who presented perianal lesions. Of the total number of patients with lesions, 4 were males and 1 was a female. Conclusion: The presence of perianal lesions was observed in 10 % of the patients with genital lesions by means of simple anal inspection. This figure increased to 25 % when anal colposcopy was associated, thus showing the importance of conducting such examination on all patients with increased risk factors for HPV infection in the anal region...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of {{anorectal}} {{function in}} faecal incontinence. In cases presenting faecal incontinence, an etiological diagnosis {{should be based}} on history, clinical examination, <b>anuscopy</b> and rectoscopy. This diagnosis should be confirmed or contradicted by the results of objective investigations, especially manometry, myography and radiology. In the absence of anorectal anatomical defects, a functional cause of incontinence has to be found: megarectum with pseudo-incontinence, psychogenic encopresis, lesions of the nervous system, pudendal neuropathy. In the presence of obvious anatomical defects, the function of all components of the anorectal continence apparatus has to be evaluated; in this way, {{it will be possible to}} objectivate the results of conservative or surgical treatment by repetition of the technical investigations. In practice, a complete functional evaluation of the anorectum has to be performed in patients in whom the results of previous therapy remain unsatisfactory. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnal impalement is a rarely {{reported}} entity. As far {{as children}} are concerned, {{it is often}} an accidental injury that is exceptionally associated with intra-abdominal injuries. We herein report a case of impalement with intestinal perforation in a 13 -year-old boy. He jumped down from a wall and fell upon a picket of wood which directly penetrated his anus. He felt {{the end of the}} picket in the abdomen near his umbilicus. After removal of the picket, he developed peritonitis. However, there was no injury at the anal margin. The <b>anuscopy</b> showed a superficial and linear detachment of the rectal mucous membrane. The surgical exploration of abdomen showed perforations of sigmoid colon and small intestine. We performed a primary repair of intestinal injuries (excision – suture of the sigmoid colon perforation, resection and end to end anastomosis of the ileum perforation), associated with a left transverse colostomy. The colostomy was closed 5 weeks later. The postoperative periods were uneventful. With a follow-up of 2 years, there were no complications...|$|E
40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} of the anus (SCCA) is a common cancer in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected population, and its incidence continues to increase in male homosexuals. Combined chemoradiation with mitomycin C and 5 -fluorouracil was poorly tolerated by severely immunocompromised patients in the early 1990 s. In the era of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART), however, recent data indicate that: (1) most HIV patients with anal cancer can tolerate standard chemotherapy regimens; and (2) this approach is associated with survival rates similar to those of HIV-negative patients. However, HIV-positive patients with SCCA are much younger, more likely to develop local tumor recurrence, and ultimately die from anal cancer than immune competent patients. Taken together, these findings suggest that anal cancer is an often fatal neoplasia in middle-aged HIV-positive male homosexuals. In this population, SCCA is an opportunistic disease resulting in patients with suboptimal immune function from persistent infection and prolonged exposition to oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Large-scale cancer-prevention strategies (routine <b>anuscopy</b> and anal papanicolaou testing) should be implemented in this population. In addition, definitive eradication of oncogenic HPVs within the anogenital mucosa of high-risk individuals might require a proactive approach with repeated vaccination...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: A infecção pelo Papilomavírus Humano é uma das Doenças Sexualmente Transmissíveis (DSTs) de maior incidência e prevalência no mundo, sendo atualmente considerada como uma lesão pré-neoplásica. A infecção pelo Papilomavírus humano (HPV) somou 23, 4 % das doenças sexualmente transmissíveis (DST) comunicadas ao Ministério de Saúde, sendo atualmente a mais comum em nosso país. Muitos pacientes são portadores assintomáticos. MÉTODOS: Foram encaminhados para a realização de anuscopia e colposcopia da região perianal 20 pacientes já tratados para HPV por lesões em regiões genitais. RESULTADOS: Houve prevalência do sexo masculino (80 %) em relação ao sexo feminino (20 %), do total de pacientes apenas 2 apresentavam lesões a anuscopia (10 %), porém mais 3 pacientes apresentaram lesões com a realização da colposcopia, aumentando para 5 (25 %) o total de pacientes assintomáticos que apresentavam lesões perianais. Do total de pacientes com as lesões 4 eram do sexo masculino e 1 do sexo feminino. CONCLUSÃO: Pudemos observar a presença de lesões perianais em 10 % dos pacientes portadores de lesões genitais pela simples inspeção anal, estes valores aumentam para 25 % quando se associa a colposcopia anal, demonstrando a importância da realização deste exame em todos os pacientes com fator de risco aumentado para a infecção pelo HPV na região anal.

40|$|Incidence of {{anal cancer}} is {{increasing}} {{and risk of}} anal cancer is higher in MSM, {{especially if they are}} HIV+. European guidelines for treatment of HIV-infected adults recommend anal cancer screening by digital rectal exam&#x 00 B 1;Pap test with <b>anuscopy</b> if Pap test is abnormal. A systematic anal cancer screening in HIV+MSM with anal cytology (Pap smears) was established in June 2011 in our reference centre in Brussels. If anal cytology was abnormal, high-resolution <b>anuscopy</b> (HRA) with biopsy was performed. 353 MSM HIV+were screened by anal smears between June 2011 and May 2012. 90 % were Caucasians, median age was 44. 5 years, 83 % were on HAART and 74 % had an undetectable viral load, median CD 4 was 632 /&#x 00 B 5;l and 33 % had a nadir CD 4 &# 60; 200. Thirty-three (9. 3 %) were excluded because of poor quality. Cytology was abnormal in 46 % of the 320 remaining patients: high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) 3 %, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) 24 %, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) 16 %, and atypical squamous cells / cannot rule out a high-grade lesion (ASC-H) 3 %. Viral load (VL) was more frequently undetectable (82 % vs 64 %, p= 0. 0003) and median duration of HAART was longer (111 vs 61 months, p= 0. 0145) in patients with normal cytology. 80 HRA with biopsies have been performed. 12. 5 % were normal, 44 % showed anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) 1, 24 % AIN 2 and 19 % AIN 3. For this analysis, high-grade AIN (2 and 3) were put together (AIN 2 +). Among patients with AIN 2 +(n= 33), cytology had showed 8 (24 %) ASC-US, 3 (9 %) ASC-H, 19 (57 %) LSIL, 3 (9 %) HSIL. When patients with normal cytology or normal biopsy and patients with AIN 2 +were compared, the only significant risk factor found for AIN 2 +was a nadir CD 4 &# 60; 100 /&#x 00 B 5;l (32 % of the patients with AIN 2 +vs 14 % in patients with normal smear, p= 0. 0073). Anal precancerous lesions are frequent and at different stages. Among 46 % abnormal cytology, 87 % had abnormal biopsy including half AIN 2 +. Cytology&#x 00 B 1;biopsy {{is the only way to}} detect those lesions and should be performed systematically in HIV+MSM. Risk factor for AIN 2 +was a nadir CD 4 &# 60; 100 /&#x 00 B 5;l. A normal cytology was associated with an undetectable VL and a longer duration of HAART. Those results provide further argument for early initiation of HAART...|$|E

The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate MRI defaecography in FI and to compare it with clinical examination combined with rigid rectoscopy in assessing the pelvic floor in patients with FI. Consecutive patients with FI referred over a 3 -year period to our tertiary centre for MRI defaecography were retrospectively studied. MRI images of the pelvic floor were compared with clinical examination and <b>anuscopy</b> and rectoscopy. Seventy-four female patients [mean age 60. 5 (30. 0 - 81. 0) years] were recruited. MRI defaecography showed conditions which often overlapped, including internal intussusception in 19 (25. 7 %) and pelvic floor descent in 24 (32. 4 %). There was average agreement between MRI and clinical examination for a significant anterior rectocoele (κ =  0. 40) and poor agreement between MRI and anuscopy/rectoscopy for intra-rectal (κ =  0. 06) and intra-anal intussusception (κ =  0. 11). Other than for anterior rectocoele, there is poor correlation between MRI defaecography and clinical examination with rigid rectoscopy. MRI can detect a variety of abnormal static and dynamic pelvic disorders. This includes enterocoele, which could result in a modification of the surgical approach to intussusception and anterior rectocoele...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: {{nowadays}} {{the rubber}} band ligation technique {{is one of}} the most worldwide used and effective treatment of the hemorrhoidal disease. Objectives: our study has as a goal to analyze the success or failure of the rubber band ligation in hemorrhoids grade 1, 2 and 3, to analyze their complications and to see if all symptomatic hemorrhoids should be treated with ligation at the first visit. Patients and method: a prospective and descriptive study was designed for patients who came to the Colorectal Unit with hemorrhoidal disease from September 1997 to December 2001. First, second and third degree patients were treated according to the classification of hemorrhoids of St. Mark's Hospital. The technique of ligation after Barron was applied. Results: from 261 patients with a mean age of 48. 3 (range: 16 - 86), 181 (99 M/ 82 W) have been treated with Barron's method and 80 with rich fiber diet and water. Rectal bleeding was the most common symptom (91. 16 %). <b>Anuscopy</b> showed hemorrhoidal disease in all the cases. From 181 patients, 19. 33 % were hemorrhoids degree I, 51. 93 % degree II and 29. 83 % degree III. Two hundred and eighty-seven ligation sessions were done and the balance of ligations per patient was 2. 45 and 1. 5 rubber band per session. The 32 % of the patients referred pain after ligation. A 13. 81 % of cases were operated due to persistent rectal bleeding or hemorrhoidal prolapse. Conclusions: symptomatic hemorrhoids degree I and II with a short clinical history should be treated initially with a rich fiber and water diet. The technique of Barron is an effective therapy to treat the hemorrhoids degree 1, 2 and in 74 % of success in cases with degree 3. Introducción: la técnica de ligaduras con banda para hemorroides constituye hoy en día uno de los tratamientos más efectivos a nivel mundial. Objetivos: el objetivo de nuestro estudio ha sido valorar el éxito/fracaso terapéutico de las ligaduras en hemorroides grado I-II-III, analizar sus complicaciones y plantear si todas las hemorroides sintomáticas deben ser tratadas con bandas en la primera visita. Pacientes y método: se diseñó un estudio descriptivo prospectivo de los pacientes que acudieron a la Unidad de Coloproctología con patología hemorroidal entre septiembre de 1997 y diciembre de 2001. Se trataron a pacientes con hemorroides grado I, II y III según la clasificación del Hospital de St. Mark's. Se empleó la técnica de ligaduras descrita por Barron. Resultados: doscientos sesenta y un pacientes, con una edad media de 48, 3 años (rango: 16 - 86), de los cuales 181 (99 V/ 82 M) han sido tratados según el método de Barron. Ochenta pacientes han sido tratados con dieta rica en fibra y agua. La sintomatología más frecuente la constituye la rectorragia (91, 16 %). La anuscopia evidenció patología hemorroidal en todos los casos. De 181 pacientes, 19, 33 % fueron hemorroides grado I, 51, 93 % grado II y 29, 83 % grado III. Se efectuaron 287 sesiones de ligaduras, siendo la media de 2, 45 ligaduras por paciente y 1, 5 ligaduras por sesión. Un 32 % de pacientes tuvieron dolor tras la ligadura. Se operó a un 13, 81 % por persistencia de rectorragias y de prolapso hemorroidal. Conclusiones: las hemorroides sintomáticas grado I y II de corta evolución deben ser tratadas inicialmente con dieta rica en agua y fibra. La técnica de Barron resulta una terapéutica eficaz para tratar las hemorroides grado 1, 2 y en el 74 % de éxito en los casos grado 3...|$|E
