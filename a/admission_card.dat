50|$|Krishna and {{her father}} travel to Patna for {{the final stage of}} the exam. However, unbeknownst to her, Tun Tun Singh and Bihari have bribed two of the {{examiners}} to make sure that Krishna fails and Pinky passes. While in the waiting room at the bus station, Krishna's bag containing her <b>admission</b> <b>card</b> is stolen. Krishna eventually finds the person who stole her bag. She makes it to the center just in time to sit the exam. Fortunately for her, Pintu has bribed the name-caller to bump her name up so that she is last to be called and won't miss her interview. When she gets there, at Babloo's insistence, Pintu gives her his handkerchief to wipe her face. This horrifies Pinky, whose interview was a disaster but seems unaffected by it.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 Campbell was {{appointed}} as the Canadian ambassador to NATO. As {{part of his}} appointment {{he served as a}} Canada's representative on NATO's Nuclear Planning Group. He was known as a blunt-spoken diplomat who believed in the Cold War realities of NATO. This came {{at a time when the}} Liberal cabinet led by Pierre Trudeau questioned the value of NATO and contemplated revoking membership within the alliance. Campbell was firm in his view that without NATO, the Soviet Union would have opportunity to overthrow the countries of Western Europe. Campbell held that NATO existed to preserve European territorial integrity, security, and social and economic well-being. Further, Campbell argued that NATO acted as Canada's <b>admission</b> <b>card</b> to the negotiating tables of the Western Alliance. After his NATO assignment ended in 1972, Campbell {{was appointed}} as the ambassador to Japan.|$|E
50|$|The {{importance}} of the Congress {{and the necessity of}} the members to attend the Congress were expressed in a circular, which was signed by the Secretary General for French India and dispatched to the elected members accompanied by the topographical map of the place where the congress was to be held together with the <b>admission</b> <b>card.</b> There was a proposal to hold the congress at karaikal, but that was set aside. Kizhur, a tiny hamlet was finally chosen {{in order to avoid the}} disturbances, which the presence of messrs. Goubert and Mouthoupoulle might have provoked if the congress had been held at Pondicherry. Monsieur Balasubramanian, President of Assemblée Représentative, acted as presiding officer of the congress. After considering the draft agreement put before them by the French and Indian Governments the Congress voted in secret ballot. An agreement for the de facto transfer of the Establishments was thereupon signed in Delhi on 21 October 1954.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{computerized}} patient record (CPR) system {{plays an}} essential support {{role in the}} efficient functioning of the clinical and research services of a medical centre. We report the experience gained in developing a CPR for the Respiratory Rehabilitation Department (RRD) of the Tradate Medical Center of the Salvatore Maugeri Foundation, with specific reference to Out-patient (OP) and In-patient (IP) Units. The CPR was developed locally {{under the guidance of}} the Bioengineering Department. Several items implemented and strategies adopted are described and grouped in relation to broader objectives, such as the improvement of health-care quality, the enhancement of personnel productivity and reduction in costs, the support of clinical and health service research and the accommodation of future developments. In particular, we describe the design and implementation of anamnestic, physical and admission data collection, specifically orientated to respiratory diseases. Daily use of the CPR in the OP and IP units and its potential outcome for research and management support are also studied in detail. On the basis of our experience (1, 251 out-patient examinations, 650 in-patient clinical <b>admission</b> <b>cards),</b> the computerized patient record seems a useful way of providing better health-care and a more comprehensive coverage of the rehabilitation process of patients in a Respiratory Rehabilitation Department...|$|R
2500|$|The World Bank {{survey of}} 80 {{teachers}} found that 80% reported general dissatisfaction with procedures for up-grading with 50% considering it {{was influenced by}} political connections and 27% by relationships to committee members. Bribery was mentioned by 9%. Application of rules and regulations could be {{at the discretion of}} key decision makers and favouritism was unchallenged. Teachers' absenteeism was tolerated to allow private tutoring which was reported by 40% of school officials. Promotion was seen as unrelated to merit and could involve forged documentation, possibly supported by officials who failed to notice forgeries. [...] There were some reports of corruption in student assessment such as staff changing marks, favouring their relatives and selectively leaking questions. Fraudulent practices in examinations included forged <b>admission</b> <b>cards,</b> to allow students to pay others to take their exam, and collusion in cheating between students and school officials. In one case, regional officials were alleged to have over-turned a disqualification. Teachers might also accept bribes from students or parents to over-score the examination. Falsification of documents was widespread with most occurring for completion of the primary or secondary school cycle. There could be corruption in the building of new educational facilities, particularly in remote areas which were difficult to supervise. Corruption was indicated when a building collapsed but no one was held to account and there was no investigation. Bribery was regarded as worse than favouritism or document falsification. Expressing gratitude with a small gift was not considered corrupt. Malpractice tended not to be reported for fear of reprisals. Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) and general knowledge of pupil entitlement helped to reduce some sources of potential corruption.|$|R
5000|$|The Fort Pitt Brewing Company was {{incorporated}} in 1906 by Dr. Herman Hechelman {{with a group}} of businessmen and local politician, Samuel Grenet. [...] With capital stock of $200,000, the company soon began construction of a five story brewery located in Sharpsburg, PA. Fort Pitt Brewery opened for business in early 1908 with an annual capacity of 75,000 barrels. Fort Pitt Beer’s distribution network along with other brands, were established throughout Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland. Prohibition in 1920 caused the vast majority of breweries to close. Fort Pitt Brewing Company, however, remained successfully in business by selling a wide variety of non-alcoholic serial beverages in 27 states from Massachusetts to California.After the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 which led to the repeal of prohibition laws, Fort Pitt soon brought alcoholic beer back to Pittsburgh. Management initially found that the brewing industry had changed significantly since 1920 based upon many technological advances in the brewing process. [...] However, the economics of selling beer had also drastically changed {{especially in light of the}} fact that Fort Pitt was able to thrive on pre-prohibition saloon sales which were 60% of draft beer in bars. [...] As a result of the introduction of steel cans into the market, a growing portion of Fort Pitt sales had increased. [...] Fort Pitt played an increasingly larger role through point of sales signs in bars, supermarkets and liquor stores, outer billboards, newspapers, and eventually commercials on radio and television. In fact, the 1935 US Open Golf Championship held at Pittsburgh’s Oakmont Country Club, Fort Pitt printed the <b>admission</b> <b>cards</b> including its logo on each ticket.|$|R

40|$|Treatment {{following}} salicylate ingestion {{is determined}} by clinical evidence of toxicity. Previous {{studies have shown that}} routine measurement of plasma salicylate concentrations in all overdose patients is unnecessary except in those with clinical features suggestive of salicylate poisoning or in those who are unable to give an accurate history [1]. This retrospective study evaluates whether plasma salicylate concentrations are appropriately measured. A retrospective study of all plasma salicylate concentrations measured in St Thomas’ Hospital Accident and Emergency department from 1 February 2001 to 31 January 2002 was conducted. <b>Admission</b> record <b>cards</b> were surveyed for history of salicylate ingestion, clinical features suggestive of a toxic salicylate concentration requiring treatment and the diagnosis recorded. Details of the salicylate overdose, concentrations and treatments were recorded. Of the 737 patients who had plasma salicylate concentrations measured, notes were available for review for 612 (82. 7 %) of patients. Sixteen records were excluded as salicylate concentrations had been measured inappropriately. 52. 3 % of patients were male. Fifty (6. 8 %) patients had a detectable salicylate concentration; three of these patients did not have notes available for review...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobility}} of labor seldom if ever matches that of capital, {{but the end}} of the cold war seemed for a time to be the start of a new era of accelerated population movements. Just as foreign investment and trade restrictions were being widely dismantled, so were many national barriers to intercountry migrants. The most dramatic case was, of course, the opening of Eastern Europe's borders to permit massive out-migration. From 1989 to 1992, over 2. 1 million applied for asylum in the West. Concurrently, the European Union moved toward relaxation of internal border checks under the Schengen Accord. And in the United States, new 1990 entry criteria raised considerably the official ceiling on legal green <b>card</b> <b>admissions.</b> However, by the mid-nineties, all Western European countries had moved to sharply curtail inmigration from non-EU nations, and full implementation of Schengen was being delayed by several countries worried about weak external border controls in poorer member states. Likewise, in the U. S., the 1990 legislation was targeted for early reversal by new restrictive bills passing quickly through the Republican Congress, with considerable bipartisan support. This sharp reversal of policy, both here and abroad, reflects in part the emergence of highly nationalistic and ethnocentric political forces opposed on principle to sizable foreign-bor...|$|R
