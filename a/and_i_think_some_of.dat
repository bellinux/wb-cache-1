According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the guys got a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat.

5000|$|In retrospect, I {{think the}} little touches Bowie {{put on the}} mix helped <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the things MainMan did helped, and more than {{anything}} else, what the whole experience did was {{to get me out}} of Detroit and onto a world stage. And also I learned a helluva lot being over there in England and I started thinking differently. It led to a very ambitious piece of work, and that's fine. But the fact was that neither Bowie's mix nor my previous mix could do justice to the power of the band or even to the legibility of the vocal ... I feel that now I have the , the position, and the expertise at my disposal to give this thing its due sonically, and I didn't have that before. So it's kind of like I'm finishing that off. I don't think you can beat David's mix, it's very creative. But this is just a simple, straight band mix of a powerful band. I feel like there's a closure on it and that's a nice thing.|$|E

5000|$|As at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Pittman-Rawlinson was {{a member}} of Australia's gold medal-winning 4 × 400 m relay team (with Tamsyn Lewis, Caitlin Willis and Rosemary Hayward). However, the 2006 Aussie team was awarded the gold medal after the {{disqualification}} of the England team for a baton-change violation. Pittman later wrote a letter of apology to the English team and offered her gold medal to them. She blamed the disqualification on Lewis who, alongside Pittman, went up to the officials after the race to point out the violation of Englishwoman Natasha Danvers-Smith of taking an incorrect position on the starting leg. According to the ABC Sports Desk the officials were moving to disqualify England anyway. England head coach, Brad McStravick, {{in an interview with the}} ABC TV program Offsiders, questioned Pittman's motivation for writing the letter: [...] "I know she is going to spend, well, at least half the year in England <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the girls wondered whether it was just to try and make peace, so that she wouldn't face any animosity once she was living and training in England," [...] he said.|$|E
5000|$|Pearce {{felt the}} need [...] "to make songs with an end, if not a chorus," [...] and in an interview, he commented that he was [...] "quite pleased with Mirror. Im not so embarrassed about the singing. However {{abstract}} it is, they’re still meant to be songs. In the past, they weren’t very song-y, and this time I did really want {{for them to be}} songs." [...] Unlike New Lands, which Pearce has expressed dissatisfaction with, Pearce said that, with Mirror, he [...] "had the title before any of it. In a way, that effected the kind of stuff recorded for it." [...] He elaborated on his songwriting: [...] "Yeah, the idea was to be more direct, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> it is. I felt like my singing was better so we turned it up a bit. Also, I wanted to try to do something with the lyric side of it and be more direct. Still, I don’t know that I have anything to say, and if I do, it probably comes through more in the music. Most of my opinions on things aren’t really the kind of things I’d want to put into songs. Like, “I hate government.” Well, if I put that into a song, it would just sound embarrassing. You have to be a really good lyricist to tackle a subject like that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Having {{gone through}} November unbeaten, Birmingham began December without Shinnie, {{who had an}} ankle problem, and gave Lee Clark's new club, Blackpool, only their second win of the season. Rowett {{suggested}} that [...] "a lot of players were playing against their old manager <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them expended a lot of nervous energy in getting up for the game and I don't think that helped them." [...] In contrast, Gray produced a first-half hat-trick at home to Reading, who were three points above them in the table. Rowett praised his [...] "clinical" [...] finishing and his positive response to teasing about his lack of goals. Caddis's powerful shot from Grounds' free kick opened the scoring, Shinnie added a fifth immediately after the interval with a low shot after a dribble from the right, and Cotterill's free kick from wide left that evaded everybody completed a 6-1 win. Nikola Žigić, who had re-signed for the club the previous week for {{a small fraction of}} his former salary, was a late substitute. A 1-0 win away to Huddersfield Town courtesy of another Cotterill free kick and some desperate stoppage-time defending preceded an [...] "uninspiring" [...] performance in a 4-0 reverse at home to fifth-placed Derby County in heavy Boxing-Day snow. Two days later, a 10-minute spell just before half-time containing two Cotterill free kicks, one touched in by Donaldson, and a defensive mistake gave Birmingham a three-goal lead, effectively securing their double over Nottingham Forest and taking them into the new year 11 points clear of the relegation places.|$|E
