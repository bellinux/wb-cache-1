40|$|We {{propose a}} {{realization}} of the electric-field-induced antiferromagnetic resonance. We consider three-dimensional antiferromagnetic insulators with spin-orbit coupling characterized by {{the existence of a}} topological term called the θ term. By solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation {{in the presence of the}} θ term, we show that, in contrast to conventional methods using ac magnetic fields, the antiferromagnetic resonance state is realized by ac electric fields along with static magnetic fields. This mechanism can be understood as the inverse process of the dynamical chiral magnetic effect, an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> by magnetic fields. In other words, we propose a way to electrically induce the dynamical axion field in condensed matter. We discuss a possible experiment to observe our proposal, which utilizes the spin pumping from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a heavy metal contact. Comment: 7 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Power {{transformers}} {{are inevitable}} components in <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation,</b> transmission, distribution and utilization systems. Lifespan {{and performance of}} power transformer are dependent on cooling system employed for dissipation of heat generated during its operation. In this paper numerical simulation of an oil natural air natural power transformer radiator was performed to determine its cooling capacity. In addition, optimum spacing between sections and optimum length of sections of radiator were also determined. An optimised radiator design was proposed and was simulated to determine its cooling capacity. The proposed radiator design was found to 14 % more efficient than existing design in terms of cooling capacity for same material cost. The control volume method {{has been used to}} resolve the continuity, the momentum and the energy equations in steady state...|$|R
40|$|We {{search for}} {{dynamical}} magnetoelectric phenomena in three-dimensional correlated systems with spin-orbit coupling. We {{focus on the}} antiferromagnetic insulator phases where the dynamical axion field is realized by the fluctuation of the antiferromagnetic order parameter. It is shown that the dynamical chiral magnetic effect, an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> by magnetic fields, emerges due to the time dependences of the order parameter such as antiferromagnetic resonance. It is also shown that the anomalous Hall effect arises due to the spatial variations of the order parameter such as antiferromagnetic domain walls. Our study indicates that spin excitations in antiferromagnetic insulators with spin-orbit coupling can result in nontrivial charge responses. Moreover, observing the chiral magnetic effect and anomalous Hall effect in our system is equivalent to detecting the dynamical axion field in condensed matter. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Navy has {{developed}} in their ships, and is continually improving, electric propulsion, ship service power, and electric loads. The latest topology under design is the integrated power system (IPS). The IPS entails the all electric ship concept with electric propulsion, direct current (DC) distribution, and modular technology. In the all electric ship concept, ship propulsion and ship service loads are powered by <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC) <b>generation.</b> For the IPS, power electronics conversion {{is to be}} utilized to convert <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC) <b>generation</b> to direct <b>current</b> (DC) distribution. As state-of-the-art power electronics, the Navy plans to use power electronic building blocks (PEBB) technology in its IPS. A U. S. naval shipboard power system is required to be a highly reconfigurable system to enhance its survivability and reliability. Reconfiguration {{is a change in}} the shipboard power system state for various reasons such as new topology, changing missions and emergencies. It was decided to study the behavior of a PEBB-based integrated shipboard power system during reconfiguration. Since no real time operation data was available, the problem was studied through the simulation of reconfiguration scenarios on a scaled-down computer model of an IPS in MATLAB. Reconfiguration scenarios were determined and staged, and an AC/DC power system stability assessment methodology was applied by decoupling the IPS test system around an intrazonal bus. The coupled system of the test IPS, consisted of two dynamic 4160 VAC generators, two rectifiers, two DC-DC converters between the rectifiers' output looped bus and the downstream intrazonal 775 V busses, inverters, buck converters, AC loads and DC loads. There was modeling of excitation perturbations which introduced errors in the assessment of the stability requiring an approximation analysis. The study found that the DC bus of interest was stable for all nine reconfiguration scenarios staged, but it found that other busses were not stable for two of the scenarios. The study further found that lower stability margins occurred at lower frequencies of about 1 Hz for stable scenarios. It concluded that there were tangible benefits to advancing the shipboard power system architecture to the IPS topology because of the good stability results...|$|R
40|$|About 30 % of all {{primary energy}} {{resources}} worldwide {{are used to}} generate electrical energy. Since {{the invention of the}} electric incandescent light bulb in 1879, the growth of electric power systems progressed at an exponential rate, particularly after the development of AC (<b>alternating</b> <b>current)</b> power <b>generation</b> and the transformer. Transforming AC power from one voltage level to much higher levels meant that losses and voltage drops in the supply lines could be kept at acceptable values. The contribution of different renewable energy sources to the electricity generation mix varies from one country to another, but generally this is currently a small proportion of the total installed capacity. The increase in renewable energy generation involves significant challenges in establishing cost-effective and reliable renewable energy systems in addition to solving the technical problems associated with their connection to the grid. In order to understand the impact of increased connection of RES on the grid and the need for smart grid solutions, it is important first to understand how electricity is currently generated, the characteristics of generation from RES, and some aspects of grid control...|$|R
50|$|The Richmond Power Station was {{completed}} in 1891 by the New Australian Lighting and Traction Company. It {{was one of the}} first <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC) electricity <b>generation</b> plants in Victoria. The building was designed by Charles D'Ebro, one of Melbourne's premier architects of the time. Initially the station provided power to Melbourne and the suburbs of Richmond, Prahran and South Melbourne. The main competitor was A U Alcock's Electric Light and Motive Power Company. Early equipment was a 750KW Elwell-Parker alternator. Power was supplied at 2kv and 97HZ. The set was driven by a Robey compound steam engine rated at 200HP. In 1899 these two companies were taken over by Brush Electrical and were combined to form the Electric Lighting and Traction Company of Australia. In 1901, 2 Brush-Universal 500KW sets were added.|$|R

5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct <b>current</b> (DC) or <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|R
