5000|$|In 1772, John Whitehurst of Cheshire, United Kingdom, {{invented a}} {{manually}} controlled precursor of the hydraulic ram called the [...] "pulsation engine" [...] and installed {{the first one}} at Oulton, Cheshire to raise water to a height of 4.9 m. In 1783, he installed another in Ireland. He did not patent it, and details are obscure, but it {{is known to have}} had an <b>air</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>vessels</b> work in {{much the}} same way as water towers, but are pressurized. They {{typically}} have an air cushion above the fluid level in the vessel, which may be regulated or separated by a bladder. Sizes of <b>air</b> <b>vessels</b> may be up to hundreds of cubic meters on large pipelines. They come in many shapes, sizes and configurations. Such vessels often are called accumulators or expansion tanks.|$|R
500|$|The flying aerial-craft {{airships}} {{were not}} just working models that went a few feet along a track, but flying machines driven by real people. [...] They could ascend, turn and dive. These inventions and innovations of Myers consisted not just of <b>air</b> <b>vessels,</b> but also of scientific application balloons and specialty ordered curiosity balloons contrived of by other inventors. Some even gave the impression they were from the future or another world of advanced people.|$|R
50|$|In 1944 {{the ship}} was re-commissioned for service in the Far East. While at Alexandria an {{exploding}} <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> occurred {{in one of the}} torpedoes in the port tubes which caused severe damage and one casualty. The repairs delayed her arrival in the Far East for service with the British Pacific Fleet (BPF). Newfoundland went to New Guinea to support the Australian 6th Division in the Aitape-Wewak campaign. On 14 June 1945, as part of a BPF task group, Newfoundland attacked the Japanese naval base at Truk, in the Caroline Islands during Operation Inmate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{water was}} drawn from the main culvert feeding the wheel {{by means of a}} {{vertical}} oak penstock, through a 4 in diameter cast iron pipe, and delivered through a 3 in diameter cast iron pipe to the reservoirs at Petworth. At a later date, a compressed <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> was installed in the delivery line to reduce pressure fluctuations. Between the pump and Petworth, {{there were a number of}} non-return valves. At its peak, the pump could deliver water at the rate of 20000 imp gal per day, or [...] "a hogshead a minute".|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{dangerous}} goods are often indicated by diamond-shaped signage on the item (see NFPA 704), its container, or {{the building where}} it is stored. The color of each diamond indicates its hazard, e.g., flammable is indicated with red, because fire and heat are generally of red color, and explosive is indicated with orange, because mixing red (flammable) with yellow (oxidizing agent) creates orange. A nonflammable or nontoxic gas is indicated with green, because all compressed <b>air</b> <b>vessels</b> are this color in France after World War II, and France was where the diamond system of hazmat identification originated.|$|R
50|$|Richard Newsham (died 1743) was an English inventor. He {{took out}} 2 patents for fire engines in 1721 and 1725 (Royal Patent Office 1721 patent #439 and 1725 patent #479) and soon {{dominated}} the fire engine market in England. The engine had two single-acting pistons and an <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> {{placed in a}} tank which formed {{the frame of the}} machine. The pump was worked by people at the long cross handles. At the front of the engine, protected by a sheet of horn and a door, were directions for keeping the machine in order. The cistern could hold about 170 gal of water pumping up to 100 gal a minute. New York City imported its first two fire engines from Newsham in 1731. In 1737 Newsham made a manual fire pump for the Parish of Bray in Berkshire.|$|E
50|$|The forward end of {{the forward}} section {{contains}} the air vessels, there are four in this section, one Type 93 torpedo <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> flanked either side by 2 small trim tanks on the keel and three smaller vessels directly above it. The vessels are held in place simply with wood packing. The smaller air vessels are a proprietary design that took some heavy research to perfect. They are sealed by {{the pressure of the}} gas, as the pressure rises, a slackly threaded cap presses up against a sealing ring which is screwed down with another cap, thus making an airtight seal. Directly aft of the air vessels is the fuel tank which is ringed by the main forward trim tanks. The fuel tank is lightly constructed and contains baffles to prevent sloshing. Just behind this are the 4 steering air bottles.|$|E
5000|$|Hodge {{was born}} on 15 July 1808, at St. Austell in Cornwall, south west England. He emigrated to the United States around 1836 and {{initially}} worked as a draftsman for the locomotive builder Thomas Rogers in Paterson, New Jersey. Under the sponsorship of an insurance company, in 1840-1841, Hodge designed and built the first fire engine in the United States that was steam powered. It {{was also the first}} self-propelled fire engine; the engine used a dog clutch on the rear axle for movement, navigation, and steering. It could throw a jet of water of 290 tons per hour (about 20 usgal L per second) [...] high. The horizontal cylinders lined up with the pump cylinders and worked with a pair of driving wheels. At the front axle, ahead of the smoke-box, was an <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> that activated a bell. In 1896 the fire engine was reported to have weighed around 7 or 8 tons, and was [...] long. The large back wheels of the fire engine were lifted off the ground by a built-in jackscrew when pumping water for use on a fire, whereupon they served as flywheels for the engine as it pumped.|$|E

40|$|Background: According to {{observations}} by {{occupational health}} physicians, nearly 50 % of the seamen on German vessels will get {{diseases of the}} upper respiratory tract. An impact of the air-conditioning systems on these diseases has been suggested. Objectives: To examine the hygienic quality of indoor <b>air</b> on seagoing <b>vessels,</b> a pilot study was initiated by the See-Berufsgenossenschaft. Methods: Air samples were taken on-site at different sampling sites and analysed for the occurrence of microorganisms. Results: Bacteria showed the highest cell numbers and the highest distribution in indoor <b>air</b> on <b>vessels,</b> whereby the maximum level was determined in the air of crew cabins. The identification of bacteria showed that beside common airborne species, pathogens existed.

5000|$|The {{first use}} of the air-ship was in the rescuing of Natasha in the March 1904, arrested by Russian {{government}} about the time Ariel was built. On their flight towards the designated town in Russia where they will attempt to rescue Natasha, the [...] "Terrorists" [...] - as everyone called {{the members of this}} secret order - decided to show the world the destructive power of the air-ship. The strongest European fortress, Kronstadt, situated on the island in the Finnish Gulf, was picked as an example of what the Terrorists can now achieve. Within several minutes, the fortress was brought to ruin, with weapons fired from the Ariel, of the devastating power that no army has yet seen. Through the use of such a vessel and the innumerable agents the Brotherhood had all around the Western world, in all professions, the Terrorists managed to rescue Natasha before the convoy of political prisoners reached Siberia. The news of the mysterious <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> and its power traveled all over the Western world, causing fear and panic in the ranks of both common people and the upper classes.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Riggin had her {{built for}} his oyster {{dredging}} fleet and named her after his sons, Jacob and Edward. They all captained her {{at one time}} or another on the Delaware Bay. She was always known as a quick, light <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> and her speed was proven in 1929 when she handily won the only official Oyster Dredging Race in the Delaware Bay. She was used for oyster-dredging until the 1940s, when the fishing regulations changed. The Riggin family sold her and she was converted to power to begin fishing for groundfish and mackerel in Cape Cod and Long Island Sound. In the early 1970s she was bought by Dave and Sue Allen and converted from a fishing vessel to a passenger carrying vessel which is what she remains. Her engine was removed and cabins added below to create space for guests. [...] She is part of the Maine Windjammer fleet, carrying vacationers on 3-, 4- and 6-day sailing trips in Penobscot Bay, Maine. Her homeport is Rockland, Maine and her sailing grounds range from Boothbay Harbor, Maine to Bar Harbor, Maine. Much of her deck, underwater planking and frames are original. She is currently owned by Jon Finger and Anne Mahle.|$|E

In circumstances of the greatest danger he was always first at hand to deal with emergencies, whether in fire fighting operations or in rescue work. The following are examples of his promptitude and gallantry: -* Rendered safe the torpedo of a burning torpedo aircraft, working 3 feet from the main petrol tank for ten minutes.* Extinguished a burning aircraft during a heavy bombing attack. Attempted to save a burning aircraft and subsequently removed torpedoes from the vicinity. Assisted in saving the pilot of a burning aircraft and extinguishing the fire. Saved an aircraft from destruction by fire.* Attempted for six hours to extricate airmen from a bombed shelter, despite continued heavy bombing and danger from falling stone-work. Fought fires in two aircraft, his efforts resulting in the saving of one. Freed the parachute of a burning flare caught in an aircraft, enabling the pilot to taxi clear. Checked the fire in a burning aircraft, {{the greater part of}} which was undamaged.* The last three incidents occurred on the same day. Leading Aircraftman Osborne was unfortunately killed on 2nd April, 1942. During an intense, air attack he led a party to extinguish the flames of a burning aircraft. A petrol tank exploded and he was injured and affected by the fumes. On recovery, he. returned to fight the fire and was killed by the explosion of an <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> while attempting to pour water over torpedoes which were in danger of exploding.* This airman's fearless courage and great leadership on all occasions have been beyond praise.

40|$|The Shuweihat Water Transmission Scheme (SWTS, UAE) {{consists}} of a twin DN 1600 DI PN 25 pipeline transmitting 150 MIGD over 250 km from Shuweihat Desalination plant to Mussafah (Abu Dhabi city). The Scheme is divided in two subsequent systems, each with a tank farm and a pump station delivering water to downstream terminal reservoirs and direct consumers. The first system (Lot A) transmits water from Shuweihat to Mirfa (100 km). The second (Lot C) is from Mirfa to Mussafah (150 km). The pipeline follows roughly the UAE coastline and the profile is generally flat with a few local high points. The surge study of the Lot C system investigated {{a large number of}} scenarios and resulted in the design of surge protection equipments and control systems. The surge protection equipment {{consists of}} 16 x 121 m 3 (1936 m 3) innovative vertical non-vented air vessels, invented by Deltares. The innovation includes a passive air release valve at a strategic elevation on the <b>air</b> <b>vessel.</b> This air release valve opens if the water level drops below the float level. At this water level the air pressure is super-atmospheric so that air is released from the <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> to prevent draining. This innovation was driven by the initial findings of the surge analysis where it became apparent that 22 x 220 m 3 (4840 m 3) air vessels would have been required. These large vessels were the result of a double constraint. On the one hand, the initial air mass had to be sufficient to allow a proper expansion of the vessels and thus the protection of the pipeline against excessive negative pressures. On the other hand, a very small initial air mass was required {{due to the lack of}} backpressure. This meant that the air pocket was expanding by a factor exceeding 20, resulting in the emptying of the vessels. In this paper, we will describe the hydraulic model of the hybrid <b>air</b> <b>vessel,</b> detail the benefits of the new design and discuss the cost savings compared to conventional air vessels. It is concluded that the hybrid <b>air</b> <b>vessel</b> has saved over 50 % of the required air vessels total volume. Considering the size of air vessels initially required, the costs savings in terms of surge protection of the SWTS Lot C system were cut in excess of 60 %.
