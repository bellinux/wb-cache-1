40|$|<b>Anthropogenic</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emissions</b> of CO 2 are {{responsible}} for simultaneous ocean warming (OW) and ocean acidification (OA). These global events can have important impacts on marine fleshy macroalgae and coastal ecosystems. To understand the effects of OW and OA on the early life history stages of native (Macrocystis pyrifera) and invasive (Undaria pinnatifida) macroalgae, a multi-factorial experiment was performed to determine the independent and interactive effects of the drivers and the corresponding species-specific responses. Meiospores of M. pyrifera and U. pinnatifida were separately exposed to a 4 * 2 factorial design of seawater pH (pHT 7. 20, extreme OA predicted for 2300; pHT 7. 65, OA predicted for 2100; pHT 8. 03, ambient pH; and pHT 8. 40, pre-industrial pH) and temperature (12 °C, seasonal average temperature; and 16 °C, OW predicted for 2100). Over 15 days, different physiological parameters (i. e. meiospore germination, germling growth rate, gametophyte development and sex ratio) were measured. Reduced seawater pH and elevated temperature had independent and significant effects on developmental processes (germling growth rate, and male and female gametophyte sizes were independently greater under OA and OW conditions), but {{the interaction of the}} abiotic factors had no effect on any stage of meiospore development of either species. Despite some small differences between species (e. g. sex ratio), results of this experiment suggest that microscopic stages of the native M. pyrifera and the invasive U. pinnatifida will respond similarly to OA and OW...|$|E
40|$|<b>Anthropogenic</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emissions</b> {{of typical}} toxic heavy metals have caused {{worldwide}} concern {{due to their}} adverse effects on {{human health and the}} ecosystem. By determining the best available representation of time-varying emission factors with S-shape curves, we establish the multiyear comprehensive atmospheric emission inventories of 12 typical toxic heavy metals (Hg, As, Se, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Sb, Mn, Co, Cu, and Zn) from primary anthropogenic activities in China for the period of 1949 – 2012 for the first time. Further, we allocate the annual emissions of these heavy metals in 2010 at a high spatial resolution of 0. 5 ° × 0. 5 ° grid with ArcGIS methodology and surrogate indexes, such as regional population and gross domestic product (GDP). Our results show that the historical emissions of Hg, As, Se, Cd, Cr, Ni, Sb, Mn, Co, Cu, and Zn, during the period of 1949 – 2012, increased by about 22 – 128 times at an annual average growth rate of 5. 1 – 8. 0 %, reaching about 526. 9 – 22 319. 6 t in 2012. Nonferrous metal smelting, coal combustion of industrial boilers, brake and tyre wear, and ferrous metal smelting represent the dominant sources of heavy metal emissions. In terms of spatial variation, the majority of emissions are concentrated in relatively developed regions, especially for the northern, eastern, and southern coastal regions. In addition, because of the flourishing nonferrous metal smelting industry, several southwestern and central-southern provinces play a prominent role in some specific toxic heavy metals emissions, like Hg in Guizhou and As in Yunnan. Finally, integrated countermeasures are proposed to minimize the final toxic heavy metals discharge on account of the current and future demand of energy-saving and pollution reduction in China...|$|E

40|$|Coal {{combustion}} is {{the primary}} <b>anthropogenic</b> source of <b>atmospheric</b> iodine, which has important environmental and health effects. The iodine distribution in Chinese coals and the <b>atmospheric</b> iodine <b>emission</b> factors of coal-fired boilers are studied to estimate the iodine atmospheric flux from coal combustion in China from 1995 to 2009. The national average iodine content weighted by coal yield fluctuated from 2. 61 mg kg(- 1) in 1995 to 2. 09 mg kg(- 1) in 2009, recording an annual decline of 1. 42 %.

40|$|The natural {{nitrogen}} cycle is significantly perturbed by <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emissions</b> of reactive nitrogen compounds resulting from our {{production of energy}} and food. Ammonia (NH 3) {{is one of the}} largest contributors to reactive nitrogen and the principal alkaline component in our atmosphere. In the last century global ammonia emissions have doubled and are expected to further increase in the coming decades, with huge implications on Earth's environment, climate and human health. In the atmosphere 109 NH 3 rapidly forms aerosols and is therefore a species of high relevance for air quality. In Europe, it is expected to become the single most important contributor of tropospheric aerosol by 2020. As a short-lived species, ammonia is highly variable in time and space, and while ground based measurements are possible, they are sparse and not representative for larger scales. Consequently, the ammonia budget is poorly understood and accounts for the largest uncertainty in the global {{nitrogen cycle}}. The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), an infrared sounder onboard the MetOp platform, has demonstrated its capabilities for probing atmospheric ammonia, down to the boundary layer. We recently developed an Optimal Estimation Method on Spectral Ensemble (OEMSE) to obtain global distributions of NH 3 total columns with much improved sensitivity than in previous studies, and which also allows assessing retrievals errors. This new method and daily-based global ammonia products will be presented. Comparisons with ground-based in situ measurements and model data will be provided as a first validation of the product. Based on the results, we will further assess the capabilities of IASI to monitor local sources (in terms of seasonal and inter annual variations) and transport, and to contribute, by also using model simulations, in refining emission inventories. Finally we will provide the first results of an empirical analysis of NH 3 volatilization, performed by correlating the retrieved total columns to soil parameters (temperature, soil pH, relative humidity, [...] .) and anthropological activity indicators (livestock density, intensity of fertilization, population density, [...] .) ...|$|E
40|$|Geological {{storage is}} one of the most {{promising}} technologies for reducing <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emissions</b> of CO 2. Among the several CO 2 storage techniques, sequestration in deep-seated saline aquifers implies four processes: a) supercritical fluid into geologic structure (physical trapping), b) dissolved CO 2 (aq) due to very long flow path (hydrodynamic trapping), c) dissolved CO 2 (aq) (solubility trapping), and d) secondary carbonates (mineral trapping). The appealing concept that CO 2 can permanently be retained underground has prompted several experimental studies in Europe and North America sponsored by IEA GHG R&D, EU and numerous international industrials and governments, the most important project being the International Energy Agency Weyburn CO 2 Monitoring & Storage, an EnCana’s CO 2 injection EOR project at Weyburn (Saskatchewan, Canada). Owing to the possible risks associated to this technique, numerical modelling procedures of geochemical processes are necessary to investigate the short- to long-term consequences of CO 2 storage. Assumptions and gap-acceptance are made to reconstruct the reservoir conditions (pressure, pH, chemistry, and mineral assemblage), although most strategic geochemical parameters of deep fluids are computed by a posteriori procedure due to the sampling collection at the wellhead, i. e. using depressurised aliquots. In this work a new approach to geochemical model capable of to reconstruct the reservoir chemical composition (T, P, boundary conditions and pH) is proposed using surface analytical data to simulate the short-medium term reservoir evolution during and after the CO 2 injection. The PRHEEQC (V 2. 11) Software Package via thermodynamic corrections to the code default database has been used to obtain a more realistic modelling. The main modifications brought about the Software Package are: i) addition of new solid phases, ii) use of P> 0. 1 Mpa, iii) variation of the CO 2 supercritical fugacity and solubility under reservoir conditions, iv) addition of kinetic rate equations of several minerals and v) calculation of reaction surface area. The Weyburn Project was selected as case study to test our model. The Weyburn oil-pull is recovered from the Midale Beds (1300 - 1500 m deep) that consist of two units of Mississippian shallow marine carbonate-evaporites: i) the dolomitic “Marly” and ii) the underlying calcitic “Vuggy”, sealed by an anhydrite cap-rock. About 3 billions mc of supercritical CO 2 have been injected into the “Phase A 1 ” injection area. The INGV and the University of Calgary (Canada), have carried out a geochemical monitoring program (ca. thrice yearly- from pre-injection trip: “Baseline” trip, August 2000, to September 2004). The merged experimental data are the base of the present geochemical modeling. On the basis of the available data, i. e. a) bulk mineralogy of the Marly and Vuggy reservoirs; b) mean gas-cap composition at the wellheads and c) selected pre- and post-CO 2 injection water samples, the in-situ (62 °C and 0. 1 MPa) reservoir chemical composition (including pH and the boundary conditions as PCO 2, PH 2 S) has been re-built by the chemical equilibrium among the various phases, minimizing the effects of the past 30 -years of water flooding in the oil field. The kinetic evolution of the CO 2 -rich Weyburn brines interacting with the host-rock minerals performed over 100 years after injection have also been computed. The reaction path modeling suggests that CO 2 can mainly be neutralized by solubility and mineral trapping via Dawsonite precipitation. To validate our model the geochemical impact of three years of CO 2 injection (September 2000 - 2003) has been simulated by kinetically controlled reactions. The calculated chemical composition after the CO 2 injection is consistent with the analytical data of samples collected in 2003 with a 90 %), likely due to the complexation effect of carboxilic acid...|$|E

The main weather conditions are analysed using local meteorological variables, meteorological soundings, synoptic maps, as well as back trajectories of the air masses using the HYSPLIT model and high spatial resolution of meteorological fields. Measurements of the main meteorological parameters were collected both {{on the surface and}} on a tall tower. A detailed land use analysis was performed on a 80 km scale showing the main vegetation types. Also the main <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> sources both industrial-urban from Huelva and from the urban Seville area are shown. A study to identify air mass origins and their variation with height was carried out. In this intensive campaign air masses coming from different areas with different emission sources were observed: from the NW, with a highly industrial-urban character; continental flows from northerly directions; from the NE, with pathway, first, over the Seville metropolitan area and, then, over the Doñana National Park; and maritime air masses coming from the Atlantic Ocean. To study the chemistry in the four atmospheric scenarios identified, gas phase measurements of primary and secondary species such as ozone, NO, NO 2 and SO 2, biogenic and anthropogenic VOCs like benzene and isoprene, as well as total particles concentration and chemical composition of the aerosols are compared and discussed. The highest levels for total particle concentration, NO, NO 2, SO 2, benzene, PM 10, PM 2. 5 and chemical elements such as As or Cu were found under flows associated with industrial-urban emissions from the Huelva-Portugal sector which are transported to the site before significant removal by chemical or deposition mechanism can occur. The air masses from the north were affected mainly by crustal elements and biogenic sources, the latter being exemplified by the biogenic species such as isoprene, particularly {{in the first part of}} the campaign. The urban air from the Seville area, before arriving at El Arenosillo traverses the Doñana National Park and therefore, was affected by industrial-urban and biogenic emissions. This air can transport low levels of NO x, total particle concentration and SO 2 with aged ozone and some isoprene. Marine air masses from the Atlantic Ocean influence El Arenosillo frequently.

Combined with unprecedented meta-analysis, this paper applies emission factor method to examine Hg emissions in 1995, 2003, 2011 and projection to 2015. Hg {{emissions from}} CFPPs were estimated to rise from 13. 28 ton to 23. 61 [...] 36. 67 ton with an increase rate of 77. 8 % to 176. 3 %, while coal con-sumption increased by 325. 5 %. The emissions of Hg 0, Hg 2 + and HgP are estimated to reach 11. 80 [...] 18. 34 ton, 9. 45 [...] 14. 66 ton and 2. 36 [...] 3. 67 ton, respectively. Low increase of Hg emissions benefits from the wide application of APCDs, especially the sound operation of denitrification devices. However, there are uncertainties in the estimation of Hg emission due to variation of parameters in the method, and Hg content was proved to be the predominant parameter that results in the uncertainties. The paper addresses the effect of denitrification devices and their operation rate on Hg removal, and reduces the uncertainties of Hg emissions through comprehensive emission factors.

40|$|Owing to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions,</b> <b>atmospheric</b> {{concentrations}} {{of carbon dioxide}} could almost double between 2006 and 2100 according to business-as-usual carbon dioxide emission scenarios. Because the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will lead to increasing dissolved inorganic carbon and carbon dioxide in surface ocean waters, and hence acidification and lower carbonate saturation states. As a consequence, {{it has been suggested}} that marine calcifying organisms, for example corals, coralline algae, molluscs and foraminifera, will have difficulties producing their skeletons and shells at current rates, with potentially severe implications for marine ecosystems, including coral reefs. Here we report a seven-week experiment exploring the effects of ocean acidification on crustose coralline algae, a cosmopolitan group of calcifying algae that is ecologically important in most shallowwater habitats. Six outdoor mesocosms were continuously supplied with sea water from the adjacent reef and manipulated to simulate conditions of either ambient or elevated seawater carbon dioxide concentrations. The recruitment rate and growth of crustose coralline algae were severely inhibited in the elevated carbon dioxide mesocosms.

Measurements of Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn concentrations were performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) on dated fractions of a sediment core, dated by the 210 Pbex method. They are found to cover a time period from 1951 to 2004. The constant sedimentation rate model was used for dating. Specific activities of 137 Cs have also been measured in the sediment core sections as a check of the time scale derived by the 210 Pbex method. A time-series analysis based on temporal decomposition was used in order to investigate the presence of heavy metal pollution trend. The additive component model, widely used to estimate seasonal and long–term behavior, was chosen for the temporal analysis. Results showed the presence of a specific heavy metal concentration trend. Residual time–autocorrelation has also been taken into account in order to investigate their stochastic properties. Concentrations of some metals (Cu, Hg, and Zn) have been found increasing until the beginning of the 1970 s. A peak around the beginning of the 1980 s has been found for Cr and Pb. Heavy metal concentration in the sediment core show a significant decreasing after these years.

40|$|In {{the east}} of China, recent haze {{pollution}} has been severe and damaging. In addition to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions,</b> <b>atmospheric</b> circulations and local meteorological conditions were conducive factors. The number of December haze days over North China and the Huanghuai area has increased sharply since 2010 and was greatest in 2016. During 2016, the most aggressive control measures for anthropogenic emissions were implemented from 16 to 21 December, but the most severe haze pollution still occurred, covering approximately 25  % of the land area of China and lasting for 6  days. The atmospheric circulations must play critical roles in the sub-seasonal haze events. Actually, the positive phase of the East Atlantic–West Russia pattern in the middle troposphere strengthened the anomalous anti-cyclone over the NH area that confined vertical motion below. The associated southerly anomalies made the cold air and surface wind speed weaker, but enhanced the humid flow. Thus, the horizontal and vertical dispersion of atmospheric particulates was suppressed and the pollutants gathered within a narrow space. In December 2016, these key indices were strongly beneficial for haze occurrence and combined to result in the severest haze pollution. The influences of the preceding autumn sea surface temperature near the Gulf of Alaska and the subtropical eastern Pacific, October–November snow cover in western Siberia, and associated physical processes on haze pollution are also discussed...|$|R

The objectives are to produce images of various <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emissions</b> to: investigate ionospheric transport processes; observe induced emissions from artificial particle injection; measure electron impact cross sections of atmospheric species; study natural aurora at high spatial and temporal resolutions and in the ultraviolet...|$|R
40|$|Infrared solar spectra and {{infrared}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> spectra {{were obtained from}} the ground, from aircraft and from balloons. The initial detection of most stratospheric molecules was achieved by the solar spectral technique because better resolution helps remove interference from other molecules. Because the sun is an intense source of radiation, the resolution which can be obtained with good signal-to-noise, is greater than with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> spectroscopy. Data are generally taken using a method that enhances the number of molecules in the optical path i. e. at large solar zenith angles for solar spectra and at low elevation angles for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>emission</b> spectra. The search for molecules which are predicted to be present but which, the detection of a molecule known to be present from other measurement techniques but observed {{for the first time in}} infrared solar spectra, and some further data on the variability of HNO 3 are discussed...|$|R
