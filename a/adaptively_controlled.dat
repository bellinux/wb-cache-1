50|$|Ultra high {{intensity}} lasers are now {{commonly used in}} several fields of physics research, including X-rays, wakefield acceleration, proton generation and ICF, with the common idea of intensely focusing a laser beam to energy densities that can reach 1022 W/cm2 on a target. To achieve such a goal, the laser beam typically passes through several amplification stages and is transported with larger and larger optical components. As a result, the beam is affected by thermal effects and optical aberrations which distort the wavefront and affect the focusing quality. This decreases light intensity on the target. Usually, both spectral and spatial phases are <b>adaptively</b> <b>controlled</b> {{in order to achieve}} the required focusing. Over the last 2 decades, adaptive optics for wavefront correction and beam shaping have been commonly used in laser facilities by means of a wavefront sensor that measures the spatial phase and a deformable mirror that corrects it. Adaptive Optics systems (AOs) are now a must have in ultra-{{high intensity}} facilities, {{with some of the most}} recent systems needing several AOs to function.. Recently Imagine Optic developed mechanical actuator based deformable mirrors to specifically address the phase correction in laser systems. Key points of this technology are the optical quality, the capacity of correction, great stability and linearity and simplified maintenance requirements.|$|E

40|$|To {{preserve}} link {{quality of}} mobile phones, under fluctuating user conditions, an <b>adaptively</b> <b>controlled</b> series-LC matching circuit is presented for multi-band and multi-mode operation. Following a bottom-up approach, {{we discuss the}} design of an RF-MEMS unit cell {{for the construction of}} a 5 -bit switched capacitor array. To reduce dielectric charging of the RF-MEMS devices their average biasing voltage is minimized by applying a bipolar waveform with a small high/low duty-cycle obtained from a high-voltage driver IC. RF-MEMS capacitive switches are applied because of their high linearity, low loss, large tuning range, and easy control in the discrete domain. Application specific RF-MEMS pull-in and pull-out voltage requirements are derived. An impedance phase detector is used to feed mismatch information to an up-down counter providing robust iterative control. The measured MEMS array capacitance tuning ratio is almost a factor 10. Module insertion loss is 0. 5 dB at low-band and high-band. Harmonic distortion is less than - 85 dBc at 35 dBm output power and the EVM, measured in EDGE-mode, is less than 1 % at 27 dBm.

30|$|Although we have {{considered}} that the transmit power {{levels of the}} cells are fixed, {{it is expected that}} the performance can be further improved if each cell’s transmission power is <b>adaptively</b> <b>controlled.</b> However, {{it is very hard to}} determine the optimal power levels of the cells to improve network PF. The reason is that increasing the power in one cell increases interference in the other and vice versa, making most of the cases a non-convex or non-concave problem. To solve this problem, we may combine the power control process with the association process and the ABS rate update process in a recursive manner. The power control process is described as follows.|$|E
