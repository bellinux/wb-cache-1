5|$|An {{example is}} the bipartite double cover, formed from a graph by {{splitting}} each vertex v into v0 and v1 <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> each edge u,v with edges u0,v1 and v0,u1. The function mapping v0 and v1 in the cover to v in the original graph is a homomorphism and a covering map.|$|E

As a result, many literary works written in Pahlavi script disappeared. During the Abbasid reign the Zoroastrians, {{for the first time}} became a minority in Iran. Nevertheless, there were instances of toleration during the Abbasid era, particularly under the reign of Al-Mu'tasim who flogged an imam and muezzin for destroying a fire-temple <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> it with a mosque.|$|E
5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E

5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> mechanical brushes.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Canterbury City Council began {{a public}} {{consultation}} {{to discuss the}} regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the shopping centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> it with other tourist attractions.|$|E

5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic voters <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> them with several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties {{from the district}} and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.|$|E
