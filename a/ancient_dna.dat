5|$|The quagga was {{the first}} extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and this 1984 study {{launched}} the field of <b>ancient</b> <b>DNA</b> analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was {{more closely related to}} zebras than to horses, with the quagga and mountain zebra (Equus zebra) sharing an ancestor 3–4 million years ago. An immunological study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra. A 1987 study suggested that the mtDNA of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2% per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra.|$|E
40|$|For a long time, the {{analysis}} of <b>ancient</b> human <b>DNA</b> represented {{one of the most}} controversial disciplines in an already controversial field of research. Scepticism in this field was only matched by the long-lasting controversy over the authenticity of <b>ancient</b> pathogen <b>DNA.</b> This ambiguous view on <b>ancient</b> human <b>DNA</b> had a dichotomous root. On the one hand, the interest in <b>ancient</b> human <b>DNA</b> is great because such studies touch on the history and evolution of our own species. On the other hand, because these studies are dealing with samples from our own species, results are easily compromised by contamination of the experiments with modern human DNA, which is ubiquitous in the environment. Consequently, some of the most disputed studies published - apart maybe from early reports on million year old dinosaur or amber DNA - reported DNA analyses from human subfossil remains. However, the development of so-called next- or second-generation sequencing (SGS) in 2005 and the technological advances associated with it have generated new confidence in the genetic study of ancient human remains. The ability to sequence shorter DNA fragments than with PCR amplification coupled to traditional Sanger sequencing, along with very high sequencing throughput have both reduced the risk of sequencing modern contamination and provided tools to evaluate the authenticity of DNA sequence data. The field is now rapidly developing, providing unprecedented insights into the evolution of our own species and past human population dynamics as well as the evolution and history of human pathogens and epidemics. Here, we review how recent technological improvements have rapidly transformed <b>ancient</b> human <b>DNA</b> research from a highly controversial subject to a central component of modern anthropological research. We also discuss potential future directions of <b>ancient</b> human <b>DNA</b> research. © 2015 Knapp et al. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ancient</b> human <b>DNA</b> {{has been}} treated {{cautiously}} ever since the problems related {{to this type of}} material were exposed in the early 1990 s, but as sequential genetic data from ancient specimens have been key components in several evolutionary and ecological studies, interest in <b>ancient</b> human <b>DNA</b> is on the increase again. It is especially tempting to approach archaeological and anthropological questions through this type of material, but <b>DNA</b> from <b>ancient</b> human tissue is notoriously complicated to work with due to the risk of contamination with modern human DNA. Various ways of authenticating results based on <b>ancient</b> human <b>DNA</b> have been developed to circumvent the problems. One commonly used method is to predict what the contamination is expected to look like and then test whether the <b>ancient</b> human <b>DNA</b> fulfils this prediction. If it does, the results are rejected as contamination, while if it does not, they are often considered authentic. We show here that human contamination in ancient material may well deviate from local allele frequencies or the distributions to be found among the laboratory workers and archaeologists. We conclude that it is not reliable to authenticate <b>ancient</b> human <b>DNA</b> solely by showing that it is different from what would be expected from people who have handled the material.

40|$|Analysis of <b>ancient</b> {{microorganism}} <b>DNA</b> {{represents one}} of the newest and most promising branches of molecular archaeology. In particular, microbial DNA associated with human remains can provide direct evidence of the occurrence and frequency of infectious diseases in historic times. Human mummies represent very interesting subjects for palaeomicrobiological investigations as they retain soft tissues. Initial reports on the identification of ancient bacterial pathogens in human mummies using DNA analysis date back to the early nineties and publications are steadily becoming more numerous. However, despite this favourable trend, the analysis of <b>ancient</b> microbial <b>DNA</b> is still a contentious issue. Among the difficulties in <b>ancient</b> bacterial <b>DNA</b> work, sample contamination due to aerosol in laboratories where the DNA of modern microbes is manipulated and the ubiquitous dispersal of microorganisms seem to play the most prominent roles; hence the need for authentication criteria.

40|$|Genetic {{investigations}} on eukaryotic plankton {{confirmed the}} existence of modern biogeographic patterns, but analyses of palaeoecological data exploring the temporal variability of these patterns have rarely been presented. <b>Ancient</b> sedimentary <b>DNA</b> proved suitable for investigations of past assemblage turnover {{in the course of}} environmental change, but genetic relatedness of the identified lineages has not yet been undertaken. Here, we investigate the relatedness of diatom lineages in Siberian lakes along environmental gradients (i. e. across treeline transects), over geographic distance and through time (i. e. the last 7000 years) using modern and <b>ancient</b> sedimentary <b>DNA.</b> Our results indicate that closely-related Staurosira lineages occur in similar environments and lessrelated lineages in dissimilar environments, in our case different vegetation and co-varying climatic and limnic variables across treeline transects. Thus our study reveals that environmental conditions rather than geographic distance is reflected by diatom-relatedness patterns in space and time. We tentatively speculate that the detected relatedness pattern in Staurosira across the treeline could be a result of adaptation to diverse environmental conditions across the arctic boreal treeline, however, a geographically-driven divergence and subsequent repopulation of ecologically different habitats might also be a potential explanation for the observed pattern...|$|R

40|$|SummaryModern humans (Homo sapiens) last {{shared a}} common {{ancestor}} with two types of archaic hominins, Neandertals and Denisovans, roughly 800, 000 years ago, and the population leading to modern H. sapiens separated from that leading to Neandertals and Denisovans roughly 400, 000 years ago [1 – 4]. Genome sequences for {{these two types of}} archaic hominins have been reported [1, 2]. They were determined by sequencing <b>ancient</b> <b>DNAs</b> using techniques that generated many short sequence reads. Here, we analyzed individual sequence reads used to assemble the published Neandertal and Denisovan genomes for insertions of Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K) DNA. Virus–host DNA junctions were identified that defined 14 proviruses where modern humans contain the corresponding, empty, preintegration site. Thus, HERV-K reinfected germ lineage cells of Neandertals and Denisovans multiple times, and these events occurred around the time of or subsequent to the divergence of the archaic hominin lineages from that leading to modern humans. One of the proviruses was shared by Neandertals and Denisovans, which is consistent with the hypothesis that these archaic humans {{shared a common}} ancestor more recently than they shared one with the lineage leading to modern humans...|$|R
