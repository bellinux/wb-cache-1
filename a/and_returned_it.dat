5|$|Chicago {{tight end}} John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's {{bouncing}} kickoff <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> 9-yards {{to his own}} 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line.

In the fourth quarter, All-Americans tackle Youngstrom blocked a Thorpe punt <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> for a touchdown. The Sunday Chronicle named Thorpe, Henry and Lowe as the Bulldogs' stars, while Anderson, Youngstrom, and Miller were the standouts for the All-Americans.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{received}} the post-touchdown kickoff <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> to their 31-yard line, where the Tech offense took over {{on its first}} possession of the game. Tech running back Lee Suggs ran for a three-yard gain, and quarterback Bryan Randall completed a 15-yard pass to take the Hokies to near midfield, earning Virginia Tech a first down in the process. But on the third play after taking possession, the Hokies turned the ball over as Tech running back Lee Suggs fumbled the ball. Air Force recovered the turnover <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> to the Tech 35-yard line, where the Falcons offense returned to the field. Despite gaining possession of the ball deep inside Virginia Tech's side of the field, Air Force was unable to move the ball forward with much success. After a quick first down provided by a penalty against Virginia Tech, the Hokie defense stiffened and denied the Falcons another. Air Force was forced to attempt a 45-yard field goal, which Ashcroft converted with 7:36 left in the quarter to give the Falcons a 10–0.|$|E
5|$|With just a {{few seconds}} {{remaining}} in the first half, there appeared to be little chance that Nebraska would have a chance to score. But Nebraska received the kickoff at its 24-yard line <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> to the Nebraska 42. Frost attempted a long pass to get Nebraska into position for a field goal attempt, but the throw fell incomplete. Instead of trying another long pass, Nebraska proceeded to run out the clock, and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 1714 lead.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} their loss to LSU, Alabama {{traveled}} to Starkville and defeated their long-time rival, the Mississippi State Bulldogs 24–7. After {{a pair of}} missed field goals, one from 19-yard by Cade Foster and the second from 31-yards by Jeremy Shelley, Alabama scored their first {{points in the second}} quarter. Eddie Lacy capped a five-play, 52-yard drive with a two-yard touchdown run to give the Crimson Tide a 7–0 lead. Later in the quarter Derek DePasquale missed a 41-yard field goal attempt for the Bulldogs, but on the ensuing Alabama possession Cameron Lawrence intercepted an AJ McCarron pass <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> to the Alabama four-yard line. However, the Alabama defense held the Bulldogs to only a field goal attempt which was then missed from 29-yards by Brian Egan to preserve a 7–0 halftime lead for the Crimson Tide.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it out of the water <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> to the church in a festive procession.|$|E
5|$|Adamle {{attended}} Ohio State University {{and was on}} the 1942 Ohio State Buckeyes freshman team, {{but left}} school prior to the 1943 season to fight in World War II. After serving in the U.S. Air Force in the Mediterranean Theatre of War, he returned to Ohio State for the team's 1946 season—his only season with the varsity Buckeyes. Playing as a center in a November game against the Northwestern Wildcats, Adamle intercepted a Frank Aschenbrenner pass in the third quarter <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> 38 yards. He had another interception {{in the fourth quarter of}} the 39–27 Buckeyes victory. Ohio State finished the season with a 4–3–2 record and Adamle was selected to play in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League (NFL) champion and a selection of the best college players from around the country.|$|E
