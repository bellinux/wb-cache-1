5000|$|Haemoglobin gives oxygenated blood its red colour. Unlike other vertebrates, fish of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefish</b> family (Channichthyidae) {{do not use}} {{haemoglobin}} {{to transport}} oxygen around their bodies; instead, {{the small amount of}} oxygen that simply dissolves in blood plasma is utilized. In 2011 Tokyo Sea Life Park claimed that C. rastrospinosus has totally transparent blood [...] "like clear water", after dissecting a specimen. In 1954, Ruud noted that Chaenocephalus aceratus, another member of this family, had almost transparent blood, in contrast to the yellowish blood of other members. C. aceratus and C. rastrospinosus both fail to express the major adult α-globin, α1, due to the same 5' truncation of the gene, and have lost the β-globin gene entirely. Zhao et al. propose that an ancestral channichthyid fish lost expression of both genes through a single mutation. <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefish</b> also have very few erythrocytes. It is believed they benefit from loss of reliance on haemoglobin-containing erythrocytes for oxygen transport by having less viscous, more easily pumped blood. They compensate for this loss by having lower metabolic rates, larger gills, scaleless skin that can contribute more to gas exchange, wider capillaries and significantly increased blood volume and cardiac output.|$|E

For example, the Mexican tetra is an albino cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution. Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves. This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation, such as crystallins and the melanocortin 1 receptor. Similarly, comparing the genome of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefish,</b> which lacks red blood cells, to close relatives such as the Antarctic rockcod revealed genes needed to make these blood cells.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefishes</b> Channichthyidae lack {{haemoglobin}} and {{are thought}} to lack myoglobin (Mb) in their skeletal muscle as well. Due {{to the absence of}} both respiratory pigments, icefishes may present a variety of physiological adaptations in their skeletal muscles. In mammals, molecular responses to limiting oxygen availability in the skeletal muscle include, among others, the over expression of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), such as type I (neuronal nNOS) and type III (endothelial eNOS), as well as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this paper, we evaluated by western blot analysis whether the skeletal muscle of haemoglobin-less icefishes expresses in a constitutive manner higher levels of the type I and type III NOS isoforms and VEGF. Our results demonstrate that haemoglobin-less icefish of the family Channichthyidae do indeed present higher expression of the type I NOS isoform compared with red-blooded Antarctic fish species of other families of the same suborder Notothenioidei. In contrast, VEGF was not over-expressed. Moreover, we show that some icefish species, thought previously to lack Mb in oxidative muscles, actually present Mb-like immunoreactivity in their skeletal muscle. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Alone among piscine taxa, the <b>antarctic</b> <b>icefishes</b> (family Channichthyidae, {{suborder}} Notothenioidei) {{have evolved}} compensatory adaptations that maintain normal metabolic {{functions in the}} absence of erythrocytes and the respiratory oxygen transporter hemoglobin. Although the uniquely "colorless" or "white" condition of the blood of icefishes has been recognized since the early 20 th century, the status of globin genes in the icefish genomes has, surprisingly, remained unexplored. Using alpha- and beta-globin cDNAs from the antarctic rockcod Notothenia coriiceps (family Nototheniidae, suborder Notothenioidei), we have probed the genomes of three white-blooded icefishes and four red-blooded notothenioid relatives (three antarctic, one temperate) for globin-related DNA sequences. We detect specific, high-stringency hybridization of the alpha-globin probe to genomic DNAs of both white- and red-blooded species, whereas the beta-globin cDNA hybridizes only to the genomes of the red-blooded fishes. Our results suggest that icefishes retain inactive genomic remnants of alpha-globin genes but have lost, either through deletion or through rapid mutation, the gene that encodes beta-globin. We propose that the hemoglobinless phenotype of extant icefishes is the result of deletion of the single adult beta-globin locus prior to the diversification of the clade...|$|R

Within this family of fishes, which is endemic to the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, there exist 15 known species and 11 genera. To date, we have examined eight species of icefish (representing seven genera) using immunoblot analyses. Results indicate that Mb is present in heart ventricles from five of these species of icefish. Mb is absent from heart auricle and oxidative skeletal muscle of all species. We have identified a 0. 9 -kb mRNA in Mb-expressing species that hybridizes with a Mb cDNA probe from the closely related red-blooded Antarctic nototheniid fish, Notothenia coriiceps. In confirmation that the 0. 9 -kb mRNA encodes Mb, we report the full-length Mb cDNA sequence of the ocellated icefish, Chionodraco rastrospinosus. Of the eight icefish species examined, three lack Mb polypeptide in heart ventricle, although one of these expresses the Mb mRNA. All species of icefish retain the Mb gene in their genomic DNA.

40|$|Due to its {{structural}} and functional plasticity the fish heart ventricle adapts to volume and pressure hemodynamic loads by distinct chamber remodellings (Tota and Gattuso, 1996). This can be best illustrated by ranking elasmobranchs and teleosts {{on the basis}} of the relative contribution of pressure and volume to the stroke work. The spectrum of cardiac dynamic patterns obtained allows to distinguish between heart ventricles producing mainly pressure work (prototype: tuna) and those producing mainly volume work (prototype: <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefish)</b> (Tota and Gattuso, 1996). This adaptational flexibility of the ventricle chamber is also illustrated by some fish species that either by growing or under 60 particular environmental challenges can move from one ventricular pattern to another.

40|$|The perciform {{suborder}} Notothenoidei {{provides a}} compelling {{opportunity to study}} the adaptive radiation of a marine species-flock in the cold Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica. To facilitate genome-level studies of the diversification of these fishes, we present estimates of the genome sizes of 11 Antarctic species and describe the production of high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries for two, the red-blooded notothen Notothenia coriiceps and the white-blooded icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus. Our results indicate that evolution of phylogenetically derived notothenioid families (e. g., the crown group Channichthyidae [icefishes]), was accompanied by genome expansion. Six species from the basal family Nototheniidae had C-values between 0. 98 and 1. 20 [*]pg, a range {{that is consistent with}} the genome sizes of proposed outgroups (e. g., percids) of the notothenioid suborder. In contrast, four icefishes had C-values in the range 1. 66 – 1. 83 [*]pg. The BAC libraries VMRC- 19 (N. coriiceps) and VMRC- 21 (C. aceratus) comprise 12 × and 10 × coverage of the respective genomes and have average insert sizes of 138 and 168 [*]kb. Paired BAC-end reads representing ∼ 0. 1 % of each genome showed that the repetitive element landscapes of the two genomes (13. 4 % of the N. coriiceps genome and 14. 5 % for C. aceratus) were similar. The availability of these high-quality and well-characterized BAC libraries sets the stage for targeted genomic analyses of the unusual anatomical and physiological adaptations of the notothenioids, some of which mimic human diseases.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefishes</b> lack {{hemoglobin}} (Hb), {{and some}} species lack cardiac myoglobin (Mb). As iron-centered proteins, Hb and Mb can promote {{the formation of}} reactive oxygen species that may damage biological macromolecules. Consistent with this, we find higher levels of oxidized proteins in some tissues of red-blooded notothenioids than in icefishes. Oxidized proteins are marked for degradation by the conjugation of the protein ubiquitin. I hypothesized that levels of ubiquitinated proteins and 20 S proteasome activity (which degrades oxidized proteins) would be higher in +Hb and +Mb notothenioids than icefishes lacking the proteins. Levels of ubiquitinated proteins and rates of proteasome activity were measured in the heart ventricle, pectoral adductor, and liver of six species of notothenioids differing in Hb and Mb expression. Previous studies in notothenioids suggest that oxidative stress declines following acclimation to 4 °C. I also hypothesized that levels of ubiquitinated proteins and 20 S proteasome activity would decline in response to acclimation to 4 °C. Levels of ubiquitinated proteins and rates of proteasome activity were measured in the heart ventricle, pectoral adductor, and liver of the red-blooded Notothenia coriiceps held at ambient temperature and acclimated to 4 °C for 3 weeks. Levels of ubiquitinated proteins were higher in tissues of the red-blooded N. coriiceps compared to icefishes, but {{the activity of the}} 20 S proteasome did not follow a similar trend, suggesting that icefishes do not incur an energetic benefit resulting from reduced rates of protein degradation. Levels of ubiquitinated proteins were equivalent in heart ventricle and oxidative skeletal muscle, and proteasome activities were equivalent in all tissues between acclimated N. coriiceps and those held at ambient temperature, suggesting that protein damage and rates of protein degradation are not altered in notothenioids by long-term exposure to 4 °C...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 Mitochondrial biogenesis is {{induced by}} low {{temperature}} in many fish species. For example, cold acclimation of Gasterosteus aculeatus (threespine stickleback) increases mitochondrial densities in oxidative skeletal muscle. Oxidative muscles of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefishes</b> (suborder Notothenioidei) also have high mitochondrial densities characterized by higher densities of phospholipids compared to red-blooded notothenioids. Mitochondrial biogenesis {{has been well}} studied in mammals yet it is unknown how mitochondrial phospholipid synthesis is regulated. I hypothesized that both activity and mRNA levels of glycerol- 3 -phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in glycerolipid biosynthesis, would increase in oxidative muscle of stickleback, where mitochondrial biogenesis occurs, but not in liver, in response to cold acclimation, and that GPAT 1 and /or GPAT 2 mRNA levels would be higher in hearts of icefishes compared to red-blooded species. To test these hypotheses, maximal activity of GPAT and mRNA levels of GPAT 1 and GPAT 2 were measured in liver and oxidative muscle of coldand warm- acclimated stickleback. GPAT 1 and GPAT 2 mRNA levels were also quantified in hearts and livers of red- and white-blooded Antarctic notothenioids. Additionally, cDNA of GPAT 1 was sequenced in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic notothenioids to gain insight {{to the evolution of}} a mitochondrial membrane protein and identify candidate amino acid residues responsible for maintaining function at cold temperature. GPAT activity increased in oxidative muscle but not in liver, and transcript levels of GPAT 1 increased in liver but not in oxidative muscle, in response to cold acclimation in stickleback. GPAT 2 transcripts were undetectable in both tissues. GPAT 1 mRNA levels were highest in liver of red-blooded Antarctic notothenioids and did not differ in hearts between red- and white-blooded fishes, and GPAT 2 transcripts were undetectable. GPAT protein levels may not change concurrently with GPAT 1 and GPAT 2 mRNA levels because GPAT 3 or 1 -acylglycerol- 3 -phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT), the enzyme subsequent to GPAT, may be involved in regulating phospholipid synthesis during mitochondrial biogenesis. The amino acid sequence of GPAT 1 is highly conserved (97. 94 - 98. 06 %) among Antarctic and sub-Antarctic notothenioids, with three potential sites in the cytosolic region that may be important for maintaining function at cold temperature: Ser 415 Ala, Asp 603 Glu and Thr 648 Ala...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{supported}} by the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology for Scotland (Scottish Funding Council grant no. HR 09011),Myoglobin (Mb) is the classic vertebrate oxygen-binding protein present in aerobic striated muscles. It functions principally in oxygen delivery and provides muscle with its characteristic red colour. Members of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefish</b> family (Channichthyidae) are widely thought to be extraordinary for lacking cardiac Mb expression, a fact that has been attributed to their low metabolic rate and unusual evolutionary history. Here, we report that cardiac Mb deficit, associated with pale heart colour, has evolved repeatedly during teleost evolution. This trait affects both gill-and air-breathing species from temperate to tropical habitats across a full range of salinities. Cardiac Mb deficit results from total pseudogenization in three-spined stickleback and is associated with a massive reduction in mRNA level in two species that evidently retain functional Mb. The results suggest that near or complete absence of Mb-assisted oxygen delivery to heart muscle is a common facet of teleost biodiversity, even affecting lineages with notable oxygen demands. We suggest that Mb deficit may affect how different teleost species deal with increased tissue oxygen demands arising under climate change. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefish</b> Chaenocephalus aceratus {{lacks the}} globins common to most vertebrates, {{hemoglobin}} and myoglobin, but has retained neuroglobin in the brain. This conserved globin has been cloned, over-expressed and purified. To highlight similarities and differences, the structural {{features of the}} neuroglobin of this colourless-blooded fish were {{compared with those of}} the well characterised human neuroglobin {{as well as with the}} neuroglobin from the retina of the red blooded, hemoglobin and myoglobin-containing, closely related Antarctic notothenioid Dissostichus mawsoni. A detailed structural and functional analysis of the two Antarctic fish neuroglobins was carried out by UV-visible and Resonance Raman spectroscopies, molecular dynamics simulations and laser-flash photolysis. Similar to the human protein, Antarctic fish neuroglobins can reversibly bind oxygen and CO in the Fe 2 + form, and show six-coordination by distal His in the absence of exogenous ligands. A very large and structured internal cavity, with discrete docking sites, was identified in the modelled three-dimensional structures of the Antarctic neuroglobins. Estimate of the free-energy barriers from laser-flash photolysis and Implicit Ligand Sampling showed that the cavities are accessible from the solvent in both proteins. Comparison of structural and functional properties suggests that the two Antarctic fish neuroglobins most likely preserved and possibly improved the function recently proposed for human neuroglobin in ligand multichemistry. Despite subtle differences, the adaptation of Antarctic fish neuroglobins does not seem to parallel the dramatic adaptation of the oxygen carrying globins, hemoglobin and myoglobin, in the same organisms. © 2012 Giordano et al.

Antarctic fish, which hold high trophic positions but appear to possess low endogenous elimination rates for chemicals, are expected to bioaccumulate POPs with rising anthropogenic pollution. Using a chemical-analytical method, we measured concentrations of PCBs, PBDEs, HCBs, HCH and DDTs and determined toxic equivalents (TEQs) and bioanalytical equivalents (BEQs) in muscle and ovaries of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefish</b> caught in the Southern Ocean around Elephant Island. We used two species with different feeding habits and trophic web positions: the planktivorous Champsocephalus gunnari and the piscivorous Chaenocephalus aceratus. Our results revealed higher contaminant levels in ovary than in muscle tissues of both species. Most analytes concentrations and the TEQs (0. 2 - 0. 5) and BEQs (0. 2) were lower as in temperate species. Comparison with literature data points to higher PCB (20 - 22 ng g(- 1) lipid weight (lw)) and DDT (7 19. 5 ng g(- 1) lw) concentrations than those measured in icefish in the 90 's. For the other contaminants, we could not identify temporal trends.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Antarctic notothenioid fishes in the chronically cold waters of the Southern Ocean {{has resulted in a}} remarkably narrow thermal tolerance shared among most extant species. While most of these fishes have the capacity to accommodate the physiological challenges of low temperature, they show a greatly reduced tolerance to heat relative to fishes native to warmer waters. Though predominantly distributed in the Southern Ocean, today the Antarctic notothenioids are largely divided by their geographic distributions between three regionally endemic ichthyofaunas in the high-latitude High Antarctic Zone (HAZ), the lower-latitude Seasonal Pack-ice Zone, and cold-temperate waters of southern South America and the South Island of New Zealand. However, the extent to which regional differences in ice abundance and temperature affect the thermal tolerance of their endemic fishes is poorly understood. Within the Southern Ocean the Antarctic notothenioids are largely split between the constantly freezing High-Antarctic Zone (HAZ) and the more thermally variable Seasonal pack-Ice Zone (SPZ). For these fishes, the lower boundary of their thermal tolerance is effectively determined by their capacity for freeze avoidance and limited by their circulating levels of antifreeze proteins (AFPs). To investigate the differences in freeze avoidance between these regions??? endemic ichthyofaunas blood serum freezing points were measured in 11 of the 14 species of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefishes</b> (family Channichthyidae). While the icefishes are a small monophyletic group within the suborder Notothenioidei, they mirror the larger group???s divisions in geographic distribution and lifestyle making this family a useful system for understanding the larger group. Within this family, blood serum freezing point was negatively correlated with the latitude of species??? geographic distributions with the three SPZ species showing the highest freezing points. Either equal to or higher than the freezing point of seawater, these serum freezing points left the SPZ species with insufficient protection from freezing to survive in the ice-laden waters inhabited by the HAZ species. When the contributions to freeze avoidance of serum osmolytes, antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs), and the antifreeze potentiating protein was assessed, the higher freeze avoidance of high-latitude HAZ icefishes was found to result predominantly from increasing antifreeze activity from the AFGPs. The reduced severity of some SPZ habitats which allows the survival of species with high freezing points may also be reflected in the development of notothenioid freeze avoidance during ontogeny. While prior work on larval Gymnodraco acuticeps has shown that HAZ notothenioids can reach adult levels of serum antifreeze activity within months of hatching, antifreeze activity has never been previously studied in any of the SPZ species. To do so, I investigated the freeze avoidance in juveniles of the high freezing point SPZ icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus which had the highest serum freezing point among the adult <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefishes.</b> These maintained sub-adult levels of serum antifreeze activity through the 2 + year class, which were the oldest collected, and if the observed rate of increase was sustained they would not attain adult levels of antifreeze activity until 4. 2 years after hatching. Though most of the Antarctic notothenioids share low freezing points, the absence of selection for heat tolerance in the chronically cold Southern Ocean has over evolutionary time resulted in their modern limited heat tolerance. To determine whether differences in environmental temperature between the HAZ and SPZ are also correlated with the heat tolerance of regionally endemic fishes, the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) was determined in 11 species of Antarctic fishes including six from the HAZ and five from the SPZ. Like freeze avoidance, heat tolerance among the Antarctic fishes could be separated according to their geographic distribution with the CTMaxs of five of the HAZ species significantly below those of the SPZ species when acclimatized to their natural freezing water temperatures. However, while these shared low heat tolerances in the eight species available in numbers allowing further study, all retained plasticity in their heat tolerance with significant and often proportionally large increases in CTMax following warm acclimation to 4 ??C. The Antarctic notothenioids also include at least 16 secondarily temperate species with origins in Antarctic waters but that are now permanent residents of the warmer waters around New Zealand and South America. Presumably these once shared the limited heat tolerance found currently among endemic Antarctic fishes however, it is not known whether this polar trait continues to exert an influence on their modern heat tolerance. To investigate, I determined the CTMax in two species of New Zealand notothenioids, the secondarily temperate N. angustata and the basal thorn fish Bovichtus variegatus that does not share the former???s evolutionary origins in polar waters but which inhabits a similar modern thermal environment. While N. angustata had significantly higher heat tolerance than its endemic Antarctic congener N. coriiceps, it showed significantly lower heat tolerance than B. variegatus, suggesting the continued presence of its presumed ancestral loss of heat tolerance. These studies showed species??? levels of freeze avoidance and heat tolerance are not homogeneous throughout the Antarctic notothenioids, but reflect regional differences even within the Southern Ocean where water temperatures range only between - 1. 9 and 3 ??C. Freeze avoidance was lowest among species restricted to the more northerly waters of the SPZ where they presumably survive in the perennially ice free waters found within this region, but which also likely limits their distributions to waters outside the more severe HAZ. The relaxed selection for freeze avoidance in some SPZ waters also allows for the slow onset of adult antifreeze activity in at least one species of icefish, C. aceratus. Similarly, while the Antarctic notothenioids largely share low heat tolerances when acclimatized to their natural freezing water temperatures, these show notable regional variation and a surprisingly high level of plasticity in response to warm acclimation. However, the comparably limited levels of heat tolerance in the secondarily temperate nototheniid, N. angustata, suggests that there may be substantial retention of its ancestral low heat tolerance which may impairing the Antarctic notothenioid???s ability to adapt to the rising water temperatures predicted from global climate change...|$|R

When samples for all years were combined, cephalopods and crustaceans {{were the main}} components in the diet of Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses, respectively. However, their diets exhibited interannual variations. Cephalopods {{were the most important}} component in the diet of Grey-headed Albatrosses between 1996 and 1999 (60 - 75 % by mass) but decreased significantly in 2000 (17 %), when crustaceans dominated (61 %). The Black-browed Albatross diet varied greatly, with cephalopods being the most important component in 1996 (49 % by mass) and 1997 (48 %), fish in 1998 (32 %) and 1999 (40 %), and crustaceans in 2000 (63 %). In 1998 and 2000 there was a significant change in the cephalopod species present in the diet of both albatross species, when their breeding success was low. The consumption of the ommastrephid Martialia hyadesi was significantly and positively correlated with Grey-headed Albatross breeding success. For Black-browed Albatrosses significant correlations were found between its consumption of the Icefish Champsocephalus gunnari and breeding success, and between its consumption of M. hyadesi and M. hyadesi CPUE (Catch per Unit Effort). These findings suggest that Grey-headed Albatrosses are more reliant on Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone prey (M. hyadesi and Lamprey Geotria australis) whereas Black-browed Albatrosses are more dependent on <b>Antarctic</b> prey (<b>Icefish</b> and <b>Antarctic</b> Krill Euphausia superba). The differences between diets of Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses breeding on different islands of the Southern Ocean showed that Grey-headed Albatrosses feed more on oceanic cephalopods (e. g.

40|$|Correctly {{quantifying}} {{the impacts}} of rare apex marine predators is essential to ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management, where harvesting must be sustainable for targeted species and their dependent predators. This requires modelling the uncertainty in such processes as predator life history, seasonal abundance and movement, size-based predation, energetic requirements, and prey vulnerability. We combined these uncertainties to evaluate the predatory impact of transient leopard seals on a community of mesopredators (seals and penguins) and their prey at South Georgia, and assess the implications for an ecosystem-based management. The mesopredators are highly dependent on <b>Antarctic</b> krill and <b>icefish,</b> which are targeted by regional fisheries. We used a state-space formulation to combine (1) a mark-recapture open-population model and individual identification data to assess seasonally variable leopard seal arrival and departure dates, numbers, and residency times; (2) a size-based bioenergetic model; and (3) a size-based prey choice model from a diet analysis. Our models indicated that prey choice and consumption reflected seasonal changes in leopard seal population size and structure, size-selective predation and prey vulnerability. A population of 104 (90 - 125) leopard seals, of which 64 % were juveniles, consumed less than 2 % of the Antarctic fur seal pup production of the area (50 % of total ingested energy, IE), but ca. 12 - 16 % of the local gentoo penguin population (20 % IE). Antarctic krill (28 % IE) were the only observed food of leopard seal pups and supplemented the diet of older individuals. Direct impacts on krill and fish were negligible, but the "escapement" due to leopard seal predation on fur seal pups and penguins could be significant for the mackerel icefish fishery at South Georgia. These results suggest that: (1) rare apex predators like leopard seals may control, and may depend on, populations of mesopredators dependent on prey species targeted by fisheries: and (2) predatory impacts and community control may vary throughout the predator's geographic range, and differ across ecosystems and management areas, depending on the seasonal abundance of the prey and the predator's dispersal movements. This understanding is important to integrate the predator needs as natural mortality of its prey in models to set prey catch limits for fisheries. Reliable estimates of the variability of these needs are essential for a precautionary interpretation {{in the context of}} an ecosystem-based management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) {{are one of}} Antarctica’s top predators, yet {{surprisingly}} little information exists about their year-round movement, habitat, and foraging behavior. Previous attempts to determine the overwinter behavior of Weddell seals were met with limited success due to early tag failure. Conductivity Temperature and Depth – Satellite Relay Data Loggers (CTD-SRDL tags) now {{make it possible to}} collect animal movement and oceanographic data on the same scale. These tags are deployed on marine vertebrates with the assumption that oceanographic data collected by miniaturized sensors are on par with standard oceanographic equipment. Movement data collected by the tags, in combination with oceanographic data can be used to study the seasonal habitat preference and foraging behavior of Weddell seals. Tracking data can also be linked to diet to provide a complete picture of the seasonal ecology of the southernmost mammal on Earth. Unlike previous studies which were biased towards prey with indigestible hard parts, stable isotopes can be used to provide a more complete picture of both digestible and indigestible components of prey species. In the first data chapter (chapter 2), I assess the accuracy of the temperature and conductivity sensors on the CTD-SRDL tags to determine their performance relative to standard oceanographic equipment. I found that CTD tags were not comparable to high-precision oceanographic equipment, but still provided invaluable oceanographic data and were fully capable of identifying water mass characteristics and seasonal changes in otherwise inaccessible areas. This study provides the first independent assessment of CTD tag performance in laboratory (pre- and post-deployment, and after battery replacement) and under in situ conditions (before and during deployment). In the second data chapter (chapter 3), I explain and predict Weddell seal habitat and foraging behavior from a suite of environmental variables as well as examine the relationship between foraging behavior and dive metrics. I found that seasonal sea-ice extent, open water polynyas, and the diverse topography of the Ross Sea were important in determining the habitat preference and foraging behavior of Weddell seals in the western Ross Sea. This work provides insight into how Weddell seals might adjust their habitat preferences and foraging behavior in light of increased climate change. Finally, in the last data chapter (chapter 4), I used stable isotopes (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) to examine the diet of Weddell seals over two time scales. I found that Antarctic silverfish (Pleurogramma antarcticum), <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefish</b> (Neopagetopsis ionah) and several Tremamtomus species were important prey items, but their proportional contribution to Weddell seal diet varied among individuals and across time scales.

Within vertebrates, the dominant suborder Notothenioidei of the Southern Ocean is one of the most interesting models to study the evolutionary biological responses to extreme environment. Hemoproteins of cold-adapted organisms are likely to fulfil important physiological roles, not only in delivering oxygen to cells, but also in protecting them from the nitrosative and oxidative stress. This thesis will in particular focus on: (i) the structural and functional features of globins of the Antarctic marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125, (ii) the role of neuroglobin (Ngb) recently identified in the brain of Antarctic notothenioid fish. The genome of the cold-adapted bacterium P. haloplanktis TAC 125 contains multiple genes encoding three distinct monomeric hemoglobins (Hbs) exhibiting a 2 / 2 -helical fold (2 / 2 Hb). One of these 2 / 2 Hb (Ph- 2 / 2 HbO) has been over-expressed and characterised by spectroscopic analysis, kinetic measurements and computer simulation approaches (Howes et al., 2011; Giordano et al., 2011). The results indicate unique adaptive structural properties, that overall confer higher flexibility to the protein and may facilitate its functioning in the cold by providing greater freedom for the correct positioning of ligand(s). Similar to Ngb, the recombinant protein is hexacoordinated in the ferric and ferrous forms, and shows a strong dependence on pH (Howes et al., 2011; Giordano et al., 2011). Polar fish are a suitable model to learn more about the function of globins in the brain, and especially about their role in species devoid of Hb and Myoglobin (Mb). The finding that Antarctic icefishes retain the Ngb gene despite having lost Hb, and Mb in most species, suggests a crucial function. The function of Ngb needs to be ascertained, because it may have important implications in the physiology and pathology of the brain. The first structural model of fish Ngb was described using molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, Ngb genes from a colourless-blooded <b>Antarctic</b> <b>icefish</b> species (Chaenocephalus aceratus), and a related red-blooded species (Dissostichus mawsoni), were cloned, the recombinant proteins were expressed and purified, and then sequenced and analysed. Both Antarctic fish Ngbs are hexacoordinated, but have some peculiarities that differentiate them from mammalian counterparts: they have extensions in the N and C termini, interacting with the EF loop, and a gap in the alignment that changes the CD-region structure/dynamics, that has been found to play a key role in human Ngb. The adaptive modifications to compensate for the effects of low temperature appear to primarily rely on a higher flexibility of key parts of the molecular structure and/or decreased overall stability. At all levels analysed, the functionally most crucial adaptation to permanently low temperatures apparently requires molecular flexibility to support cell functioning. Proteins are the major targets for the ensuing mechanisms of adaptation...|$|E
