Our architecture addresses the issue of heterogeneous information management, the need for analyzing mixed manufacturing approaches, and efficiency and accuracy tradeoffs of analysis methods. We propose five distinct layers to address these requirements: an XML/RDF/DAML Information Access Layer, a Resource Vector Representation Layer, <b>an</b> <b>Analysis</b> <b>Layer,</b> a Coordination Layer, and a Visualization Layer. Our successful results in developing agent systems in support of lean manufacturing cell and supply chain management validate our layered approach...|$|E

An echoing mechanism between two neighboring layers of neurosomes is assumed to establish temporary memory, and repeating processes enhance the formation of long-term memory. Creation and degradation of memory information are statistically. The maximum capacity of memory storage in a human brain {{is estimated to be}} one billion of 2 D codes.

40|$|Abstract — Electrical {{control of}} {{magnetic}} tunnel junc-tions (MTJs) provides opportunities to introduce MTJs into high-performance applications requiring low power consumption. The magnetic state of an MTJ can be electrically controlled through: 1) the spin transfer torque (STT) effect; 2) the voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect; and 3) {{the fusion of}} STT and VCMA. Several compact models have been published for MTJs. All of these models consider an MTJ whose magnetic state is controlled through the STT effect. In this paper, a model of an MTJ comprising a free layer, <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>layer,</b> and a spin polarizing layer is described. The MTJ compact model, adaptive compact MTJ (ACM) model, includes the effects of asymmetry on the MTJ behavior, and models a device controlled through the STT, VCMA, or a fused STT–VCMA mechanism. The ACM model includes {{the dynamics of the}} junction temperature. The proposed model can be adapted to experimental configurations including in-plane MTJ (IMTJ), IMTJ with a perpendicular-to-the-plane polarizer, perpendicular-to-the-plane MTJ (PMTJ), and PMTJ with an additional easy axis. The ACM model is validated with published experimental data, showing reasonably accurate results with an average error of less than 6 %.

40|$|Active-databases are {{a budding}} {{technology}} where rule-based expert {{systems can be}} developed in tight integration with database management systems. This paper presents VenusIDS: an active database component of the Network Exploitation Detection Analyst Assistant (NEDAA) developed as an enhancement to the analysis layer of a two-layer distributed network intrusion detection system using the VenusDB active database system. The layers consist of a network layer and <b>an</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>layer.</b> The network layer contains probes on each subnetwork that sniff network traffic and forward interesting packets in real time to a central Oracle database. The analysis layer comprises this central database and the mechanism to identify and report intrusions. For active-database technology to form an effective basis for intrusion detection, it must be capable of processing network events at least {{as fast as the}} network probes produce and log them. Our performance results show that VenusIDS is more than fast enough to handle this rate. Further, VenusIDS is scalable in the number of rules and size of the underlying database. As context for the VenusIDS component, we begin by describing the application architecture and the VenusDB system, with emphasis on the particular features that are important to distributed intrusion detection. We follow that with a description of the VenusIDS component and its performance profile that enables near real time intrusion detection. We conclude with a discussion of future topics for active-database analysis layers...|$|E

40|$|Network-based {{attacks against}} {{computer}} systems {{are a common}} and increasing problem. Attackers continue to increase the sophistication and complexity of their attacks {{with the goal of}} removing sensitive data or disrupting operations. Attack detection technology works very well for the detection of known attacks using a signature-based intrusion detection system. However, attackers can utilize attacks that are undetectable to those signature-based systems whether they are truly new attacks or modified versions of known attacks. Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems approach the problem of attack detection by detecting when traffic differs from a learned baseline. In the case of this research, the focus was on a relatively new area known as payload anomaly detection. In payload anomaly detection, the system focuses exclusively on the payload of packets and learns the normal contents of those payloads. When a payload 2 ̆ 7 s contents differ from the norm, an anomaly is detected and may be a potential attack. A risk with anomaly-based detection mechanisms is they suffer from high false positive rates which reduce their effectiveness. This research built upon previous research in payload anomaly detection by combining multiple techniques of detection in a layered approach. The layers of the system included a high-level navigation <b>layer,</b> <b>a</b> request payload <b>analysis</b> <b>layer,</b> and <b>a</b> request-response <b>analysis</b> <b>layer.</b> The system was tested using the test data provided by some earlier payload anomaly detection systems as well as new data sets.
