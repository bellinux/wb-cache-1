40|$|In {{the past}} two decades many {{attempts}} have been made to relate surface and interfacial parameters with the blood compatibility of polymeric surfaces. It is however doubtful if by a single parameter the behaviour of blood on a surface can be predicted. Two major aspects of blood compatibility - the prevention of platelet adhesion and the deactivation of the intrinsic coagulation system are determined by the measure and nature of competitive blood protein adsorption on the foreign surface. The adhesion of blood platelets is promoted by adsorbed fibrinogen and gamma globulin, while adsorbed <b>albumin</b> <b>inhibits</b> <b>platelet</b> adhesion. Heparinised surfaces do not adsorb fibrin and consequently no adhesion of platelets takes place. Other surfaces with low platelet adhesion are the hydrogels, certain block copolyetherurethanes, polyelectrolyte complexes and biolised proteins. Heparinised surfaces of the cationically bonded type inhibit the intrinsic coagulation as well, however this may be due to unstable coatings and heparin leakage. In the authors laboratory a synthetic heparinoid was prepared with the structure - [CH 2 - C(CH 3 NHSO 3 Na - C(H) COONa - CH 2 -]x with Mw = (7. 5 /pm 1. 0) × 105 and an in vivo anticoagulant activity of 50...|$|R

In diabetic patients, alterations in platelet functions, especially increased <b>platelet</b> <b>agregation,</b> have been suggested to cause increasing in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality or in accelaretion of athersclerotic process. In this study, we aimed to investigate the platelet aggregation response alterations {{and the effects of}} DM duration, HbA 1 c, treatment options among the patients with Type 2 DM. Fortyfive patients (case group; 21 male, 24 female) with Type 2 DM and forty-eight healthy individuals (control group; 22 male, 26 female) were included in this study. Platelet aggregation was determinated with Chorono-log 500 (USA) named device by using Chorono-log/ADP, Chorono-log/ collagen and Chorono-log/epinephrine kits. ADP-induced platelet aggregation was significantly higher in the case group compared with control group (p 0. 05).

40|$|Platelets play an {{important}} role in various thrombotic diseases, including myocardial infarction. Because red wine consumption is inversely associated with death due to ischemic heart diseases, the effects of grape components on platelet function have been extensively investigated.

In addition, ellagic acid also inhibited p 38 MAPK and Akt phosphorylation stimulated by hydrogen peroxide.
