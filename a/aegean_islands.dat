5|$|In the Ionian Islands, P.fluviatile {{is known}} to occur at only one site on Corfu, {{as well as on}} Kefalonia, Lefkada and Zakynthos. In the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Islands,</b> it is found on Skiathos and Skopelos (Sporades), on Euboea and Skyros, and at a single site on Andros in the Cyclades.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this turmoil, {{specific}} regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia. Mycenaean refugees migrated to Cyprus and the Levantine coast. Nevertheless, other regions {{on the edge of the}} Mycenaean world prospered, such as the Ionian islands, the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of Attica and a number of <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands.</b> The acropolis of Athens, oddly, appears to have avoided destruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Byzantine Greeks lived in Asia Minor, the southern Balkans, and <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands.</b> Nearly {{all of these}} Byzantine Greeks fell under Turkish Muslim rule by the 16th century. Many retained their identities, eventually comprising the modern Greek and Cypriot {{states as well as}} the Cappadocian Greek and Pontic Greek minorities in Asia Minor. Other Byzantine Greeks, particularly in Anatolia, converted to Islam and underwent Turkification over time.|$|E

5|$|The {{natural range}} of Potamon fluviatile is highly fragmented, and covers parts of many {{countries}} with a Mediterranean coastline. It {{is found in}} mainland Italy and on the Balkan Peninsula from Dalmatia to the Axios River in Greece. It is also found {{on a number of}} islands, including Sicily, Malta and Gozo, the Ionian Islands, <b>Aegean</b> <b>Islands,</b> Sporades and Andros in the Cyclades. Although the species as a whole is widespread, it is declining in numbers, and these insular populations are particularly vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Around 1450 BC, Greece {{was divided}} {{into a series of}} warrior kingdoms, the most {{important}} being centered in Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos and Thebes. Before the end of the same century, this militaristic civilization replaced the former priestess-dominated civilization of Minoan Cretans in the Aegean. Thus, the Mycenaeans began to build up their maritime power in the Aegean Sea, expanding towards the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Islands</b> and Anatolian coast. The warlike nature of the Mycenaeans was probably a decisive factor in their diplomatic relations towards the other Late Bronze Age powers. Mycenaean warriors were also hired as mercenaries in foreign armies, such as in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|From ca. 1088 on, he {{used his}} base at Smyrna to wage war against the Byzantines. Employing Christian craftsmen, he built a fleet, with which he {{captured}} Phocaea and the eastern <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands</b> of Lesbos (except for the fortress of Methymna), Samos, Chios and Rhodes. A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle. Some modern scholars have speculated that his activities during this time {{may have been in}} conjunction, and perhaps even coordination, with two contemporary Byzantine Greek rebels, Rhapsomates in Cyprus, and Karykes in Crete.|$|E

5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} almost doubled. The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands</b> was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their own. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1941, Hitler issued Directive No. 27, {{including}} his occupation policy for Greece. He finalized jurisdiction in the Balkans with Directive No. 31 issued on 9 June. Mainland Greece was divided between Germany, Italy and Bulgaria, with Italy occupying {{the bulk of}} the country (see map opposite). German forces occupied the strategically more important areas of Athens, Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia and several <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands,</b> including most of Crete. They also occupied Florina, which was claimed by both Italy and Bulgaria. Bulgaria, which had not participated in the invasion of Greece, occupied most of Thrace {{on the same day that}} Tsolakoglou offered his surrender. The goal was to gain an Aegean Sea outlet in Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. The Bulgarians occupied territory between the Struma river and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and Svilengrad west of the Evros River. Italian troops started occupying the Ionian and <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands</b> on 28 April. On 2 June, they occupied the Peloponnese; on 8 June, Thessaly; and on 12 June, most of Attica. The occupation of Greece—during which civilians suffered terrible hardships, many dying from privation and hunger—proved to be a difficult and costly task. Several resistance groups launched guerrilla attacks against the occupying forces and set up espionage networks.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera, {{which according to}} archaeological data occurred in c. 1500 BC, resulted in {{the decline of the}} Minoan civilization of Crete. This turn of events gave the opportunity to the Mycenaeans to spread their influence throughout the Aegean. Around c. 1450 BC, they were in control of Crete itself, including Knossos, and colonized several other <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands,</b> reaching as far as Rhodes. Thus the Mycenaeans became the dominant power of the region, marking the beginning of the Mycenaean 'Koine' era (from , common), a highly uniform culture that spread in mainland Greece and the Aegean.|$|E

5|$|The last notable {{members of}} the family are {{mentioned}} in Constantinople during the early centuries of the Ottoman Empire, as with Michael or Mozalos Gabras, active ca. 1555–65, or Cyril Gabras, megas skeuophylax of the Patriarchate in 1604. Other family members are attested in Crete and the <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands.</b> Thus an unnamed Gabras held lands in Santorini in the early 17th century; and numerous Gabrades are to be found at Chios and in Crete, especially around Siteia, until the early 19th century. For Crete in particular, it has been often supposed, although with no definitive evidence, that the local Gabrades came directly from the Pontus.|$|E
5|$|Within 90 {{years of}} Osman I's {{establishment}} of the Ottoman beylik, Byzantine Asia Minor had ceased to exist and by ca. 1380, Byzantine Thrace was lost to the Ottomans. By ca. 1400, the once mighty Byzantine Empire {{was nothing more than}} a collection of the Despotate of the Morea, a few <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands</b> and a strip of land in Thrace in the immediate vicinity of the Capital. The Crusade of Nicopolis in 1396, Timur's invasion in 1402 and the final Crusade of Varna in 1444 allowed a ruined Constantinople to stave off defeat until 1453. With the conclusion of the war Ottoman supremacy became established in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|In {{many ways}} Mycale {{represents}} {{the start of}} a new phase of the conflict, the Greek counterattack. After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians in the region, and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, which the Athenians then laid siege to; after a protracted siege, it fell to the Athenians. Herodotus ended his Historia after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands</b> and Ionia. Peace with Persia came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, {{this period}} in Greek history is {{remarkable}} {{for the social}} and political upheaval in many Greek cities, particularly the establishment of the first democracy in Athens. The island of Naxos, part of the Cyclades group in the Aegean Sea, was also in this period affected by political turmoil. Naxos had been ruled by the tyrant Lygdamis, a protege of the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos, until around 524 BC, when he was overthrown by the Spartans. After this, a native aristocracy seems to have flourished, and Naxos {{became one of the most}} prosperous and powerful of the <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands.</b> Despite its success, Naxos was not immune to class tensions and internal strife, and shortly before 500 BC, the population seized power, expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Salamis {{marked the}} {{turning point in the}} Greco-Persian wars. After Salamis, the Peloponnese, and by {{extension}} Greece as an entity, was safe from conquest; and the Persians suffered a major blow to their prestige and morale (as well as severe material losses). At the following battles of Plataea and Mycale, the threat of conquest was removed, and the Allies were able to go on the counter-offensive. The Greek victory allowed Macedon to revolt against Persian rule; and over the next 30 years, Thrace, the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Islands</b> and finally Ionia would be removed from Persian control by the Allies, or by the Athenian-dominated successor, the Delian League. Salamis started a decisive swing in the balance of power toward the Greeks, which would culminate in an eventual Greek victory, severely reducing Persian power in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} spring, the Allies {{assembled the}} largest ever hoplite army, and marched north from the isthmus to confront Mardonius. At the ensuing Battle of Plataea, the Greek infantry again proved its superiority, inflicting a severe defeat on the Persians and killing Mardonius in the process. On the same day, across the Aegean Sea an Allied navy destroyed {{the remnants of the}} Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. With this double defeat, the invasion was ended, and Persian power in the Aegean severely dented. The Greeks would now move to the offensive, eventually expelling the Persians from Europe, the <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands</b> and Ionia before the war finally came to an end in 479 BC.|$|E

5|$|For his successes, Licario {{was rewarded}} with the post of megas konostaulos, head of the Latin mercenaries, and {{eventually}} appointed as megas doux after Philanthropenos's death in ca. 1276; the first foreigner to be thus honoured. He commanded the Byzantine navy {{in a series of}} expeditions against the Latin-held <b>Aegean</b> <b>islands.</b> The first to fall was Skopelos, whose fortress was believed to be impregnable. Licario, however, knew that it lacked water supplies. Thus, he attacked it during the hot and dry summer of 1277 and forced its surrender. Its lord, Filippo Ghisi, was captured and sent to Constantinople; his other possessions, the islands of Skyros, Skiathos and Amorgos, were also taken soon after. After that, Licario went on to capture the islands of Kythera and Antikythera off the southern coast of the Morea, and later Kea, Astypalaia, and Santorini in the Cyclades. The great island of Lemnos was also captured, although its lord, Paolo Navigajoso, withstood a three-year siege before surrendering.|$|E
