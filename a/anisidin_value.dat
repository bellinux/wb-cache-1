40|$|The {{quality of}} fish oil is {{determined}} by some parameters such as primary and secondary grade oxidation, fatty acid profile and physical qualities which include viscosity, density, color and clarity. Sardine fish oil by-products of fish meal processing can {{be a source of}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Degumming is one of steps that can be carried out {{to improve the quality of}} sardine fish oil. The processing will help to reduce oxidation and eliminate the impurity of the oil that influence the quality of fish oil. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of sodium chloride solution degumming on the quality of sardine fish oil to fulfill International Fish Oil Standard (IFOS). Fish oil purification was done by degumming of 5 % H 2 O,  followed by sodium chloride solution with ratio of fish oil and sodium chloride solution were 1 : 1; 1 : 3, and 1 : 5. The sodium chloride solution concentrations of 5 % and 8 % for 20, 30 and 40 minutes. The next steps after degumming process were followed by alkali neutralization and bleached by absorbent. The best treatment was at  concentration of 5 %  sodium chloride solution, ratio fish oil with sodium chloride solution 1 : 1 on a long time degumming processed 20 minutes. The best quality of fish oil, according to IFOS, was resulted from the treatments combination of free fatty acid 0. 21 ± 0. 00 %, peroxide value 0. 43 ± 0. 06 mEq/kg, <b>anisidin</b> <b>value</b> 2. 22 ± 0. 04 mEq/kg and total oxidation 3. 11 ± 0. 14   mEq/kg. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Omega- 3 {{fatty acids}} (- 3) are proven to have health {{beneficial}} effects. Some effort {{had been done}} to obtained oil high in - 3 fatty acids. Among the methods developed, urea crystallization was preferred because it is simple, economic, and result in high purity of fatty acids. A source that had not been widely explored for - 3 fatty acids production is the by-product of tuna meal processing. This research studied the optimization condition for separation and purification of - 3 fatty acids from the by-product of tuna meal processing by urea crystallization. Crystallization reaction conditions of urea inclusion were optimized using the response surface methodology, and the model was developed. Optimization result showed a quadratic polynomial regression equation of Y= 140, 52677 X 1 + 8, 38203 X 2 – 19, 85850 X 12 – 0, 12173 X 22 – 0, 74000 X 1 X 2 – 240, 33546 with X 1 =urea to fatty acid ratio and X 2 =crystallization time. Maximum response was obtained at urea to fatty acid ratio of 3, 07 : 1,crystallization time of 25, 10 hours, and predicted response was 80, 60 %. Analysis of variance showed that urea to fatty acid ratio and crystallization time affected response. Under optimal conditions, the product was 3. 89 times concentrated and the purity of - 3 fatty acids was 81, 98 %. Verification result revealed that the predicted value from this model was reasonably close to the experimentally observed value. Urea crystallization process changed quality parameters that were oxidation level (peroxide value, <b>anisidin</b> <b>value,</b> and totox value), Fe and Cu content, P content, and water content. The changes were caused by adsorption of primary and secondary oxidation products, part of metals, and phosphoric compound onto unsaponifiable matters or soluble into water...|$|E

One {{of the effort to}} prevent the oxidation process is by adding antioxidants stability of oil catfish and shelf life of the oil. The experimental study was applied by adding vitamin E to the oil as much as 0. 67 mg / g PUFA compared with the control oil. Oil was stored with the Schaal Oven Test method, which are stored at a temperature of 600 C. The study showed that, based on the parameters of oxidation (free fatty acids, peroxide <b>value,</b> <b>anisidin</b> numbers, and the number of total oxidation), catfish oil were added vitamin E more stabilized than the catfish oil without added vitamin E. The catfish fish oil in the form of soft gell capsules added vitamin E could maintain stability in appropriate with IFOS up to 23 months.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{oxidized}} dietary lipid {{and the role}} of vitamin E on the growth performance, biometric traits, blood parameters, muscle pH and fillet quality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) were evaluated after a 79 -day feeding period. Five hundred sixty fish with mean initial bodyweight of 2. 12 kg were distributed into eight cages and fed four different experimental diets. The salmon were fed a commercial diet added fresh or oxidized rapeseed oil with standard (200 mg/kg) or elevated (1200 mg/kg) vitamin E. The fresh and oxidized rapeseed oil used had the <b>anisidin</b> <b>value</b> of 2. 3 and 33 (meq peroxide/kg) and peroxide value of 3. 3 and 24 (meq peroxide/kg), respectively. Growth performance showed no significant dietary effects, but the feed conversion rate (FCR) of the fish fed fresh oil in combination with elevated vitamin E was lowest compared with other diets. No significant differences in organ adhesions (Speilberg score), spleen somatic index, slaughter yield, fillet yield or fillet fat content were observed due to dietary treatment. However, oxidized oil tended to increase heart somatic index and significantly reduced the fillet thickness. Livers of salmon fed high vitamin E levels were larger and paler than those of salmon fed the diets without vitamin E supplementation, irrespective of oil quality. The fish were slaughtered immediately after netting (non-stressed) or they were kept in seawater with decreasing dissolved oxygen (DO), from 9 to 2 mg/L (stressed) before slaughtering. For the non-stressed group, supplementation with vitamin E resulted in higher levels of Na+ and K+ in the blood, while oxidized lipid had tended to increase the hemoglobin level although these effects were not significant. The diet added fresh oil without vitamin E supplementation had significantly highest pH after 3 h storage, but no significant dietary effects were observed on muscle pH after 24 h, pH in blood, liquid loss or gaping., Vitamin E supplementation had a positive effect on the fillet firmness, independent of dietary oil quality. Acute stress due to exposure to low DO level had a negative effect on the osmoregulation, muscle pH after 3 h and liquid loss whereas no significant effects on firmness or gaping were observed. However, vitamin E supplementation appeared to lower Na+ and K+ increase and drop in muscle pH due to acute stress. Statistical analyses revealed significant interactions between stress and oxidized oil. Indeed, hemoglobin level was higher and pH in blood was lower of the fish fed oxidized oil than in those fed. These results demonstrated that feed containing oxidized oil increased the hemoglobin concentration, accelerated glycolytic activity post-mortem and also negatively affected the fillet thickness. Salmon fed oxidized oil had less ability to cope with acute stress, in particular impaired osmoregulation ability. High vitamin E levels improved the feed utilization, fillet firmness and the ability of the fish to cope with acute stress before slaughtering. However, paler and larger livers, increased Na+ and K+ levels in the blood and faster pH drop in the muscle post-mortem might be considered as negative. Hence the level and period of vitamin E supplementation need to be ascertained to achieve optimal production efficiency, physiological status and fillet quality of farmed salmon...|$|E
