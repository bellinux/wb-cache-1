500|$|During one of Art's visits, {{he finds}} that a friend of Mala's has sent the couple one of the {{underground}} comix magazines Art contributed to. [...] Mala had tried to hide it, but Vladek finds and reads it. [...] In [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", Art is traumatized by his mother's suicide three months after his release from the mental hospital, {{and in the end}} depicts himself behind bars saying, [...] "You murdered me, Mommy, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> here to take the rap!" [...] Though it brings back painful memories, Vladek admits that dealing with the issue in such a way was for the best.|$|E
500|$|Many {{songs from}} the album are {{inspired}} by Cuomo's past personal experiences. [...] "My Name is Jonas", deals with Cuomo's brother Leaves who had been seriously injured {{in a car accident}} while a student at Oberlin College and was having problem with his insurance. Jason Cropper earned co-writing credit for coming up with the intro to the song. Both [...] "No One Else" [...] and [...] "The World Has Turned <b>and</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Me</b> Here" [...] are lyrically connected, with Cuomo describing the narrator of [...] "No One Else" [...] as [...] "the jealous-obsessive asshole in me freaking out on my girlfriend" [...] and claiming that [...] "'The World has Turned <b>and</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Me</b> Here' is the same asshole wondering why she's gone." [...] The second single from the Blue Album was [...] "Buddy Holly", whose music video was also directed by Spike Jonze. It portrayed the band performing at the original Arnold's Drive-In diner from the popular 1970s television show, Happy Days. The video combined contemporary footage of the band with clips from the show. Happy Days cast member Al Molinaro made a cameo appearance in the video. The video was met with great popularity and heavy rotation on MTV. The music video was also featured as an extra in the Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade CD, along with Edie Brickell's [...] "Good Times" [...] music video and the movie trailer for Rob Roy. The video won four awards at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards, including prizes for Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Video.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 26, Bottomley {{became the}} company's chairman. His advance in the {{business}} world was attracting wider notice, and in 1887 he was invited by the Liberal Party in Hornsey to be their candidate in a parliamentary by-election. He accepted, and although defeated, fought a strong campaign which won him a congratulatory letter from William Gladstone. His business affairs were proceeding less serenely; he quarrelled with his partner Douglas MacRae, and the two decided to separate. Bottomley described the [...] "Quixotic impulse" [...] that led him to let MacRae divide the assets: [...] "He was a printer, and I was a journalist—but he took the papers <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> the printing works".|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Martin's {{brilliance}} in evoking atmosphere through {{description is}} an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings {{much more than}} just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with [...] "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters". CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire {{to know what was going}} to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor advised reading the novels with an A Song of Ice and Fire encyclopedia at hand to [...] "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [...] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephanie Zacharek of Salon felt {{positively}} {{about the}} episode itself but ambivalent {{about the lack}} of resolution, stating, [...] "I'm not sure if Tuesday night's finale is a deeply unsatisfying way to close out a series that's ending before its time or the only way to end such a series." [...] However, she blamed the network for this ending. She also commented on the tone and themes of the episode, arguing that one of the series's main takeaways was that the rich would always be in charge. However, she did not view the finale as being spiteful and pessimistic: [...] "'Veronica Mars' has always been a clear-eyed show, never a bitter one." [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt unsatisfied with the episode's conclusion, partially because Veronica and Logan did not resume dating. However, he praised the sex-tape mystery and the plot involving the Castle because of their similarities to earlier seasons. He also praised Keith's actions, stating, [...] "Okay, maybe I'm a sap, but this tugged at my heartstrings a bit <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> relieved there wasn't a dreaded Veronica–Keith battle at the end." [...] Stransky concluded by saying that [...] "the end is fine". Sydney Bucksbaum of Zap2it felt disappointed because of the ambiguous endings of Keith's arc and Veronica's love triangle. Although she was positive towards [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] as a standalone episode, she found herself hoping that there were another episode to the season: [...] "Watching Veronica walk out into the pouring rain all alone after casting a probably insignificant vote for her dad was depressing, symbolic (rain in SoCal?), and just downright unsatisfying." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nina Munteanu of Europa SF {{reviewed}} and compared both {{the movie and}} the series; she {{said that while the}} movie sacrificed character development in pursuit of a coherent story, the series chose the path of deep characters and themes. She summed up by saying [...] "While the film’s moralistic tale resonated and lingered like a muse’s long forgotten poem, the subversive kick of the comic series (which I thankfully saw later) struck deep chords <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> breathless with questions".|$|E
2500|$|Although Emerson did not own {{a record}} player, he enjoyed {{listening}} to music on the radio, particularly Floyd Cramer's 1961 slip note-style [...] "On the Rebound" [...] {{and the work of}} Dudley Moore. He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books. He also listened to boogie-woogie, and to country-style pianists including Joe [...] "Mr Piano" [...] Henderson, Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell. Emerson later described himself: [...] "I was a very serious child. I used to walk around with Beethoven sonatas under my arm. However, I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies. That was because I could also play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs. So, they thought I was kind of cool <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robertson, visiting London {{in early}} October, had {{discussed}} French's replacement with Murray (now CIGS) and the King. [...] After {{he returned to}} France and conferred with Haig, Haig recorded (diary 24 October) [...] "I ha(ve) been more than loyal to French and {{did my best to}} stop all criticism of him or his methods … I ha(ve) {{come to the conclusion that}} it (i)s not fair to the Empire to retain French in command. [...] Moreover, none of my officers commanding corps had a high opinion of Sir John's military ability or military views; in fact they had no confidence in him. [...] Robertson quite agreed <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> saying [...] "he knew how to act, and would report to Stamfordham" [...] ". Robertson thought (24 October) that French's [...] "mind was never the same for two consecutive minutes" [...] and that his ideas were [...] "reckless and impossible" [...] and that he had poor relations with Joffre.|$|E

6000|$|... "He didn't say, I {{wanted to}} {{question}} him further, but {{a man who was}} standing on a corner, some distance away, beckoned to him, <b>and</b> he <b>left</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> joined the man, and the two walked off." ...|$|R
