5|$|Knox's final {{encounter}} with Mary {{was prompted by}} an incident at Holyrood. While Mary was absent from Edinburgh on her summer progress in 1563, a crowd forced its way into her private chapel as Mass was being celebrated. During the altercation, the priest's life was threatened. As a result, two of the ringleaders, burgesses of Edinburgh, were scheduled for trial on 24 October 1563. In order to defend these men, Knox sent out letters calling the nobles to convene. Mary obtained one of these letters and asked her advisors if {{this was not a}} treasonable act. Stewart and Maitland, wanting to keep good relations with both the Kirk and the Queen, asked Knox to <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> was wrong and to settle the matter quietly. Knox refused and he defended himself in front of Mary and the Privy Council. He argued that he had called a legal, not an illegal, assembly as part of his duties as a minister of the Kirk. After he left, the councillors voted not to charge him with treason.|$|E

25|$|That {{same year}} BBC TV started its Pot Black series.

Nevertheless, he would be runner-up in the 1971 series (to John Spencer) and {{achieved}} the highest break in the 1970, 1971 and 1975 series.|$|E

25|$|A {{feature film}} version of the serial was shot in eleven days in December 1973 in colour on 16mm film and then blown up to 35mm. The film {{features}} nearly all the show's regular cast {{as well as more}} revealing nudity than was allowed on TV at the time. A gay kiss between Don and Simon was mysteriously cut from the movie after its Sydney season.

On another visit in May 1998, he becomes attracted to landlady Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) and they soon begin a relationship.

When Pat turns to Frank following an argument with Roy and is seen leaving his flat, Roy and Peggy believe Frank and Pat are having an affair. Peggy calls off her engagement and Roy speeds off in his car on a suicide bid but Frank manages to convince him that his relationship with Pat is now platonic. He and Roy bond, leading Frank to <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> got a young woman called Gemma pregnant in Manchester, and had a young son, Danny, of whom no one else is aware.|$|E
25|$|He was {{insulated}} by his wife, who selected {{matters for}} his attention and delegated others to his cabinet. Wilson temporarily resumed a perfunctory attendance at cabinet meetings. By February 1920, the President's true condition was publicly known. At issue was Wilson's fitness {{for the presidency}} {{at a time when}} the League fight was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze. No one close to him, including his wife, his physician, or personal assistant, was willing to <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> was unable to perform the duties of the presidency. Because of this complex case, and the subsequent realization of the difficulties that might have been experienced in the nuclear age if, instead of being assassinated in 1963, John F. Kennedy had been left in a permanent vegetative state on account of his brain injuries, the 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967 to allow the voluntary or forcible replacement of an unable or unwilling incumbent.|$|E
25|$|Three {{months after}} the Wests' assault trial, the couple {{committed}} their first known murder. The victim was a 19-year-old named Lynda Gough, with whom Fred and Rose became acquainted through a male lodger in early 1973. Gough regularly visited Cromwell Street, and {{is known to have}} engaged in affairs with two male lodgers. On 19 April, she moved into Cromwell Street, although on or about 20 April, other tenants were informed that she had been told to leave the household after she had hit one of their children. This story was repeated to the girl's mother when she contacted the Wests to enquire as to her daughter's whereabouts (although Rose had been wearing Lynda's clothing when she repeated this claim). When Lynda's dismembered body was found, her jaw was completely wrapped in both adhesive and surgical tape to silence her screams, and two small tubes had likely been inserted into her nasal cavities to facilitate breathing. Long sections of string and sections of knotted fabric were also discovered with her remains. Lynda had likely been suspended from holes carved into the wooden beams supporting the ceiling of the cellar Fred would later <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> had devised for the purpose of suspending his victims' bodies, and likely died of strangulation or suffocation. Her dismembered body, missing five cervical vertebrae bones in addition to her patellae and numerous phalange bones, was buried in an inspection pit beneath the garage.|$|E

500|$|The Porto manager, Jos√© Mourinho, led {{his team}} to the Champions League title the {{following}} year before moving to Chelsea. Reflecting on the final, Mourinho was happy to <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> played part of a historic moment in football. He said, [...] "As a football game, Celtic-Porto in Seville was the most exciting football game I have ever been involved in. An unbelievable game.

The infraction reduced him in rank from cadet captain to cadet private, characterized by Olds in his memoirs as [...] "only the second cadet {{in the history of}} West Point to earn that dubious honor." ...|$|E

When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that [...] "I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction", Eichmann said he meant [...] "enemies of the Reich" [...] such as the Soviets.

500|$|Although he had {{intended}} to finish the version of [...] "Dark Horse" [...] taped at Friar Park with Voormann and Starr, Harrison decided to re-record the song with the tour band, live, on the sound stage at A Studios. The session took place on either 30 or 31 October, with Norm Kinney as engineer. Leng writes of this performance of [...] "Dark Horse": [...] "Anyone wondering what Harrison's voice sounded like on the Dark Horse Tour need look no further: this track was cut only days before the first date in Vancouver. Although the band sounded good, his voice was in shreds..." [...] Later, Harrison would <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "knackered" [...] {{by the time he}} arrived in Los Angeles, having simply taken on too much over the previous year.

Furthermore, he wrote that there [...] "was a lot of really funny stuff tonight" [...] and highlighted [...] "the scene between Darryl and Michael" [...] due to Robinson's acting. Aubry D'Arminio from Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "Mike's embarrassment, and his unwillingness at first to <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> is disliked, was very very well played on Carell's part." [...] Furthermore, D'Arminio praised several of the episode's lines of dialogue and wrote [...] "I cannot even come near to picking a favorite quote [...] for this episode" ...|$|E
