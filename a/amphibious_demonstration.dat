5|$|Resolution 1313 was a {{significant}} shift in attitude for UNAMSIL, away from its previous neutrality to support of the Sierra Leone government, a shift that made the governments of several troop-contributing nations uncomfortable. In particular, the governments of Jordan and India—two of the largest contributors, with nearly 5,000 troops between them serving with UNAMSIL—were moved to withdraw their forces. The withdrawal coincided {{with the end of}} the rainy season, after which there were fears that the RUF would resume its advance towards Freetown, and the UN and British government feared that UNAMSIL would be vulnerable. As a deterrent, the ARG was once more deployed off the coast, and was instructed to conduct <b>amphibious</b> landing <b>demonstrations</b> as a show of force.|$|R

[...] The objective was to fix the six Iraqi divisions deployed along the Kuwaiti coast.

The operation was extremely successful in keeping more than 41,000 Iraqi forces from repositioning to the main battlefield. As a result, the Marines maneuvered through the Iraq defense of southern Kuwait and outflanked the Iraqi coastal defense forces.|$|E

50|$|The CNOA was {{to assert}} the French Navy's {{capability}} to perform <b>amphibious</b> assaults, withdrawals, <b>demonstrations,</b> and raids. This {{would allow the}} French Navy to further integrate into the doctrinal frameworks described by NATO's Allied Tactical Publication 8B (ATP8) and the European Amphibious Initiative. While the CNOA made air capabilities a priority, it also recommended {{an increase in the}} number of vehicles and personnel that could be transported and deployed; the CNOA fixed the aim to project a force comprising four combat companies (1,400 men, 280 vehicles, and 30 helicopters) for ten days, in a 100 kilometre-deep sector; this force should be able to intervene either anywhere within 5000 kilometres of the French metropole, or in support of French oversea territories or allies. As well as joint operations with NATO and EU forces, any proposed ship had to be capable of inter-service operations with the Troupes de Marine brigades of the French Army.|$|R
5000|$|After {{spending}} 1960 {{operating with}} Task Group ALFA, DesRon 2 undertook training both at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Norfolk, Virginia, where ships also underwent overhaul in 1961, and operated {{in support of}} Project Mercury space shot operations. In addition, Soley proceeded to the waters off the Dominican Republic, in readiness to evacuate Americans if unrest should arise {{in the wake of}} the assassination of Rafael Trujillo, as did Borie and Wallace L. Lind, after which the latter two ships [...] "chased Project Mercury shots…and a myriad of other assignments." [...] On 9 September 1961, the Norfolk, Va., based Barton, Soley, John R. Pierce, English, and Hank proceeded to the Mediterranean to operate with the Sixth Fleet, leaving Borie and Wallace L. Lind in Norfolk, where they began Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) II conversions on 21 November and 22 December, respectively. The Mediterranean deployment involved fleet exercises as well as visits to liberty ports including Suda Bay, Crete; Piraeus, Greece; Naples and Genoa, Italy, and Monte Carlo, Monaco. Following her refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, the Fletcher (DD-445)-class Wren (DD-568), assigned to the squadron on 1 October 1961, joined the squadron for its Mediterranean deployment in January 1962, and returned to Norfolk with the squadron on 31 March 1962; she would remain assigned to DesRon 2 until 9 July, when she sailed to enter the Reserve Fleet at Galveston, Texas. Remaining briefly in port, the squadron - minus Borie and Wallace L. Lind - took part in an <b>amphibious</b> <b>demonstration</b> for President John F. Kennedy at Onslow Beach, North Carolina. Resuming Mercury shot recovery operations, John R. Pierce recovered the Aurora 7 capsule after a helicopter from USS Intrepid (CVS-11) had retrieved astronaut Lt. Comdr. M. Scott Carpenter, on 24 May 1962 off Puerto Rico.|$|E
