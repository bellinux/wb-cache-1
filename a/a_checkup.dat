25|$|Wherever he went, {{no matter}} how frail he was, he always promulgated Humanistic Buddhism. In November 1954, <b>a</b> <b>checkup</b> {{revealed}} that the master had long been inflicted with pulmonary tuberculosis. His lungs were calcified and the tracheae were abnormal. He needed to receive immediate medical treatment and get adequate rest. Still, he had to fly to the Philippines to give a series of lectures. When he finally returned to Taiwan, five months had passed. The trip took a heavy toll on his health. He barely {{had the strength to}} eat or talk. However, when people came to him with questions on Buddhism, he would summon his strength and answer spiritedly.|$|E
25|$|Esther Stutzman, {{who works}} as a {{receptionist}} in a doctor's office, also experiences a close call with Nazi policies when her friends Richard and Maria Klein, closeted Jews like herself, bring their ailing eight-month-old baby, Paul, in for <b>a</b> <b>checkup.</b> The diagnosis, Tay-Sachs disease, is a disease known to be prevalent among Jews. A subsequent investigation into his family background would spell doom for his parents and any names they might be forced to reveal under torture. Although Esther's husband, Walther, is able to hack into the Reich's computer network and change the Klein's family history, it is the revelation that Reichsführer-SS Lothar Prützmann has a nephew with Tay-Sachs that brings the investigation to a halt.|$|E

25|$|McCormick's {{body was}} found on June 30, 1999 near a West Alton, Missouri cornfield by a woman driving along a field road off Route 367. The reason he was 15 miles away from his current address is another mystery, as he did not own a car and the area is not served by public transportation. Though the body had already {{somewhat}} decomposed, authorities used fingerprints to identify McCormick. There was no indication that anyone had a motive to kill McCormick {{and no one had}} reported him missing, so the authorities initially ruled out homicide, but no cause of death was officially determined at the time.
