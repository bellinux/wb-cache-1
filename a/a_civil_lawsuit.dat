5|$|After {{leaving the}} D-League, Clinkscales signed in 2013 with the Panama City Breeze of the semi-professional American Basketball League (ABL), with no {{indication}} that he joined any other team since his tenure with the BayHawks. On February 16, 2013, he scored 12 points with two three-pointers in a loss to the Emerald Coast Knights. While with the Breeze, Clinkscales (and his teammates) endured financial and domestic difficulties. He lived with five other teammates in a duplex house in Bay County, Florida. Because of financial issues, the league failed to pay the players—with Clinkscales solely receiving a check of $400—and canceled several games on its schedule. Later in the season, the players' duplex was supposedly leased by Breeze's head coach, Ty Fisher. A local broker filed <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>lawsuit</b> against Fisher to evict the players, and county sheriff deputies soon forced them to leave the house. While living in the area, the players received aid from a local resident, Vonda Gainer, who they met at a Dollar Tree store. Gainer gave them food and washed their clothes. Despite their poor living conditions, the players failed to receive any aid by the league, with no contact or assurance from league CEO Steve Haney.|$|E
5|$|Gui {{returned}} to China in 1999 {{and started a}} daughter company in Ningbo for a Swedish company known in Chinese as Tangyou (唐友), offering air purification products. Gui {{was involved in a}} drink-driving incident in Ningbo in December 2003 in which a 23-year-old girl was killed while crossing the road. The victim's mother disagreed with the police investigation report that her daughter should bear secondary responsibility for not paying attention to traffic, since she had heard from witnesses that the car had been speeding, so she risked her life to experiment on herself {{with the help of her}} son and a driver for 10 days, demonstrating that the driving speed had to exceed 110 km/h for the accident to occur. She appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, which upon reexamination concluded that Gui should bear full responsibility for the incident in May 2004. Her experiment was widely reported in the Chinese media. The victim's parents later filed <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>lawsuit</b> against Gui for compensation. The Ningbo Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled the following August that Gui had committed a crime, for which Gui received a two-year suspended jail term. He then departed for Germany, thus violated his probation terms. In 2004, after leaving China, he worked for a German affiliate of Nordpool Consulting.|$|E
