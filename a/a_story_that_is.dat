For instance, Abhijñānaśākuntala by the renowned Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa (c. 400 CE), believed to {{have lived in the}} era of the Gupta dynasty, is based on <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the precursor to the Mahābhārata. Urubhaṅga, a Sanskrit play written by Bhāsa who is believed to have lived before Kālidāsa, is based on the slaying of Duryodhana by the splitting of his thighs by Bhīma.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, {{the current}} revival of her {{reputation}} rides {{on the work}} Oroonoko (1688), <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> taken to promote modern, progressive views on gender, race and class. Todd maintains that the fiction has been co-opted by modern interests and that such views are not views that Behn clearly expressed. Her reputation is not helped {{by the fact that}} almost nothing is known of her first 27 years; and while she was a pioneer, she also faced debt for much of her life and was a propagandist and writer for hire. She was ambitious, desiring fame and literary prestige, which for a woman of the time and in times since, is often regarded as suspect.|$|E

With [...] "Only the Lonely", co-written with Joe Melson and {{recorded}} by Bill Porter, Orbison's songs turned to introspective and plaintive ballads, and they fully employed his powerful three-octave vocal range backed by more orchestral accompaniment.

In 1992, Frederick Busch wrote in The New York Times that Hemingway had gone out of fashion. While his antisemitism, racism, violence, and attitudes toward women and homosexuals made him objectionable by current standards, he turned violence into art unlike any other American writer of his time by showing that [...] "the making of art is a matter of life or death, no less". Busch believes Hemingway's characters either faced life or chose death, a choice shown most starkly in [...] "Indian Camp". The saving of a life in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] {{is at the center of}} much of Hemingway's fiction, Busch writes, and adds power to his fiction.|$|E

The film had a wide national release, advertising theaters include those in Indiana, Kansas, Utah, Wisconsin, North Carolina, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio. The Billboard reviewed the film and offered praise for the production, [...] "This picture presents <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> decidedly original and away from beaten paths. The settings in Turkey are elaborate and faithful to Turkish customs. All the players portray their respective parts in an excellent manner. The photography is very good." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror provided {{a summary of the}} film and concluded that the film [...] "was well enacted and the sets were fully adequate, creating a fair illusion of the Oriental land depicted." [...] The Moving Picture World was also provided a positive review, stating [...] "The scenic effects are interesting and the story is lively enough to keep the audience wondering what the end will be."

2500|$|To reach {{a broader}} audience, Bly wrote several books to assist others in {{learning}} to write well.

2500|$|Jeffrey Lilburn {{notes that}} some find [...] "the {{suffering}} endured by Wharton's characters is excessive and unjustified," [...] but others see the difficult moral questions addressed and {{note that it}} [...] "provides insightful commentary on the American economic and cultural realities that produced and allowed such suffering." [...] Wharton was always careful to label Ethan Frome as a tale rather than a novel. Critics did take note of this when reviewing the book. Elizabeth Ammons compared the work to fairy tales. She found <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> [...] "as moral as the classic fairy tale" [...] and that functions as a [...] "realistic social criticism." [...] The moral concepts, as described by Ammons, are revealed {{with all of the}} brutality of Starkfield's winters. Comparing Mattie Silver and Zeena Frome, Ammons suggests that the Matties will grow as frigid and crippled as the Zeenas, so long as such women remain isolated and dependent. Wharton cripples Mattie, says Lilburn, but has her survive in order to demonstrate the cruelty of the culture surrounding women in that period.|$|E

2500|$|Sir Eglamour of Artois is a Middle English verse romance {{that was}} written {{sometime}} around 1350. It is a narrative poem of about 1300 lines, a tail-rhyme romance that was quite popular in its day, judging {{from the number of}} copies that have survived – four manuscripts from the 15th century or earlier and a manuscript and five printed editions from the 16th century. The poem tells <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> constructed from a large number of elements found in other medieval romances and modern scholarly opinion has been critical of it because of this, describing it as unimaginative and of poor quality. Medieval romance as a genre, however, concerns the reworking of [...] "the archetypal images of romance" [...] and if this poem is viewed from a 15th-century perspective as well as from a modern standpoint – and it was obviously once very popular, even being adapted into a play in 1444 – one might find a [...] "romance [...] is carefully structured, the action highly unified, the narration lively." ...|$|E

[...] Grey again gave it a 7.9 writing, [...] "Now that the personalities of the Fearless Defenders are slotting into place and the shady force behind the rise of the Doom Maidens is amping up her villainy, The Fearless Defenders is shaping up to be one of the more unique and enjoyable titles in Marvel's monthly lineup." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shubik {{began work}} and soon found that finding science fiction stories {{suitable}} for adaptation {{was a difficult}} task. She later recalled “I had to read hundreds of stories to pick a dozen. You {{have no idea how}} difficult some of these authors are to deal with, and it seems a special thing among SF writers to hedge themselves behind almost impossible copyright barriers, even when they have got <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> possible to do on television. So many you can't. Either the conception is so way out you would need a fantastic budget to produce it, or the story is too short, too tight to be padded out to make an hour's television”. When working on Out of this World Shubik had made a valuable contact in John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction publishing. He was the founder of science fiction magazine New Worlds and agent for many of Britain's science fiction writers. Carnell was able to suggest stories and authors for Shubik to consider. Shubik received copies of science fiction anthologies from British publishers and also sought advice from many authors including Frederik Pohl, Alfred Bester and Robert Silverberg. [...] The latter two admitted to Shubik that they had run into similar difficulties in finding suitable material for television adaptation. Shubik considered asking Nigel Kneale if he would write a new Quatermass story for the series, and contacted Arthur C. Clarke regarding the possibility of adapting his novel The Deep Range.|$|E

2500|$|In 1923 he {{made his}} {{literary}} debut by publishing the mystery story [...] under the pen name [...] "Edogawa Ranpo" [...] (pronounced quickly, this humorous pseudonym sounds much like {{the name of the}} American pioneer of detective fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, whom he admired). The story appeared in the magazine Shin Seinen, a popular magazine written largely for an adolescent audience. Shin Seinen had previously published stories by a variety of Western authors including Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, and G. K. Chesterton, {{but this was the first}} time the magazine published a major piece of mystery fiction by a Japanese author. Some, such as James B. Harris (Ranpo's first translator into English), have erroneously called this the first piece of modern mystery fiction by a Japanese writer, but well before Ranpo entered the literary scene in 1923, a number of other modern Japanese authors such as Ruikō Kuroiwa, Kidō Okamoto, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Haruo Satō, and Kaita Murayama had incorporated elements of sleuthing, mystery, and crime within stories involving adventure, intrigue, the bizarre, and the grotesque. What struck critics as new about Ranpo’s debut story [...] "The Two-Sen Copper Coin" [...] was that it focused on the logical process of ratiocination used to solve a mystery within <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> closely related to Japanese culture.
