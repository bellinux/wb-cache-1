25|$|In 1814 {{following}} the War of 1812, the United States established Fort Gratiot {{at the base}} of Lake Huron. French colonists had a temporary trading post and fort at this site in the 17th century, but this developed as the first settled European-American population in the area. Until 1836, an Ojibwa reservation occupied land in part of the modern <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>Port</b> Huron. They were removed to west of the Mississippi in Wisconsin and Minnesota.|$|E
25|$|The next European {{visit to}} the area was by the explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell. They reached the {{northern}} edge of Corio Bay - the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>Port</b> Phillip that Geelong now fronts - on 16 December 1824, and it was at this time they reported that the Aboriginals called the area Corayo, the bay being called Djillong. Hume and Hovell had been contracted to travel overland from Sydney to Port Phillip, and having achieved this, they stayed the night and began their return journey two days later on 18 December.|$|E

500|$|On 3 January 1927, {{following}} a venture out to Gunnamatta Bay, Gibbs was piloting a launch {{back into the}} Grays Point <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>Port</b> Hacking when a scream rang out. Gibbs looked up and noticed 15-year-old Mervyn Allum struggling in the water about [...] from the shore. Subsequent reports indicate that the other bathers first thought that Allum, who {{was known to be}} a good swimmer, was drowning. Gibbs, however, quickly realised that the youth's leg had been grabbed by a shark. Gibbs immediately dived into the water and swam towards the scene to render Allum assistance, as the latter struggled to fend off the shark. By now the water was red with blood. As Gibbs grabbed for Allum, the teenager was pulled under water. Gibbs had to strike at the shark with his legs and fists and grasp its dorsal fin before the shark would release its grip. While Gibbs' friend, Donald Campbell, rowed a boat towards the pair, Gibbs maintained a hold on the now unconscious Allum, trod water, and splashed to discourage further attacks. The shark continued to circle below during this time, at one point brushing past Gibbs' feet. As Campbell drew near, he and Gibbs managed to lift Allum aboard before Gibbs pulled himself clear of the water. Gibbs later reported that the flesh had been stripped from the ankle to the thigh on one of Allum's legs, and there was evidence of teeth and bite marks to Allum's hands and stomach; Allum was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.|$|E
2500|$|Modern Horta grew {{beyond the}} limits of this early colonization. [...] A {{secondary}} nucleus grew in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>Port</b> Pim, and infilling occurred sporadically until a crescent form {{along the banks of the}} east coast developed, only contained by Ponte de Espalamaca to the north and the open sea to the south. The cinder cones in the south likely protected settlers and ships from the north Atlantic weather systems, sheltering colonists during the formative period. Horta grew slowly into the river valleys to the interior, linking the parishes of Flamengos to the west and Feteiras (the southwest) forming an incomplete urbanized mass. [...] The nodes of growth basically follow the road network, including the recently completed [...] "Scute" [...] (freeway) that bypasses the southern E.R.1-1ª between Angustias and Feteiras.|$|E
