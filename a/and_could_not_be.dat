The supercharger broke down in April 1942, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> repaired because of equipment shortages and restricted dockyard access caused by World War II.|$|E

Chilembwe's forces held a strong defensive position along the Mbombwe river <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> pushed back. Two African government {{soldiers were killed}} and three were wounded; Chilembwe's losses have been estimated as about 20.|$|E

5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from the}} rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
5|$|At that time, many in Britain {{worried that}} coal {{reserves}} were rapidly dwindling, {{but some experts}} opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase {{the rate at which}} England's coal deposits were being depleted, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> relied upon to solve the problem.|$|E

5|$|Between January and March 1916, Townshend {{launched}} several {{attacks in}} an attempt to lift the siege. In sequence, the attacks took place at the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad, the Battle of the Wadi, the Battle of Hanna, and the Battle of Dujaila Redoubt. These attempts to break through the encirclement did not succeed and the cost was heavy with both sides suffering high casualties. In February food, and hopes were running out for Townshend in Kut-al-Amara. Disease spread rapidly <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> contained or cured and Townshend surrendered in April 1916. In December 1916, the 3rd and 7th Divisions arrived from the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Chinese-American cook Wong Kim Ark, who {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1873, had been denied {{re-entry}} to the United States after a trip abroad, under a law restricting Chinese immigration and prohibiting immigrants from China (the Great Qing) from becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. He challenged the government's refusal to recognize his citizenship, and the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, holding that the citizenship language in the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed the circumstances of his birth <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> limited in its effect by an act of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Diderot, Mirabeau and Vergniaud briefly {{participated in}} the {{occupation}} of Constantinople {{after the end of}} the war and the latter two ships were sent to the Black Sea in early 1919 during the Southern Russia Intervention. Vergniauds crew mutinied after one of its members was killed when a protest against intervention in support of the Whites was bloodily suppressed and forced the return of the French ships supporting the Whites. Mirabeau ran aground in February 1919 off the coast of the Crimea <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> refloated until some of her guns and armor were removed.|$|E

5|$|Edgar Quinet was {{converted}} into a training ship in the mid-1920s, a role she filled {{for the remainder of}} the decade. On 4 January 1930, she ran aground off the Algerian coast <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> freed. She sank five days later. Waldeck-Rousseau had meanwhile been assigned as the flagship of the Far East fleet in 1929, where she remained until 1932, when she returned to France. She was decommissioned upon arrival, hulked in 1936, and broken up for scrap in 1941â€“44.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same steps <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> regulated to {{serve the needs of}} the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her passengers and cargo, De Soto also acted as a conduit for news between Cuba and the United States. Most of the news conveyed by De Soto was of a mundane characterfor example, reports of activity on the Havana sugar marketbut sometimes it was of more interest. In October 1860 for instance, De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves. The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> retrieved.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{extractive}} industries of the West of Scotland underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. A similar process took place in the iron and steel production industries, and the medium scale iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway branch lines had been heavily dependent on business from the mineral industries, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sustained when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities.|$|E
5|$|In the unbroadcast pilot We Are Mongrels, another {{character}} was included called Debbie. Debbie was a suicidal chicken who never left her coop. However, {{it was decided}} that the character did not go anywhere <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sustained for a full series, so the {{character was}} axed. Another chicken character called Wendy appeared in the first broadcast episode as a reference to Debbie. Both characters had the same voice actress, Ruth Bratt, who performed Wendy's voice in exactly the same manner as that of Debbie.|$|E

5|$|The British {{continued}} their policy of stalling Smith. At {{the end of}} August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an immediate threat, and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained defiance of the mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's stand on the issue for Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia had been told just before Federal dissolution that it would retain the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this entrustment was subject to British discretion, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to Britain's line.|$|E
5|$|The Corporation of Doncaster sought {{powers in}} 1727 {{to improve the}} river below Holmstile, as far as Wilsick House in Barnby Dun. The Bill passed through {{parliament}} uneventfully, and again included detailed restrictions on what could <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> done, {{designed to protect the}} landowners. The details were very specific in that they included the permissible heights of dams, the maximum length of cuts, and many other details of the work to be carried out.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{also decided}} whether foreign {{corporations}} are also within {{the jurisdiction of}} a state, ruling that a foreign corporation which sued in a state court {{in which it was}} not licensed to do business to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another state was within the jurisdiction <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> subjected to unequal burdens in the maintenance of the suit. When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to equal protection of the laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations.|$|E
