50|$|When the link-local IPv4 address {{block was}} reserved, no {{standards}} existed for mechanisms of address autoconfiguration. Filling the void, Microsoft created an implementation {{that is called}} Automatic Private IP Addressing (<b>APIPA).</b> <b>APIPA</b> has been deployed on millions of machines and has, thus, become a de facto standard in the industry. In RFC 3927, the IETF defined a formal standard for this functionality, entitled Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses.|$|E

5000|$|The {{address a}} host assigns to itself when address request via DHCP has failed, {{provided}} the host's IP stack supports this. This usage {{has been replaced}} with the <b>APIPA</b> mechanism in modern operating systems.|$|E

5000|$|Windows 98 {{networking}} enhancements to TCP/IP include {{built-in support}} for Winsock 2, SMB signing, a new IP Helper API, Automatic Private IP Addressing (<b>APIPA)</b> (also known as link-local addressing), IP multicasting (including IGMPv2 support and ICMP Router Discovery - [...] ), and performance enhancements for high-speed high bandwidth networks (TCP large windows and time stamps - , Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) - , TCP Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery). Multihoming support with TCP/IP is improved and includes RIP listener support.|$|E
50|$|Both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts may {{randomly}} {{generate the}} host-specific {{part of an}} autoconfigured address. IPv6 hosts generally combine a prefix of up to 64 bits with a 64-bit EUI-64 derived from the factory-assigned 48-bit IEEE MAC address. The MAC address {{has the advantage of}} being globally unique, a property inherited by the EUI-64. The IPV6 protocol stack includes duplicate address detection to avoid conflicts with other hosts. In IPv4, the method is called link-local address autoconfiguration. However, Microsoft refers to this as Automatic Private IP Addressing (<b>APIPA)</b> or Internet Protocol Automatic Configuration (IPAC) (supported since at least Windows 98).|$|E
40|$|The {{exploitation}} of New and Renewable Energy {{is a priority}} {{for the implementation of}} the policy of Decentralized Rural Electrification (DRE). The high plateau and the East slope of Madagascar abound in potentiality for the installation of micro and pico hydroelectric power plant. Unfortunately the lack of hydrological data penalizes the development of this choice. The modeling of the annual mode of the small rivers is then necessary to allow the reliability of the feasibility studies relatively short for the size of these power stations. The database of the ‘Autorité pour la Protection contre les Inondations de la Plaine d’Antananarivo ’ (<b>APIPA)</b> are used during modeling with the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The global model obtained is parsimonious and ended in satisfactory results allowing the reconstitution of the annual mode of the small rivers with weak hydrological data...|$|E
