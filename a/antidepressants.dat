5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} <b>antidepressants,</b> and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of <b>antidepressants,</b> it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other <b>antidepressants.</b>|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all <b>antidepressants,</b> including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that <b>antidepressants</b> may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 <b>antidepressants</b> in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Depressive episodes {{are common}} in bipolar {{disorder}}, and the disorder is characterized by high suicide rates. Recent analyses indicate a possible association of <b>antidepressant</b> treatment and suicidality in children and adults with depressive or anxiety disorders. However, few data are available to inform the suicidality risk assessment of <b>antidepressant</b> use specifically in bipolar disorder. METHOD: Of the first 2000 participants followed for 18 months in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD), 425 experienced a prospectively observed, new-onset major depressive episode without initial suicidal ideation. Standardized ratings of suicidality and <b>antidepressant</b> exposure at index depressive episode and next evaluation were used to investigate the primary hypothesis that new-onset suicidality was associated with increased <b>antidepressant</b> exposure (<b>antidepressant</b> initiation or dose increase). Secondary analysis investigated correlates of new-onset suicidality and <b>antidepressant</b> exposure. Data were collected from November 8, 1999, to April 24, 2002. RESULTS: Twenty-four participants (5. 6 %) developed new-onset suicidality at follow-up, including 2 suicide attempts. There was no association of new-onset suicidality with increased <b>antidepressant</b> exposure or any change in <b>antidepressant</b> exposure, and no association with initiation of <b>antidepressant</b> treatment. New-onset suicidality was associated with neuroticism, prior attempt, and higher depressive or manic symptom ratings at index episode. Increased <b>antidepressant</b> exposure was negatively associated with higher manic symptom rating at index episode; control for this sole empirically identified confound did not alter the primary results. CONCLUSIONS: Although careful monitoring for suicidality is always warranted in bipolar disorder, this cohort study provides no evidence that increased <b>antidepressant</b> exposure is associated with new-onset suicidality in this already high-risk population. Correlates of both suicidality and <b>antidepressant</b> exposure indicate directions for further research...|$|R
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few <b>antidepressants</b> {{that does}} not cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies {{demonstrate}} that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other <b>antidepressants,</b> but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction. According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, although this is not an indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{effect of}} recent {{increases}} in <b>antidepressant</b> prescribing on population suicide rates is uncertain. AIMS: To investigate {{the relationship between}} <b>antidepressant</b> sales and trends in suicide rates. METHOD: Graphical and quantitative assessment of trends in suicide and <b>antidepressant</b> sales in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. RESULTS: Suicide rates declined in all four countries during the 1990 s, whereas <b>antidepressant</b> sales increased by 3 - to 4 -fold. Decreasing suicide rates in Sweden and Denmark preceded the rise in <b>antidepressant</b> sales by over 10 years, although the reductions accelerated between 1988 and 1990. In Norway, a modest but short-lived decline in suicide rates began {{around the time of}} the increase in <b>antidepressant</b> sales. In Finland, decreases in male suicide rates and to a lesser extent in female suicide rates began around the time of increased <b>antidepressant</b> sales. In all four countries decreases in suicide rates appeared to precede the widespread use of SSRIs. CONCLUSIONS: We found mixed evidence that increases in <b>antidepressant</b> sales have coincided with a reduction in the number of suicides in Nordic countries...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the down-regulation of the signaling pathway involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a molecular element known to regulate neuronal plasticity and survival, {{plays an important role}} in the pathogenesis of major depression. The restoration of BDNF activity induced by <b>antidepressant</b> treatment has been implicated in the <b>antidepressant</b> therapeutic mechanism. Because there is variability among patients with major depressive disorder in terms of response to <b>antidepressant</b> treatment and since genetic factors may contribute to this inter-individual variability in <b>antidepressant</b> response, pharmacogenetic studies have tested the associations between genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes related to <b>antidepressant</b> therapeutic action. In human BDNF gene, there is a common functional polymorphism (Val 66 Met) in the pro-region of BDNF, which affects the intracellular trafficking of proBDNF. Because of the potentially important role of BDNF in the <b>antidepressant</b> mechanism, many pharmacogenetic studies have tested the association between this polymorphism and the <b>antidepressant</b> therapeutic response, but they have produced inconsistent results. A recent metaanalysis of eight studies, which included data from 1, 115 subjects, suggested that the Val/Met carriers have increased <b>antidepressant</b> response in comparison to Val/Val homozygotes, particularly in the Asian population. The positive molecular heterosis effect (subjects heterozygous for a specific genetic polymorphism show a significantly greater effect) is compatible with animal studies showing that, although BDNF exerts an <b>antidepressant</b> effect, too much BDNF may have a detrimental effect on mood. Several recommendations are proposed for future <b>antidepressant</b> pharmacogenetic studies of BDNF, including the consideration of multiple polymorphisms and a haplotype approach, gene-gene interaction, a single <b>antidepressant</b> regimen, controlling for age and gender interactions, and pharmacogeneti...|$|R
5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different <b>antidepressants</b> was unsuccessful.

CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than <b>antidepressants</b> in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E

40|$|AbstractInvestigations of {{the effects}} of <b>antidepressant</b> {{treatment}} for individuals with major depression have focused on short-term outcomes in individuals that meet very specific criteria; however, there is limited knowledge about long-term outcomes associated with <b>antidepressant</b> use in general population samples. This study aimed to investigate the long-term outcomes associated with <b>antidepressant</b> use by focusing on 486 depressed adults in a prospective observational Canadian cohort in 1998 / 99. We used logistic regression to investigate the association between <b>antidepressant</b> use and depression status 8 years later. Non-random allocation to treatment was accounted for by a propensity-for-treatment model which included thirteen predictors of <b>antidepressant</b> use, including: severity of depressive symptoms, previous episodes of depression (from 1994 to 1997), physical health condition, social support and socio-demographic characteristics. 29 % of individuals with major depression reported <b>antidepressant</b> use.

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other <b>antidepressants</b> is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of <b>antidepressants</b> may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among <b>antidepressants</b> in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E

40|$|A {{debilitating}} mental disorder, major depressive {{disorder is}} {{a leading cause of}} global disease burden. Existing <b>antidepressant</b> drugs are not adequate for the majority of depressed patients, and large clinical studies have demonstrated their limited efficacy and slow response onset. Growing evidence of low-dose ketamine’s rapid and potent <b>antidepressant</b> effects offers strong potential for future <b>antidepressant</b> agents. However, ketamine has considerable drawbacks such as its abuse potential, psychomimetic effects, and increased oxidative stress in the brain, thus limiting its widespread clinical use. To develop superior <b>antidepressant</b> drugs, it is crucial to better understand ketamine’s <b>antidepressant</b> mechanism of action. Recent preclinical studies indicate that ketamine’s <b>antidepressant</b> mechanism involves mammalian target of rapamycin pathway activation and subsequent synaptogenesis in the prefrontal cortex, as well as glycogen synthase kinase- 3 beta (GSK- 3 B) inactivation. Adjunct GSK- 3 B inhibitors, such as lithium, can enhance ketamine’s efficacy by augmenting and prolonging its <b>antidepressant</b> effects.

40|$|Major {{depressive}} {{disorder is}} among the most commonly diagnosed disabling mental diseases. Several non-pharmacological treatments of depression upregulate adenosine concentration and/or adenosine A 1 receptors (A 1 R) in the brain. To test whether enhanced A 1 R signaling mediates <b>antidepressant</b> effects, we generated a transgenic mouse with enhanced doxycycline-regulated A 1 R expression, specifically in forebrain neurons.

Various <b>antidepressant</b> treatments increase homer 1 a expression in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).
