40|$|It is {{essential}} to evaluate safety of marine traffic {{for the improvement of}} efficiency and safety of marine traffic. Spread of AIS makes observation of actual marine traffic more easily and faster than before. Besides, description of collision avoidance behaviours of ships are indispensable to simulate a realistic marine traffic. It is important to develop and implement an algorithm of collision avoidance corresponding to a target traffic or target area into the marine traffic simulation because actual <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>collision</b> avoidance depend on circumstances where ships are sailing. The authors developed an automated marine traffic simulation system with AIS data. And in this paper, we proposed a series of systematic procedures for marine traffic simulation including analysing <b>for</b> <b>collision</b> avoidance behaviours using AIS data...|$|R
40|$|This report {{details the}} {{development}} and demonstration of a <b>collision</b> control technology <b>for</b> P&H-class mining shovels that minimizes the frequency and severity of dipper collisions between the bucket, crawler tracks and floor. The work was funded by ACARP as project C 15038. The collision control technology uses a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework whereby control <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> preventing <b>collisions,</b> are chosen based on the predicted future behaviour of the shovel. The system predicts future locations of the dipper over a receding time horizon using a set of mathematical models that are driven by the operator’s joystick commands. The prediction models incorporate the shovel’s electro-mechanical dynamics for hoist, crowd and swing motions. Predicted future bucket positions are tested <b>for</b> <b>collisions</b> using computational geometry algorithms on VRML models of the bucket, crawler tracks and floor. If a collision is predicted, the collision prevention algorithms calculate the minimum change to the operator’s command that will avoid the collision by a specified clearance distance. The altered joystick references are then passed to the P&H Centurion control system over the shovel’s PROFIBUS control bus. The technology has been successfully demonstrated on the CRCMining P&H 2100 BLE research shovel at Bracalba Quarry in Queensland and on a P&H 4100 A at Caballo Mine in Wyoming USA. The technology is currently being commercialized by P&H Mining Equipment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany {{authors have}} assumed that motor <b>actions</b> {{required}} <b>for</b> <b>collision</b> avoidance and <b>for</b> <b>collision</b> achievement (<b>for</b> example, in driving a car or hitting a ball) are guided by monitoring the time to collision (TTC), {{and that this is}} done on the basis of moment-to-moment values of the optical variable τ [1 – 3]. This assumption has also motivated the search for single neurons that fire when τ is a certain value [4 – 8]. Almost all of the laboratory studies and all the animal experiments were restricted to the case of stationary observer and moving object. On the face of it, this would seem reasonable. Even though humans and other animals routinely perform visually guided actions that require the TTC of an approaching object to be estimated while the observer is moving, τ provides an accurate estimate of TTC regardless of whether the approach is produced by self-motion, object-motion or a combination of both. One might therefore expect that judgements of TTC would be independent of self-motion. We report here, however, that simulated self-motion using a peripheral flow field substantially altered estimates of TTC for an approaching object, even though the peripheral flow field did not affect the value of τ for the approaching object. This finding points to long range interactions between collision-sensitive visual neurons and neural mechanisms for processing self-motion...|$|R
40|$|In {{this letter}} we derive an <b>action</b> {{principle}} <b>for</b> Coulomb <b>collisions</b> in plasmas. Although no natural Lagrangian exists for the Landau-Fokker-Planck equation, an Eulerian variational formulation is found considering {{the system of}} partial differential equations that couple the distribution function and the Rosenbluth potentials. Exact conservation laws are derived after generalizing the energy-momentum stress tensor for second order Lagrangians and, {{in the case of}} a test-particle population in a given plasma background, the action principle is shown to correspond to the Langevin equation for individual particles. Being suitable for discretization, the presented action allows construction of variational integrators. Numerical implementation is left for a future study. Comment: 4 page...|$|R

A (k, l) -robust {{combiner}} <b>for</b> <b>collision</b> resistant hash functions is a construction, {{which takes}} l hash func-tions and combines {{them so that}} if at least k of the compo-nents are collision resistant, then so is the resulting com-bination. A black-box (k, l) -robust combiner is robust com-biner, which takes its components as black-boxes. A trivial black-box combiner is concatenation of any (l−k+ 1) of the hash functions.
