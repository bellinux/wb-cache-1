50|$|In 1958, surplus J33s {{were used}} in jet donkeys pushing dead loads at 200 knots to test <b>aircraft</b> carrier <b>arresting</b> gear <b>cables</b> and tailhooks at Lakehurst.|$|R
2500|$|Prior {{to making}} an [...] "arrested landing", the pilot lowers the hook {{so that it}} will contact the ground as the {{aircraft}} wheels touch down. [...] The hook then drags along the surface until an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable,</b> stretched across the landing area, is engaged. [...] The cable lets out, transferring the energy of the <b>aircraft</b> to the <b>arresting</b> gear through the cable. [...] A [...] "trap" [...] is often-used slang for an arrested landing. [...] An aircraft which lands beyond the <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> is said to have [...] "boltered." [...] Occasionally, the tailhook bounces over {{one or more of the}} wires, resulting in a [...] "hook skip bolter." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Arresting</b> <b>cable</b> {{systems were}} invented by Hugh Robinson and were {{utilized}} by Eugene Ely {{on his first}} landing on a ship - the armored cruiser USS Pennsylvania, on January 18, 1911. These early systems had cables run through pulleys and attached to dead weights, such as sandbags. More modern <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> were tested on HMS Courageous in June 1931.|$|R

Finally the conclusion is that this auto net setting up equipment used on <b>aircraft</b> <b>arresting</b> system can make estimation timely, fleetly and accurately, give control signal, set up <b>arresting</b> net, <b>arrest</b> <b>aircraft</b> and ensure landing safety when the velocity of the aircraft is fall short of secure regulation...|$|R
50|$|Although STOVL {{aircraft}} {{are capable of}} taking off vertically from {{a spot on the}} deck, using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight. As catapults are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for complex steam or electromagnetic launching equipment, vertical landing aircraft also remove the need for <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> and related hardware. Russian, Chinese, and future Indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> and a tailhook on their aircraft.|$|R

5000|$|The {{purchase}} {{cable is}} a wire rope that looks {{very similar to}} the <b>arresting</b> <b>cable.</b> They are much longer, however, and are not designed to be easily removed. There are two purchase <b>cables</b> per <b>arresting</b> <b>cable,</b> and they connect to each end of the <b>arresting</b> wire. Purchase <b>cables</b> connect the <b>arresting</b> wire to the arresting gear engines and [...] "pay out" [...] as the arresting wire is engaged by the aircraft. As an incoming aircraft engages the deck pendant, the purchase cable transmits the force of the landing aircraft from the deck gear to the arresting engine. The pendant (arresting wire) is [...] "swaged" [...] (attached) to the purchase cable by means of a loop created with zinc heated to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This onboard fabrication is considered dangerous, and it is reported the Navy is testing the use of an automated press to accomplish it more safely. On land based systems, heavy nylon tapes are used in place of purchase cables, but they serve the same function.|$|R
50|$|The Arresting Gear Officer (AGO) is {{responsible}} for arresting gear operation, settings, and monitoring landing area deck status (the deck is either clear and ready to land aircraft or foul and not ready for landing). Arresting gear engines are set to apply varying resistance (weight setting) to the <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> based {{on the type of}} aircraft landing.|$|R
50|$|Some airports, {{typically}} military airbases, {{have long}} runways used as emergency landing sites. Many airbases have arresting equipment for fast <b>aircraft,</b> known as <b>arresting</b> gear - a strong cable suspended {{just above the}} runway and attached to a hydraulic reduction gear mechanism. Together with the landing <b>aircraft's</b> <b>arresting</b> hook, it is used in situations where the aircraft's brakes would be insufficient by themselves.|$|R
500|$|... 5 September 2005: a Russian Navy Su-33's <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> broke after {{a landing}} on the Admiral Kuznetsov in the Northern Atlantic at high speed. The pilot ejected and was recovered. The plane was {{initially}} planned to be destroyed with depth charges to prevent the recovery of classified equipment. However, this {{did not take place}} as the aircraft did not carry sensitive equipment. The crash was captured on video.|$|R
50|$|Currently Finland conducts drills on its road bases (maantietukikohta), around once a year. In the Baana 16 {{exercise}} in 2016 the Finnish Air Force flew F/A-18C and BAE Hawk, Pilatus PC-12 and C295M aircraft from a highway in Lusi. The Finnish Air Force uses <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> to quickly stop F/A-18s, which were {{originally designed to}} operate from aircraft carriers.

5000|$|Modern {{carriers}} {{typically have}} three or four <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> laid across the landing area. All U.S. carriers in the Nimitz-class, along with Enterprise, have four wires, {{with the exception of the}} USS Ronald Reagan and USS George H.W. Bush, which have only three. The Gerald R. Ford-class carriers will also have three. Pilots aim for the second or third wire (depending on ship configuration) to reduce the risk of landing short. Aircraft coming in to land on a carrier are at approximately 85% of full throttle. At touchdown, the pilot advances the throttles to full power. In the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler aircraft, the aircraft automatically reduces engine thrust to 70% once the deceleration of a successful arrestment is detected. This feature can be overridden by the pilot by selecting max afterburner. If the aircraft fails to catch an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable,</b> a condition known as a [...] "bolter", the aircraft has sufficient power to continue down the angled flight deck and become airborne again. Once the arresting gear stops the aircraft, the pilot brings the throttles back to idle, raises the hook and taxies clear.|$|R
500|$|... 3 December 2016: A Su-33 {{based on}} the Admiral Kuznetsov {{aircraft}} carrier crashed while making a second landing attempt after a combat sortie over Syria. The pilot survived without injuries and was immediately recovered by search and rescue teams. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the plane was lost after an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> ruptured. [...] Afterwards, the Russian Navy transferred the carrier's remaining aircraft to an air base in Syria to continue operations while the carrier's issue was resolved.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> or wires, cross deck {{pendants}} are flexible steel cables which are spanned across the landing {{area to be}} engaged by the arresting hook of an incoming aircraft. On aircraft carriers there are either three or four cables, numbered 1-4 from aft to forward. Pendants are made of 1 inch (25 mm), 1-1/4 (32 mm) inch or 1-3/8 inch (35mm) diameter wire rope. Each wire rope {{is made up of}} numerous strands twisted about an oiled hemp center core, which provides a [...] "cushion" [...] for each strand and also supplies cable lubrication. The cable ends are equipped with terminal couplings designed for quick detachment during replacement and are able to be rapidly detached and replaced (in about 2-3 minutes on aircraft carriers). On U.S. carriers, the <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> are removed and replaced after each 125 <b>arrested</b> landings. Individual <b>cables</b> are often removed and left [...] "stripped" [...] in order to perform maintenance on other components of the <b>arresting</b> gear during <b>aircraft</b> recoveries (using other, on line, systems). Wire supports raise the deck pendants several inches so that they may be picked up by the tailhook of a landing aircraft. The wire supports on carriers are merely curved steel leaf springs that can flex to allow an aircraft to taxi over the installed deck pendant. On land based systems, [...] "donut" [...] shaped rubber supports raise the cable off the runway surface a minimum of 2 inches (51 mm).|$|R
50|$|The Prime BEEF program proved {{its value}} in {{additional}} situations. Several hundred personnel were deployed to Korea during Operation Combat Fox, following {{the seizure of}} the USS Pueblo in 1968. These teams dug wells, laid airfield matting, erected frame buildings, installed <b>aircraft</b> <b>arresting</b> systems, sandbagged bunkers, and rehabilitated building and utility systems to facilitate the buildup of American forces at Korean air bases.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the first}} A-4Es were flown in Vietnam in early 1965, the A-4Cs {{continued}} to be used until late 1970. On 1 June 1965, the Chu Lai Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) was officially opened {{with the arrival of}} eight A-4 Skyhawks from Cubi Point, Philippine Islands. The group landed with the aid of <b>arresting</b> <b>cables,</b> refueled and took off with the aid of JATO, with fuel and bombs to support Marine combat units. The Skyhawks were from Marine Attack Squadron VMA-225 and VMA-311.|$|R
50|$|The island {{on these}} ships {{was small and}} cramped, and located well forward of the funnels (unlike on a normal-sized carrier where the funnels were {{integrated}} into the island). Although the first escort carriers had only one aircraft elevator, having two elevators (one fore and one aft), along with the single aircraft catapult, quickly became standard. The carriers employed the same system of <b>arresting</b> <b>cables</b> and tail hooks as on the big carriers, and procedures for launch and recovery {{were the same as}} well.|$|R
50|$|During the April {{mobilization}} at Capitol Hill {{that resulted}} in 400 <b>arrests,</b> <b>cable</b> television devoted minimal coverage to the protests. CNN spent zero time covering the protests, while MSNBC gave Democracy Spring ~12 seconds and Fox News ~17 seconds. Additionally, MSNBC and Fox News misrepresented the protests, saying they were for voting rights issues rather than to stop systemic political corruption. While cable news did not give Democracy Spring much air time, other organizations including NPR, Al Jazeera, Democracy Now, The Young Turks, and CSPAN covered the protests {{with a number of}} featured segments.|$|R

50|$|Aside {{from the}} flight deck, the KFT had three {{additional}} decks. The upper deck housed the bridge, radio and navigation {{room in the}} front, workshops for engines and planes, med-bay, boats and <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> machines {{in the middle and}} back. Along the whole deck were cabins for the 80 soldiers for both ships and planes plus the pilots. The middle deck housed anchors and catapult mechanisms, aircraft fuel tanks, main and auxiliary engines, food storage and rudder control. Also included were additional cabins and the upper hangar levels. The lowest deck housed the main engines, water tanks, additional aircraft fuel tanks, bombs, torpedoes and spare parts storage and the hangar floor.|$|R
50|$|The runway {{was painted}} with a {{contoured}} outline of Graf Zeppelins flight deck and simulated deck landings were then conducted over an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> strung width-wise across the airstrip. The cable {{was attached to}} an electromechanical braking device manufactured by DEMAG (Deutsche Maschinenfabrik A.G. Duisburg). Testing began in March 1938 using the Heinkel He 50, Arado Ar 195 and Ar 197. Later, a stronger braking winch was supplied by Atlas-Werke of Bremen and this allowed heavier aircraft, such as the Fieseler Fi 167 and Junkers Ju 87, to be tested. After some initial problems, Luftwaffe pilots performed 1,500 successful braked landings out of 1,800 attempted.|$|R

50|$|A normal {{arrestment}} {{is accomplished}} when the arresting hook of an incoming aircraft engages {{one of the}} deck pendants. When a landing aircraft engages a deck pendant, {{the force of the}} forward motion of the landing aircraft is transferred to a purchase cable which is routed via sheaves to the arresting engine, located in a machinery room below the flight deck or {{on either side of the}} runway. As the deck pendant and the purchase cable are pulled out by the <b>aircraft</b> being <b>arrested,</b> the kinetic energy of the aircraft is transferred to mechanical energy of the <b>cables,</b> and the <b>arresting</b> engine transfers the mechanical energy of the cables to hydraulic energy. The arresting engine brings about a smooth, controlled stop of the landing aircraft. At the completion of the arrestment, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>arresting</b> hook is disengaged from the deck pendant, which is then retracted to its normal position.|$|R
5|$|It took {{thirty minutes}} {{to clear the}} runway and rig an <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33 Shooting Star, but he almost landed long—and the Nellis base operations office decided that to avoid any further problems, {{it would be best}} to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.|$|R
2500|$|On 3 December 2016, an Su-33 {{crashed into}} the sea after {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} carrier. According to a report, the combat plane crashed at its second attempt to land on the aircraft carrier in good weather conditions. The pilot was safely recovered by a search and rescue helicopter. Initially it was suspected that the plane missed the wires and failed to go around, falling short of the bow of the warship, but later it was revealed that the <b>arresting</b> <b>cable</b> failed to hold the aircraft, and was damaged in the attempt. [...] Following the two incidents, the air wing was transferred to shore at Khmeimim Air Base near Latakia, Syria to continue military operations while the carrier's arresting gear issues are resolved.|$|R

40|$|Objectives] Considering the {{shortcomings}} of the traditional sheave damper in buffer performance and the peak value of the greatest cable tension, [Methods] this paper presents a sheave damper with variable damping according to piston displacement {{as a replacement for}} the traditional sheave damper, and AMESim software is used for the modeling and simulation. [Results] The results show that the new sheave damper can significantly improve the arresting gear performance indicators, and has better adaptability for aircraft impact load. Compared with the traditional sheave damper, the new method can reduce cable tension by 25 % and reduce the maximum deceleration of aircraft by 23 %. [Conclusions] As such, the research in this paper can provide a theoretical reference for improving the performance of <b>aircraft</b> <b>arresting</b> gear...|$|R
50|$|In 1947 an {{enormous}} crane with a 630-ton capacity was completed {{at the site}} by the American Bridge Company. It was the largest crane in the world. This {{was used to remove}} the turrets of battleships so the guns could be quickly replaced while the old set was being refurbished on land. In 1959, a 230-foot tall trapezoidal tower was added {{to the top of the}} crane, bringing its total height to nearly 500 feet. This made the crane the tallest man-made structure in San Francisco until the completion of 44 Montgomery in 1967. The addition was created to facilitate Operation Skycatch, where Polaris missiles were fired and caught via a string of <b>arresting</b> <b>cables,</b> before being lowered to the ground for testing. Previous versions of the test had the missiles flung out into the bay and retrieved from the ocean floor. The crane dominates the landscape in the area as is easily visible from miles around.|$|R
