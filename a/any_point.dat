5|$|An {{important}} feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder {{in the case of}} three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space).

5|$|The {{entry of}} both the Czech Republic and Poland to the European Union in May 2004, and {{especially}} the entry of the countries to the EU's passport-free Schengen zone in late 2007, reduced the significance of territorial disputes, ending systematic controls {{on the border between}} the countries. Signs prohibiting passage across the state border were removed, with people now allowed to cross the border freely at <b>any</b> <b>point</b> of their choosing.|$|E

Additionally, when continuing a saved game, players are shown the last four actions they performed, allowing them to remember what they were doing.|$|E
5|$|X-Men vs. Street Fighter {{features}} gameplay {{similar to}} Street Fighter, but incorporates dual-character selection and tag team-based combat. Each player selects two characters {{to compete in}} a one-on-one battle, attempting to defeat the opposing team. The players are given the ability to switch between their characters at <b>any</b> <b>point</b> during the match. The game also incorporates numerous elements from X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes.|$|E
5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without <b>any</b> <b>point</b> deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E

5|$|As dawn came, {{the army}} {{approached}} a stream called Stony Brook. The road the army took followed Stony Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the Post Road from Trenton to Princeton. However, {{off to the}} right of this road, there was an unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at <b>any</b> <b>point</b> because the British had left it undefended.|$|E
5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the director, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules {{in the neighborhood of}} <b>any</b> <b>point.</b> Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E
5|$|Before 1952, {{the inner}} German border could be crossed at almost <b>any</b> <b>point</b> along its length. The {{fortification}} {{of the border}} resulted in the severing of 32railway lines, three autobahns, 31main roads, eight primary roads, about 60 secondary roads and thousands of lanes and cart tracks. The number of crossing points was reduced to three air corridors, three road corridors, two railway lines and two river connections giving transit access to Berlin, plus a handful of additional crossing points for freight traffic.|$|E

5|$|Draw by agreement: Draws {{are most}} {{commonly}} reached {{by mutual agreement}} between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players {{have been allowed to}} agree to a draw at <b>any</b> <b>point</b> in the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.|$|E
5|$|Following the Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, NASA {{conducted}} a safety {{review of the}} Apollo program. In response to this review, McDonnell proposed the Universal Lunar Rescue Vehicle, a repackaged version of the Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft with an enlarged capsule {{to make room for}} the three astronauts who were being rescued. It was intended to rescue an Apollo crew at almost <b>any</b> <b>point</b> whilst they were at the Moon, should an anomaly occur. Some ULRV designs included five seats, with two astronauts piloting it to the Moon. The proposal was considered, but rejected due to lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices. The keyboard {{can also be used}} instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the same purpose as clicking. The save button can be employed at <b>any</b> <b>point</b> during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For {{the problem of}} a flat plate with a temperature jump at , they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature at <b>any</b> <b>point</b> in the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 No.6 Squadron's F-111Cs were {{replaced}} by F-111Gs which had been purchased from the USAF in 1992 {{to be used for}} training purposes. This purchase allowed Australia's F-111Cs to be used mainly for strike and reconnaissance purposes and extended the type's expected life in RAAF service. All the F-111Gs were assigned to No,6 Squadron, and the unit's F-111C and RF-111C aircraft were transferred to No.1 Squadron. The squadron typically had seven F-111Gs operational at <b>any</b> <b>point</b> in time.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{after leading}} the {{division}} {{standing by the}} end of April, the Mets again began to struggle. The Mets would not hold first place at <b>any</b> <b>point</b> after May 1, although they came close in mid-June. By {{the end of the season}} the Mets had finished 18 games behind the first place Phillies. For its part, Philadelphia was mainly engaged in a fierce division race with the Atlanta Braves, trailing them as late in the season as September 6. However, Philadelphia would surge at the end of the month and once again be crowned division champs. 2010 ultimately served as a disappointment for the Mets–Phillies rivalry.|$|E
