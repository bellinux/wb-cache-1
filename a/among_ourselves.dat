500|$|Many Stanford alumni {{were upset}} with the {{decision}} to hire Shaughnessy. The most popular candidates for the vacant position were two Stanford alumni themselves: San Jose State coach Dudley DeGroot, and Santa Clara coach Buck Shaw. Some believed the Shaughnessy hiring was a ploy to eventually eliminate football at the school, as had happened at both Loyola and Chicago the year prior. The Bay Area media mocked the Shaughnessy hiring as comically inept. They believed that a prestigious academic school had foolishly hired an inveterate loser as its head coach. Prescott Sulivan of the San Francisco Examiner and Jack McDonald of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin coined the nickname [...] "Soup" [...] for Shaughnessy, which they sarcastically explained was a diminutive for the word [...] "super". Sullivan wrote, [...] "We have heard it said that Shaughnessy has developed the knack of losing to the point where, with him, it is an exact science. In light of his record, we aren't at all surprised at this." [...] The Stanford players were also skeptical of Shaughnessy's abilities. Center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd been reading about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking <b>among</b> <b>ourselves</b> that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} dated June 28, 1954, D.R. [...] "Spec" [...] Collins, the then-President of Phi Sigma Kappa, {{announced}} that from {{his point of}} view, [...] "the entire fraternity system-which is truly an American institution engaged in the service of building good American citizens–is being challenged. Challenged by those subversive elements who, by encouraging us to quarrel <b>among</b> <b>ourselves</b> may cause us to destroy ourselves. The 'divide and conquer strategy' that might well eliminate a great American institution." [...] President Collins warned that the anti-discrimination issue would be raised at the next Phi Sigma Kappa convention. The Bedford Resolution was a policy and was more easily changed than a constitutional measure or bylaw. Two years after its passage, at the 1954 Convention the Bedford Resolution was repealed in favor of a non-legislative [...] "Gentlemen's Agreement" [...] to ban non-whites. [...] This much weaker, short-lived, informal agreement also encouraged local chapters not to admit minorities to membership.|$|E

[...] In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, [...] "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [...] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football... Now, I have a formation for {{you that if you}} learn it well will take you to the Rose Bowl." [...] He asserted that one of his plays, a line plunge by a back without a blocker, would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical, and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner said before the season, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean." [...] Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing. As a contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "The [...] team looked great in some games and sour in others. The machinery was there but it wasn't running as smoothly as had been hoped for." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the Russian {{historian}} Boris Vadimovich Sokolov, Lend-Lease {{played a}} crucial role in winning the war:On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [...] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.Nikita Khrushchev, having served as a military commissar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs:I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were [...] "discussing freely" [...] <b>among</b> <b>ourselves.</b> He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.|$|E

60|$|These several {{developments}} of the artistic faculty, whether manifested in sculpture, painting, or architecture, are evidently outgrowths of the human intellect which have no immediate influence on the survival of individuals or of tribes, or {{on the success of}} nations in their struggles for supremacy or for existence.
