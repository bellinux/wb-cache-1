Wherry speculated {{at length}} on the hybrid origins of A.bradleyi and other Appalachian spleenworts in 1925, but the scheme he {{proposed}} was later {{found to be}} untenable, although he did recognize the contribution of A.platyneuron to its ancestry.

He also collected specimens of the backcross hybrid between A.montanum and A.bradleyi from a cliff near Blairstown, New Jersey in 1935. The hybrid received no further attention until 1961, when it was described and named in Wherry's honor as Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi).

5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This <b>allotetraploid</b> was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E
40|$|The joining of {{different}} genomes in <b>allotetraploids</b> {{played a major}} role in plant evolution, but the molecular implications of this event are poorly understood. In synthetic <b>allotetraploids</b> of Arabidopsis and Cardaminopsis arenosa, we previously demonstrated the occurrence of frequent gene silencing. To explore the involvement of epigenetic phenomena, we investigated the occurrence and effects of DNA methylation changes. Changes in DNA methylation patterns were more frequent in synthetic <b>allotetraploids</b> than in the parents. Treatment with 5 -aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, resulted in the development of altered morphologies in the synthetic <b>allotetraploids,</b> but not in the parents. We profiled mRNAs in control and 5 -aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine-treated parents and <b>allotetraploids</b> by amplified fragment length polymorphism-cDNA.

Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that synthetic <b>allotetraploids</b> have compromised mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|Polyploidy has {{occurred}} throughout the evolutionary history of all eukaryotes and is extremely common in plants. Reunification of the evolutionarily divergent genomes in allopolyploids creates regulatory incompatibilities {{that must be}} reconciled. Here we report genomewide gene expression analysis of Arabidopsis synthetic <b>allotetraploids,</b> using spotted 70 -mer oligo-gene microarrays. We detected > 15 % transcriptome divergence between the progenitors, and 2105 and 1818 genes were highly expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana and A. arenosa, respectively. Approximately 5. 2 % (1362) and 5. 6 % (1469) genes displayed expression divergence from the midparent value (MPV) in two independently derived synthetic <b>allotetraploids,</b> suggesting nonadditive gene regulation following interspecific hybridization. Remarkably, the majority of nonadditively expressed genes in the <b>allotetraploids</b> also display expression changes between the parents, indicating that transcriptome divergence is reconciled during allopolyploid formation. Moreover, > 65 % of the nonadditively expressed genes in the <b>allotetraploids</b> are repressed, and > 94 % of the repressed genes in the <b>allotetraploids</b> match the genes that are expressed at higher levels in A. thaliana than in A. arenosa, consistent with the silencing of A. thaliana rRNA genes subjected to nucleolar dominance and with overall suppression of the A. thaliana phenotype in the synthetic <b>allotetraploids</b> and natural A. suecica. The nonadditive gene regulation is involved in various biological pathways, and the changes in gene expression are developmentally regulated.

40|$|Patterns of {{polyploid}} {{evolution in}} the taxonomically controversial Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata groups were inferred genetically by analyzing 399 individuals from 177 localities for (1) four polymorphic plastid regions yielding aggregate haplotypes and (2) nuclear ribosomal ITS allele frequencies. Concordance between patterns observed in distributions of plastid haplotypes and ITS alleles renders ancestral polymorphism an unlikely cause of genetic variation in diploids and allopolyploids. Combining the degree of concerted evolution in ITS alleles (thought to reflect gene conversion) with inferred parentage provides support for a quadripartite classification of western European allopolyploid dactylorchids according to their respective parentage and relative dates of origin. The older <b>allotetraploids</b> that generally exhibit only one parental ITS allele {{can be divided into}} those derived via hybridization between the divergent complexes we now call D. incarnata s. l. and D. fuchsii (e. g., D. majalis) and those derived via hybridization between D. incarnata s. l. and D. maculata (e. g., D. elata). Similarly, the younger <b>allotetraploids</b> that maintain evidence of both parental ITS alleles can be divided into those derived from hybridization between D. incarnata s. l. and D. fuchsii, or perhaps in some cases a diploid species resembling D. saccifera (e. g., D. praetermissa, D. purpurella, D. traunsteineri s. l., D. baltica), and those derived from hybridization between the D. incarnata s. l. and D. maculata groups (e. g., D. occidentalis, D. sphagnicola). Older <b>allotetraploids</b> are inferred to have passed through glacially induced migration bottlenecks in southern Eurasia, whereas at least some younger <b>allotetraploids</b> now occupying northern Europe are inferred to have originated post-glacially and remain sympatric with their parents, a scenario that is largely in agreement with the morphology and ecology of these <b>allotetraploids.</b> ITS conversion is in most cases biased toward the maternal parent, eventually obscuring evidence of the original allopolyploidization event because plastid haplotypes also reflect the maternal contribution. Gene flow appears unexpectedly low among <b>allotetraploids</b> relative to diploids, whereas several mechanisms may assist the gene flow observed across ploidy levels. There is good concordance between (1) the genetically delimited species that are required to accurately represent the inferred evolutionary events and processes and (2) morphologically based species recognized in certain moderately conservative morphological classifications previously proposed for the genus.

In certain cases, such heterozygosity can have beneficial heterotic effects, either in terms of fitness in natural contexts or desirable traits in agricultural contexts. This could partially explain the prevalence of allopolyploidy among crop species. Both bread wheat and Triticale are examples of an allopolyploids with six chromosome sets. Cotton is an <b>allotetraploid</b> with multiple origins. In Brassicaceous crops, the Triangle of U describes {{the relationships between the}} three common diploid Brassicas (B. oleracea, B. rapa, and B. nigra) and three allotetraploids (B. napus, B. juncea, and B. carinata) derived from hybridization among the diploid species. A similar relationship exists between three diploid species of Tragopogon (T. dubius, T. pratensis, and T. porrifolius) and two <b>allotetraploid</b> species (T. mirus and T. miscellus).

25|$|Many genera {{and species}} of Triticeae are allopolyploids, having more {{chromosomes}} than seen in typical diploids. Typical allopolyploids are tetraploid or hexaploid, XXYY or XXYYZZ.

40|$|Allopolyploidy {{is formed}} by {{combining}} {{two or more}} divergent genomes and occurs throughout the evolutionary history of many plants and some animals. Transcriptome analysis indicates that many genes in various biological pathways, including flowering time, are expressed nonadditively (different from the midparent value). However, the mechanisms for nonadditive gene regulation in a biological pathway are unknown. Natural variation of flowering time is largely controlled by two epistatically acting loci, namely FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). FRI upregulates FLC expression that represses flowering in Arabidopsis. Synthetic Arabidopsis <b>allotetraploids</b> contain two sets of FLC and FRI genes originating from Arabidopsis thaliana and A. arenosa, respectively, and flower late. Inhibition of early flowering is caused by upregulation of A. thaliana FLC (AtFLC) that is trans-activated by A. arenosa FRI (AaFRI). Two duplicate FLCs (AaFLC 1 and AaFLC 2) originating from A. arenosa are expressed in some <b>allotetraploids</b> but silenced in other lines. The expression variation in the <b>allotetraploids</b> is associated with deletions in the promoter regions and first introns of A. arenosa FLCs. The strong AtFLC and AaFLC loci are maintained in natural Arabidopsis <b>allotetraploids,</b> leading to extremely late flowering. Furthermore, FLC expression correlates positively with histone H 3 -Lys 4 methylation and H 3 -Lys 9 acetylation and negatively with H 3 -Lys 9 methylation, epigenetic marks for gene activation and silencing.

An excellent system to assess these processes is provided by Nicotiana section Repandae, which arose via allopolyploidy (approximately 5 million years ago) involving relatives of Nicotiana sylvestris and Nicotiana obtusifolia. Subsequent speciation in Repandae has resulted in <b>allotetraploids</b> with divergent genome sizes, including Nicotiana repanda and Nicotiana nudicaulis studied here, which have an estimated 23. 6 % genome expansion and 19. 2 % genome contraction from the early polyploid, respectively.

Unexpectedly, in both <b>allotetraploids,</b> over 85 % of sequence clusters (repetitive DNA families) had a lower abundance than predicted from their diploid relatives; a trend seen particularly in low-copy repeats. The loss of high-copy sequences predominantly accounts for the genome downsizing in N. nudicaulis. In contrast, N. repanda shows expansion of clusters already inherited in high copy number (mostly chromovirus-like Ty 3 /Gypsy retroelements and some low-complexity sequences), leading {{to much of the}} genome upsizing predicted. We suggest that the differential dynamics of low- and high-copy sequences reveal two genomic processes that occur subsequent to allopolyploidy. The loss of low-copy sequences, common to both allopolyploids, may reflect genome diploidization, a process that also involves loss of duplicate copies of genes and upstream regulators. In contrast, genome size divergence between allopolyploids is manifested through differential accumulation and/or deletion of high-copy-number sequences...|$|R

Here, I examine the fate of duplicate gene copies in the floral development gene NICOTIANA FLO/LFY (NFL) and the evolution of floral form and colour in Nicotiana (Solanaceae) <b>allotetraploids</b> of different ages. Both NFL copies are retained in all <b>allotetraploids</b> examined, even those ~ 10 million years old (myo). There are no nonsense or frame-shift mutations, suggesting that all copies are still functional. Both copies are expressed in all <b>allotetraploids</b> examined, even those ~ 4. 5 myo. The evolution of floral form and colour was examined using geometric morphometrics of floral limb shape, corolla tube length and width metrics, and spectral reflectance measurements of floral colour. In floral limb shape, younger polyploids tend to be intermediate in shape between those of their diploid progenitors, whereas older polyploids have more divergent forms; however, divergence in floral limb shape can occur rapidly following polyploidisation. In corolla tube length and width, the majority of polyploids have wider and shorter corolla tubes, suggesting more generalist pollination after polyploidisation. In floral colour, polyploids can either be intermediate between their progenitors, like one or other progenitor, or divergent. The floral colour of N. tabacum is divergent and seems to have resulted from the inheritance of floral plastids that lack chlorophyll from its maternal progenitor and the inheritance of anthocyanin pigmentation from its paternal progenitor. Evidence for convergent evolution of floral form in green/yellow-flowered Nicotiana seems to be linked to hummingbird pollination. Overall, rapid molecular and morphological changes following polyploidisation may be advantageous and may partially explain why polyploids have been so successful in angiosperms.
