25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out.|$|E
500|$|Born in Cleveland, Gedeon {{was a star}} athlete at Cleveland's West High School, {{where he}} was a member of the class of 1935. [...] He was a [...] athlete who excelled in American football, baseball, and track and field. While ice skating in Brookside Park in Cleveland as a youth, the ice gave way and Gedeon's cousin plunged through up to his neck. [...] The cousin later recalled: [...] "Elmer slid across the ice on his belly <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out." [...] Gedeon's uncle, Joe Gedeon, was a Major League Baseball player who was implicated in the Chicago Black Sox scandal.|$|E
2500|$|Every {{morning before}} {{beginning}} work, I visited the animals. One of the elephants, Candy, loved to be scratched on the belly behind her foreleg. I'd scratch {{her and she}} would lean farther and farther toward me until there was some danger of her toppling over on me. One time I started {{to walk away from}} her, and she reached out and took my wrist with her trunk <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> back to her side. It was a command: [...] "Don't stop!" [...] I used it in the picture. Noah scratches the elephant's belly and walks away, and the elephant pulls him back to her time after time.|$|E

60|$|About {{the middle}} of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs. Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>me</b> by the hair to rouse me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Belike, belike, my son," [...] said Richard. [...] "There are {{folk who}} can take as many forms as a {{barnacle}} goose. Keep thou a sharp eye as the fellows pass out, <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> by the cloak if thou seest him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Police held Verburgh for 48hours of questionings and beatings that {{severely}} injured him, including a separated shoulder. Throughout, Verburgh denied {{involvement in the}} murder. Verburgh's Janitor Union lawyer got Verburgh released on a writ of habeas corpus. Verburgh said of the experience:Oh, they hanged me up, they blindfolded me ... I can't put up my arms, they are sore. They had handcuffs on me for hours and hours. They threw me in the cell and blindfolded me. They handcuffed my hands behind my back <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> up on bars until my toes touched the floor. I no eat, I go to the hospital. Oh, I am so sick. Any more and I would have confessed to anything.|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{contribution}} in music came after she met William Orbit {{at a party}} and tried to beg a cigarette from him. They began a relationship shortly after, and he encouraged her to do some spoken word for his Strange Cargo project and to sing. Possibly the best-known work from that time is [...] "Water from a Vine Leaf", which she co-wrote and which was released as a limited-edition single. It was also {{at this time that}} Orbit and Orton covered John Martyn's [...] "Don't Wanna Know 'Bout Evil", which was not only the first song that they recorded together, but also their first release in Japan, as a duet called Spill (later re-released in the UK in 1997). She regarded Orbit's influence as very positive, commenting [...] "I think William pulled me out of the crowd <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out of the gutter, in a way. Because I don't know where my enthusiasm was going to take me, because it was pretty raw to say the least." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} on a log {{at the corner of the}} house, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> down beside her.|$|E
6000|$|When it {{was burning}} brightly the little hare {{said to the}} rabbit, 'Rabbit, my friend, throw me into the fire, and when you hear my fur crackling, and I call [...] "Itchi, Itchi," [...] then be quick <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> out.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mont. Thou art deceived; for whensoe'er I die, The Sun, my father, bears my soul on high: He lets me down a beam, {{and mounted}} there, He draws it back, <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>me</b> through the air: I {{in the eastern}} parts, and rising sky, You in heaven's downfal, and the west must lie.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very good,' Herbert {{answered}} drily; 'only mind, {{whatever you}} do, for Heaven's sake don't go <b>and</b> stumble <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>ME</b> {{down on the}} top of you. It's the clear duty of a good citizen to respect the lives of the other men who are roped together with him {{on the side of a}} mountain.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'No, no, Jack, for God's sake!' she gasped, in {{uncontrollable}} emotion. Then, as I {{approached the}} door, she seized my sleeve <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> back with convulsive strength.|$|E
60|$|With {{these words}} she {{suddenly}} splashed {{a pint of}} icy water down my neck, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed, his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.|$|E
60|$|They {{let down}} ropes <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> {{up to the}} top of the little crag, clumsily, so as to cause me great pain: and then three men carried me home to the {{farmhouse}} on a stretcher. M. Claude was one of the three, the others were labourers from the village.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, we’ve had a {{hard time}} of it," [...] said Brisket, putting the notes into his breast-pocket and staring hard at Captain Bowers. [...] "When that little craft went down, of course I went down with her. How I got up I don’t know, but when I did there was Peter hanging {{over the side of the}} boat <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>me</b> in by the hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course I am. Now, is {{not this}} method of getting at the truth much easier and pleasanter than setting a couple of dirty negroes to pinch <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> so making it a point of honour with {{me to tell you}} nothing but lies? Here comes Ganymede with the wine, just in time to calm your nerves, and fill you with the spirit of divination.... To the goddess of good counsels, my lord. What wine this is!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not that," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have many}} and very dear friends, {{and it is}} only for a little time that I am {{separated}} from them. It is simply that I am not used to solitude, and I am becoming a creature of moods and presentiments. It is very foolish that I give way to them; but to-day I am miserable. You must stretch out that strong hand of yours, my friend, <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> up." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} I rose, believing that I {{had given them}} all mortal offence. To my astonishment several got to their {{feet in front of}} me, huzzaing, and Comyn and Lord Ossory grasped my hands. And Charles Fox reached out over the corner of the table <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> back into my chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{the crows}} had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try {{hard to get}} some brains. By good luck you came along <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> off the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me brains {{as soon as we}} get to the Emerald City." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He drew me {{from the}} river, Father," [...] said Bessee looking up. [...] "There was nothing to stand on, {{and it was so}} cold! And he took me in his arms <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out, and put me in a boat; and the lady pulled off my blue coat, and put this one on me. Feel it, Father; oh, so pretty, so warm!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} was, Sam; <b>and</b> you <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> {{out of a}} big hole," [...] {{came from}} Tom. [...] "When I saw that fellow hit the ball, I {{thought it was all}} up with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am {{not hurt}} at all. The snow {{squeezed}} {{me against the}} rock, and I could not move an inch, but uncle managed to get me a little free <b>and</b> then <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mind her. She's always saying, 'Keep {{out of my}} sight.'" [...] His voice trembled. He took me by {{the sleeve}} <b>and</b> began <b>pulling</b> <b>me</b> {{around the house and}} into a little summer bower that stood there; for he had a masterful manner.|$|R
6000|$|The {{prospect}} of doing something--and, what is more, {{of doing that}} something on a horse--brought Mr. Franklin up like lightning from the flat of his back. He sprang to his feet, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> up, without ceremony, on to mine. [...] "Betteredge, you are worth your weight in gold," [...] he said. [...] "Come along, and saddle the best horse in the stables directly." ...|$|E
60|$|With that I {{brought him}} in and set him down to my own place, where he fell to greedily on the remains of breakfast, winking to me between-whiles, and making many faces, which I think the poor soul {{considered}} manly. Meanwhile, my uncle had read the letter and sat thinking; then, suddenly, {{he got to his}} feet with a great air of liveliness, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> apart into the farthest corner of the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Their cries soon brought assistance, but, ere it arrived, we {{had been}} sucked within the {{influence}} of the dam where the stream went under the sluice with great violence. As we struck against the sluice I caught it. Turner held on to me, but was dragged partially under. Another moment and two powerful countrymen had hold of me, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out. They had more difficulty with Turner. His right leg had got entangled, and, in dragging him forcibly out, they broke it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ho! Nell," [...] he cried, giving vent {{to a deep}} sigh of relief, [...] "I'm {{thankful to}} see you--but look here. What snow-shoe made this track? I came on it just this moment, <b>and</b> it <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> up slick, I can tell ye." ...|$|R
30|$|He {{just kept}} holding my collar <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>me</b> {{the whole way}} to the CS desk. What was really funny, when we {{approached}} the CS desk, he suddenly {{let go of my}} collar and turned to talk to the CS girl. He changed into a polite person…What pissed me off most was that he kept talking to the CS girl like, ‘you understand what I mean, right?’ I mean as a service worker you should be aware that you ought to satisfy the customers’ requests’… and a lot of bullshit like that… Then I lost my control and threatened him.|$|R
5000|$|... "As soon as {{she came}} in, Marcy had fits"Magistrate: Do you know this woman?Abigail Williams saith it is goody Martin, she hath hurt me often.Others by fits were {{hindered}} from speaking.Marcy Lewis pointed at her and fell into a little fit.Ann Putnam threw her glove in a fit at her................. Susanna laughed ................Magistrate: What! Do you laugh at it?Martin: Well I may at such folly.Mag: Is this folly? The hurt of persons?Martin: I never hurt man or woman or child.Marcy: She hath hurt me a great many times <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>me</b> down. Then Martin laughed again.|$|R
6000|$|... '"No harm!" [...] {{he burst}} out. [...] "I {{leave it to}} you. You can understand. Can't you? You see it--don't you? No harm! Good God! What more could they have done? Oh yes, I know very well--I jumped. Certainly. I jumped! I told you I jumped; but I tell you they were too much for any man. It was their doing as plainly {{as if they had}} reached up with a boat-hook <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> over. Can't you see it? You must see it. Come. Speak--straight out." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{found the}} place easy enough. The door {{was just on}} the jar, and as I tapped on it with my finger-nails a wild-looking black man, arf naked, opened it and said [...] "H'sh!" [...] <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> inside. There was a bit o' candle on the floor, shaded by a box, and a man fast asleep and snoring up in one corner. Rupert dressed like lightning, and he 'ad just put on 'is cap when {{the door at the}} back opened and a 'orrid fat black woman came out and began to chatter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And oh! aunt, {{he asked}} me whether we ever went to Brogden; and when he heard {{that we had been}} at the parsonage, he said he lived there {{when he was a little}} boy, and our nursery was his;' chattered on Helen. 'He asked if we were in the fire; and you know Johnnie can't bear to hear of that; so I told him how funny it was when you came <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out of bed, and we went down the garden with no shoes. And he asked whether that was the way you had grown so ugly, Aunt Theodora.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Upon this {{he faced}} about, just before me, {{as he walked}} along, <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>me</b> to a full stop, made me a very low bow: [...] "I most heartily thank God, and you, Sir," [...] says he, [...] "for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a work; {{and if you think}} {{yourself}} discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all of the hazards and difficulties of such a broken disappointed voyage as I have met with, that I have dropped at last into so glorious a work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn’t it do if {{you just}} chucked {{a bucket of water}} over <b>me</b> <b>and</b> SAID you’d <b>pulled</b> <b>me</b> out," [...] {{suggested}} the victim. [...] "The other thing seems a downright LIE." ...|$|R
5000|$|And {{though the}} nightmares should be overSome of the terrors are still intactI'll hear that ugly coarse and violent voiceAnd then he grabs {{me from behind}} <b>and</b> then he <b>pulls</b> <b>me</b> back ...|$|R
