In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum.

[...] Of her return she said, [...] "It came completely out of the blue, and knocked me for six."...I really thought Marsden was no more.

500|$|In November 2014, Disney Animation {{commenced}} a 16-month upgrade of the Roy E. Disney Animation Building, {{in order}} to fix what Catmull had called its [...] "dungeon-like" [...] interior. For example, the interior was so cramped {{that it could not}} easily accommodate [...] "town hall" [...] meetings with all employees in attendance. [...] Disney did not disclose the renovation's cost, but Lasseter revealed that [...] "he whole center of the second floor will have an atrium that will go up two stories we want to make this building so beautiful that it's worthy of the artistic talent that's there." [...] In addition, it was revealed that the large sorcerer's hat would become the building's main entrance. Lasseter stated, [...] "There will be a gorgeous stairway that goes up into the hat, it's <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>great</b> symbol like you're entering the building through the magic of Mickey Mouse's hat." [...] Due to the renovation, the studio's employees were temporarily moved from Burbank into the closest available Disney-controlled studio space– the DisneyToon Studios building in the industrial park in Glendale and the old Imagineering warehouse in North Hollywood under the western approach to Bob Hope Airport (the Tujunga Building).

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the official EastEnders website, Oberman detailed the background dynamic to Chrissie and Den's relationship as it existed before their appearance on the show: [...] "They were a real match for each other and ran a successful wine bar. The couple made a good team, but he was always going off with other women. She'd end up leaving him, but they'd always end up back together." [...] Den's womanising and philandering nature was deliberately set against Chrissie's strong and forceful personality, and culminated on-screen in his affair with Kate Mitchell (Jill Halfpenny). The plot was praised by television editor Ru Green as being one of the [...] "better storylines" [...] during an otherwise weak year for the show, with media attention at the time profiling Chrissie's dramatic plans for revenge. Commenting on the storyline's climax, a report in The Sun spotlighted how [...] "instead of collapsing in tears" [...] as many female characters in EastEnders are wont to do, Chrissie [...] "proves that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned". The climax, which saw Chrissie cut off Kate Mitchell's hair in retribution for the affair, was a highlight for Oberman and an important dramatic milestone for her character: [...] "cutting off Jill Halfpenny's hair in the salon... was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>great</b> episode. I loved working with Jill and I think that put Chrissie on the map." ...|$|E

Kimi Räikkönen expressed surprise at his performance, considering that he had struggled with the handling of the car both in qualifying and the race. Speaking about the track intruder, Sebastian Vettel stated at the post-race press conference that he [...] "saw him taking a picture" [...] and continued: [...] "I hope it was a good one at least. I hope it was in focus! Yeah, pretty crazy, we approach that corner at around 280–290 klicks so, I don't know, I wouldn't cross the track if I was him.

Further details were eventually supplied by entertainment reporter Michael Ausiello, who reported on April 19, 2011 that a [...] "beloved character" [...] would be dying in the [...] "season's penultimate episode", and one week later that the character was female.

His personal aircraft is a modified Curtiss P-40. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the teaser trailer and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, [...] "All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look." [...] Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law: [...] "What was clear was also that at the center was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>great</b> cinematic relationship, which you could put into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [...] I always {{like to call it}} The African Queen meets Buck Rogers." [...] Avnet wanted to work with Law because he knew that the actor had [...] "worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star." [...] The actor had just finished filming Cold Mountain (2003) and was intrigued at going from filming on real locations to working on a movie done completely on a soundstage.

Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>great</b> drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing.

[...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted.
