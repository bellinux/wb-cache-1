40|$|Aging is {{a complex}} process caused by many factors. The most {{important}} factors include exposure to UV radiation, smoking, facial muscle movement, gravity, loss and displacement of fat and bone resorption. As a symptom of aging, face loses elasticity, volume and cheerful look. While changing face proportions, the dominant part of a face is its bottom instead of the mid part. The use of three-dimensional face modelling techniques, particularly the mid-face – tear through and cheeks, restores the skin firmness, volume and healthy look. For this purpose the hyaluronic acid is used, calcium hydroxyapatite, and L-polylactic acid fillers. Volumetric techniques require precision and proper selection of the filling agent to {{give a sense of}} satisfaction to both the patient and the doctor.

40|$|Aristotelia chilensis ([Molina], Stuntz) {{a member}} of the family Eleocarpaceae, is a plant native to Chile that is {{distributed}} in tropical and temperate Asia, Australia, the Pacific Area, and South America. The juice of its berries has important medicinal properties, as an astringent, tonic, and antidiarrhoeal. Its many qualities make the maqui berry the undisputed sovereign of the family of so-called "superfruits", as well as a valuable tool to combat cellular inflammation of bones and joints. Recently, it is discovered that the leaves of the maqui berry have important antibacterial and antitumour activities. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the traditional use, phytochemistry, and biological activity of A. chilensis using information collected from scientific journals, books, and electronic searches. Anthocyanins, other flavonoids, alkaloids, cinnamic acid derivatives, benzoic acid derivatives, other bioactive molecules, and mineral elements are summarized. A broad range of activities of plant extracts and fractions are presented, including antioxidant activity, inhibition of visible light-induced damage of photoreceptor cells, inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, inhibition of pancreatic lipase, anti-diabetic effects, anti-inflammatory effects, analgesic effects, anti-diabetes, effective prevention of atherosclerosis, promotion of hair growth, anti-photo <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Although some ethnobotanical uses have been supported in in vitro experiments, further studies of the individual compounds or chemical classes of compounds responsible for the pharmacological effects and the mechanisms of action are necessary.

Even today, people in rural and urban areas depend upon herbs for traditional cosmetics. Information on the herbal cosmetics was collected via electronic search (using pub med, scifinder, Google Scholar and web of science) and library search for articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Furthermore, information also was obtained from some local books on ethnopharmacology. The herbal extracts, as a whole or part, {{have been used for}} various ailments of the skin, hair, and dental care for overall appearance. Cosmetics alone are not sufficient to take care of skin and others body parts, it requires association of active ingredients to check the damage and <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Herbal cosmetics have gained much popularity among the population. Herbal cosmetics products claimed to have efficacy and intrinsic acceptability due to routine use in daily life and avoid the side effects which are commonly seen in synthetic products. Due to the awareness of the environmental damage caused by industrialization, a trend has developed to use products with natural ingredients. Various adverse effects may occur in the form of acute toxicity, percutaneous absorption, skin irritation, eye irritation, skin sensitization and photosensitization, sub chronic toxicity, mutagenicity, and photo toxicity by the usage of synthetic products that’s why today’s generation prefers herbal cosmetics for hair, skin and dental care.

40|$|Millions {{of people}} purposefully and dangerously expose {{themselves}} to the sun {{with the aim of}} attaining tan, especially female adolescents who perceive a tan as attractive. The primary consequence of such exposure is skin cancer as well as premature <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> which is known as photoaging. Empirical evidence indicates that photoaging photography, which explicitly illustrates the ageing of skin {{through the use of a}} UV -filter, as well as photoaging information, contributes to the efficacy of appearance-based health promotion interventions which aim to increase sun protection intentions and behaviours. The present literature review indicates that the effectiveness of using this novel approach has not yet been explored in the Australian female adolescent population. The present paper reviews findings from empirical research concerning sun exposure practices of the Australian populace, the high skin. cancer rates, motivators and intentions of deliberate sun exposure behaviours, age and gender differences, and the benefit of including photoaging information and photographs in health promotion campaigns, with particular focus on adolescent females. A consistent finding across many quantitative studies is that although many people show high levels of knowledge of the dangers of excessive sun exposure, this does not transfer into behaviour, with the desire for a tan far exceeding any concern for one 2 ̆ 7 s health, particularly in Australian adolescents. Current research shows, however, that by using fear appeals and vivid health promotion material, these messages personalise the threat of skin cancer and are more persuasive in producing response to skin cancer prevention. The presentation of photoaging photography and information has been found to increase behaviours and intentions to sun protect which holds promise as a way to further increase the success of health messages. This review concludes with an exploration of the implications of these findings. Despite health promotion efforts, health-risk behaviour is still prevalent, especially in female adolescents who purposefully expose {{themselves to the}} sun with the aim of getting a tan. The primary motivator of tanning has been found to be appearance-related, as tanned skin is perceived as attractive. Contemporary skin cancer interventions have focused on making the negative appearance consequences of sun exposure more salient through photoaging photography and this approach has been found to be more effective at increasing the adoption of appropriate sun-protective behaviours. The present study examines the effectiveness of a photoaging intervention on attitudes toward sun protection of a female adolescent population. A sample of 66 females aged between 15 and 17 years were randomly assigned to either the photoaging intervention or the educational intervention. The photoaging intervention included photoaging images and information whereas the education intervention did not. The intervention produced significant differences in attitudes across conditions favouring photoaging as an effective strategy for motivating sun protection practices that may reduce skin cancer risk...|$|E

Conventional photocatalysis requires three essential components of a semiconductor photocatalyst, a light source with appropriate wavelengths, and an oxidizing agent (e.g. water or oxygen molecules). In semiconductor photocatalysis, the wide bandgap energy (e.g. 3.0 – 3.2  eV) of semiconductor photocatalysts intrinsically limits light absorption to only the ultraviolet (UV) region (wavelength of light λ[*]<[*] 420  nm), which accounts for only about 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total solar energy.
