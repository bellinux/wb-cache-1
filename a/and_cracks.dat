5|$|After the war, {{construction}} and reconstruction work resumed on the A3 motorway. The battle damage {{was the first}} to be addressed, along with removal of the trenches excavated in the flyover embankments. Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway had to be removed by minesweepers. The motorway pavement was seriously deteriorated, as evidenced by extensive ruts <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs made to the viaducts and flyovers, mine clearance and pavement reconstruction took considerably more time to perform.|$|E

5|$|Henry II came to {{the throne}} in 1154 and built {{extensively}} at Windsor between 1165 and 1179. Henry replaced the wooden palisade surrounding the upper ward with a stone wall interspersed with square towers and built the first King's Gate. The first stone keep was suffering from subsidence, <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> were beginning {{to appear in the}} stonework of the south side. Henry replaced the keep with another stone shell keep and chemise wall, but moved the walls in {{from the edge of the}} motte to relieve the pressure on the mound, and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support. Inside the castle Henry remodelled the royal accommodation. Bagshot Heath stone was used for most of the work, and stone from Bedfordshire for the internal buildings.|$|E
40|$|The crack {{propagation}} process in single-crystal aluminum plate (SCAP) with central cracks under tensile load was simulated by molecular dynamics method. Further, {{the effects of}} model size, <b>crack</b> length, temperature, <b>and</b> strain rate on strength of SCAP <b>and</b> <b>crack</b> growth were comprehensively investigated. The results showed that, {{with the increase of}} the model size, <b>crack</b> length, <b>and</b> strain rate, the plastic yield point of SCAP occurred in advance, the limit stress of plastic yield decreased, and the plastic deformability of material increased, but the temperature had less effect and sensitivity on the strength <b>and</b> <b>crack</b> propagation of SCAP. The model size affected the plastic deformation <b>and</b> <b>crack</b> growth of the material. Specifically, at small scale, the plastic deformation <b>and</b> <b>crack</b> propagation in SCAP are mainly affected through dislocation multiplication and slip. However, the plastic deformation <b>and</b> <b>crack</b> propagation are obviously affected by dislocation multiplication and twinning in larger scale...|$|R

5|$|The inner {{peridium}} {{is a thin}} shiny {{tissue that}} is depressed into areas demarcated by the pyramidal plates. The puffball base, which occupies about a third to {{a quarter of the}} bottom of the fruit body, consists of moderately-sized chambers that persist even after the gleba has matured and the spores have dispersed. The base can assume a purplish hue after weathering. The base is rooted into the soil with rhizomorphs. Initially white, the gleba turns color from yellow to golden brown to dark brown as the spores mature. As the gleba dries, the inner peridium dries <b>and</b> <b>cracks,</b> exposing the spore mass in cracks between the scales. The gleba is supported by a yellowish-brown to light brown subgleba.|$|E

5|$|By February 26 city {{officials}} had determined One Meridian Plaza {{was not in}} danger of collapse. There was structural damage to horizontal steel beams and floor sections {{on most of the}} fire damaged floors. Under extreme fire exposure the beams and girders sagged and twisted <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> appeared in the concrete floors. However, the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building. Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building's facade. The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off. The 20-story Morris Building and several three-story shops behind One Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000. The neighboring Girard Trust Building, then called Two Mellon Plaza, experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building. A bank in the building reopened a month later {{but the rest of the}} tower remained vacant for years. The roads around the building were closed for months after the fire, including a portion of two of Philadelphia's major streets, Broad and Market.|$|E
5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}}'s {{effects were}} felt {{as far north}} as Lebanon and Syria and it was the strongest event in the Jordan Rift Valley since the 1927 Jericho earthquake which was centered near the Dead Sea. The heaviest damage occurred in the resort town of Eilat where seven hotels and 50 other buildings were damaged, <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> formed in the sidewalks. Fifteen people were treated there for injuries or shock and one man {{died of a heart attack}} in Aqaba. In Saudi Arabia two women were reported dead and five deaths were reported in Egypt, with three of them occurring in the gulf resort town of Nuweiba. Eight buildings collapsed in Cairo where, just several years before, the much smaller 1992 Cairo earthquake had a much more destructive impact. One person was killed and two were injured slightly at Al-Bad', Saudi Arabia and damage was reported there as well as the towns of Al-`Ula and Haql.|$|E

25|$|Slab {{stabilization}} {{does not}} correct depressions, increase the design structural capacity, stop erosion or eliminate faulting. It does, however, restore the slab support, therefore, decreasing deflections under the load. Stabilization {{should only be}} performed at joints <b>and</b> <b>cracks</b> where loss of support exists. Visual inspection is the simplest manner to find voids. Signs that repair is needed are transverse joint faulting, corner breaks and shoulder drop off and lines at or near joints <b>and</b> <b>cracks.</b> Deflection testing is another common procedure utilized to locate voids. It is recommended to do this testing at night as during cooler temperatures, joints open, aggregate interlock diminishes and load deflections are at their highest.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: High {{temperature}} components with notches, {{defects and}} flaws can produce <b>crack</b> initiation <b>and</b> <b>crack</b> propagation under service conditions. Fracture mechanics procedures {{are needed to}} study <b>crack</b> problems <b>and</b> to support an advanced remnant life evaluation. Since a more flexible service mode of steam power plants causes a higher number of start up and shut down events, creep-fatigue crack behaviour is decisive for life assessment and integrity of components. Fracture mechanics experiments normally are carried out under air conditions although in some cases internal defects are not in contact with air. Therefore, it is of interest to which degree environmental conditions, e. g. crack tip oxidation, can influence <b>crack</b> initiation <b>and</b> <b>crack</b> growth behaviour. In order to enlighten these problems for high temperature components, the <b>crack</b> initiation time <b>and</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate were determined in air and inert gas environment on 1 % CrMo(Ni) V- and 10 % CrMoWVNbN-steels. <b>Crack</b> initiation <b>and</b> <b>crack</b> propagation under creep and creep-fatigue conditions have been described with the usual fracture mechanics parameters C*, KI and ∆KI and a modified "Two Criteria Approach " was applied.
