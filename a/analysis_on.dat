5|$|During the 1980s {{very few}} {{specialized}} digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live <b>analysis</b> <b>on</b> media, examining computers {{from within the}} operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence.

A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.|$|E
