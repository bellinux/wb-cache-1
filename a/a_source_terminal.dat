In the SBC scheme, the relay senses the channel {{at the beginning of}} each time slot. In the idle time slots, the relay transmits the packet at the head of its queue, while in the busy one, the relay decides either to transmit simultaneously with the <b>source</b> <b>terminal</b> or to listen to the source transmission. The SBC scheme is a novel paradigm that utilizes the spectrum more efficiently than the other cooperative schemes because the relay not only exploits the idle time slots, but also has the capability to mildly interfere with the <b>source</b> <b>terminal.</b> On the other hand, in the DBC scheme, the relay does not sense the channel and it decides either to transmit or to listen according to certain probabilities. Numerical results reveal that the two proposed schemes outperform existing cooperative schemes that restrict the relay to send only in the idle time slots. Moreover, we show how the MPR capability at the destination can compensate for the sensing need at the relay, i. e., the DBC scheme achieves almost the same stability region as that of the SBC scheme.

40|$|Abstract — We study two-hop {{communication}} protocols where {{one or two}} relay terminals assist in the communication between two transceiver terminals. All terminals operate in half-duplex mode, i. e., may not receive and transmit simultaneously {{at the same time}} and frequency. This leads to a loss in spectral efficiency due to the pre-log factor 1 / 2 in corresponding expressions for the achievable rate (capacity). We propose and analyze two relaying protocols that avoid the pre-log factor 1 / 2 but still work with half-duplex relays. Firstly, we consider a relaying protocol where two half-duplex relays, either amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF), alternately forward messages from <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>terminal</b> to a destination terminal (two-path relaying). It is shown that the protocol can recover a significant portion of the half-duplex loss. Secondly, we propose a relaying protocol where a bidirectional connection between two transceiver terminals is established via one half-duplex AF or DF relay (two-way relaying). It is shown that the sum rate of the two-way half-duplex AF relay channel achieves the rate of the one-way full-duplex AF relay channel, whereas the sum rate of the two-way half-duplex DF relay channel achieves the rate of the one-way full-duplex DF relay channel only in certain cases.

30|$|Two-way {{cooperative}} relaying establishes {{bidirectional connection}} between two <b>source</b> <b>terminals</b> to exchange independent messages {{with the help}} of relays. Operating in the half-duplex mode with DF strategy, two-way cooperative relaying has three protocols based on different channel conditions [19 – 21]: (i) the naive four-phase, which uses four time slots for an information exchange and is spectrally inefficient [19]; (ii) three-phase (also known as time-division broadcast channel (TDBC)) protocol [22, 23], which requires three time slots and is commonly used in two-way relaying [19]; and (iii) two-phase (multiple-access broadcast channel (MABC)) protocol [24], which uses two time slots and requires network coding [25 – 27]. In this paper, three-phase two-way DF relaying protocol is considered due to its feature of having a direct link between both <b>source</b> <b>terminals</b> and <b>an</b> indirect link via intermediate relays to enhance the diversity. In the first time slot, one <b>source</b> <b>terminal</b> broadcasts its one symbol to the relay and the second <b>source</b> <b>terminal.</b> In the second time slot, the second <b>source</b> <b>terminal</b> broadcasts its one symbol to the relay and the first terminal. Then, the relay decodes the symbols received from both <b>source</b> <b>terminals</b> and broadcasts the combination of both symbols to both terminals in the third time slot. Since each <b>source</b> <b>terminal</b> perfectly knows its transmitted signal, it can cancel the self-interference term. Thus, the conventional three-phase two-way DF relaying system exchanges two symbols in three time slots [19]. To circumvent the issues due to the repetition-based relaying approach, signal space diversity (SSD) [28] is proposed to employ in the three-phase two-way DF relaying system in this paper, in order to enhance the spectral efficiency and system performance.|$|R
