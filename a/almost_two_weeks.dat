5|$|The 1964 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured {{the highest number}} of U.S.-landfalling hurricanes since 1933. The season officially began on June15, and lasted until November30.

All of the hurricanes strengthened into major hurricanes, an event that had not occurred since 1930. The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed on June2, <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> before the official start of the season.

The invasion was abandoned, Hoche and his remaining men were returned to the army for service in Germany, and the general died nine months later from natural causes. The French Navy, although criticised for failing to land the expeditionary force, was also praised for successfully reaching Ireland and returning without encountering {{the main body of the}} British fleet. This achievement encouraged further invasion attempts, including a landing at Fishguard in Wales in February 1797 and a second invasion of Ireland in mid-1798.|$|E

Fearful of the oncoming Dutch, the Chinese retreated to a sugar mill in Kampung Melayu, four hours from Salapadjang; this stronghold fell to troops under Captain Jan George Crummel. After defeating the Chinese and retaking Qual, the Dutch returned to Batavia. Meanwhile, the fleeing Chinese, who were blocked to the west by 3,000 troops from the Sultanate of Banten, headed east along the north coast of Java; by 30October it was reported that the Chinese had reached Tangerang.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two seasons, routine {{analysis}} for ethanol {{as an indicator of}} cane deterioration has been carried out on DAC samples from all Tongaat-Hulett mills. Results for the 1992 season are reviewed in this paper. Extensive runaway fires on one day in August resulted in two mills crushing this fire cane <b>almost</b> exclusively for <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> The routine ethanol data over that period showed an exponential increase and confirmed the findings from smaller scale planned trials. Evaluation of data over the whole season showed up a number of consistent trends. In particular, the average ethanol content of unburnt cane was only 40 % of the level for burnt cane. A deterioration trial on unburnt cane showed that this does not reflect less sucrose loss, but rather a higher ratio of sucrose lost to ethanol formed. The use of a single loss ratio for burnt and unburnt cane is not valid...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an {{improved}} TVOCs (total volatile organic compounds) sensor construction was studied. Base {{on this new}} construction, the optimized flow rate, the responding character and the linear range of detector were studied. The effect of different electrode positions on the signal intensity was tested at different voltages. Compared with traditional PID — axial PID 3, the construction of this perpendicular PID could make the sensitivity loss decreased {{by a factor of}} 40 %. Especially, a newly adopted automatic cleaning technique was tested, which could decrease the drift greatly and make the signal of the detector <b>almost</b> unchanged after <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of continuous detection. Due to this new construction, the response time was decreased and the accuracy consequently was improved. When coupled with automatic cleaning technique, labor intensive daily calibration and frequent lamp cleaning were eliminated. The improvements in this new design made the detector more compatible with field uses...|$|R

Before me was placed very difficult goal to prepare the new product in company offer to be fit for sale. The task was divided into four paths, my master thesis is a result from three of them. First partial task consist in finding out as much as possible errors and faults in software and suggest new useful functions. In future on that base computer engineer will modify the software to offer for customers the best street lighting management system in Poland. Second partial task consist in measuring the parameters {{of one of the most}} important device in the “Jupiter”, electronic ballast. The part of knowing the system I realized in cooperation with Wroclaw University of Technology. I spent <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> <b>week</b> preparing and perform the measurements, which have been the base to write main part of my master thesis. The measurements required a lot of work and involvement, they were made in two separate laboratories, which entail with moved all necessary devices from one laboratory to another and built two measuring circuits. Third partial task consist in economic analysis, which include the comparison of maintenance and investment costs “Jupiter” system and traditional street lighting system. It is understood as a work in direction of improvement the MS Excel spreadsheet. I had to modify the structure and develop the input parameters, which must have been taken from measurements results, internal company documents and warehouses price lists. The results of economic analysis will be used in master thesis and in “Jupiter” commercial presentation. The company will use spreadsheet as a base of creation the sale offer for the potential customers. Fourth partial task consist in making the “Jupiter” commercial presentation. Some parts of this presentation will be used in creation of master thesis presentation, but first of all it will be used as a tool for sales specialists to help them in presentation the “Jupiter” for customers. I should also prepare myself to present and convince the potential customer that the “Jupiter” is good solution for him. It required a lot of time and learning of every detail to begin with wiring system and end with software structure...|$|R
