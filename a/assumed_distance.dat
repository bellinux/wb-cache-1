[29] It {{is to be}} remembered, however, {{that these}} truths present [...] {{themselves}} in all probability under very different phases to [...] individuals of different powers of vision. Many artists who appear [...] to generalize rudely or rashly are perhaps faithfully endeavoring to [...] render the appearance which nature bears to sight of limited range. [...] Others may be led by their singular keenness of sight into [...] inexpedient detail. Works which are painted for effect at a certain [...] distance must be always seen at disadvantage by those whose sight is [...] of different range from the painter's. Another circumstance to which [...] I ought above to have alluded is {{the scale of the}} picture; for there [...] are different degrees of generalization, and different necessities [...] of symbolism, belonging to every scale: the stipple of the miniature [...] painter would be offensive on features of the life size, and the [...] leaves with Tintoret may articulate on a canvas of sixty feet by [...] twenty-five, must be generalized by Turner on one of four by three. [...] Another circumstance of some importance is the <b>assumed</b> <b>distance</b> of [...] the foreground; many landscape painters seem to think their nearest [...] foreground is always equally near, whereas its distance from the [...] spectator varies not a little, being always at least its own [...] calculable breadth from side to side as estimated by figures or any [...] other object of known size at the nearest part of it. With Claude [...] almost always; with Turner often, as in the Daphne and Leucippus, [...] this breadth is forty or fifty yards; and as the nearest foreground [...] object must then be at least that distance removed, and may be [...] much more, it is evident that no completion of close detail is in [...] such cases allowable, (see here another proof of Claude's erroneous [...] practice;) with Titian and Tintoret, on the contrary, the foreground [...] is rarely more than five or six yards broad, and its objects [...] therefore being only five or six yards distant are entirely [...] detailed.|$|E

5000|$|During the spacewalk, Tyurin hit a {{golf ball}} from the {{exterior}} of the Pirs airlock. This [...] "experiment" [...] was sponsored by a Toronto-based commercial company, Element 21, which manufactures golf clubs made of scandium. The ball weighs just 3 grams, compared with 48 grams for a standard golf ball. At that weight, it was unlikely to damage any station components which might accidentally have been hit. There were three balls allowing two options for repeating the shot if required, but only one shot was actually taken. Taken with a one-handed grip by Tyurin (with López-Alegría stabilising Tyurin by holding his legs), the shot was a substantial slice, with the ball flying off {{to the right of the}} station instead of the rear. In 2006, there were plans for the video from the shot to be used in a TV commercial. The progress of the ball, which contains tracking equipment, could be followed on E21's Track the Ball in Space web site which was set up in 2006. Although, the site simply calculates an <b>assumed</b> <b>distance</b> of the ball based on a constant speed and does not perform any real tracking of the ball. The stunt was carried out around 35 years after Alan Shepard hit two golf balls on the moon during Apollo 14.|$|E

40|$|We analyse four XMM-Newton {{observations}} of the neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary EXO 0748 - 676 in quiescence. We fit the spectra with an absorbed neutron-star atmosphere model, {{without the need for}} a high-energy (power-law) component; with a 95 per cent confidence the power law contributes less than 1 per cent to the total flux of the source in 0. 5 - 10. 0 keV. The fits show significant residuals at around 0. 5 keV which can be explained by either a hot gas component around the neutron star or a moderately broad emission line from a residual accretion disc. The temperature of the neutron star has decreased significantly compared to the previous observation, from 124 to 105 eV, with the cooling curve being consistent with either an exponential decay plus a constant or a (broken) power law. The best-fitting neutron-star mass and radius can be better constrained if we extend the fits down to the lowest possible energy available. For an <b>assumed</b> <b>distance</b> of 7. 1 kpc, the best-fitting neutron-star mass and radius are 2. 00 (0. 24) (+ 0. 07) M-circle dot and 11. 3 (1. 0) (+ 1. 3) km if we fit the spectrum over the 0. 3 - 10 keV range, but 1. 50 (1. 0) (+ 0. 4) M-circle dot and 12. 2 (3. 6) (+ 0. 8) km if we restrict the fits to the 0. 5 - 10 keV range. We finally discuss the effect of the <b>assumed</b> <b>distance</b> to the source upon the best-fitting neutron-star mass and radius. As systematic uncertainties in the deduced mass and radius depending on the distance are much larger than the statistical errors, it would be disingenuous to take these results at face value...|$|E
