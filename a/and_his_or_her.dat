5|$|Like {{all other}} Pokémon RPGs, Diamond and Pearl {{begin in the}} protagonist's hometown. After viewing a {{television}} report about a media-conducted search for a Red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake (Johto's Lake of Rage), the protagonist <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> best friend travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Starly, the protagonist <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice among the three Pokémon found in the briefcase (Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup) with which to battle the Starly. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it to him or her, asking {{that he or she}} embark on a journey and fill his or her Pokédex.|$|E

They sought to investigate {{the relationship between a}} person's name-letter effect <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> birthday-number effect, given that Kitayama and Karasawa had suspected a single driving force behind both.

5|$|At {{the end of}} each song, {{a result}} screen is {{displayed}} to player, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> performance is rated with a letter grade, a numerical score, and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy. The player is awarded a number of fans and in-game money for his or her performance. The number of fans determine the idols' ranking, and as the player's idols increase in ranking, more items become available for purchase.

Finishing a song also earns the player Memories with the idols who perform the song, which can be used in the Star of Festa game mode.|$|E
