50|$|Both the B1 and B2 {{featured}} Fuel Injection. The B1 model featured an EFI (electronic) {{system that}} was modelled on the 1980 z1000H and (also used in the 1980 z1000G model). This system was a hybrid car design using an <b>air</b> <b>flap</b> that had many reliability issues causing most owners to end up removing it {{and replace it with}} the 34mm Keihin CV carburettors used on all the later z1000 and z1100 models. The key problem with the EFI on the B1 was the use of an air-flap design rather than a MAP sensor used in modern systems and the early Throttle Position sensor (TPS) design registered only open or closed (idle) throttle positions. Later models (B2 and ZX1100A)featured DFI (digital) which used a variable TPS that accurately represented the throttle position and hence a better Electronic Control Unit (ECU) algorithm called Alpha-N.|$|E

5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds {{almost exclusively on}} carrion. It finds its food using its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying low enough to detect the gases produced by {{the beginnings of the}} process of decay in dead animals. In flight, it uses thermals to move through the <b>air,</b> <b>flapping</b> its wings infrequently. It roosts in large community groups. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It nests in caves, hollow trees, or thickets. Each year it generally raises two chicks, which it feeds by regurgitation. It has very few natural predators. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.|$|R

50|$|The air (which {{is to be}} cooled), often {{after being}} {{filtered}} by a cabin air filter, is blowed by an adjustable speed electric powered centrifugal blower across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled, and also deprived of any humidity (which condenses on the evaporator coils and is drained outside of the vehicle) in the process. It is then passed through an heater matrix, inside of which the engine's coolant circulates, {{where it can be}} reheated to a certain degree or even a certain temperature selected by the user and then delivered inside the vehicle's cabin through a set of adjustable vents. The user is also given the option to close the vehicle's external <b>air</b> <b>flaps,</b> in order to achieve even faster and stronger cooling by recirculating the air inside the cabin.|$|R

In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can also fly by inflating himself with a mouthful of <b>air</b> and <b>flapping</b> his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of attack is to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight.|$|R

50|$|Flight, {{especially}} flight {{driven by}} the muscle-powered flapping of wings, is a strenuous physical activity. Although a sally from a perch {{may look like a}} single, rapid movement to the human eye, actually the bird must perform several moves: it begins its take-off by pushing with its feet to get into the <b>air,</b> it <b>flaps</b> its wings to generate forward motion (thrust), pursues the prey item, turns in the air, flies back, and, with a final flurry of wings, lands on its perch. When a bird hawks insects, the prey must be substantial enough to pay off in terms of a biological energy budget. In other words, the bird must take in more energy in food than it is using up in the pursuit of food. Therefore, flycatchers tend to prefer insect prey of moderate size, such as flies, over smaller insects like gnats.|$|R
