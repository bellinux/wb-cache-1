5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} everywhere, though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), {{but it can}} also rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus).

5000|$|One of {{the ways}} prey {{switching}} has been identified and defined is when <b>a</b> predator's <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> particular type of prey increases as the prey increase in abundance. The result is <b>a</b> strong <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> prey which are common in the environment and <b>a</b> weak <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> prey which are rare. The definition of preference will therefore impact on understanding switching. The most common definition of preference {{is the relationship between}} the ratio of prey in the environment and the ratio of prey in a predator's diet. It has been independently proposed a number of times and is described by the equation: ...|$|R

5|$|Common {{over most}} of its range in woodland, the common {{blackbird}} has <b>a</b> <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude.. The common blackbird also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.|$|E
5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by <b>a</b> <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> more stable earnings, in which case management {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing. Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.|$|E
5|$|In his {{lab at the}} Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Nuttin {{designed}} {{experiments to}} test the hypothesis that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name.
