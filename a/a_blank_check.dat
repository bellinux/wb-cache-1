The Yankees sent Krichell to scout him and offered him a contract with <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>check,</b> being willing pay up to $20,000 for his services. As Nicolas was still in high school, the Yankees were fined $500 by Happy Chandler, the Commissioner of Baseball. Nicolas never reached the Majors.

Kahn, sometimes called the architect of Detroit, originally worked for John Scott, {{the architect of the}} Wayne County Building (1897). It opened as the second largest office building in the world. The seven Fisher brothers who owned the automotive company Fisher Body essentially gave architect Kahn <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>check</b> to design and build the most beautiful building in the world. This became Detroit's famous Fisher Building (1927) which, with its detailed work, has been called the city's largest art object; its opulent three story barrel vaulted lobby is constructed with forty different kinds of marble. Albert Kahn Associates chief architect for the Fisher Building was Joseph Nathaniel French. The Fisher Building and Cadillac Place are among the National Historic Landmarks in Detroit anchoring the city's historic New Center.|$|E

In {{your public}} capacities, as bank directors, and charity overseers, and administrators {{of this and}} that other {{undertaking}} or institution, you cannot express your feelings at all. You form committees to decide upon {{the style of the}} new building, and as you have never been in the habit of trusting to your own taste in such matters, you inquire who is the most celebrated, that is to say, the most employed, architect of the day. And you send for the great Mr. Blank, and the Great Blank sends you a plan of a great long marble box with half-a-dozen pillars at one end of it, and the same at the other; {{and you look at the}} Great Blank's great plan in a grave manner, and you dare say it will be very handsome; and you ask the Great Blank what sort of <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>check</b> must be filled up before the great plan can be realized; and you subscribe in a generous [...] "burst of confidence" [...] whatever is wanted; and when it is all done, and the great white marble box is set up in your streets, you contemplate it, not knowing what to make of it exactly, but hoping it is all right; and then there is a dinner given to the Great Blank, and the morning papers say that the new and handsome building, erected by the great Mr. Blank, is one of Mr. Blank's happiest efforts, and reflects the greatest credit upon the intelligent inhabitants of the city of so-and-so; and the building keeps the rain out as well as another, and you remain in a placid state of impoverished satisfaction therewith; but as for having any real pleasure out of it, you never hoped for such a thing. If you really make up a party of pleasure, and get rid of the forms and fashion of public propriety for an hour or two, where do you go for it? Where do you go to eat strawberries and cream? To Roslin Chapel, I believe; not to the portico of the last-built institution. What do you see your children doing, obeying their own natural and true instincts? What are your daughters drawing upon their cardboard screens as soon as they can use a pencil? Not Parthenon fronts, I think, but the ruins of Melrose Abbey, or Linlithgow Palace, or Lochleven Castle, their own pure Scotch hearts leading them straight to the right things, in spite of all that they are told to the contrary. You perhaps call this romantic, and youthful, and foolish. I am pressed for time now, and I cannot ask you to consider the meaning of the word [...] "Romance." [...] I will do that, if you please, in next lecture, for it is a word of greater weight and authority than we commonly believe.

40|$|A {{modified}} assimilable {{organic carbon}} (AOC) bioassay is proposed. We evaluated {{all aspects of}} the AOC bioassay technique, including inoculum, incubation water, bioassay vessel, and enumeration technique. Other concerns included eliminating the need to prepare organic carbon-free glassware and minimizing the risks of bacterial and organic carbon contamination. Borosilicate vials (40 ml) with Teflon-lined silicone septa are acceptable incubation vessels. Precleaned vials are commercially available, and the inoculum can be injected directly through the septa. Both bioassay organisms, Pseudomonas fluorescens P- 17 and Spirillum sp. strain NOX, are available from the American Type Culture Collection and grow well on R 2 A agar, making this a convenient plating medium. Turbid raw waters need to be filtered prior to an AOC analysis. Glass fiber filters used with either a peristaltic pump or a syringe-type filter holder are recommended for this purpose. A sampling design that emphasizes replication of the highest experimental level, individual batch cultures, is the most efficacious way to reduce the total variance associated with the AOC bioassay. Quality control for the AOC bioassay includes <b>an</b> AOC <b>blank</b> and <b>checks</b> for organic carbon limitation and inhibition of the bioassay organisms...|$|R
