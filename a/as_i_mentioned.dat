Before performing the song, Aguilera revealed to the crowd, [...] "When I was younger {{there were a lot}} of people, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> before, that were sort of around me for the wrong reasons.

5000|$|Gregory of Nazianzus (330-390) begins Or. 21 with: [...] "When I praise Athanasius, virtue {{itself is}} my theme: for I name every virtue <b>as</b> often <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> him who was possessed of all virtues. He {{was the true}} pillar of the church. His life and conduct were the rule of bishops, and his {{doctrine}} {{the rule of the}} orthodox faith." ...|$|R
60|$|These things terrified {{the people}} to the last degree, and {{especially}} when two or three times, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> already, they found one {{or two in the}} bills dead of the plague at St Giles's.|$|R
2500|$|All of {{the various}} adult stem cell {{research}} approaches are supported by Palin. In an interview with Charlie Gibson, Palin differentiated between {{the two types of}} stem cell research [...] "And thankfully, again, not only are there other options, but we're getting closer and closer to finding a tremendous amount of other options, like, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned,</b> the adult stem cell research".|$|E
2500|$|Georgian state {{minister}} for reintegration told the BBC that, {{although most of}} the facts in the report were accurate, he disagreed with some parts of it. [...] "I disagree with the notion that Georgia used excessive force in the attack on Tskhinvali because, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned,</b> there are ample evidences of Russian deployment and these were not just peacekeepers, so one can hardly judge what is proportionate," [...] said Temur Iakobashvili.

2500|$|But I, though I saw {{and heard}} these things, refused {{to write for}} a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the {{diversity}} of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [...] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close – though just barely – in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out therefore, and write thus!' ...|$|E

60|$|This, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned,</b> was Saturday night. Being Saturday night, I had {{accomplished}} but {{the half of}} my uncommercial journey; for, its object was to compare the play on Saturday evening with the preaching in the same Theatre on Sunday evening.|$|R
60|$|I had no {{particular}} desire {{to hear about}} the commodore or Darius, therefore I asked if he knew anything concerning Elias Macomber, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> the name Bill burst into a hearty laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I reckon I {{can tell}} the colonel well enough," [...] {{answered}} Barton Brownell. [...] "For I saw Caspard often, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> before, and he never {{knew what it was}} to keep his tongue from wagging." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> last night, this Ada Waltham is very rich, {{and she has}} a brother, Chester, who {{is older}} than she is and much richer. In fact, I've heard it said that he is a young millionaire." ...|$|E

"Yes," [...] said Edgar thoughtfully; [...] "that's {{about my}} idea; and I suppose {{it could be}} raised, though my share of what was left us has nearly all been spent in cramming me with {{knowledge}} I've no great use for. Stephen, however, has done pretty well, and I think he always realized {{that it would be}} his privilege to give me a lift; I've no doubt he'll write to you <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> the matter, and your answer will have its effect." [...] He looked at George with anxious eyes. [...] "I venture to think you'll strain a point to say what you can in my favor?" ...|$|R

[...] Mr. Brand answered nothing; he looked for a chair and softly sat down. Felix {{could see that he was}} blushing; he had looked straight at his host hitherto, but now he looked away. The foremost effect of what he had heard had been a sort of irritation of his modesty. [...] "Of course," [...] said Felix, [...] "I suggest nothing; it would be very presumptuous in me to advise you. But I think there is no doubt about the fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|Shadrach it was; Shadrach, {{our former}} guide, who had betrayed us; Shadrach who, {{to save his}} own life, had shown us how to rescue Higgs, and for that service been pardoned, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>mentioned.</b> Shadrach and no other! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My suspicions," [...] he boomed, {{towards the}} {{conclusion}} of the feast, [...] "which have, I am rejoiced to say, proved so entirely void of foundation and significance, were aroused in the first instance, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> before, by the narrative of the man Samuel Wapshott." ...|$|E
60|$|Though {{for my own}} part, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> {{some time}} since in a letter I had {{occasion}} to write to the Bishop of ----, I {{do not like the}} term reformed; if taken in its literal sense, as a transformation, it is very objectionable.|$|E

40|$|This final degree report {{pretends to}} {{investigate}} and analyze what is CLIL (Content and language integrated learning) and what is Montessori Method in order to design a primary education Natural Science didactic proposal joining and combining these two concepts (CLIL and Montessori Method). The body part of this report is divided in two different but related parts. The first one exposes the theoretical bases of the concepts mention above. Moreover, {{in the second part}} and following these theoretical bases, I provide a Natural Science didactic proposal named “The plants”, designed to be developed with pupils of 1 st grade of primary education.

6000|$|... "'Well, Mistress Martin,' says I, 'I don't say as I {{have given}} you all particulars.

60|$|Any {{person would}} have been {{surprised}} to have seen how we all sat staring at each other; for though it was signed by all the executors, yet {{they did not know}} the substance of it till it was publicly read, excepting the chaplain; and he, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> before, had told me the codicil had better never have been added.|$|E

60|$|Therefore I say, those {{principal}} weavers {{who would}} enter {{in such a}} compact <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned,</b> must give sufficient security against all such practices; for if once the women can persuade their husbands that foreign goods besides the finery will be as cheap, and do more service, our last state will be worse than the first.|$|R
60|$|Above all things, the {{tradesman}} {{should take}} care not to be absent in the season of business, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> above; for the warehouse-keeper to be absent from 'Change, which is his market, or from his warehouse, at the times when the merchants generally go about to buy, he had better be absent {{all the rest of the}} day.|$|R
60|$|I desired {{the carrier}} to pay you, but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> only 15s. to him, I will rather inclose you a guinea-note.

60|$|But even if {{the person}} you ask for be not at home, it is {{sometimes}} {{a pleasure to be}} told so by an intelligent maid, such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> above.
