5|$|The dromedary's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} foliage, dry grasses and desert vegetation mostly thorny plants. A study said the typical diet of the dromedary is dwarf shrubs (47.5%), trees (29.9%), grasses (11.2%), other herbs (0.2%) <b>and</b> <b>vines</b> (11%). The dromedary {{is primarily a}} browser; forbs and shrubs comprise 70% of its diet in summer and 90% of its diet in winter. The dromedary may also graze on tall, young, succulent grasses.|$|E
5|$|Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year on Saipan, where the species' nesting behaviour has been studied. The peak breeding period seems to be from March to July. The species is monogamous. The nests are simple undecorated cups of casuarina needles, grasses, <b>and</b> <b>vines.</b> These are placed around 2.9m (between 1.5 and 6.5m) off {{the ground in a}} variety of trees including Casuarina, Guamia, Cynometra, Leucaena, and Citrus. The nests are predated by other bird species, specifically Micronesian starlings and collared kingfishers, as well as the introduced green tree skink.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation <b>and</b> <b>vines.</b> They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E

5|$|Holland {{looks at}} the {{earliest}} evidence for Muhammad, Mecca and Islam {{in the first century}} of the Arab Empire, pointing to a lack of evidence in the historical record to support the traditional account. Highlighting that very little Muslim testimony from the 7th century exists, he considers it suspect that 30 years after Muhammad's death, Muawiyah I became leader of the Arab Empire in Jerusalem despite showing little sign of being Muslim, and that no mention of Muhammad or Islam can be found in any of Muawiyah's inscriptions, coins, or documents. Holland proceeds to note that {{with the exception of a}} single ambiguous reference in the Qur'an, there is no mention of Mecca in any datable text for a century after Muhammed's death. He points out that in the Qur'an, the Prophet appears to address farmers and agriculturalists while his opponents are described as keeping cattle and growing olives <b>and</b> <b>vines.</b> This appears to describe an environment foreign to Mecca, where there was no agriculture; thus Holland posits that the location attributed to Mecca in the Qur'an more closely fits a city in the Negev desert, in what is now southern Israel.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late <b>and</b> <b>vines</b> planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, {{and the types of}} harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|The dining room, {{originally}} the library, {{was designed by}} Lewis Wyatt in about 1808. Wyatt extended the room and added a shallow, semi-circular apse at one end. It features decorative plasterwork on both the ceiling and walls, but is largely unadorned. Wyatt implemented a design featuring gilded acanthus leaves <b>and</b> <b>vines</b> on the ceiling with large-scale egg-and-dart molding around the upper sections of the wall, scagiola columns and a black marble fireplace with bronze ornamentation. Wyatt's alteration works at Rode Hall {{are influenced by the}} style of Sir John Soane, and he described his designs for the interiors as an 'experiment in primitive simplicity... At Rode the primitivist intent is emphasized by the total absence of an entablature.' The room is furnished with original pieces of furniture designed and made by the English manufacturer Gillows of Lancaster and London; of note is the mahogany dining-table and the semi-circular sideboard built into the apse. A Royal Crown Derby dinner service, purchased by Mary Wilbraham-Bootle for her son Randle Wilbraham III in 1809, is on display here.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple of}} weeks later in late June in the Wimbledon singles he again {{suffered}} a surprise loss to Ian Collins in the second round. In the mixed event Cochet and Whittingstall lost in semifinal stage, this time to Enrique Maier and Elizabeth Ryan. The singles competition was won by Ellsworth Vines, his first non-American title. The American Davis Cup team traveled back to France to challenge the reigning holder at the Stade Roland Garros. The French Musketeers secured the cup for the sixth and final time after four rubbers, losing only the doubles match. Cochet <b>and</b> <b>Vines</b> met in the dead fifth rubber. The face-off between the two {{was one of the few}} encounters that later had a decisive effect on the rankings. Vines ameliorated his team's result by defeating Cochet in five sets. The two European major champions then met in the final of the U.S. National Championships final in September. Vines kept the national title home with his second win, a straight sets 6–4 victory over Cochet. Vines and Keith Gledhill subsequently beat Cochet and Marcel Bernard in the doubles final. Cochet and Virginia Rice were dropped out in the mixed semifinal while Vines reached the finals. These losses sealed the fate of the year-end rankings.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers <b>and</b> <b>vines</b> grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

40|$|The Effect of Vine Presence on Arboreal Ant Community Structure in a Temperate Forest Chloe Lash 1 and Steve Yanoviak 2 Tropical vines {{can provide}} {{efficient}} linear pathways for foraging ants. Here {{we examine the}} effects of the presence of vines, as well as tree size and species, on the species richness and composition of ant communities in a temperate forest in Kentucky, USA. We used tuna baits to sample the ant fauna of 100 trees [...] 50 with <b>vines</b> <b>and</b> 50 lacking <b>vines.</b> We also measured tree <b>and</b> <b>vine</b> diameters <b>and</b> recorded tree, <b>vine,</b> <b>and</b> ant species, and ant abundance. These data were used to examine the similarities of ant species richness among varying tree sizes, species <b>and</b> <b>vine</b> presence. Species richness was similar between trees with <b>and</b> without <b>vines,</b> <b>and</b> among tree species. Species richness did not vary predictably with tree size. This suggests that ants in the temperate forest might not use vines as opportunistic linear foraging pathways. We also conclude that factors other than tree species, size <b>and</b> <b>vine</b> presence affect the distribution of arboreal ants in the temperate forest...|$|R
