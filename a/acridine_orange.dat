H. pylori can be demonstrated in tissue by Gram stain, Giemsa stain, haematoxylin–eosin stain, Warthin–Starry silver stain, <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> stain, and phase-contrast microscopy. It is capable of forming biofilms and can convert from spiral to a possibly viable but nonculturable coccoid form.|$|E
2500|$|André Bernanose and {{co-workers}} at the Nancy-Université in France {{made the first}} observations of electroluminescence in organic materials in the early 1950s. They applied high alternating voltages in air to materials such as <b>acridine</b> <b>orange,</b> either deposited on or dissolved in cellulose or cellophane thin films. [...] The proposed mechanism was either direct excitation of the dye molecules or excitation of electrons.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the course}} of the {{passages}} it lost its O antigen and in 1953 was cured first of its lambda phage ( [...] by UV by Joshua Lederberg and colleagues) and then in 1985 of the F plasmid by <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> curing. Strains derived from MG1655 include DH1, parent of DH5α and in turn of DH10β (rebranded as TOP10 by Invitrogen).|$|E
50|$|<b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> binding {{with the}} nucleic acid occurs in both living and dead bacteria, also other microorganisms. <b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> {{is useful for}} {{enumerating}} the microbes in a sample.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, Hilbrich and Strugger {{were first}} {{described}} using <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> {{to detect the}} fluorchromatic staining of microorganisms. Since then the use of <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> has been performed frequently in the examination of soil and water for microbial content. Direct counts of aquatic bacteria by using epifluorescent methods were evaluated by Jones and Simon in 1975. They also determined that the best estimation of the bacterial population in lake, river, and seawater samples can be achieved using <b>acridine</b> <b>orange.</b>|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> in {{clinical}} applications has become widely accepted; mainly {{focusing on the}} use in highlighting bacteria in blood cultures. In 1980, a study involved the comparing <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> staining with blind subcultures {{for the detection of}} positive blood cultures was done by McCarthy and Senne. The results showed that the <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> is a simple, inexpensive, rapid staining procedure that appeared to be more sensitive than the Gram stain for detecting microorganism {{in clinical}} materials. Later on, Lauer, Reller and Mirret performed a similar study, compared <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> with the Gram stain for detecting the microorganisms in cerebrospinal fluid and other clinical materials. As a result, they reached the same conclusion that was reported by McCarthy and Senne.|$|E
50|$|Acridine yellow {{is similar}} to <b>acridine</b> <b>orange.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> {{can be used}} in {{conjunction}} with ethidium bromide to differentiate between viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells. Additionally, <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> may be used on blood samples to cause bacterial DNA to fluoresce, aiding in clinical diagnosis of bacterial infection once serum and debris have been filtered.|$|E

50|$|<b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> is a {{versatile}} fluorescence dye used to stain acidic vacuoles (lysosomes, endosomes, and autophagosomes), RNA, and DNA in living cells. This method is a cheap and {{easy way to}} study lysosomal vacuolation, autophagy, and apoptosis. <b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> emission changes from yellow, to orange, to red fluorescence as the pH drops in acidic vacuole of the living cell. <b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> emits yellow fluorescence when it binds RNA and green fluorescence when it binds DNA. Nuclei emit yellowish-green fluorescence in normal condition, and deep green fluorescence when RNA synthesis is inhibited by compounds such as chloroquine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> direct count (AODC) {{methodology}} {{has been}} used in the enumeration of landfill bacteria. A study shows that the use of AODC in marine bacterial populations can be compared favorably to fluorescent oligonucleotide direct counting (FODC) procedures. Direct epifluoresent filter technique (DEFT) using <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> is specified in methods for the microbial examination of food and water.|$|E
50|$|Acridine dyes are {{prepared}} via the condensation of 1,3-diaminobenzene with suitable benzaldehydes. <b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> {{is derived from}} dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and N,N-dimethyl-1,3-diaminobenzene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> is {{an organic}} compound. It {{is used as}} a nucleic acid-selective {{fluorescent}} cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. Being cell-permeable, it interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions respectively. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein, with an excitation maximum at 502 nm and an emission maximum at 525 nm (green). When it associates with RNA, the excitation maximum shifts to 460 nm (blue) and the emission maximum shifts to 650 nm (red). <b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> will also enter acidic compartments such as lysosomes and become protonated and sequestered. In these low pH conditions, the dye will emit orange light when excited by blue light. Thus, <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> can be used to identify engulfed apoptotic cells, because it will fluoresce upon engulfment. The dye is often used in epifluorescence microscopy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} and used in many different areas, such as epifluorescence microscopy, the assessment of sperm chromatin quality. <b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> stain is particularly useful in the rapid screening of normally sterile specimens, and its recommended {{for the use of}} fluorescent microscopic detection of microorganisms in direct smears prepared from clinical and non-clinical materials. The staining has to be performed at an acid pH in order to obtain this differential staining effect with bacteria showing orange stain and tissue components yellow to green.|$|E
50|$|Prior to (or {{during the}} {{staining}} step) the cells are often treated with RNase A to remove RNAs. This {{is important because}} certain dyes that stain DNA will also stain RNA, thus creating artefacts that would distort the results. An exception is the metachromatic fluorochrome <b>acridine</b> <b>orange,</b> which under the specific staining protocol can differentially stain both, RNA (generating red luminescence) and DNA (green fluorescence), or in another protocol, after removal of RNA and partial DNA denaturation, to differentially stain double-stranded DNA (green fluorescence) versus single-stranded DNA(red luminescence)3. Aside from propidium iodide and <b>acridine</b> <b>orange,</b> quantifiable dyes that are frequently used include (but are not limited to) DRAQ5, 7-Aminoactinomycin D, DAPI and Hoechst 33342.|$|E
50|$|The RAS-transformed {{cell lines}} MDFB6 and B6ras show near {{complete}} loss of TSP-1 expression. Activation of CD47 with TSP-1 results in loss of viability in these RAS-expressing cells. Affected cells do not exhibit hallmarks of apoptosis but rather autophagy {{as seen by}} staining with <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> and immunoreactivity for LC3.|$|E
5000|$|Several dyes {{and drugs}} feature the {{acridine}} skeleton. [...] Many acridines, such as proflavine, also have antiseptic properties. Acridine and related derivatives (such as amsacrine) bind to DNA and RNA {{due to their}} abilities to intercalate. <b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> (3,6-dimethylaminoacridine) is a nucleic acid-selective metachromatic stain useful for cell cycle determination.|$|E

50|$|At a low pH (3.5), when <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> {{is excited}} by blue light, it can {{differentially}} stain human cells green while staining prokaryotes bright orange for detection with a fluorescence microscope. This differential staining capability allows more rapid scanning of smears {{at a lower}} magnification (400x), than by Gram stain (1000x). Bright orange organisms are easily detected against a black to faint green background.|$|E

50|$|<b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> (AO) is a {{nucleic acid}} {{selective}} fluorescent cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. It is cell-permeable, and interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions. When bound to DNA, {{it is very}} similar spectrally to fluorescein. Like fluorescein, it is also useful as a non-specific stain for backlighting conventionally stained cells {{on the surface of}} a solid sample of tissue (fluorescence backlighted staining).|$|E
50|$|When an <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> binds with DNA, it {{exhibits}} an excitation maximum at 502 nm (cyan) and an emission maximum at 525 nm (green). When it binds with RNA, the excitation maximum {{is located}} at 460 nm (blue) and the emission maximum {{is located at}} 650 nm (red). This is all due to the electrostatic interactions occurring when the acridine molecule intercalates between the nucleic acid base pairs.|$|E
50|$|Quantitative {{buffy coat}} (QBC) is a {{laboratory}} test to detect infection with malaria or other blood parasites. The blood is {{taken in a}} QBC capillary tube which is coated with <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> (a fluorescent dye) and centrifuged; the fluorescing parasites can then be observed under ultraviolet light at the interface between red blood cells and buffy coat. This test is more sensitive than the conventional thick smear, however it is unreliable for the differential diagnosis of species of parasite.|$|E
50|$|Ethidium bromide intercalates and stains DNA, {{providing}} a fluorescent red-orange stain. Although {{it will not}} stain healthy cells, {{it can be used}} to identify cells that are in the final stages of apoptosis - such cells have much more permeable membranes. Consequently, ethidium bromide is often used as a marker for apoptosis in cells populations and to locate bands of DNA in gel electrophoresis. The stain may also be used in conjunction with <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> (AO) in viable cell counting. This EB/AO combined stain causes live cells to fluoresce green whilst apoptotic cells retain the distinctive red-orange fluorescence.|$|E
50|$|The {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} TBRF {{is based on}} the observation of Borrelia spirochaetes in smears of peripheral blood, bone marrow, or cerebrospinal fluid in a symptomatic person. B. turicatae is best visualized by dark-field microscopy, but the organisms can also be detected using <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> or Wright's stain. The organisms are best detected in blood obtained while a person is febrile. With subsequent febrile episodes, the number of circulating spirochaetes decreases, making it harder to detect spirochetes on a peripheral blood smear. Even during the initial episode, spirochaetes will only be seen 70% of the time.|$|E
50|$|Electroluminescence {{is light}} {{emission}} stimulated by electric current. In organic compounds, electroluminescence {{has been known}} since the early 1950s, when Bernanose and coworkers first produced electroluminescence in crystalline thin films of <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> and quinacrine. In 1960, researchers at Dow Chemical developed AC-driven electroluminescent cells using doping. In some cases, similar light emission is observed when a voltage is applied to {{a thin layer of}} a conductive organic polymer film. While electroluminescence was originally mostly of academic interest, the increased conductivity of modern conductive polymers means enough power can be put through the device at low voltages to generate practical amounts of light. This property has {{led to the development of}} flat panel displays using organic LEDs, solar panels, and optical amplifiers.|$|E
50|$|As {{the head}} group forms such compact bicycle structure, the head group area is quite small {{relative}} to the big tail region consisting of 4 acyl chains. Based on this special structure, the fluorescent mitochondrial indicator, nonyl <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> (NAO) was introduced in 1982, and was later found to target mitochondria by binding to CL. NAO has a very large head and small tail structure which can compensate with cardiolipin’s small head large tail structure, and arrange in a highly ordered way. Several studies were published utilizing NAO both as a quantitative mitochondrial indicator and an indicator of CL content in mitochondria. However, NAO is influenced by membrane potential and/or the spatial arrangement of CL, so it's not proper to use NAO for CL or mitochondria quantitative studies of intact respiring mitochondria. But NAO still represents a simple method of assessing CL content. Cardiolipin has a molecular weight of 1466.0585 g/mol.|$|E
5000|$|Although metachromasia was {{observed}} and described since 1875, by Cornil, Ranvier and others, {{it was the}} German scientist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915) who gave its name and studied it more extensively. The modern understanding of metachromasia was advanced by Belgian histologist Lucien Lison, who studied it between 1933 and 1936 and ascertained its value in the quantitative determination of sulfate esters of high molecular weight. He also studied the metachromasia of nucleic acids. More recently, Karlheinz Toepfer published in 1970 spectral shifts with increasing concentration of the thiazine dyes that matched the spectra of dye:heparin mixtures, showing clearly that metachromasia, corresponding to the colour of stained cartilage, could be reproduced by high concentration of the dye alone in solution. Hence, proximity of the dye molecules was the key parameter in defining metachromasia. Another example of metachromatic dye (fluorochrome) is <b>acridine</b> <b>orange.</b> Under certain conditions it stains single-stranded nucleic acids fluorescing red (red luminescence) while when interacts with double stranded nucleic acids gives green fluorescence.|$|E
5000|$|Multiparameter {{analysis}} of the cell cycle includes, in addition to measurement of cellular DNA content, other cell cycle related constituents/features. The concurrent measurement of cellular DNA and RNA content, or DNA susceptibility to denaturation at low pH using the metachromatic dye <b>acridine</b> <b>orange,</b> reveals the G1Q, G1A, and G1B cell cycle compartments and also {{makes it possible to}} discriminate between S, G2 and mitotic cells. The cells in G1Q are quiescent, temporarily withdrawn from the cell cycle (also identifiable as G0), the G1A are in the growth phase while G1B are the cells just prior entering S, with their growth (RNA and protein content, size) {{similar to that of the}} cells initiating DNA replication. Similar cell cycle compartments are also recognized by multiparameter analysis that includes measurement of expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A and cyclin B1, each in relation to DNA content [...] Concurrent measurement of DNA content and of incorporation of DNA precursor 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) by flow cytometry is an especially useful assay, that has been widely used in {{analysis of}} the cell cycle in vitro and in vivo. However, the incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), the precursor whose detection offers certain advantages over BrdU, has now become the preferred methodology do detect DNA replicating (S-phase) cells.|$|E
5000|$|A strain was {{isolated}} from a stool sample {{of a patient}} convalescent from diphtheria and was labelled K-12 (not an antigen) in 1922 at Stanford University. This isolate was used in 1940s by Charles E. Clifton to study nitrogen metabolism who deposited it in ATCC (strain ATCC 10798) and lent it to Edward Tatum for his tryptophan biosynthesis experiments, despite its idiosyncrasies due to the F+ λ+ phenotype.In {{the course of the}} passages it lost its O antigen and in 1953 was cured first of its lambda phage (strain W1485 by UV by Joshua Lederberg and colleagues) and then in 1985 of the F plasmid by <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> curing. Strains derived from MG1655 include DH1, parent of DH5α and in turn of DH10β (rebranded as TOP10 by Invitrogen).An alternative lineage from W1485 is that of W2637 (which contains an inversion rrnD-rrnE), which in turn resulted in W3110.Due to the lack of specific record-keeping, the [...] "pedigree" [...] of strains was not available and had to be inferred by consulting lab-book and records in order to set up the E. coli Genetic Stock Centre at Yale. The different strains have been derived through treating E. coli K-12 with agents such as nitrogen mustard, ultra-violet radiation, X-ray etc. An extensive list of Escherichia coli K-12 strain derivatives and their individual construction, genotypes, phenotypes, plasmids and phage information can be viewed at Ecoliwiki.|$|E
5000|$|Flow cytometry is most {{frequently}} used to detect apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Analysis of DNA content by flow cytometry can identify apoptotic cells with fragmented DNA as the cells with fractional DNA content, often called the sub-G1 cells. The flow-cytometric assay utilizing the fluorochrome <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> shows that DNA fragmentation within individual cells is discontinuous likely reflecting different levels of restriction in accessibility of DNA to DNase, by the supranucleosomal and nucleosomal levels of chromatin structure. The presence of apoptotic [...] "sub-G1cells" [...] can also be detected in cells pre-fixed in ethanol but not after fixation in the crosslinking fixatives such as formaldehyde. It {{should be noted that}} the late-S and G2 apoptotic cells may not be detected with this approach because their fractional DNA content may overlap with that of the non-apoptotic G1 cells.Treatment of cells with detergent, prior or concurrently with DNA fluorochrome, also reveals DNA fragmentation by virtue of the presence of the sub-G1 cells or cell fragments, as defined by Nicoletti et al.5 Apoptotic DNA fragmentation can also be detected by the TUNEL assay. The fluorochrome-based TUNEL assay applicable for flow cytometry, correlates the detection of DNA strand breaks with the cellular DNA content and thus with cell cycle-phase position. The avidin-peroxidase labeling TUNEL assay is applicable for light absorption microscopy. Many TUNEL-related kits are commercially available. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation is also analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis to demonstrate a [...] "ladder" [...] pattern at ~180-BP intervals.1 Necrosis, on the other hand, is usually characterized by random DNA fragmentation which forms a [...] "smear" [...] on agarose gels.|$|E
40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis {{were studied}} properties of aqueous solutions of hyaluronan and celytrimethylamonnium bromid {{with help of}} <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> as fluorescence probe. At first, this thesis was focused on interactions of <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> and hyaluronan. Emision and excitation spectra of <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> were observed. Result of these measurement was bonding of <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> dimer to carboxylic group of hyaluronan. Next studied interaction was interaction of cetyltrimethyl amonium bromid with <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> – hyaluronan system. Result of these interaction was, that molecules of cationactive surfactant pushed away dimers of <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> and took place of dimer of <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> on carboxylic group of hyaluronan. Dimer of <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> was changed into monomers. The reason why this thesis was focused on study of aqueus solutions of hyaluronan with cationactive surfactant is benefit of hyaluronan – surfactant system in research of transport system for target distribution of drugs...|$|E

40|$|<b>Acridine</b> <b>orange</b> {{altered the}} {{response}} to anions of both ATP and in-organic pyrophosphate-dependent pH gradient formation in tonoplast vesicles isolated from oat (Avena sativa L.) roots and red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) storage tissue. When used as a fluorescent pH probe {{in the presence of}} I−, ClO 3 −, NO 3 −, Br−, or SCN−, <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> reported lower pH gradients than either quinacrine or [14 C]methylamine. <b>Acridine</b> <b>orange,</b> but not quinacrine, reduced [14 C]methylamine accumulation when NO 3 − was present indicating that the effect was due to a real decrease {{in the size of the}} pH gradient, not a misreporting of the gradient by <b>acridine</b> <b>orange.</b> Other experiments indicated that <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> and NO 3 − increased the rate of pH gradient collapse both in tonoplast vesicles and in liposomes of phosphatidylcholine and that the effect in tonoplast vesicles was greater at 24 °C than at 12 °C. It is suggested that <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> and certain anions increase the permeability of membranes to H+, possibly because protonated <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> and the anions form a lipophilic ion pair within the vesicle which diffuses across the membrane thus discharging the pH gradient. The results are discussed in relation to the use of <b>acridine</b> <b>orange</b> as a pH probe. It is concluded that the recently published evidence for a NO 3 −/H+ symport involved in the export of NO 3 − from the vacuole is probably an artefact caused by <b>acridine</b> <b>orange...</b>|$|E
