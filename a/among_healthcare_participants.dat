40|$|Background: {{aggression}} against healthcare workers is an alarming issue worldwide. However, there {{is lack of}} data on psychological vulnerability factors (such as personality traits, attachment style) which can constitute a risk or a protective factor for being a victim of an episode {{of violence in the}} health sector. Methods/design: the present protocol is a cross-sectional study on prevalence and characteristics of violent episodes experienced by nursing students in the clinical setting. Its aim is to identify risk and protective factors for becoming a victim of verbal and/or physical aggression <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers. <b>Participants</b> will undergo an intensive battery of psychometric tests, dealing with episodes of aggression in the previous year, attachment style, personality traits, perceived stress, health related quality of life and job strain. Conclusions: the findings derived from this study may be of value in identifying vulnerability factors in experiencing an episode of aggression in the health sector. In this respect, it is a step towards the development of valid training and support focused on health workers, aimed at teaching them how to modulate and manage their vulnerability factors in an efficient way. ...|$|R

40|$|Nasal {{carriage}} of Staphylococcus aureus {{plays an}} important role in the epidemiology and pathogenesis of infection and is becoming an increa sing problem <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers and in the healthy community individuals 1, 2. General populations are persistent S. aureus nasal carriage rates at 10 % to 20 %, 2, 3 and up to 50 % are intermittent carriers 3. Furthermore, carrier levels of 25 % have been report ed <b>among</b> hospital <b>healthcare</b> workersBackground: Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is becoming an increasing problem <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers and community individuals Objectives: To determine the prevalence of methicillin,resista nt S. aureus (MRSA) nasal colonization and inducible clindamycin resistance (ICR) of S. aureus <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers at Soba University Hospital and community m embers in Khartoum State, Sudan. Methods: Five hundred nasal swabs samples were collected du ring March 2009 to April 2010. Isolates were identified using conventional l aboratory assays and MRSA were determined by the disk diffusion method. The D,test was performed for detection of ICR isolates with Clinical Laboratory Standard Inst itute guidelines. Results: Of the 114 S. aureus isolated, 20. 2 % represented MRSA. The occurrence o f MRSA were significantly higher <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> wor ker than community individuals [32. 7 % (18 / 55) vs. 6. 9 % (5 / 59) ] (p= 0. 001). Overall the 114 S. aureus isolates tested for ICR by D,test, 29 (25. 4 %) were yielded inducible resistance. Significantly higher (p= 0. 026) ICR was detected among MRSA (43. 5 %) than methicillin,susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (20. 9 %). Conclusion: Elevating of MRSA nasal carriage <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> w orkers needs infection control practice in hospitals to prevent transmission of MRSA. The occurrence of ICR in S. aureus is of a great concern, D, test should be carried o ut routinely in our hospitals to avoid therapeutic failur...|$|R

40|$|Background: Presenteeism {{affects the}} {{performance}} of healthcare workers. This study examined associations between job stress, affective commitment, and presenteeism <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers. Methods: To investigate the relationship between job stress, affective commitment, and presenteeism, structural equation modeling was used to analyze a sample of 1392 healthcare workers from 11 Class A tertiary hospitals in eastern, central, and western China. The mediating effect of affective commitment on the association between job stress and presenteeism was examined with the Sobel test. Results: Job stress was high {{and the level of}} presenteeism was moderate <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers. Challenge stress and hindrance stress were strongly correlated (β = 0. 62; p < 0. 05). Affective commitment was significantly and directly inversely correlated with presenteeism (β = − 0. 27; p < 0. 001). Challenge stress was significantly positively correlated with affective commitment (β = 0. 15; p < 0. 001) but not with presenteeism. Hindrance stress was significantly inversely correlated with affective commitment (β = − 0. 40; p < 0. 001) but was significantly positively correlated with presenteeism (β = 0. 26; p < 0. 001). Conclusions: This study provides important empirical data on presenteeism <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of self-reported hand eczema <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> professionals in the Netherlands, and to investigate absenteeism and presenteeism resulting from hand eczema. METHODS: A questionnaire-based observational study was performed. Participants were recruited from hospitals and nursing homes in the Netherlands. The study population consisted of 1232 healthcare professionals. We used the NOSQ- 2002 to measure hand eczema and the PRODISQ for absenteeism and presenteeism. RESULTS: The 1 -year prevalence of hand eczema <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> professionals was 12 %. Among all participants, 47 % reported symptoms related to hand eczema.

Interoperability <b>among</b> the <b>healthcare</b> organizations is appreciated not only by the academia but also by the policy-makers and other related personnel.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a good death {{continues}} to receive attention in end-of-life (EOL) scholarship. We sought to continue this line of inquiry related to a good death by conducting a meta-synthesis of published qualitative research studies that examined a good death from the bereaved family member’s perspective. Results of the meta-synthesis included 14 articles with 368 participants. Based on analysis, we present a conceptual model called The Opportunity Model for Presence during the EOL Process. The model is framed in socio-cultural factors, and major themes include EOL process engagement with categories of <b>healthcare</b> <b>participants,</b> communication and practical issues. The second theme, (dis) continuity of care, includes categories of place of care, knowledge of family member dying and moment of death. Both of these themes lead to perceptions of either a good or bad death, which influences the bereavement process. We argue the main contribution of the model {{is the ability to}} identify moments throughout the interaction where family members can be present to the EOL process.

40|$|HIV-related stigma and {{discrimination}} {{is a complex}} concept that affects HIV reduction interventions. HIV-related stigma occurs <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> providers resulting in reduction of quality of care of people living with HIV. Social psychological research into stigma reduction {{has led to the}} development of many stigma reduction interventions, but has not resolved the underlying problem. This study was designed to identify predictors of stigmatizing behavior <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers in Ghana using the social cognitive theory (SCT) for use in developing an evidence-based intervention. The study used a cross-sectional research design incorporating a preexisting survey, Measuring HIV Stigma and Discrimination Among Health Staff: Comprehensive Questionnaire. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive, multiple regression analysis and Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s coefficient to estimate the relationship between the dependent variable, HIV related stigmatizing behavior, and independent variables, personal attributes and environmental factors. The key findings from the analysis were that the personal attributes of healthcare workers predicted their stigmatizing behavior (R 2 = 0. 674, p 3 ̆c 0. 05). There was, however, no significant relationship between environmental factors and stigmatizing behavior and between personal attributes and environmental factors. The social change implications may be to reduce stigma <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers toward people living with HIV and in turn increase the willingness of healthcare workers to engage with people living with HIV and provide quality service to them...|$|R
