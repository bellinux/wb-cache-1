50|$|Mere {{existence}} of triangular arbitrage opportunities {{does not necessarily}} imply that a trading strategy seeking to exploit currency mispricings is consistently profitable. Electronic trading systems allow the three constituent trades in a triangular <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction</b> to be submitted very rapidly. However, there exists a delay between the identification of such an opportunity, the initiation of trades, {{and the arrival of}} trades to the party quoting the mispricing. Even though such delays are only milliseconds in duration, they are deemed significant. For example, if a trader places each trade as a limit order to be filled only at the arbitrage price and a price moves due to market activity or new price is quoted by the third party, then the triangular transaction will not be completed. In such a case, the arbitrageur will face a cost to close out the position that is equal to the change in price that eliminated the arbitrage condition.|$|E
50|$|For example, Citibank detects that Deutsche Bank is quoting {{dollars at}} a bid price of 0.8171 €/$, and that Barclays is quoting pounds at a bid price of 1.4650 $/£ (Deutsche Bank and Barclays are {{in other words}} willing to buy those {{currencies}} at those prices). Citibank itself is quoting the same prices for these two exchange rates. A trader at Citibank then sees that Crédit Agricole is quoting pounds at an ask price of 1.1910 €/£ (in other words {{it is willing to}} sell pounds at that price). While the quoted market cross exchange rate is 1.1910 €/£, Citibank's trader realizes that the implicit cross exchange rate is 1.1971 €/£ (by calculating 1.4650 × 0.8171 = 1.1971), meaning that Crédit Agricole has narrowed its bid-ask spread to serve as a market maker between the euro and the pound. Although the market suggests the implicit cross exchange rate should be 1.1971 euros per pound, Crédit Agricole is selling pounds at a lower price of 1.1910 euros. Citibank's trader can hastily exercise triangular arbitrage by exchanging dollars for euros with Deutsche Bank, then exchanging euros for pounds with Crédit Agricole, and finally exchanging pounds for dollars with Barclays. The following steps illustrate the triangular <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction.</b>|$|E

Formally, <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transactions</b> have negative skew - prices can get a small amount closer (but often no closer than 0), while they can get very far apart. The day-to-day risks are generally small because the transactions involve small differences in price, so an execution failure will generally cause a small loss (unless the trade is very big or the price moves rapidly). The rare case risks are extremely high because these small price differences are converted to large profits via leverage (borrowed money), and in the rare event of a large price move, this may yield a large loss.|$|R

Types of frictions under consideration include fixed and proportional transaction costs, bid–ask spreads, taxes, and upper bounds on the number of units for transaction. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of arbitrage. In addition, we obtain some negative result on computational difficulty in general for arbitrage under those frictions: it is NP-complete to identify whether there exists a cash-and-carry <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction</b> and it is NP-hard to find an optimal cash-and-carry <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} currency {{competition from}} an information perspective. Transactions in traditional models do not convey information, so transaction costs [...] {{the driver of}} competition outcomes [...] are driven by market size. In our model transactions do convey information (consistent with recent empirical findings). Several important departures arise. First, adding the information dimension resolves the traditional indeterminacy of currency trade patterns (by mitigating the concentrating force of market-size economies). Second, whether transactions are executed directly or through a vehicle actually affects prices (because these trading methods do not in general reveal the same information). Third, our model provides a new rationale for why some currency pairs never trade directly (information is not sufficiently symmetric to support trading). Fourth, our model formalizes the arbitrage process and shows that <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction</b> quantities and price levels are jointly determined. Empirically, the paper provides a first integrated analysis of transactions in a triangle of markets: ¥/$, $/Euro, and ¥/Euro. Data for the full triangle permits comparison of direct, indirect and arbitrage transactions, for each pair. The information model predicts that transactions should affect prices across markets (e. g., flow in the ¥/$ market should convey information relevant to $/Euro and ¥/Euro prices), which is borne out. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper constructs, for {{the five}} largest cities in the United States, user costs and rents for the same structure, in levels (i. e., {{measured}} in dollars). The levels formulation is a major advantage over indexes since one can answer questions like "Is it cheaper to rent or to own?" or "Are houses overvalued?" because such questions are essentially about the levels of rents and house prices and their fundamentals. These new measures are constructed using Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) Interview data from 1982 to 2002, along with house price appreciation forecasts from Verbrugge (2007 a). Characteristics, current market value, and rental equivalence of owner-occupied housing are used in a regression framework to predict the rent associated with a structure with median characteristics in each city. The property value of this median house is used to construct a user cost estimate for this structure. We find that, for the median structure in each city, estimated user costs and rents diverge to a surprising degree, {{in keeping with the}} previously noted findings of Verbrugge (2007 a). It is not always cheaper to own: user costs sometimes lie well above rents. Finally, the dynamics of the estimated price-to-rent ratio are generally similar to those found in conventional estimates based upon indexes, suggesting that the present study might be useful for scaling or normalizing other estimates.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{international}} tax arbitrage has proven {{a difficult and}} at times intractable one. Rather than try to minimize costs of the arbitrage or prevent “abuse” {{of the laws of}} a particular regime, the United States should also consider affirmatively bearing some of the costs of international tax arbitrage to further the policy of international vertical equity and transform the incentives that led to the current worldwide non-cooperative equilibrium, and thus the rise of international tax arbitrage, in the first place. Harnessing the costs of international tax arbitrage transactions will not always be the appropriate response to each particular <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction.</b> Harnessing the costs of the international tax arbitrage should be considered, however, when such responses prove inadequate. At a minimum, in adopting such an approach the United States would provide some level of subsidy for investment in developing countries at little to no cost to the current international tax regime. At best, however, harnessing the costs of international tax arbitrage could place of the issue of international tax arbitrage back on the international scene, restart stalled international tax discussions and potentially move towards a greater worldwide consensus, not only on the international tax arbitrage itself but on the larger issue of the role of international vertical equity in the worldwide tax regime. In a second-best world, United States unilateral action in harnessing the costs of international tax arbitrage may be the first step towards a first-best solution...|$|E

We use index <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transactions</b> scheduling as a real-life application example to show the possibility of quantifying the two consistencies.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the extent to}} which smallholder farmers, including those who do not necessarily produce a surplus for the market, might benefit from participating in warehouse receipt systems (WRS) in terms of improved income and food security. We consider three potential channels: efficient food markets; reduced post-harvest losses; and access to credit. Firstly, we find that WRS, through its potential to increase demand for storage and facilitate temporal arbitrage, could address high price seasonality driven by high transport margins and thin commodity markets. By lowering price seasonality, WRS would benefit net-consuming households that tend to sell low and buy high. However, since temporal <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transactions</b> are associated with costs and price risks, engaging in them becomes undesirable if prices do not follow predictable seasonal patterns. Prices tend to be less predictable in countries such as Malawi where government market intervention is highly discretionary.

40|$|We provide robust {{evidence}} of a deviation in the covered interest rate parity (CIP) relation since {{the onset of the}} financial crisis in August 2007. The CIP deviation exists with respect to several different dollar-denominated interest rates and exchange rate pairings of the dollar vis-a-vis other currencies. The results show that our proxies for margin conditions and for the cost of capital are significant determinants of the CIP deviations, especially during the crisis period. The supply of dollars by the Federal Reserve to foreign central banks via reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) reduced CIP deviations at this time. Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, uncertainty about counterparty risk became a significant determinant of CIP deviations, and the swap lines program no longer affected the CIP deviations significantly.

50|$|In the 1980s, risk {{arbitrage}} was common. In {{this form}} of speculation, one trades a security that is clearly undervalued or overvalued, when it is seen that the wrong valuation {{is about to be}} corrected by events. The standard example is the stock of a company, undervalued in the stock market, which is about to be the object of a takeover bid; the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company, giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price - if the merger goes through as predicted. Traditionally, <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transactions</b> in the securities markets involve high speed, high volume and low risk. At some moment a price difference exists, and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists (that is, before the other arbitrageurs act). When the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months, as above, it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage. One way of reducing the risk is through the illegal use of inside information, and in fact risk arbitrage with regard to leveraged buyouts was associated with some of the famous financial scandals of the 1980s such as those involving Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky.|$|R

The first chapter entitled, “Examination of the Effects of Arbitrage Activity on Terminated Takeover Transactions” is a detailed analysis of the performance of target companies 2 ̆ 7 security prices after a merger, tender offer or bear hug transaction is cancelled. In this chapter we examine whether investors can obtain abnormal returns from investing in situations where the arbitrage community unwinds their positions after an acquisition announcement is terminated. ^ In the second chapter, “Return Distribution Changes in Securities Involved with Mergers and Takeovers”, we examine the changes that occur in the distribution of security returns and betas when risk <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transactions</b> are announced. Secondly, we show that the distributions of returns from arbitrage opportunities are not normally distributed. We also examine arbitrage returns and the possible determinants of the returns. Finally, we use Monte Carlo simulation techniques to create risk arbitrage portfolios under various portfolio formation rules. We use these simulated portfolios to test the three different portfolio formation rules. ^ The third and final chapter, “A Microstructure Examination of Risk Arbitrage Behavior”, is a study involving the use of trade-by-trade data to analyze the changes that occur in the trading of stocks of target companies after a merger or tender offer is publicly announced and arbitrageurs begin to trade in the target company 2 ̆ 7 s stock. We look at the changes that occur in the target company 2 ̆ 7 s stock initially after the takeover announcement, during the trading life of the transaction, just prior to the closing of the transaction, {{and in the case of}} cancelled transactions we look at the changes just before and after the transaction are cancelled. In all these cases we compare the changes to a base period prior to the announcement that is free from the biases of insider trading, rumors and leakage. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the validity of}} the cost of carry model for pricing FTSE 100 futures contracts and the relationship between FTSE 100 spot and futures markets during two sub-periods characterised by different market trading systems employed by the LSE and LIFFE. The empirical work is carried out using three approaches to econometric modeling: a basic VECM for spot and futures prices, a VECM extended with a DCCTGARCH framework to account for the conditional variance-covariance structure for spot and futures prices and a threshold VECM to capture regime-dependent spot-futures price dynamics. Overall, both the basic VECM and the DCC-TGARCH analysis suggest that there are deviations from the cost of carry relationship in the first sub-sample when transactions costs in both markets are relatively high but that the cost of carry relationship tends to be valid in the second sub-sample when transactions costs are lower. This is further confirmed by the evidence of higher conditional correlations between the two markets in the second sub-sample as compared with the first, using the DCC-TGARCH analysis. This implies that the no-arbitrage cost of carry relationship between spot and futures markets is more effectively maintained by index arbitrageurs in the second period when market conditions are closer to perfect market assumptions, and hence the cost of carry model could be more reasonably used as a benchmark for pricing stock index futures. The threshold VECM analysis depicts regime-dependent price dynamics between FTSE 100 spot and futures markets and leads to some interesting and important findings: arbitrage may not be practicable under some market conditions, either because it is difficult to find counterparties for the <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transactions,</b> or because there is significant risk associated with arbitrage; as a result, the cost of carry model may not always be suitable for pricing stock index futures.
