40|$|During the {{amorphous}} ribbon production process, {{the mechanisms}} that cause uneven thickness and herringbone on two {{surfaces of the}} ribbon are very complicated. The high velocity rotating roller causes periodic air eddies near the surface and <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> around the contact zone. The <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> might be the major reason that causes the non-uniformity thickness and the ripples. In this paper, a two-dimension model was developed to simulate the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> eddies and a three-dimensional simulation was performed for the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> field around the puddle zone. Simulation {{results show that the}} higher velocity of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> around the puddle edges is closely related to thicker ribbon rim. The continuous air eddies along the roller surface and the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuations along the roller width are the major reasons causing non-uniform convective heat transfer during ribbon solidification. The frequency of air eddy matches well with the nominal ripple frequency along the ribbon length, and the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuation coincides with the herringbone wavelength along the ribbon width.

The performance {{tests were conducted}} with three type of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> using various <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates. 1) Collector efficiency increases as <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates increase. Among three types of <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> the order of efficiency is first, the reversed flow type, follwed by two-way flow type and the upper flow type. 2) The air temperature rise decrease as <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates increase. Especially in the reversed <b>flow</b> type, <b>air</b> temperature rise beyond 15 ℃ is attained when he average solar radiation is 1. 2 cal/cm²min. Thus, {{the results indicate that}} the reversed flow type offers the best performance of the three types of <b>air</b> <b>flow.</b> (2) The mathematical model of the solar collector was developed as one part of solar grain drying simulation. Simulation results for the temperatures of the absorbing plate,the cover and the air showed reasonable agreement with the experimental data. It was demonstrated that this model was reasonably valid for simulation studies of rise drying. (3) Then, the simulation model was used to predict collector performance. The results were as follows: 1) Temperatures of the absorbing plate rise with an increase in the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates and with a decrease in the collector area. 2) Air temperature is raised as <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates decrease and the collector area increases. 3) Collector efficiency increases with an increase in <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates.
