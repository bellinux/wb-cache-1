5|$|As {{technical}} director of Digital's Corporate Strategy Group, Kotok {{was instrumental in}} creating the Internet Business Group which advocated early adoption and integration of Internet and Web-based technologies. Digital created the <b>AltaVista</b> search engine, the Internet firewall, the Web portal, the webcast and live election returns. Digital continued its lead in Internet and Web development through difficult times, but Kotok questioned a corporate strategy that he believed consumed Web and Internet resources to sell Digital products like the AlphaServer. For example, he saw a missed opportunity in Millicent, the micropayment system for buying and selling Web content for fractions of a U.S. cent.|$|E

25|$|Several {{footpaths}} take hikers to {{the upper}} cable car terminal, and then onto the summit (with the permit). The most popular route is via the Refugio de <b>Altavista,</b> however these are demanding hikes requiring at least 4–5 hours of ascent.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there exists}} no {{autonomous}} system of [...] "fully automatic high quality translation of unrestricted text," [...] {{there are many}} programs now available {{that are capable of}} providing useful output within strict constraints. Several of these programs are available online, such as Google Translate and the SYSTRAN system that powers <b>AltaVista's</b> BabelFish (now Yahoo's Babelfish as of 9 May 2008).|$|R
40|$|Search by boolean queries {{suffers from}} a paradox of precision: if the query is too general (with respect to the corpus), the {{response}} is an avalanche; if the query is too specific, the response is empty. It is difficult to cast a query balanced on this scale of specificity that retrieves a reasonable number of items. Nowhere is this more evident, perhaps, than in search on the World Wide Web. For this reason, many Web search engines employ information retrieval (IR) techniques other than boolean search. Indeed, this problem of specificity is a key reason, in general, that other IR techniques have been researched. For instance, <b>AltaVista's</b> standard interface employs an IR scoring technique across the document list to rank-order a result list. (<b>AltaVista's</b> "advanced" interface is for boolean search.) However, the IR searches have problems too. Quite often, IR search queries result in avalanches. If the IR scoring is not "natural" for the query at hand, the documentsof -interest may be b [...] ...|$|R
50|$|There was {{significant}} {{growth in the}} use of machine translation {{as a result of the}} advent of low-cost and more powerful computers. It was in the early 1990s that machine translation began to make the transition away from large mainframe computers toward personal computers and workstations. Two companies that led the PC market for a time were Globalink and MicroTac, following which a merger of the two companies (in December 1994) was found to be in the corporate interest of both. Intergraph and Systran also began to offer PC versions around this time. Sites also became available on the internet, such as <b>AltaVista's</b> Babel Fish (using Systran technology) and Google Language Tools (also initially using Systran technology exclusively).|$|R

The city hosts the headquarters of the largest Italian publishing companies, such as Feltrinelli, Mondadori, RCS Media Group, Messaggerie Italiane, and Giunti Editore. Milan has also seen a rapid increase in internet companies with both domestic and international companies such as <b>Altavista,</b> Google, Lycos, Virgilio and Yahoo! establishing their Italian operations in the city.|$|E
25|$|Two {{teams of}} people have {{claimed to be the}} first to invent the CAPTCHAs used widely on the Web today. The first team {{consists}} of Mark D. Lillibridge, Martín Abadi, Krishna Bharat, and Andrei Broder, who used CAPTCHAs in 1997 at <b>AltaVista</b> to prevent bots from adding URLs to their web search engine. Looking for a way to make their images resistant to OCR attack, the team looked at the manual of their Brother scanner, which had recommendations for improving OCR's results (similar typefaces, plain backgrounds, etc.). The team created puzzles by attempting to simulate what the manual claimed would cause bad OCR.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a {{connection}} containing intensive censored terms {{may also be}} closed by The Great Firewall, and cannot be reestablished for several minutes. This affects all network connections including HTTP and POP, but the reset {{is more likely to}} occur during searching. Before the search engines censored themselves, many search engines had been blocked, namely Google and <b>AltaVista.</b> Technorati, a search engine for blogs, has been blocked. Different search engines implement the mandated censorship in different ways. For example, the search engine Bing is reported to censor search results from searches conducted in simplified Chinese characters (used in China), but not in traditional Chinese characters (used in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau).|$|E

500|$|... 4chan {{was started}} in 2003 in the bedroom of Christopher Poole, a then-15-year-old student from New York City whose 4chan handle is [...] "moot". Prior to {{starting}} 4chan, Poole had been a regular participant on the Something Awful forums. He intended 4chan to be an American counterpart to the popular Japanese Futaba Channel ("2chan") imageboard {{and a place to}} discuss manga and anime. Upon the creation of 4chan, Poole encouraged users from the Something Awful subforum titled [...] "Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse", who also happened to be dissatisfied with the forum, to discuss anime on his website. Poole originally used the Futaba Channel to obtain anime-related images, and liked the concept of a message board where people anonymously shared images, which eventually led to his idea of creating a similar English-based website. During the creation of 4chan, he obtained the source code for the Futaba Channel website, and translated the Japanese text into English using <b>Altavista's</b> Babelfish online translator. During 4chan's earliest days, it had only two boards: [...] "/a/ – Anime/General" [...] and [...] "/b/ – Anime/Random" [...] (the very first board to be created); more boards were created over time, and /b/ was eventually renamed to simply [...] "/b/ – Random".|$|R
25|$|The massive size of text {{available}} on the Web {{can be seen in}} the analysis of controlled data in which corpora of different languages were mixed in various proportions. The estimated Web size in words by <b>AltaVista</b> saw English at the top of the list with 76,598,718,000 words. The next is German, with 7,035,850,000 words along with 6 other languages with over a billion hits. Even languages with fewer hits on the Web such as Slovenian, Croatian, Malay, and Turkish have more than one hundred million words on the Web. This reveals the potential strength and accuracy of using the Web as a Corpus given its significant size, which warrants much additional research such as the project currently being carried out by the British National Corpus to exploit its scale.|$|E
25|$|Mobile {{search is}} {{important}} for the usability of mobile content for the same reasons as internet search engines became important to the usability of internet content. Early internet content was largely provided by portals such as Netscape. As the depth of available content grew, portals were unable to provide total coverage. As a result, Internet web search engines such as Google and <b>AltaVista</b> proved popular as a way of allowing users to find the increasingly specialist content they were looking for. In an international journal article, 'Exploring the logic of mobile search', Westlund, Gómez-Barroso, Compañó, and Feijóo(2011) outline a thorough review of research on mobile search usage, and also present an in-depth study of user patterns. They conclude that mobile search has started to change mobile media consumption patterns radically. They also emphasize that future developments of mobile search must be sensitive to the mobile logic.|$|E

500|$|In North Carolina, {{rainfall}} {{caused the}} Catawba, French Broad, Swannanoa, and Yadkin rivers to overflow their banks. Many nearby homes and structures were swept away. Families along the South Pacolet River near Tryon were evacuated. Additionally, two shelters {{were set up}} in Asheville, one at a Salvation Army post and another at the municipal auditorium, where hundreds of cots were set-up. A mudslide near Asheville moved across a railroad track, blocking the route to locomotive traffic. Several feet of water covered highways near Marshall, leaving many roads impassable. Extensive crop losses also occurred in western North Carolina, with agricultural losses reaching $250,000 in Burke County alone. Six {{people were killed in}} the state, of which four due to flooding and two others from a tornado in Ashley Heights. Property damage totaled over $1million. Rainfall from both the previous hurricane and this storm brought flooding to Virginia. Major flooding was reported along the Roanoke River from Brookneal to Roanoke. At the former, the river crested at [...] above flood stage. In <b>Altavista,</b> crops were ruined and 11buildings were flooded. Route 17 north of Fincastle was inundated, blocking traffic between Clifton Forge and Covington. Two deaths occurred in Virginia, one from drowning and another from fright while crossing the Roanoke River.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Altavista</b> {{is located}} 229km {{northwest}} {{of the city of}} Zacatecas. It was a ceremonial center, part of the Chalchihuite culture, active between 200 and 1000 CE.

2500|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Spanish, {{dominant}} ethnic groups included the Caxcans, Zacatecos, and Guachichils, with a probable rivalry between the Guchichils and the Caxcans. The history of these peoples is sketchy and it is not known when the first settlements were founding in the region. Between the fourth and tenth centuries in the Christian era, several large settlements developed such as <b>Altavista,</b> Chalchihuites and La Quemada, considered to be part of Greater Mesoamerica [...] Areas in the north of the state, without major settlements was part of what is called Aridoamerica, where inhabitants lived off hunting and gathering. The first of the major population centers emerged along the Suchil, Graceros and Guadiana Rivers. The archeological sites of today are all ceremonial centers and/or observatories in the center of metropolises.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} soon turned {{desperate for}} the allies, the Swiss rolling over the remaining Spanish Rodeleros and the French gendarmes besting the allied cavalry. [...] Ferdinand, easily recognized in his splendid garb, came under heavy attack, was unhorsed and threatened by enemy troops, {{only to be}} given the horse of a nobleman, alternately named as Giovanni di Capua or Juan de <b>Altavista,</b> who then gave his life delaying the enemy so that Ferdinand might escape. [...] Fernández De Córdoba led the Spanish cavalry and the remains of the infantry in a desperate delaying action against the French, which, together with the illness of the French leader, allowed the fleeing Neapolitans to escape. [...] The Spanish themselves were then able to reach the safety of Seminara, the French troops apparently being content to remain in occupancy of the field, the traditional method of claiming victory.|$|E
