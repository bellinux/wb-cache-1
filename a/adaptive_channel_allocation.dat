Applications need to adapt their functionality according to dynamic change of their QoS update. This paper proposes an enhanced service based platform to provide adaptive network management services to higher level application layer components.

One of the main challenges for seamless mobility is the availability of simple and robust handoff algorithms, which allow a mobile node to roam among heterogeneous wireless networks. In this paper, the authors devise a scheme, A Novel <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>Allocation</b> Scheme (ACAS) where the number of guard channel(s) is adjusted automatically based on the average handoff blocking rate measured in the past certain period of time. The handoff blocking rate is controlled under the designated threshold and the new call blocking rate is minimized. The performance evaluation of the ACAS is done through simulation of nodes. The result shows that the ACAS scheme outperforms the Static Channel Allocation Scheme by controlling a hard constraint on the handoff rejection probability.

Orthogonal frequency {{division multiple access}} (OFDMA) {{can be used as}} the multi-hop wireless access technique. However, since the number of available subcarriers is limited, the same subcarrier must be reused in different multi-hop links and therefore, co-channel interference limits the performance of multi-hop OFDMA VCN. Using OFDMA, the channel is composed of a block of subcarriers. OFDMA VCN requires an <b>adaptive</b> <b>channel</b> <b>allocation</b> to minimize the co-channel interference.

In this paper, we propose a distributed channel allocation scheme based on the maximization of the signal-tointerference plus noise power ratio (SINR) of each multi-hop link. Since the channel allocation is performed at each link, central port does not need to collect the SINR information of all multi-hop links.

Consequently, future mobile systems are envisioned to support a wide variety of applications. The support of these diverse services (e. g. data and multimedia) has led to different bandwidth requirements, inevitably rendering many of the traditional radio resource management (RRM) mechanisms deficient. For one, the present radio resource dimensioning strategy that dimensions radio resource based on "busy hour" traffic does not allow operators to efficiently utilised the radio resource, which is scarce and limited. In line with the future demand driven resource allocation, two novel Scalable Resource Allocation (ScRA) techniques are proposed in this thesis to optimise the utilisation of radio resources within multiple services. The proposed novel ScRA techniques performances are evaluated on a typical GSM/GPRS mobile network through our developed dynamic system level simulator. Based on the simulation results, significant radio resource utilization gain, higher data throughput, lesser delay for data connections can be achieved with the use of our ScRA technique over the conventional StRA technique. For example, when the WWW arrival rate reaches approximate 35 Kbits/sec, ScRA technique can attain the throughput difference as high as 27. 663 %.

The conventional static wireless protocols, such as Zigbee, WiFi, may not guarantee the quality of service (QoS) requirements for some specific applications under the complex and dynamic spectrum environment. There are protocols such as Bluetooth [26] and WirelessHART [27]. Both adopt channel hopping to avoid channel interferences in the ISM band. Nevertheless, the hopping pattern is fixed and it cannot be updated according to the communication environment. Moreover, both protocols require critical time synchronization, which brings extra costs and overheads. An <b>adaptive</b> <b>channel</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme is proposed in [28], which allows Zigbee nodes under significant interferences to switch to new channels with less collisions. To minimize the effect of WiFi interferences to Zigbee nodes, an interference detection and avoidance strategy is proposed in [29], which selects the channel that is least likely to have interferences. Parameters, such as link quality indicator (LQI) [30] and packet deliver ratio (PDR) [31], are used as metrics for channel switching. However, they are not directly related to interferences. In this paper, combined with packets pipelining transmission, we measure the packet loss probability in each communication round to detect the interference. Only after the packet loss probability obviously increases, the system starts spectrum sensing and then dynamically accesses the best channel in its vicinity.

For WSNs with an insufficient number of channels, we formulate a fair <b>channel</b> <b>allocation</b> problem whose objective is to minimize the maximum interference (MinMax) experienced by any transmission link in the network. We prove that MinMax <b>channel</b> <b>allocation</b> is NP-hard and propose a distributed link-based MinMax <b>channel</b> <b>allocation</b> protocol. We also propose a distributed protocol for link scheduling based on MinMax <b>channel</b> <b>allocation.</b> Simulations based on real topologies and data traces collected from a WSN testbed consisting of 74 TelosB motes, and using random topologies have shown that our <b>channel</b> <b>allocation</b> protocols significantly outperform a state-of-the-art <b>channel</b> <b>allocation</b> protocol.

40|$|Multi-radio <b>channel</b> <b>allocation</b> in {{competitive}} wireless networks <b>Channel</b> <b>allocation</b> {{has been extensively}} studied {{in the framework of}} cellular networks, but the emergence of new system concepts, such as cognitive radio systems, bring this topic into the focus of research again. In this paper, we provide a formal analysis of the selfish multi-radio <b>channel</b> <b>allocation</b> problem using game theory. We conclude that in spite of the non-cooperative behavior of such devices, their <b>channel</b> <b>allocation</b> results in a Pareto- and system-optimal solution. Furthermore, we present a simple algorithm to achieve this efficient <b>channel</b> <b>allocation.</b> To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first contribution to this important topic. 1...|$|R
