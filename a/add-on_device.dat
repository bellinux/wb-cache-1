[...] While the add-on did contain a faster central processing unit than the Genesis, {{as well as some}} enhanced graphics capabilities, the main focus of the device was to expand the size of games.

500|$|Seeking {{to create}} an <b>add-on</b> <b>device</b> for the Genesis, Sega {{developed}} the unit to read compact discs as its storage medium. The main benefit of CD technology was greater storage capacity, which allowed for games to be nearly 320 times larger than their Genesis cartridge counterparts. This benefit manifested {{in the form of}} full motion video (FMV) games like the controversial Night Trap, which became a focus of the 1993 Congressional hearings on issues of video game violence and ratings. Sega Enterprises in Japan partnered with JVC to design the add-on and refused to consult with Sega of America until the project was completed. Sega of America assembled parts from various [...] "dummy" [...] units to obtain a working prototype. While the add-on became known for several well-received games such as Sonic CD and , its game library contained a large number of Genesis ports and FMV titles.

[...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An <b>add-on</b> <b>device</b> is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E

40|$|Short Abstract: Aerodynamic drag of tractor-trailers using <b>add-on</b> <b>devices</b> {{were studied}} using CFD {{simulations}} and wind tunnel testing on scale-model. Five external attachments were tested for effectiveness: (i) front fairing, (ii) trailer top, (iii) side skirt, (iv) gap cover and (v) trailing end oval. The resulting aerodynamic drag coefficients were significantly lower. Full Abstract: Aerodynamic drag has {{significant influence on}} fuel consumption in large tractor-trailers. The primary objective {{of the current study}} is to reduce aerodynamic drag using <b>add-on</b> <b>devices.</b> Two approaches have been employed to measure the effectiveness of these devices: CFD simulation and scale model testing in wind tunnel. A 3 D full-scale model was developed in SOLIDWORKS package. In addition, a scale model prototype was constructed to perform wind tunnel tests. Five external attachments were tested for effectiveness: (i) front fairing, (ii) trailer top, (iii) side skirt, (iv) gap cover and (v) rear end oval. The drag reducing effects of the attachments were measured at various air speeds using both CFD and wind-tunnel simulations. The drag reducing effects of the various <b>add-on</b> <b>devices</b> and agreements between the results from CFD and wind tunnel testing were recorded. The resulting drag coefficients (C¬d) were significantly lower than those without add-ons. The wind tunnel model was limited to 15 inches in length, compared to over 70 feet for a real tractor-trailer. Tests were also conducted for various yaw angles for their effects on drag. This study demonstrated the importance of optimizing a tractor-trailer shape by streamlining the airflow around and over the tractor-trailer assembly...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) {{which have}} a valve holding chamber plus a {{mouthpiece}} or mask have, in recent years, markedly improved the ease, speed and reliability of aerosol therapy for reversible airflow obstruction in adults, children and infants. MDIs, effective and easily accessible when patients are away from home, are {{the gold standard for}} the treatment of reversible airflow obstruction since they provide reliable, reproducible, effort-independent dosing, protection of their contents from environmental humidity and bacterial infection {{and at the same time}} are the most readily pocketable, efficient and least expensive aerosol therapy devices available. When combined with <b>add-on</b> <b>devices</b> they are also the most versatile delivery system because they are well suited to a variety of patients and virtually any therapeutic task. With our improved understanding of the importance of drug targeting to the site of action, the most important aspects of the relationship between particle size and drug deposition throughout the lower respiratory tract are discussed.

40|$|Servere air-traffic {{constraints}} {{are imposed}} by commercial airports following public {{complaints about the}} ever increasing noise impact. This situation lead to renewed emphasis by aviation industry into aircraft noise source research. While the engine noise still dominates during aircraft full-power take-off, it is the airframe noise which represents the essential contributor to the overall flyover noise signature in the landing phase for today's high-bypass ratio engine powered large commercial aircraft. Therefore in Europe a research project was launched aiming at the reduction of landing gear noise, which is the dominant airframe noise component for wide-body aircraft and the subject area of this paper. Based on the knowledge of a state-of-the-art full scale A 340 nose- and main-landing gear baseline noise test, realistic noise reduction <b>add-on</b> <b>devices</b> were developed for these gears and the devices' effectiveness tested in a dedicated wind tunnel study. Both farfield noise data were taken and techniques employed for noise source localization. By removing the noise reduction devices orderly, their individual effectiveness were assessed.

Nintendo attempted to counter the piracy problem by slightly modifying the hardware in newer revisions, but they were unable to stop the unauthorized copying.

40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Nowadays {{the fuel}} economy {{has become more}} and more {{important}} to both manufacturers and individual users. The main approach to achieve better fuel economy is to lower the vehicle and improve the aerodynamic performance. Lower vehicle???s mass is to reduce the mass by innovation design of vehicle???s structure, exterior, interior and apply with appropriate materials. To improve the aerodynamic performance mainly is to reduce drag, which is a major factor of highway fuel consumption. In order to maintain the vehicles capacity and comfort, the improvement of aerodynamics should not majorly affect the body shape. The purpose of this research is to apply aerodynamic <b>add-on</b> <b>devices</b> to the Low Mass Vehicle to verify the aerodynamic performance while the vehicle body shape would remain untouched. The research approach is using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique.

Over the years, numerous <b>add-on</b> <b>devices</b> have been invented to help reduce drag and fuel consumption. The current research extends our previous idea of add-on humps and investigates their effect in conjuction with curved boat-tail flaps. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the form of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) and detached-eddy (DES) simulations were used to determine viable design strategies. Design optimization was applied on the new <b>add-on</b> <b>devices.</b> A 3 D baseline computational model was constructed using an Ahmed body. The predicted drag coefficient of the baseline configuration showed good agreement with experimental data. The results from the optimized design with add-on humps and curved boat-tail flaps are shown to have a 50. 9 % reduction in drag coefficient. The predicted results using three different turbulent models, including standard k-ε, RNG k-ε, and DES, were compared with each other. Predictions with the standard k-ε model produced the best agreement with the baseline experimental drag coefficient.

Particle Image Velocimetry was used in a closed loop low speed wind tunnel to investigate the vortex structures of a half-span wing model with a slender reverse delta type <b>add-on</b> <b>device</b> in the landing configuration.

The vortex characteristics dependence on angle of attack and roll, at mean chord based Reynolds number is also analyzed. The peak tangential velocity, peak vorticity and the circulation magnitude of the resultant vortices produced downstream of the half-span wing model are explored.
