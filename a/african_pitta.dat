25|$|Like most birds the pittas are monogamous breeders, {{and defend}} {{breeding}} territories. Most species are seasonal breeders, timing their breeding to {{occur at the}} onset of the rainy season. An exception to this is the superb pitta, which breeds almost year-round, as the island of Manus which it breeds on remains wet all year. The courtship behaviours of the family are poorly known, but the elaborate dance of the <b>African</b> <b>pitta</b> includes jumping into the air with a puffed out breast and parachuting down back down to the perch.|$|E
25|$|The pittas are {{strongly}} territorial, with territories varying {{in size from}} 3000 m² in the <b>African</b> <b>pitta</b> to 10,000m² in the rainbow pitta. Pittas will perform territory defence displays {{on the edges of}} their territories, although fights between rivals have only been recorded once. One such territorial display is given by the rainbow pitta, which holds its legs straight and bows to a rival on the edge of territory, while making a purring call. Displays like this are paired with calls made out of sight of potential rivals; these territorial calls are frequent and can account for up to 12% of a bird's daylight activity. Migratory species will defend non-breeding feeding territories in addition to their breeding ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{movements}} of pittas are poorly known and notoriously difficult to study. Bird ringing studies have not shed much light on this, one {{study in the}} Philippines ringed 2000 red-bellied pittas but only recaptured ten birds, and {{only one of these}} recaptures was more than two months after the initial capture. Only four species of pitta are fully or mostly migratory, all in the genus Pitta, the Indian pitta, <b>African</b> <b>pitta,</b> fairy pitta and blue-winged pitta. In addition to these four the northern subspecies of the hooded pitta (cucullata) is a full migrant. Other species make smaller or more local, and poorly understood, movements across small parts of their range, for example the noisy pitta of Australia. The migration of pittas is apparently nocturnal, and pittas migrate in small loose flocks which use the same resting and foraging sites each year.|$|E
50|$|Bird life is also prolific. The park boasts 325 sited {{species of}} birds, {{including}} the olive long-tailed cuckoo, western tinkerbird, {{two species of}} <b>pittas</b> (<b>African</b> and green-breasted) and the African grey parrot. The ground thrush (Turdus kibalensis) is endemic to Kibale National Park.|$|R
50|$|The plumage is {{very similar}} to that of the <b>African</b> <b>pitta,</b> but the breast is green and the throat is bordered by a black line. Immatures have duller, darker plumage, and a {{brownish}} olive breast.|$|E

50|$|Chizarira National Park, plays host {{to most of}} the {{expected}} plains wildlife as well as megafauna such as African elephant, lion, leopard and Cape buffalo. There are also many species of smaller wildlife, including the klipspringer, known for its ability to thrive in near-vertical rocky outcrops. Chizarira has a large variety of bird life and hundreds of species have been sighted within the Park. Sought after birds recorded include the African broadbill, Livingstone's flycatcher, yellow-spotted nicator, African emerald cuckoo and the rare and elusive <b>African</b> <b>pitta.</b> Chizarira is also home to the Taita falcon which breeds within the Park.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>pitta</b> (Pitta angolensis) is an Afrotropical bird of {{the family}} Pittidae. It is a locally common to {{uncommon}} species, resident and migratory in the west, and an intra-African migrant between equatorial and southeastern Africa. They are elusive and hard to observe despite their brightly coloured plumage, and their loud, explosive calls are infrequently heard. The plump, somewhat thrush-like birds forage on leaf litter under the canopy of riparian or coastal forest and thickets, or in climax miombo forest. They spend much time during mornings and at dusk scratching in leaf litter or around termitaria, or may stand motionless for long periods. Following rains breeding birds call and display from the mid-canopy.|$|E
