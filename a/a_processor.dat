5|$|Simultaneous {{multithreading}} (of which Intel's Hyper-Threading is {{the best}} known) was an early form of pseudo-multi-coreism. <b>A</b> <b>processor</b> capable of simultaneous multithreading includes multiple execution units in the same processing unit—that is it has a superscalar architecture—and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from multiple threads. Temporal multithreading {{on the other hand}} includes a single execution unit in the same processing unit and can issue one instruction at a time from multiple threads.|$|E
5|$|However, power {{consumption}} P by a chip {{is given by}} the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle (proportional {{to the number of}} transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in <b>a</b> <b>processor.</b> Increasing processor {{power consumption}} led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> superscalar <b>processor</b> is <b>a</b> CPU that {{implements}} {{a form of}} parallelism called instruction-level parallelism within <b>a</b> single <b>processor.</b> In {{contrast to}} <b>a</b> scalar <b>processor,</b> which can execute at most one single instruction per clock cycle, <b>a</b> superscalar <b>processor</b> can execute more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions to different execution units on the processor. It therefore allows for more throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time) than would otherwise be possible at a given clock rate. Each execution unit is not <b>a</b> separate <b>processor</b> (or <b>a</b> core if the <b>processor</b> is <b>a</b> multi-core <b>processor),</b> but <b>an</b> execution resource within a single CPU such as an arithmetic logic unit.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} strategy, and {{the only}} sandbox strategy available in systems that {{do not meet the}} Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements, is where the operating system is not running user programs as native code, but instead either emulates <b>a</b> <b>processor</b> or provides a host for a p-code based system such as Java.|$|E
25|$|Clock rate of <b>a</b> <b>processor</b> chip {{refers to}} the {{frequency}} at which the central processing unit (CPU) is running.

For basic calculators, the speed can vary from a few hundred hertz to the kilohertz range.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{improved}} performance is in microarchitecture techniques exploiting {{the growth of}} available transistor count. Out-of-order execution and on-chip caching and prefetching reduce the memory latency bottleneck {{at the expense of}} using more transistors and increasing the processor complexity. These increases are described empirically by Pollack's Rule, which states that performance increases due to microarchitecture techniques are square root of the number of transistors or the area of <b>a</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|E

40|$|Recently {{researches}} {{in natural}} language processing are developed because of a rapid progress in software and hardware. Especially, the appearance of programming language Prolog makes remarkable improvements {{in the field of}} rule repetitive application. The authors have recently constructed an experimental machine translation system named BIJET (____directional J____apanese E____nglish T____ranslation system). This system consists of three parts : <b>a</b> Japanese <b>processor,</b> <b>a</b> English <b>processor</b> and <b>a</b> transfer <b>processor.</b> Both Japanese and English processors are divided into a morphological analyser, a morphological synthesizer and <b>a</b> syntactic <b>processor.</b> <b>A</b> transfer <b>processor</b> is divided into <b>a</b> Japanese-English transfer <b>processor</b> and <b>a</b> English-Japanese one. BIJET is programmed in Prolog and Lisp. Especially the syntactic processors are written only by Prolog.

25|$|Conventional PCI, often {{shortened}} to PCI, is a {{local computer}} bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer. PCI is the initialism for Peripheral Component Interconnect and {{is part of the}} PCI Local Bus standard. The PCI bus supports the functions found on <b>a</b> <b>processor</b> bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor's native bus. Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor's address space. It is a parallel bus, synchronous to a single bus clock.|$|E
25|$|The {{relatively}} small number of processors in early systems, allowed them to easily use a shared memory architecture, which allows processors to access a common pool of memory. In the early days a common approach was the use of uniform memory access (UMA), in which access time to a memory location was similar between processors. The use of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) allowed <b>a</b> <b>processor</b> to access its own local memory faster than other memory locations, while cache-only memory architectures (COMA) allowed for the local memory of each processor to be used as cache, thus requiring coordination as memory values changed.|$|E

25|$|We {{can assume}} that as we write text left to right, we are {{increasing}} the 'address' on paper, as <b>a</b> <b>processor</b> would write bytes with increasing memory addresses − as in the adjacent table. On paper, the hex value 0a0b0c0d (written 168496141 in usual decimal notation) is big-endian style since we write the most significant digit first and the rest follow in decreasing significance. Mapping this number as a binary value to a sequence of 4 bytes in memory in big-endian style also writes the bytes {{from left to right}} in decreasing significance: 0Ah at +0, 0Bh at +1, 0Ch at +2, 0Dh at +3.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{finding in}} amnesic patients with MTL damage is the impairment of memory in all sensory modalities – sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight. This {{reflects the fact}} that the MTL is <b>a</b> <b>processor</b> for all of the sensory modalities, and helps store these kind of thoughts into memory. In addition, subjects can often remember how to perform relatively simple tasks immediately (on the order of 10 seconds), but when the task becomes more difficult, even on the same time scale, subjects tend to forget. This demonstrates the difficulty of separating procedural memory tasks from declarative memory; some elements of declarative memory may be used in learning procedural tasks.|$|E
