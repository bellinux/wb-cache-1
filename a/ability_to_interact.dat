5|$|X-Men Legends {{is played}} as an action {{role-playing}} game. Players choose {{a team of}} up to four characters from a larger group of X-Men. As players proceed through the game additional X-Men are unlocked. On the console versions up to four players can play in the cooperative campaign, {{with the ability to}} add or remove players at any time. Cooperative play features a refined combat system and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with non-player characters. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or against waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{secondary}} motive for men, especially young males, for learning the agung: the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with young, unmarried women. Both Maranao and Maguindanao cultures traditionally adhere to Islamic customs which prohibit dating or causal conversation between the opposite sexes (unless married to or related to by blood) and therefore performances such as kulintang music provided the opportunity for such a connection. Among the Maguindanao, the rhythmic modes of duyog and sinulog a kamamatuan allowed agung players to serenade the young, unmarried women on the kulintang. Tidto, the other rhythmic mode, {{could also be used}} but players rarely use this for serenading since the kulintang player is usually an older woman.|$|E

25|$|It was Portugal's connection, {{through the}} vast Portuguese Empire, {{to a full}} world of trade, culture, and commerce, from Japan to Brazil and from the Azores to Goa, that allowed the Portuguese Renaissance to be born.

25|$|Some of Harlow's final {{experiments}} explored social deprivation {{in the quest}} to create an animal model {{for the study of}} depression. This study is the most controversial, and involved isolation of infant and juvenile macaques for various periods of time. Monkeys placed in isolation exhibited social deficits when introduced or re-introduced into a peer group. They appeared unsure of how to interact with their conspecifics, and mostly stayed separate from the group, demonstrating the importance of social interaction and stimuli in forming the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with conspecifics in developing monkeys, and, comparatively, in children.|$|E
25|$|Aspergillus also utilises {{a number}} of factors to {{continue}} evading host responses, notably the use of proteolytic enzymes that interrupt IgG antibodies aimed towards it. Another important feature is its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> and integrate with epithelial surfaces, which results in massive pro-inflammatory counter-response by the immune system involving IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 (a CCL2 receptor ligand). Proteases released by both the fungus and neutrophils induce further injury to the respiratory epithelium, leading to initiation of repair mechanisms (such as influx of serum and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins) at the site of infection. Aspergillus spores and hyphae can interact with ECM proteins, and it is hypothesised that this process facilitates the binding of spores to damaged respiratory sites.|$|E
25|$|The Walking Dead is {{a graphic}} adventure, played from a third-person {{perspective}} {{with a variety}} of cinematic camera angles, in which the player, as protagonist Lee Everett, works with a rag-tag group of survivors to stay alive {{in the midst of a}} zombie apocalypse. The player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with their surroundings, and options to determine the nature of that interaction. For example, the player may be able to look at a character, talk to that character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or ask them about it. According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead.|$|E

40|$|Could {{interacting}} mindreaders be in {{a position}} to know things which they would be unable to know if they were manifestly passive observers? This paper argues that they could. Mindreading is sometimes reciprocal: the mindreader’s target reciprocates by taking the mindreader as a target for mindreading. The paper explains how such reciprocity can significantly narrow the range of possible interpretations of behaviour where mindreaders are, or appear to be, {{in a position}} <b>to</b> <b>interact.</b> A consequence is that revisions and extensions are needed to standard theories of the evidential basis of mindreading.

Aware of Shepherd's plans, Grey begins to question her feelings for Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell), with whom she had previously began a relationship. Unable to decide between what she wants and what she needs, Grey unwillingly stirs a rivalry between the two men. Now being unemployed, Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) tries to move on after the death of her fiancé, Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Realizing that she is unable to do so, she starts using baking as the way to overcome the grief. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) realizes her decisive role in Duquette's death, and begins experiencing strong guilt. Influenced by the recent revelations, Bailey tries to convince Stevens to reenter the internship program, which she had left {{as a result of her}} actions leading up to Duquette's death. Ultimately, Stevens chooses to attempt at returning to work at the hospital.|$|E

The New Straits Times also appreciated the game's performance with a 3Dfx Voodoo card, praising the graphics of the terrain, as well as water and helicopter movements. GameFan acclaimed the attention to detail and variety in environment graphics' textures. Reviewing the PC version, Allgame called the graphics [...] "decent", but criticised the minimal progress from Soviet Strike which resulted in [...] "a slightly archaic look" [...] and lack of [...] "a feel of individuality". Reviewing Nuclear Strike 64, the website noted that the graphics ably handled numerous explosions and enemies. The reviewer praised the detail, colours and fluid motion. He also acknowledged the use of N64 Expansion Pak, but said [...] "the game still moves and looks very nice" [...] without it. Game Revolution felt: [...] "This is definitely the best-looking 'Strike' game yet." [...] It praised the [...] "gorgeously rendered" [...] maps and the detail on structures and units, while Next Generation complained of [...] "water that doesn't ripple and a few other missing touches" [...] resulting in a somewhat haphazard feel. Daily Radar praised the terrain graphics but called the vehicles [...] "horrible". Power Play praised the impressive graphics and destructible scenery. Game Revolution also praised the persistent battlefields: [...] "What really stands out is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with everything.
