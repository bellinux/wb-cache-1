5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool <b>and</b> <b>dreaming</b> of what they would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E
5|$|Dave Matthews Band is an American rock band, {{formed in}} Charlottesville, Virginia in 1991 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews. Other band members include bassist Stefan Lessard, violinist Boyd Tinsley, and drummer Carter Beauford. In November 1990, Matthews {{became friends with}} a lawyer named Ross Hoffman while a {{bartender}} in Charlottesville. Hoffman convinced Matthews to create a demo album of a few songs that he had written. Matthews then shared the demo with other musicians, including Beauford and Moore. Both of them, who were jazz musicians at the time, joined Matthews after hearing the demo. The band has released eight studio albums, all with RCA Records: Under the Table <b>and</b> <b>Dreaming</b> (1994), Crash (1996), Before These Crowded Streets (1998), Everyday (2001), Busted Stuff (2002), Stand Up (2005), Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King (2009), Away from the World (2012). They have sold over 31 million albums in the United States, making them {{one of the top}} 100 highest-selling music acts of all-time.|$|E
25|$|An objectivist {{would argue}} that the {{religious}} experience is a proof of God's existence. However, others have criticised the reliability of religious experiences.

25|$|Furthermore, the pineal gland is a {{hypothetical}} candidate for producing a mind's eye; Rick Strassman {{and others have}} postulated that during near-death experiences (NDEs) <b>and</b> <b>dreaming,</b> the gland might secrete a hallucinogenic chemical N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) to produce internal visuals when external sensory data is occluded.

25|$|The book is {{separated}} into {{two or three}} parts, depending upon the edition, each part having several chapters. Part one deals with questions relating to heat such as the sources of heat {{and its effects on}} humans and animals, while Part two deals with questions relating to air, explaining why metal rusts in air, the operation of barometers and the transmission of sound. A Miscellaneous section deals with several more nebulous questions, including questions about sleep <b>and</b> <b>dreaming.</b> Within each part, the different chapters break the questions and answers up into subject areas organised thematically.|$|E
25|$|However, {{research}} by Mark Solms suggests that dreams are {{generated in the}} forebrain, and that REM sleep <b>and</b> <b>dreaming</b> are not directly related. While working in the neurosurgery department at hospitals in Johannesburg and London, Solms had access to patients with various brain injuries. He began to question patients about their dreams and confirmed that patients with damage to the parietal lobe stopped dreaming; this finding was in line with Hobson's 1977 theory. However, Solms did not encounter cases of loss of dreaming with patients having brainstem damage. This observation forced him to question Hobson's prevailing theory, which marked the brainstem {{as the source of}} the signals interpreted as dreams.|$|E

25|$|Several dialogues tackle {{questions}} about art: Socrates says that poetry {{is inspired by}} the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, {{and other forms of}} divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, <b>and</b> <b>dreaming)</b> in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great poetry, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literature that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, on a {{scorching}} {{hot summer}} night, Carnehan creeps into the narrator's office. He is a broken man, a crippled beggar clad in rags {{and he tells}} an amazing story. Dravot and Carnehan succeeded in becoming kings: traversing treacherous mountains, finding the Kafirs, mustering an army, taking over villages, <b>and</b> <b>dreaming</b> of building a unified nation and even an empire. The Kafirs (pagans, not Muslims) were impressed by the rifles and Dravot's lack of fear of their idols, and acclaimed him as a god, the reincarnation or descendant of Alexander the Great. They show a whiter complexion than others of the area ("so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends") implying their ancient lineage to Alexander himself. The Kafirs practised a form of Masonic ritual, and Dravot's reputation was further cemented when he showed knowledge of Masonic secrets that only the oldest priest remembered.|$|E
25|$|Kublai was {{attracted}} by the abilities of Tibetan monks as healers. In 1253 he made Drogön Chögyal Phagpa of the Sakya school, {{a member of his}} entourage. Phagpa bestowed on Kublai and his wife, Chabi (Chabui), an empowerment (initiation ritual). Kublai appointed Lian Xixian of the Kingdom of Qocho (1231–1280) the head of his pacification commission in 1254. Some officials, who were jealous of Kublai's success, said that he was getting above himself <b>and</b> <b>dreaming</b> of having his own empire by competing with Möngke's capital Karakorum. Möngke Khan sent two tax inspectors, Alamdar (Ariq Böke's close friend and governor in North China) and Liu Taiping, to audit Kublai's officials in 1257. They found fault, listed 142 breaches of regulations, accused Chinese officials and executed some of them, and Kublai's new pacification commission was abolished. Kublai sent a two-man embassy with his wives and then appealed in person to Möngke, who publicly forgave his younger brother and reconciled with him.|$|E

500|$|The {{two most}} widely {{accepted}} altered states are sleep <b>and</b> <b>dreaming.</b> [...] Although dream sleep and non-dream sleep appear very similar to an outside observer, each {{is associated with a}} distinct pattern of brain activity, metabolic activity, and eye movement; [...] each is also associated with a distinct pattern of experience and cognition. [...] During ordinary non-dream sleep, people who are awakened report only vague and sketchy thoughts, and their experiences do not cohere into a continuous narrative. [...] During dream sleep, in contrast, people who are awakened report rich and detailed experiences in which events form a continuous progression, which may however be interrupted by bizarre or fantastic intrusions. [...] Thought processes during the dream state frequently show a high level of irrationality. [...] Both dream and non-dream states are associated with severe disruption of memory: [...] it usually disappears in seconds during the non-dream state, and in minutes after awakening from a dream unless actively refreshed.|$|E

I am so sorry I can in no way help you or be useful. In such moments I am sorry I'm not a man." [...] As Tatiana grew into adulthood, she {{undertook}} more public appearances than her sisters and headed committees. Vyrubova recalled that she became better known to the public than her three sisters because of her attention to duty and her ability to engage those she met. In their memoirs, both her mother's friend, Vyrubova, and lady in waiting Lili Dehn recalled that Tatiana, the most social of the sisters, longed for friends her own age but her social life was restricted by her rank and her mother's distaste for society. She also had a more introspective side, known only to her closest friends and family. [...] "With her, as with her mother, shyness and reserve were accounted as pride, but, once you knew her and had gained her affection, this reserve disappeared and the real Tatiana became apparent," [...] Dehn recalled. [...] "She was a poetical creature, always yearning for the ideal, <b>and</b> <b>dreaming</b> of great friendships which might be hers." ...|$|E
500|$|Opposed to Another Green Worlds music, which Eno {{described}} as [...] "sky music", Eno {{referred to the}} music of Before and After Science as [...] "ocean music". References to water in the lyrics appear in songs such as [...] "Backwater", [...] "Julie With..." [...] and [...] "By this River". Author Simon Reynolds noted themes of [...] "boredom" [...] and [...] "bliss" [...] through the album, citing [...] "Here He Comes", about [...] "a boy trying to vanish by floating through the sky through a different time" [...] and [...] "Spider and I", about a boy watching the sky <b>and</b> <b>dreaming</b> about being carried away with a ship, as examples. Eno's songwriting style was {{described as}} [...] "a sound-over-sense approach". Influenced by poet Kurt Schwitters, Eno consciously did not make songwriting or lyrics the main focus in the music. Tom Carson of Rolling Stone noted this style, stating that the lyrics are [...] "only complementary variables" [...] to the music on the album. Lester Bangs commented on Eno's lyrical style on [...] "Julie with..." [...] stating that the lyrics themes [...] "could be a murderer's ruminations, or simply a lovers' retreat... or Julie could be three years old". Schwitters' influence is also shown on the song [...] "Kurt's Rejoinder", on which samples of Schwitters' poem [...] "Ursonate" [...] can be heard.|$|E
500|$|Billboard {{magazine}} said Dreaming of You was predominantly {{purchased by}} Latinos in the U.S.; demonstrating the {{purchasing power of}} Hispanic music consumers. The album was believed to have [...] "open the eyes" [...] of retailers who never stocked Latin music; its sales were well above expectations of white, American music shop owners. Sales of Selena's earlier albums <b>and</b> <b>Dreaming</b> of You prompted Best Buy and other retailers to hire Latin music specialists. Within weeks, the album was predicted to outsell Julio Iglesias' 1100 Bel Air Place (1984), as the largest-selling English-language Latin album. EMI Records announced in the December 2, 1995 issue of Billboard magazine that as EMI's best-selling record in North America, the album gave them the highest sales for a music label {{during the first half}} of 1995. With Dreaming of You peaking at number one, Tejano music entered the mainstream market. Music critics said the general population of the U.S. would not have known about Tejano or Latin music had it not been for Dreaming of You. Following the album's release, and because of the singer's death, Tejano music's popularity waned as Latin pop began dominating U.S. radio play and commercial sales. In March 2015, the Chicano Humanities & Arts Council in Denver, Colorado, showcased an exhibit called [...] "Dreaming of You: The Selena Art Show", which prominently featured artwork by Chicano artists who paid homage to the singer.|$|E
