50|$|Cyril Frank Uwins OBE, AFC, FRAeS (1896-1972) was a British {{test pilot}} {{who worked for}} Bristol Aeroplane Company, where he made the first flight of 58 {{different}} types of aircraft. On 16 September 1932 he broke the world <b>aeroplane</b> <b>height</b> record by climbing to 43,976 ft (nearly 8½ miles). He eventually became the Chairman of Bristol Aircraft. He was also Chairman of the Society of British Aircraft Manufacturer between 1956 and 1958, and {{he was awarded the}} Royal Aeronautical Society silver medal for aeronautics.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of 3 D modelling in the Lusatian Borough, Biskupin, using archival data. Pre-war photographs acquired from different heights, e. g., from a captive balloon (maximum height up to 150  m), from a blimp (at a height of 50 – 110  m) and from an <b>aeroplane</b> (at a <b>height</b> of 200  m, 300  m and up to 3  km). In order to generate 3 D models, AgiSoft tools were applied, as they allow for restoring shapes using triangular meshes. Individual photographs were processed using Google SketchUp software and the "shape from shadow" method. The usefulness of these particular models in archaeological research work was also analysed...|$|R
60|$|There is, I believe, {{only one}} grade higher possible. The success of B2 {{depends upon the}} {{completeness}} of the aerial observation. The invention of an anti-aircraft gun which would be practically sure of hitting and bringing down an <b>aeroplane</b> at any <b>height</b> whatever up to 20,000 feet, would restore the defensive and establish what I should think must be the final grade of war, A3. But at present {{nothing of the sort}} exists and nothing of the sort is likely to exist for a very long time; at present hitting an aeroplane by any sort of gun at all is a rare and uncertain achievement. Such a gun is not impossible and therefore we must suppose such a gun will some day be constructed, but it will be of a novel type and character, unlike anything at present in existence. The grade of fighting that I was privileged to witness on the Somme, the grade at which a steady successful offensive is possible, is therefore, I conclude, the grade at which the present war will end.|$|R
5000|$|... 31 May 1918 - Lt (T./Capt.) Christopher Joseph Quintin Brand, MC, RAF - Awarded the Distinguished Service Order for gallant {{services}} rendered {{on the occasion}} of an hostile air raid: [...] For conspicuous gallantry. While on patrol at night he encountered an enemy <b>aeroplane</b> at a <b>height</b> of 8,700 feet. He at once attacked the enemy, firing two burst of twenty rounds each, which put the enemy's right engine out of action. Closing to range of twenty-five yards he fired a further three bursts of twenty-five rounds each, and as a result the enemy machine caught fire and fell in flames to the ground. Captain Brand showed great courage and skill in manoeuvering his machine during the encounter, and when the enemy aeroplane burst into flames he was so close that the flames enveloped his machine, scorching his face. This officer has shown great determination and perseverance during the past nine months when on anti-aeroplane patrols at night, and his example of unassuming gallantry and skill has raised his squadron to a very high state of efficiency.|$|R
