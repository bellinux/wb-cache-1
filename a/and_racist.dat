5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign <b>and</b> <b>racist</b> attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that the}} Second World War was fuelled {{by the need}} to disarm oppressive <b>and</b> <b>racist</b> regimes, is it fair that the BNP has hijacked Churchill as its own?

5|$|Despite segregationist <b>and</b> <b>racist</b> attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as}} a haven during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the German Army invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. The LSSAH and Das Reich were {{attached}} to separate army Panzer corps. Fritz Klingenberg, a company commander in the Das Reich, led his men across Yugoslavia to the capital, Belgrade, where a small group in the vanguard accepted the surrender of the city on 13 April. A few days later Yugoslavia surrendered. SS police units immediately began taking hostages and carrying out reprisals, a practice that became common. In some cases, {{they were joined by}} the Wehrmacht. Similar to Poland, the war policies of the Nazis in the Balkans resulted in brutal occupation <b>and</b> <b>racist</b> mass murder. Serbia became the second country (after Estonia) declared Judenfrei (free of Jews).|$|E
5|$|Poe's {{depiction}} of the African servant Jupiter is often considered stereotypical <b>and</b> <b>racist</b> from a modern perspective. Jupiter is depicted as superstitious and so lacking in intelligence that he cannot tell his left from his right. Poe probably included the character after being inspired by a similar character in Sheppard Lee (1836) by Robert Montgomery Bird, which he had reviewed. Black characters in fiction during this time period were not unusual, but Poe's choice {{to give him a}} speaking role was. Critics and scholars, however, question if Jupiter's accent was authentic or merely comic relief, suggesting it was not similar to accents used by blacks in Charleston but possibly inspired by Gullah.|$|E

50|$|In 1984, McDonald unsuccessfully {{challenged}} Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Charlie Mayer for the party's {{nomination in}} Portage—Neepawa.

When conflict erupted, Owumi was trapped in Mutassim Gaddafi's apartment without food or electricity for several days {{in the midst of}} the violence before crossing the border into Egypt, where he was arrested and detained. After his release, before returning home, he won the league championship with El-Olympi. Following his traumatic experience in Libya, he began competing in the BBL, firstly with the Worcester Wolves, with whom he won a league title, and then the London Lions and Surrey Scorchers.|$|E
5|$|When the Empire of Brazil began aiding Uruguay in its {{struggle}} against Argentina, Rosas declared war in August 1851, starting the Platine War. This short conflict ended with Rosas being defeated and absconding to Britain. His last years were spent in exile {{living as a}} tenant farmer {{until his death in}} 1877. Rosas garnered an enduring public perception among Argentines as a brutal tyrant. Since the 1930s, an authoritarian, anti-Semitic, <b>and</b> <b>racist</b> political movement in Argentina called Revisionism has tried to improve Rosas's reputation and establish a new dictatorship in the model of his regime. In 1989, his remains were repatriated by the government in an attempt to promote national unity, seeking forgiveness for him and especially for the 1970s military dictatorship. Rosas remains a controversial figure in Argentina in the 21st century.|$|E
