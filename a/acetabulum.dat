5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an <b>acetabulum,</b> {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the <b>acetabulum</b> remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the <b>acetabulum</b> (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the <b>acetabulum,</b> the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus {{displays}} {{traits that}} are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most {{of the characteristics of}} dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony <b>acetabulum</b> (where the femur meets the pelvis) that was only partially open. The ilium, the main hip bone, is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the pubis points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a booted shape, like those in avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an hourglass shape as found in Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the <b>acetabulum),</b> and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The lesser trochanter of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter was large and projected backwards. The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} description of Dinocephalosaurus, Li recognized the postorbital {{region and the}} elongated cervical centra as being indicative of {{a close relationship with}} Tanystropheus, which led him to assign it to the Tanystropheidae. However, Rieppel and colleagues subsequently noted characteristics that distinguished Dinocephalosaurus from derived protorosaurs such as Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos; these include the lack of tapering at {{the front end of the}} nasal and an unreduced contribution of the ilium to the <b>acetabulum.</b> This led Rieppel and colleagues to consider Dinocephalosaurus as an indeterminate protorosaur, with its neck elongation been convergent upon that of Tanystropheus. Their phylogenetic tree, based on a dataset derived from the separate analyses of Jalil (1997), David Dilkes (1998), and Michael Benton & Jackie Allen (1997), is reproduced below, at left.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{skeletal}} features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are {{not considered to be}} synapomorphies. For example, as diapsids, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw. Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in Herrerasaurus); and a perforate <b>acetabulum,</b> or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in Saturnalia, for example). Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues, Herrerasaurus has {{at times}} been {{considered}} basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia, although Brinkmann and Sues still considered {{it to be}} inside Dinosauria. They supported this {{on the basis that}} Herrerasaurus has a large pedal digit V, and has a well developed medial wall on the <b>acetabulum.</b> Brinkmann and Sues considered Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae, and that instead they were successively more primitive forms. Also, they considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid, instead representing only the plesiomorphic state that was found in both taxa. This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas, who stated many derived synapomorphies of Herrerasauridae, such as a distinct pubic boot, but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia. Novas defined the family as the least common ancestor of Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus and all its descendants. A differing definition of Herrerasaurus but not Passer domesticus first suggested by Sereno (1998), and more closely follows the original inclusion proposed by Benedetto. Another group, Herrerasauria was named by Galton in 1985, and defined as Herrerasaurus but not Liliensternus or Plateosaurus by Langer (2004), who used the node-based definition for Herrerasauridae.|$|E
5|$|P. xinjiangensis is {{distinguished}} by a prominent jugal 'horn' that is flattened {{on the front}} end, {{as well as some}} features of the teeth. The ilium, one of the three bones of the pelvis, also bears a characteristically long bony process behind the <b>acetabulum</b> (hip socket). An adult femur has a published length of about 16centimetres (6.3in). P. meileyingensis has the shortest snout and neck frill of any species, making the skull nearly circular in profile. The orbit (eye socket) is roughly triangular, and there is a prominent flange on the lower edge of the dentary, a feature also seen in specimens of P. lujiatunensis, and to a lesser degree in P. mongoliensis, P. sattayaraki, and P. sibiricus. The complete type skull, probably adult, is 13.7centimetres (5.5in) long. The dentary of P. sattayaraki has a flange similar to that found in P. mongoliensis, P. sibiricus, P. lujiatunensis and P. meileyingensis, although it is less pronounced than in those species. The material appears to be roughly the same size as P. sinensis. The frontal bone of P. neimongoliensis is distinctly narrow compared to that of other species, resulting in a narrower skull overall. The ischium bone of the pelvis is also longer than the femur, which differs from other species in which these bones are known. The type specimen has a skull length of 13.2centimetres (5.2in) and a femoral length of 13centimetres (5.1in), but is not fully grown. An adult P. neimongoliensis was probably smaller than P. mongoliensis, with a proportionately longer skull and tail. P. ordosensis can be distinguished by numerous features of the jugals, which have very prominent 'horns'. It is also the smallest known species. One adult skull measures only 9.5centimeters (3.75in) in length.|$|E
25|$|The hip {{could have}} major contractions or {{seizures}} from dysplasias. The caput is not deeply and tightly {{held by the}} <b>acetabulum.</b> Instead of being a snug fit, it is a loose fit, or a partial fit. Secondly, the caput or <b>acetabulum</b> are not smooth and round, but are misshapen, causing abnormal wear and tear or friction within the joint as it moves.|$|E
25|$|If {{the joint}} is fully dislocated a false <b>acetabulum</b> often forms (often higher {{up on the}} pelvis) {{opposite}} the dislocated femoral head position.|$|E
25|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{an inherited}} disease in dogs that {{is characterized by}} abnormal development of the <b>acetabulum</b> {{and head of the}} femur. It is more common in large breeds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the normal}} {{anatomy of the}} hip joint, the root (the thigh bone) is {{connected}} to the pelvis at the hip joint. The almost spherical end of the femur head (the caput, or caput ossis femoris) fits into the <b>acetabulum</b> (a concave socket located in the pelvis). The bony surfaces of the femur head and of the <b>acetabulum</b> are covered by cartilage. While bones provide the strength necessary to support body weight, cartilage ensures a smooth fit and a wide range of motion. Normal hip function can be affected by congenital conditions such as dysplasia, discussed in this article, trauma, and by acquired diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|The Lauenstein {{projection}} {{a form of}} {{examination of}} the hip joint emphasizing {{the relationship of the}} femur to the <b>acetabulum.</b> The knee of the affected leg is flexed, and the thigh is drawn up to nearly a right angle. This is also called the frog-leg position.|$|E
25|$|Genasauria is {{commonly}} divided into Neornithischia and Thyreophora. Neornithischia {{is characterized by}} asymmetrical distributions of enamel covering the crowns of the cheek teeth, an open <b>acetabulum,</b> and a laterally protruding ischial peduncle of the ilium. Neornithischia includes ornithopods, pachycephalosaurs, and ceratopsians. Thyreophora is characterized by body armor and includes stegosaurs, ankylosaurs, Scelidosaurus, and Scutellosaurus.|$|E
25|$|The hips {{consist of}} the pelvis, which {{includes}} three major bones: the ilium (top of the hip), ischium (sides of hip), and pubis (front of the hip). These are fused into one (the innominate bone). Innominate bones are evolutionary significant {{in that they}} allow birds to lay eggs. They meet at the <b>acetabulum</b> (hip socket) and articulate with the femur, {{which is the first}} bone of the hind limb.|$|E
25|$|Each side of {{the pelvis}} is formed as cartilage, which ossifies as three main bones which stay {{separate}} through childhood: ilium, ischium, pubis. At birth {{the whole of the}} hip joint (the <b>acetabulum</b> area and the top of the femur) is still made of cartilage (but there may be a small piece of bone in the great trochanter of the femur); this makes it difficult to detect congenital hip dislocation by X-raying.|$|E
25|$|One such {{previously}} suspected complication was coxa magna, {{which is}} an overgrowth of the femoral head and broadening of the femoral neck, accompanied by changes in the <b>acetabulum,</b> which may lead to subluxation of the femur. There was also some controversy about whether continuous high intra-articular pressure in transient synovitis could cause avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease), but further studies did not confirm any link between the two conditions.|$|E
25|$|Coelophysis had narrow hips, forelimbs {{adapted for}} grasping, and narrow feet. Its neck and tail {{were long and}} slender. The pelvis and hindlimbs of C. bauri are also slight {{variations}} on the theropod body plan. It has the open <b>acetabulum</b> and straight ankle hinge that define the Dinosauria. The hindlimb ended in a three-toed foot (pes), with a raised hallux. The tail had an unusual structure within its interlocking prezygapophysis of its vertebrae, which formed a semi-rigid lattice, apparently to stop the tail from moving up and down.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} (Moore or Southern) approach accesses {{the joint}} and capsule through the back, taking piriformis muscle {{and the short}} external rotators of the femur. This approach gives excellent access to the <b>acetabulum</b> and femur and preserves the hip abductors and thus minimizes the risk of abductor dysfunction post operatively. It {{has the advantage of}} becoming a more extensile approach if needed. Critics cite a higher dislocation rate, although repair of the capsule, piriformis and the short external rotators along with use of modern large diameter head balls reduces this risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{acetabular}} cup is {{the component}} which is placed into the <b>acetabulum</b> (hip socket). Cartilage and bone {{are removed from}} the <b>acetabulum</b> and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is {{held in place by}} a metal coating {{on the outside of the}} cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper.|$|E
25|$|Initial hip {{designs were}} made of a {{one-piece}} femoral component and a one-piece acetabular component. Current designs have a femoral stem and separate head piece. Using an independent head allows the surgeon to adjust leg length (some heads seat more or less onto the stem) and to select from various materials from which the head is formed. A modern <b>acetabulum</b> component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials.|$|E
25|$|Hemiarthroplasty is a {{surgical}} procedure which replaces {{one half of}} the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part in its natural (pre-operative) state. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after a subcapital (just below the head) fracture of the neck of the femur (a hip fracture). The procedure is performed by removing the head of the femur and replacing it with a metal or composite prosthesis. The most commonly used prosthesis designs are the Austin Moore prosthesis and the Thompson Prosthesis. More recently a composite of metal and HDPE which forms two interphases (bipolar prosthesis) has also been used. The monopolar prosthesis has not been shown to have any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly and frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level. This is because {{with the passage of time}} the prosthesis tends to loosen or to erode the <b>acetabulum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Features of the {{skeleton}} indicate that Lystrosaurus moved with a semi-sprawling gait. The lower rear {{corner of the}} scapula (shoulder blade) was strongly ossified (built of strong bone), which suggests that movement of the scapula contributed to the stride length of the forelimbs and reduced the sideways flexing of the body. The five sacral vertebrae were massive but not fused {{to each other and}} to the pelvis, making the back more rigid and reducing sideways flexing while the animal was walking. Therapsids with fewer than five sacral vertebrae are thought to have had sprawling limbs, like those of modern lizards. In dinosaurs and mammals, which have erect limbs, the sacral vertebrae are fused {{to each other and to}} the pelvis. A buttress above each <b>acetabulum</b> (hip socket) is thought to have prevented dislocation of the femur (thigh bone) while Lystrosaurus was walking with a semi-sprawling gait. The forelimbs of Lystrosaurus were massive, and Lystrosaurus is thought to have been a powerful burrower.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} inserted on or directly below the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae, {{stretching from the}} anterior superior iliac spine down into the iliotibial tract, presses {{the head of the}} femur into the <b>acetabulum</b> but also flexes, rotates medially, and abducts to hip joint. The piriformis originates on the anterior pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts on the posterior aspect of the tip of the greater trochanter. In a standing posture it is a lateral rotator, but it also assists extending the thigh. The gluteus maximus has its origin between (and around) the iliac crest and the coccyx from where one part radiates into the iliotibial tract and the other stretches down to the gluteal tuberosity under the greater trochanter. The gluteus maximus is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, and it comes into action when climbing stairs or rising from a sitting to standing posture. Furthermore, the part inserted into the fascia latae abducts and the part inserted into the gluteal tuberosity adducts the hip. The two deep glutei muscles, the gluteus medius and minimus, originate on the lateral side of the pelvis. The medius muscle is shaped like a cap. Its anterior fibers act as a medial rotator and flexor; the posterior fibers as a lateral rotator and extensor; and the entire muscle abducts the hip. The minimus has similar functions and both muscles are inserted onto the greater trochanter.|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} epithet <b>acetabulum</b> means [...] "little vinegar cup", {{and was the}} Latin {{word for}} a small vessel used for storing vinegar (see <b>acetabulum).</b> Common names include the [...] "cabbage leaf Helvella", the [...] "vinegar cup", the [...] "ribbed-stalk cup", and the [...] "brown ribbed elfin cup".|$|E
500|$|Helvella <b>acetabulum</b> has {{a deeply}} {{cup-shaped}} fruit body (technically an apothecium) {{that is up}} to [...] in diameter, and [...] deep. The inner spore-bearing surface, the hymenium, is brown, and may be smooth or slightly wavy; the exterior surface is cream-colored, and is covered with minute [...] "hairs". The ribs start from the cream-colored stem and extend almost {{to the edge of}} the fruit body. The stem is typically [...] tall by [...] thick. The odor and taste of this mushroom are not distinctive.|$|E
500|$|Aetosaurs had a [...] "pillar-erect" [...] erect limb posture {{similar to}} that seen in Rauisuchia, a related group of Triassic archosaurs. A pillar-erect limb posture is one where the femur articulates {{vertically}} with the <b>acetabulum</b> of the hip, which is angled downward, so that the leg is positioned beneath the body and acts as a pillar bearing weight. While the limb posture is similar to rauisuchians, the feet resemble those of phytosaurs (crocodile-like semiaquatic crurotarsans) in the retention of primitive characteristics. Although the forelimbs are {{much smaller than the}} hind limbs, all aetosaurs were quadrupeds.|$|E
500|$|The fungus {{was first}} named as Peziza <b>acetabulum</b> by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum. It was given its current name by French mycologist Lucien Quélet in 1874 {{after having been}} placed in various Peziza segregates: Joachim Christian Timm placed it in Octospora (1788), Samuel Frederick Gray in Macroscyphus (1821), and Leopold Fuckel in Acetabula (1870). The trend wouldn't end there. Claude Casimir Gillet placed it in Aleuria in 1879, [...] and Otto Kuntze in his new Paxina (of which it would later be {{designated}} type species) in 1891.|$|E
500|$|Helvella <b>acetabulum</b> is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helvellaceae, order Pezizales. This {{relatively}} large cup-shaped fungus {{is characterized by a}} tan fruit body with prominent branching ribs resembling a cabbage leaf; for this reason it is commonly known as the cabbage leaf Helvella. Other colloquial names include the vinegar cup and the brown ribbed elfin cup. The fruit bodies reaches dimensions of [...] by [...] tall. It is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows in sandy soils, under both coniferous and deciduous trees. Although it may be considered edible, the fungus is not recommended for consumption unless cooked thoroughly, as it contains the toxin gyromitrin.|$|E
500|$|Characteristic {{features}} of the tyrannosauroid pelvis include a [...] notch at the upper {{front end of the}} ilium, a sharply defined vertical ridge on the outside surface of the ilium, extending upwards from the <b>acetabulum</b> (hip socket), and a huge [...] "boot" [...] {{on the end of the}} pubis, more than half as long as the shaft of the pubis itself. These features are found in all known tyrannosauroids, including basal members Guanlong and Dilong. The pubis is not known in Aviatyrannis or Stokesosaurus but both show typical tyrannosauroid characters in the ilium. The hindlimbs of all tyrannosauroids, like most theropods, had four toes, although the first toe (the hallux) did not contact the ground. Tyrannosauroid hindlimbs are longer relative to body size than almost any other theropods, and show proportions characteristic of fast-running animals, including elongated tibiae and metatarsals. These proportions persist even in the largest adult Tyrannosaurus, despite its probable inability to run. The third metatarsal of tyrannosaurids was pinched at the top between the second and fourth, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus. The arctometatarsus was also present in Appalachiosaurus but it is unclear whether it was found in Eotyrannus or Dryptosaurus. This structure was shared by derived ornithomimids, troodontids and caenagnathids, but was not present in basal tyrannosauroids like Dilong, indicating convergent evolution.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to these fragmentary teeth, the Maevarano Formation has also yielded a nearly complete, articulated skeleton of an immature, cat-sized mammal {{that has not yet}} been fully described. It is the most complete mammal known from the Mesozoic of Gondwana. Its skull is damaged, but its unusual dentition is preserved. The incisors (two {{on each side of the}} upper and one on each side of the lower jaw) project forwards and are separated from the three or four cheektooth in each side of the lower and upper jaws by a large diastema (gap). It shows primitive features, such as the presence of epipubic bones (in the pelvis), a septomaxilla (a small bone placed between the premaxilla and the maxilla in the upper jaw), and a deep zygomatic arch (cheekbone). On the other hand, it has derived traits like the presence of a well-developed trochlea on the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone), the absence of a rim at the dorsal (upper) margin of the <b>acetabulum</b> (the opening in the pelvis which receives the head of the femur), a small lesser trochanter of the femur (upper leg bone), reduced contact between the fibula (the smaller of the two lower leg bones) [...] and the calcaneum (heel bone), and the dentition. In a 2000 abstract, Krause identified it as a therian (a member of the group that includes marsupials, placentals, and their closest extinct relatives) more derived than the early Cretaceous Vincelestes of Argentina, but in 2006 he and colleagues instead refused to place it in any existing higher-order mammalian group and claimed that [...] "it represents a major new nontherian clade".|$|E
2500|$|As a {{mechanical}} structure the pelvis may {{be thought of}} as four roughly triangular and twisted rings. Each superior ring is formed by the iliac bone; the anterior side stretches from the <b>acetabulum</b> up to the anterior superior iliac spine; the posterior side reaches {{from the top of the}} <b>acetabulum</b> to the sacroiliac joint; and the third side is formed by the palpable iliac crest. [...] The lower ring, formed by the rami of the pubic and ischial bones, supports the <b>acetabulum</b> and is twisted 80-90 degrees in relation to the superior ring.|$|E
2500|$|DARthroplasty (dorsal {{acetabular}} rim arthroplasty) is {{a technique}} developed by Dr. Barclay Slocum and Theresa Devine Slocum whereby cortico-cancellous bone strips, taken from the iliac crest, are contoured over the femoral head and sutured to the dorsal hip joint capsule and packed with additional cancellous bone graft dorsally to eventually anchor to drill holes in the original dorsal <b>acetabulum.</b> The new [...] "shelf" [...] eventually becomes {{an extension of the}} original <b>acetabulum,</b> thereby providing support and eliminating subluxation of the hip joint. The joint capsule becomes the new joint surface.|$|E
2500|$|The hip joint, an enarthrodial joint, can be {{described}} as a ball and socket joint. The femur connects at the <b>acetabulum</b> of the pelvis and projects laterally before angling medially and inferiorly to form the knee. Although this joint has three degrees of freedom, it is still stable due to the interaction of ligaments and cartilage. The labrum lines the circumference of the <b>acetabulum</b> to provide stability and shock absorption. Articular cartilage covers the concave area of <b>acetabulum,</b> providing more stability and shock absorption. [...] Surrounding the entire joint itself is a capsule secured by the tendon of the psoas muscle and three ligaments. The iliofemoral, or Y, ligament is located anteriorly and serves to prevent hip hyperextension. The pubofemoral ligament is located anteriorly just underneath the iliofemoral ligament and serves primarily to resist abduction, extension, and some external rotation. Finally the ischiofemoral ligament on the posterior side of the capsule resists extension, adduction, and internal rotation. When considering the biomechanics of hip fractures, it is important to examine the mechanical loads the hip experiences during low energy falls.|$|E
2500|$|The tensor fasciae latae arises on the {{anterior}} superior iliac spine and inserts into the iliotibial tract. [...] It presses {{the head of}} the femur into the <b>acetabulum</b> and flexes, medially rotates, and abducts the hip.|$|E
