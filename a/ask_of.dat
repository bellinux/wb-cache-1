25|$|A {{principal}} {{benefit of}} modeling {{is the ability}} to explicitly compare models: Rather than simply returning a value for each component, the modeler can compute confidence intervals on parameters, but, crucially, can drop and add paths and test the effect via statistics such as the AIC. Thus, for instance to test for predicted effects of family or shared environment on behavior, an AE model can be objectively compared to a full ACE model. For example, we can <b>ask</b> <b>of</b> the figure above for height: Can C (shared environment) be dropped without significant loss of fit? Alternatively, confidence intervals can be calculated for each path.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{and their}} {{supporters}} were delighted with such a convincing victory over a side who had recently triumphed over Australia. England, on the other hand, had some serious questions to <b>ask</b> <b>of</b> themselves, and realised that winning back the Ashes {{was by no means}} the ultimate achievement. In fact, the loss of the first test in Multan is considered by many analysts of the game to be a turning point for the fortunes of the England side, one from which they still have not fully come back from to this date. It was a match they should have won, and they assumed they would win. However, Pakistan took advantage of their complacency and basically dominated the series from that point onwards.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} the city of Cholula has 365 churches, either one for {{each day of the}} year or one for each pre-Hispanic temple that used to be there. In reality, there are only thirty seven churches; 159, if all the small chapels {{including}} those on local haciendas and ranches are counted. One legend states that the first chapel to be built in Cholula was in the San Miguelito neighborhood on what is now the outskirts of the city. It was the first structure with a red tile roof, and it was dedicated to the Archangel Michael. It is said to have contained an image of the angel, which contained inside a small demon tied to a post. As people venerated the image of the archangel, they also acknowledged the demon, in case the angel decided not to hear their pleas. This eventually gave the chapel an evil reputation as more came to ask for favors from the demon, favors that one would not <b>ask</b> <b>of</b> a saint or angel. The demon began to be blamed for misfortunes that befell in the area, as, the legend said, when they occurred, the demon image would be found untied. Eventually, the image of the archangel with the demon inside was taken away and eventually disappeared.|$|E

The film was shot entirely using eight sound stages at Pinewood Studios, where, on the Pinewood backlot, {{the bottom half}} exterior of the Palais Garnier was constructed. The top half was implemented {{using a combination of}} computer-generated imagery (CGI) and a scale model created by Cinesite. The surrounding Paris skyline for [...] "All I <b>Ask</b> <b>of</b> You" [...] was entirely composed of matte paintings. Cinesite also created a miniature falling chandelier, since a life-size model was too big for the actual set.|$|E

500|$|The gospel quotation, [...] "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch, so ihr den Vater etwas bitten werdet in meinem Namen, so wird er's euch geben. [...] " [...] (Truly, truly I say to you, {{whatever}} you <b>ask</b> <b>of</b> the Father in My name, so {{will it be}} given to you.), {{is given to the}} bass as the vox Christi, the voice of Jesus. The instruments, strings probably doubled by oboe d'amore, introduce vocal motifs which the voice picks up. The bass sings the text three times, while the instruments continue playing the same motifs. Julian Mincham observes: [...] "The richness of the text, the unobtrusive nature of the melodic ideas and the gently flowing rhythms combine to create an appropriate atmosphere of dignified restraint".|$|E
500|$|The {{cultural}} references {{featured in}} the episode have attracted both criticism and praise. The parody of Next Media Animation has been commended by several reviewers. [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club commented that the episode [...] "features a couple of quite funny sight gags, like the fresco on Moe's ceiling and the delightful Taiwanese dramatization of certain events", but further wrote that the [...] "rest of the jokes and references clang away without being too funny or too insulting, and that {{is probably the best}} that any viewers can <b>ask</b> <b>of</b> The Simpsons in its advanced age." [...] Television Blend's Steve West commented that the episode was the worst of the Animation Domination lineup that week and further elaborated that the cultural references [...] "are always a year behind, and the smart writers who used classic American culture to bring wit to the series have been replaced by those who want to mimic South Park and Family Guy. They fail miserably, and it's gotten so bad that I now no longer care about the relationship between Marge and Homer." ...|$|E
500|$|Presiding {{over the}} trial was Sir William Chapple, a senior and {{respected}} judge in his early sixties. [...] The prosecution was directed by King's Counsel Thomas Place and Richard Crowle (brother of George), and proceedings were recorded by a York resident, Thomas Kyll. [...] Turpin had no defence barrister; {{during this period of}} English history, those accused had no right to legal representation, and their interests were cared for by the presiding judge. [...] Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy, and James Smith, the man who had recognised Turpin's handwriting. [...] Turpin offered {{little in the way of}} questioning his accusers; when asked if he had anything to <b>ask</b> <b>of</b> Creasy, he replied [...] "I cannot say anything, for I have not any witnesses come this day, as I have expected, and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial 'till another day", and when asked about Smith, he claimed not to know him. [...] When questioned himself, Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn-keeper near Heckington. [...] He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer, claiming that it was his mother's maiden name. [...] When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire, he said [...] "Turpin". [...] Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal, and following further proceedings, guilty of stealing the gelding. [...] Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence, that proceedings should be delayed until he could call his witnesses, and that the trial should be held at Essex. [...] Before sentencing him, the judge asked Turpin if he could offer any reason why he should not be sentenced to death; Turpin said: [...] "It is very hard upon me, my Lord, because I was not prepar'd for my Defence." [...] The judge replied: [...] "Why was you not? [...] You knew the Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here." [...] Despite Turpin's pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex, the judge replied: [...] "Whoever told you so were highly to blame; and as your country have found you guilty of a crime worthy of death, it is my office to pronounce sentence against you", sentencing him to death.|$|E
