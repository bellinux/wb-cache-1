5|$|Originally {{the actions}} of this tengu were portrayed as another attempt by demons to throw the world into chaos and war, but as Yoshitsune's renown as a legendary warrior increased, his monstrous teacher came to be {{depicted}} {{in a much more}} sympathetic and honorable light. In {{one of the most famous}} renditions of the story, the Noh play Kurama Tengu, Ushiwaka is the only person from his temple who does not give up an outing in disgust <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strange yamabushi. Sōjōbō thus befriends the boy and teaches him out of sympathy for his plight.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} {{invasion of}} Gibraltar {{was by the}} Moors, Muslim Arabs and Berbers who arrived from North Africa {{at the beginning of}} the eighth century. They used the area as a base from which to launch an invasion of the rest of the Iberian Peninsula which resulted in most of Iberia coming under Moorish rule. The Spanish Reconquista began later in the eighth century. The campaign eventually took 800 years to force the Moors back across the Strait, and did not reach the Bay of Gibraltar until the fourteenth century. It was not until 1309, nearly 600 years after Gibraltar was first settled, that the first siege of Gibraltar was recorded. King Ferdinand I of Castile began a siege of Algeciras on the other side of the bay in July, but his naval blockade was unable to stop supplies being smuggled in small boats from Gibraltar to the besieged city. He sent an army under Alonso Pérez de Guzmán to take Gibraltar. De Guzmán succeeded after a month-long siege, and Gibraltar was settled by the Castilians for the first time. Six years later, the Moors attempted to retake the peninsula in the brief second siege which was abandoned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Castilian relief force. Another Moorish attempt eventually succeeded in the third siege of February–June 1333. A Castilian attempt to retake it in the fourth siege of June–August 1333 failed, as did the fifth siege of 1349–50, in which King Alfonso XI of Castile lost his life in an outbreak of bubonic plague among the besiegers. The Moors of Granada and Fez fell out with each other over Gibraltar in 1411, leading to the Granadans besieging the fortified town in the sixth siege and seizing it from the Marinids of Fez. Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla made a failed attempt to capture Gibraltar in the seventh siege of 1436, during which he perished.|$|E

Sebastian quickly invites Alicia to dinner the {{following}} night at his home, where he will host a few business acquaintances. Devlin and Captain Paul Prescott of the US Secret Service (Louis Calhern) tell Alicia to memorize the names and nationalities of everyone there. At dinner, Alicia notices that a guest becomes agitated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain wine bottle, and is ushered quickly from the room. When the gentlemen are alone {{at the end of the}} dinner, this guest apologizes and tries to go home, but another of the Nazi group insists on driving him (to his death).|$|E

25|$|Moose often show {{aggression}} {{to other}} animals as well; especially predators. Bears are common predators of moose calves and, rarely, adults. Alaskan moose {{have been reported}} to successfully fend off attacks from black bears, brown bears and grizzlies. Moose have been known to stomp attacking wolves, which makes them less preferred as prey to the wolves. Moose are fully capable of killing bears and wolves. A moose of either sex that is confronted by danger may let out a loud roar, more resembling that of a predator than a prey animal. European moose are often more aggressive than North American moose, such as the moose in Sweden, which often become very agitated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> predator. However, like all ungulates known to attack predators, the more aggressive individuals are always darker in color.|$|E

[...] He also cast Barbette in his experimental first film Le Sang d'un Poete (The Blood of a Poet) (1930). Barbette appears in a scene in a theatre box with several extras, dressed in Chanel gowns, who burst into applause <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> card game that ends in suicide. He replaced the Vicomtesse de Noailles, who {{along with her husband}} had originally shot the scene but were appalled upon seeing the finished film, as the card game/suicide had been shot separately.|$|E

500|$|Bradley Stern of MuuMuse {{felt that}} the song was a {{continuation}} to Gaga's own [...] "Starstruck" [...] from The Fame, as {{they had the same}} [...] "squeaky synthesizers and urban flavoring to engage in some self-indulgence". He went on to describe its music and lyrics as [...] "dark" [...] while also calling the song [...] "inimal and moody". Digital Spy's Nick Levine described the singer as [...] "titillating" [...] in the song while singing about [...] "'touching herself' <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 'lavender blonde'". Melinda Newman from the website HitFix felt the song gave a chance to Gaga to explore her singing talents and concluded, [...] "Hypnotic and a fun sing-along, this could be a single." [...] Tony Hardy from Consequence of Sound noted that the song, which had a [...] "promising" [...] title was [...] "not that bad". An editor of Popjustice {{felt that the}} song was not suitable for a single release but noted it was important to [...] "the whole 'Fame Monster' thing". A more mixed review came from a writer of the website musicOMH who felt that the pace of The Fame Monster [...] "slowed slightly" [...] with [...] "So Happy I Could Die". He went on to describe its lyrics as [...] "too contrived" [...] and added that it [...] "lacks the fizz of the earlier tracks". Similarly, Andrew Ryce from Beats per Minute felt that the song was an [...] "unconvincing anthem for hedonism, sounding more like a wistful lament than a party track".|$|E

At that point Allen said she knew that music was something she needed to do either as a lifelong vocation or {{to get it out}} of her system. She played piano to grade 5 standard and achieved Grade 8 in singing. She played violin, guitar and trumpet and was a member of a chamber choir. Her first solo was [...] "In the Bleak Midwinter". She appeared as a lady-in-waiting in the 1998 film Elizabeth, which was co-produced by her mother. She dropped out of school at age fifteen, not wanting to [...] "spend a third of her life preparing to work for the next third of her life, to set herself up with a pension for the next third of her life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{samples of}} Urmuz's prose have been {{traditionally}} seen as his secondary, less relevant, contributions. These are [...] "After the Storm" [...] and the posthumous [...] "A Little Metaphysics and Astronomy". In the former, an unnamed cavalier {{makes his way}} into a grim monastery, his heart moved <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pious hen; the repentant man then finds [...] "ecstasy" [...] in nature, leaping through the trees or releasing captive flies. Agents of the revenue service make efforts to confiscate his tree, but the protagonist is still able to squat {{on one of the}} branches after he gives proof of naturalization, and then—swimming his way through an [...] "infected pond"—shames his adversaries into giving up their claim. Born-again as a cynic, strengthened by his affair with the hen, he heads back to his [...] "native village" [...] to train folks in the [...] "art of midwifery." [...] According to critics, [...] "After the Storm" [...] should be seen as a caricature of minor Romanticism, of conventional fantasy, or of travel literature. Simona Vasilache likens it to [...] "an Odyssey covering some twenty lines", [...] "a misalliance of heroism and pilferage" [...] with echoes from Urmuz's hero Ion Luca Caragiale.|$|E

2500|$|Under {{pressure}} by Austria, Charles Louis agreed on some territorial adjustments that were detrimental to his future inheritance in Parma. By {{the treaty of}} Florence, on 28 Nov 1844, between Charles Louis and the dukes of Tuscany and Modena, {{he had to give}} up his claim to the Duchy of Guastalla and the lands east of the Enza. These territories would be given to Modena receiving in compensation only Lunigiana. The treaty of Florence remained a secret for nearly three years, but once it became known it contributed to Charles Louis growing unpopularity both in Lucca and in Parma. Need for money led the Duke, on the advice of Ward, who became Minister of Finance, to claim tax credits for titles dating back thirty years. All these resulted in general [...] dissatisfaction. A liberal movement began to grow in Lucca where in 1847 there was a series of demonstrations, culminating in July in a full-scale riot. At first Charles Louis tried to assert his authority, but the continuous unrest forced him to take refuge in the Villa of San Martino in Vignale. On 1 September 1847, alarmed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crowd that wanted to submit some reforms, he signed a series of concessions. Three days later, under pressure from many citizens, he returned to Lucca, where he was welcomed triumphantly. However he was unable to cope with the pressure and on 9 September he left for Modena. From there, he issued a decree that converted the Council of State in a Council of Regency. On 4 October he abdicated in favor of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who would in any case have taken the duchy when Charles Louis became Duke of Parma, meanwhile he was to receive a monthly economical compensation. Thomas Ward arranged the premature handover; in a letter Charles told him [...] " [...] I can't describe to you how I feel and what a sacrifice I have made". [...] He left for Saxony while his family went to live in Turin under the protection of King Charles Albert of Sardinia.|$|E
