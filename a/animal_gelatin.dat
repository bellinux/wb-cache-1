HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate immunological effects of CpG coupled to GNP on canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro. ANIMALS: Eight dogs with AD, diagnosed by standard criteria and with a concurrent immediate hypersensitivity to house dust mites were included. Control samples were taken from eight healthy, age-matched control dogs without history or evidence of cutaneous or systemic illness. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy and allergic dogs were incubated with CpG-GNP and the uptake of CpG-GNP was demonstrated using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cell culture supernatant concentrations of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 6 and IL- 10 were measured by Canine Cytokine Milliplex. RESULTS: No significant changes in IFN-γ and IL- 4 were found when comparing PBMCs incubated with CpG and CpG-GNP with the negative controls in atopic and healthy dogs. Interleukin- 6 was not detected in any of the groups. However, a statistically significant increase in IL- 10 concentration was found after 24 h stimulation with CpG-GNP compared with CpG alone both in atopic and healthy dogs.

40|$|Animal-derived {{collagen}} and gelatin {{have been}} extensively {{used in the}} past decades for several pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. However, there is need for collagen-based materials with predictable and tailorable properties. The aim of this thesis is the design and microbial production of gel forming non-hydroxylated collagen-like proteins. Recombinant protein expression and protein engineering are used to develop collagen-like polymers with defined composition, structure, and tunable physical-chemical properties. The possibility of using these proteins as controlled release systems is also explored, as well as the set-up of efficient and scalable production procedures using P. pastorisas a microbial factory. In chapter 2 we describe the genetic design, recombinant production and preliminary characterisation of a new class of ABA triblock copolymers forming thermosensitive gels with highly controllable and predictable properties. Gel formation is obtained by combining proline-rich collagen-inspired (Pro-Gly-Pro) 9 end-blocks (T), which have triple helix-forming ability, with highly hydrophilic random coil blocks (Pn or Rn) defining the distance between the trimer forming end-blocks. We report the secreted production in yeast at several g/l of two such non-hydroxylated ~ 42 kDa triblock copolymers, TP 4 T and TR 4 T. The dynamic elasticity (storage modulus) of the gels from these collagen-inspired triblock copolymers was comparable to <b>animal</b> <b>gelatin</b> with a similar content of triple helices. In favourable contrast to traditional gelatin, the dynamic elasticity of the new material, in which only one single (well-defined) type of cross links is formed, is independent of the thermal history of the gel. The novel hydrogels have a ~ 37 °C melting temperature. However, the thermostability of the hydrogels formed by these polymers can be tailored by changing the number of (Pro-Gly-Pro) repeats. The concept allows to produce custom-made precision gels for biomedical applications. In chapter 3 it was shown that small, but tailored changes in the length of the mid-block of the collagen-inspired triblock copolymers results in significant changes in the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels. We compared 4 different triblock copolymers, differing only in their mid-block size or mid-block amino sequence. The shorter versions, i. e. TP 4 T and TR 4 T, had mid-blocks made of ~ 400 amino acids, and their longer counterparts, i. e. TP 8 T and TR 8 T, ~ 800 amino acids. These results obtained indicate that the elastic properties of the network are not only a function of concentration and temperature but also of polymer length. The experimental results were well described by an analytical model that was based on classical gel theory and accounted for the particular molecular structure of the gels, and the presence of loops and dangling ends. These results suggest that, by controlling the structure of the present type of hydrogel-forming polymers through genetic engineering their physical-chemical properties can be predicted, and tailored in order to match a specific application In chapter 4 we explored the potential of hydrogels from collagen-inspired triblock co-polymers as drug delivery systems. We studied the erosion and protein release kinetics of two of these hydrogel-forming polymers, i. e. TR 4 T and TR 8 T, differing only in their mid-block length (mid-block molecular weights ~ 37 kDa and ~ 73 kDa). By varying polymer length and concentration, the elastic properties of the hydrogels as well as their mesh size, swelling and erosion behaviour can be tuned. We show that the hydrogel networks are highly dense and that the decrease of gel volume is mainly the result of surface erosion, which in turn depends on both temperature and initial polymer concentration. In addition, we show that the release kinetics of an entrapped protein is governed by a combined mechanism of erosion and diffusion. The prevalence of one or the other is strongly dependent on polymer concentration. Most importantly, the encapsulated protein was quantitatively released demonstrating that these hydrogels offer great potential as drug delivery systems. The development of efficient large-scale production processes can be a critical factor in whether or not a relevant pharmaceutical material is available in sufficient amounts to be used for application studies and eventually enter human clinical trials and the marketplace. In chapter 5 we describe the development of a pilot-scale process for the fermentation and purification of five collagen-inspired triblock copolymers (TP 4 T, TR 4 T, TP 8 T, TR 8 T and TP 12 T) with molecular weights ranging from ~ 42 kDa to ~ 114 kDa. P. pastoris strains were grown in a 140 liter bioreactor using a three-phase fermentation process. The fermentation culture reached high cell densities, and all proteins were efficiently expressed and secreted into the fermentation medium at a concentration of ~ 700 - 800 mg/l of cell free broth. The downstream processing principles elaborated previously at lab-scale were successfully adapted to the larger scale and resulted in 80 - 95 % recovery. The purified proteins were intact and showed a similar performance to those obtained using lab-scale procedures. The good productivity and efficient downstream processing (DSP) shown in this study provides a promising perspective towards a potential further scale-up to industrial production of these proteins. In chapter 6 some of the results obtained in the thesis are highlighted and suggestions for further research are given. The contents of this thesis provide a good starting point for future development of this novel class of hydrogel forming collagen-like proteins...|$|E

WetzelFourier {{transform}} infrared microspectroscopy {{was used}} to determine protein secondary structure in hard wheat breeding lines in situ, providing a molecular means to rank endosperm hardness for the selection of wheat cultivars for a specific end-use. Mapping with a single masked spot size diameter of 4. 5 [Mu]m or confocal 5 [Mu]μm on beamlines U 10 B and U 2 B, respectively, produced spectra from the subaleurone layer within each wheat kernel using the high spatial resolution available with synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy. This procedure was used for the first four crop years. A focal plane array instrument was adapted for use for the remaining two crop years with a slight reduction of spatial resolution. Deconvolution and curve fitting were applied to the amide I region of spectra selected from the interstitial protein between the starch granules, and the relative amount of [Alpha]-helix to other protein secondary structures was revealed. Over six crop years, the [Alpha]-helix to [Beta]-sheet ratio of experimental wheat varieties were compared to those of released varieties in 143 mapping experiments. The highest measurable value was 2. 50 while the lowest was 1. 11, a range consistent with hard wheat secondary structure determination found in previous studies (13, 16).

40|$|Healing of a {{critical}} size defect remains still a challenge, because without intervention it ends in a delayed healing or nonunion (Mathon et al., 1998). Treatment with an autologous cancellous bone transplant, the gold standard, often works well, but also possesses many disadvantages (Jäger et al., 2005 a; Rompe et al., 2004). Thus many new bone substitutes, used as scaffolds, are being developed. These scaffolds shall “guide” and thereby promote the bone healing process. The mechanical properties of the scaffold, such as the microstiffness are very important for osteoregeneration {{and have to be}} tailored in an optimal manner {{to address the needs of}} the healing bone (Chatterjee et al., 2010; Engler et al., 2006; Huebsch et al. 2010). This study examined, for the first time, the influence of the microstiffness of the scaffold material on the healing outcome in vivo. The microstiffness affects the resistance a cell feels when it binds to the extracellular matrix. Therefore, two gelatin scaffolds were developed at the Helmholtz Centrum Geesthacht. The mechanical properties of these scaffolds only differ in their microstiffness. Gelatin scaffold 1 had a microstiffness of 100 kPa and Gelatin scaffold 2 had a microstiffness of 1200 kPa. In 24 rats, which were randomized and divided into three groups, a five millimeter defect at the os femoris was created. This defect was stabilized with a unilateral external fixator and was filled in the first group with the softer scaffold (gelatin scaffold group 1), while the second group received the stiffer scaffold (gelatin scaffold group 2), and the third group received a xenograft of cancellous bone (positive control group). Biweekly radiographs and in vivo micro-computer tomography scans were prepared. After six weeks the animals were euthanized, the bones were obtained and evaluated histologically. Radiologic and histological analysis revealed that no animals from the two gelatin scaffold groups showed a bony bridging after six weeks. However, one <b>animal</b> from the <b>gelatin</b> scaffold group 2 shows a cartilaginous bridging and another animal from this group had almost achieved bony consolidation. The remaining <b>animals</b> from both <b>gelatin</b> scaffold groups indicated some signs of delayed healing, such as decreased vascularisation, rounded ends of the callus or prolapsed muscle into the osteotomy gap. Even in the cancellous bone graft group, no animal had a bony bridging of the gap after six week. The cancellous bone graft was clearly visible in the gap and partly already consolidated into the newly formed bony callus. Signs of delayed healing were hardly observed in this group. The quantitative radiologic and histological measurements showed that the gelatin scaffold group 2 had significantly higher bone and cartilage formations in the new formed callus than the gelatin scaffold group 1. Also, the cancellous bone graft group had significantly higher new bone and cartilage callus tissue formation than the gelatin scaffold group 1. However, there were no quantitative differences in the amount of bone or cartilage tissue formation between the gelatin scaffold group 2 and the cancellous bone graft group. That implies that the scaffold with the higher microstiffness not only better supported the bone healing than the scaffold with the lower microstiffness, it even supported a similar degree of healing to that of the cancellous bone graft...|$|R

Yeast extract is made through autolysis (European Association for Specialty Yeast Products 2016), where grown yeast is heated to 45 – 55  °C. During this stage, yeasts proteins are denatured by endogenous digestive enzymes and allowed to mix with the aqueous solution. Finally the solution is purified and converted to a paste or concentrated liquid. Yeast extract is enriched with proteins, amino acids, vitamins (B 1, B 2, B 6, niacin, folic acid, pantothenic acid and biotin) and minerals (potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc) from the original yeast. Peptones are a widely used nitrogen source for microbial media. Most peptones are made by incubating milk or meat with trypsin, pepsin or other proteolytic enzymes, to digest proteins into amino acids, peptides and polypeptides, but sometimes also by cooking milk or meat in acid.

Emulsions prepared with all untreated proteins yielded submicron droplets at concentrations ≤ 1  wt. %, whilst at concentrations > 5  wt. % emulsions prepared with EWP, SPI and RPI yielded micron sized droplets (> 10  μm) due to pressure denaturation of protein from homogenisation. Emulsions produced with sonicated FG, SPI and RPI had the similar droplet sizes as untreated proteins at the same concentrations, whilst sonicated BG, EWP and PPI emulsions at concentrations ≤ 1  wt. % had a smaller droplet size compared to emulsions prepared with their untreated counterparts. This effect was consistent with the observed reduction in the interfacial tension between these untreated and ultrasound treated proteins...|$|R
40|$|Repeated {{intraperitoneal}} injections {{twice daily}} of various proteins into young rats were regularly {{accompanied by an}} increase in the protein content of the urine, significant renal enlargement, and often some degree of renal pallor. The most marked changes were induced by gelatin, followed in order by human albumin and bovine globulin. Rat serum produced similar but less conclusive changes. Similar changes were not produced by equivalent amounts of urea or casein hydrolysate. In sections from the kidneys of <b>animals</b> receiving <b>gelatin,</b> the cells of the convoluted tubules appeared enlarged, and they contained clear "spaces" throughout the cytoplasm. The tubular cells of the animals receiving the other solutions were not obviously altered in size or shape, and the cytoplasmic changes were slight or absent. There was little evidence of increased multiplication of cells or of tubular dilatation in the kidneys of any of the groups. Changes in concentrations of plasma proteins and hemoglobin, and the results of preliminary studies of the injected proteins in urine and renal tissue following the injections, are described and their possible significance discussed. It appears that the renal enlargement, as well as the increase in proteinuria and the tubular alterations which followed the protein injections, might have been caused in part by effects on the kidney of protein molecules per se, perhaps most likely by the effects on the tubular cells of an increased amount of protein filtered through the glomerular membranes, rather than entirely by effects of products of protein digestion and metabolism reaching the kidney through the blood stream. In the majority of animals there was no evidence from the morphological or functional studies, that the prolonged and continuous proteinuria induced by the protein injections resulted in renal damage, unless the renal enlargement, and the cytoplasmic changes which occurred regularly with gelatin, are considered evidence of damage. Renal enlargement and proteinuria promptly regressed after injections were discontinued. Lesions characterized by severe degrees of tubular damage, possibly as a result of tubular plugging, were observed in some of the animals of one group receiving gelatin solution of the usual concentration, and dilatation of renal tubules and glomerular capsules was present in some other gelatin-treated animals autopsied after relatively brief injection periods. A description is also presented of lesions of remarkable character which developed in the kidneys of all the animals of one small group receiving homologous serum obtained from severely anoxic donors. The possible relationship between the renal changes in the protein-injected animals and certain alterations of the kidneys observed in diseases characterized by large amounts of protein in the urine, is considered...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Damage {{control is}} {{valuable}} in hemodynamically unstable trauma patients. To improve the hemostasis of packing, topical hemostatic agents have been suggested. The {{effects of such}} agents are unclear in trauma situations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the hemostatic capacity, and the stability of the hemostatic clot, of four substances with different mode of action in an experimental traumatic bleeding model. METHODS: A standardized heminefrectomy was performed in 180 heparinized and normotensive Sprauge-Dawley rats. Four different substances were studied (separately and in combinations) in a randomized fashion: gelatin (sponge and matrix), bovine thrombin, freeze-dried recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), and microporous polysaccharide hemospheres. Eight treatment groups (15 animals/group) were considered, primary endpoint was hemostasis within 20 minutes of observation. The effective treatment groups were evaluated in a second set in the same experimental model, but with a prolonged observation time after hemostasis (60 minutes) to control the stability of the clot. RESULTS: Those <b>animals</b> treated with <b>gelatin</b> in the comparative study, with and without thrombin or rFVIIa, obtained hemostasis. Thrombin and rFVIIa alone did not have any hemostatic capacity. Only 20 % to 25 % of the animals obtained hemostasis with microporous polysaccharide hemospheres alone or in combination with rFVIIa. In the prolonged observation study, gelatin alone and in combination with thrombin or rFVIIa was studied. On average, 34 % (20 %- 54 %) of the animals rebled with no significant difference between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Gelatin-containing products provided a fast hemostasis in this experimental model. One third of the animals rebled, regardless of whether thrombin or rFVIIa was added. Further studies are demanded to confirm these results clinically...|$|R
