5|$|Bloody Fun Day is {{a puzzle}} Flash game {{developed}} by Urban Squall {{and published by}} Kongregate on March 12, 2009. Players control one {{of a family of}} three grim reapers and are tasked with moving around an island of hexagonal tiles, killing creatures called Cuties in order to replenish their own life force. Cuties come in four colors. Only the red ones restore life; the others charge special <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> give the player more ways to kill further Cuties.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> {{have been}} {{investigated}} include concept formation, sensory skills, and mental representations. Such research has been ongoing since the 1970s.

5|$|In {{addition}} to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, {{as is the}} case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely and use additional battle commands.|$|E

5|$|As of 17 August 2017 (Update 2.7), {{there are}} 34 hero options. The {{developers}} {{of the game}} continually add new heroes, each with different skills but balanced for fair play. For example, a hero may have high damage but poor mobility, or strong melee abilities but no ranged option. Players choose between three <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> upgrade via a common technology tree. There is a set number of heroes that are free to play, with the free to play roster being renewed every week.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Cross {{features}} a diverse cast of 45 party members. Each character is outfitted with an innate Element affinity and three unique special <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> are learned over time. If {{taken to the}} world opposite their own, characters react to their counterparts (if available). Many characters tie in to crucial plot events. Since {{it is impossible to}} obtain all 45 characters in one playthrough, players must replay the game to witness everything. Through use of the New Game+ feature, players can ultimately obtain all characters on one save file.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the five}} band members has a unique {{character}} class, which vary from one another mainly by the special magical attacks, called Anar-chi, that they can use. Anar-chi attacks include Tommy Homicide's ability to summon acid-coated buzzsaws and The Rexecutioner's ability to summon and use a debris-spitting drum kit. Players are able to use new abilities by visiting an in-game tattoo parlor. Tattoos, and the special <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> they unlock, are character-specific. Players can also unlock new abilities, including additional combination attacks, group attacks, {{and the ability to}} use two weapons at once, by leveling up.|$|E
30|$|This {{suggests}} that considering face validity {{is one of}} the crucial responsibilities of test developers. In particular, the <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> test developers claim to measure should correspond to the <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> test users (e.g., teachers, students) believe the test measures. At a minimum, this is a necessary condition for achieving the intended washback on the content of teaching and learning.|$|R

5|$|Infamous Second Son (stylized as inFAMOUS Second Son) is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Sucker Punch Productions {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 4. It is the third installment in the Infamous series. The game was released worldwide on March 21, 2014. Like in previous Infamous games, the player-controlled protagonist possesses superpower <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> players use in combat and when traveling across the city. The story follows protagonist Delsin Rowe fighting the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) in a fictionalized Seattle. Over {{the course of the}} game, Delsin acquires new powers and becomes either good or evil as player choices influence his morality.|$|E
5|$|Reach {{features}} updated {{versions of}} old weapons, plus new weapons fulfilling various combat roles. In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in Reach by reusable and persistent armor <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> remain with a character {{until they are}} replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects them from {{a limited amount of}} damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief period of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E

5|$|Senator Kelly is {{abducted}} by two more of Magneto's minions, Toad and Mystique, and {{is brought to}} their hideout on the uncharted island of Genosha. There, Magneto uses Kelly as a test subject for a machine powered by his magnetic <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> generates a field of radiation, inducing mutation in normal humans. Kelly later escapes {{by taking advantage of}} his newfound mutation. When Rogue uses her power on Wolverine in view of her classmates, she is convinced by Mystique, disguised as classmate Bobby Drake, that Xavier is angry with her and she should leave the school. Xavier uses his mutant-locating machine Cerebro to find Rogue at a train station, and the X-Men go to retrieve her. Meanwhile, Mystique enters Cerebro and sabotages it.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} fast-paced 2D {{platformer}} {{that takes}} place across seven zones, each divided into three acts and a boss fight. It allows one or two players to control any {{two of the five}} characters; each one has different <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> allow players varying access to parts of levels. While the graphics are mainly 2D, the game features some 3D rotation effects. It sold quickly upon release and received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and aesthetics, though they were more divided on the team-up dynamic. The game was later released for the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} access to unlockable <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> can open new paths of exploration, such as {{shrinking}} to access small areas like vents, teleportation which allows the player to reach otherwise unreachable platforms, and farts which trigger an explosion that defeats nearby enemies when combined with a naked flame. Actions committed against enemies outside of battle affects them in combat; the player or opponent who strikes first to trigger a fight will have the first turn in battle. Combat {{takes place in a}} battle area separate from the open game world. Battles use turn-based gameplay and each character takes a turn to attack or defend before yielding to the next character.|$|E
50|$|Rogues {{also have}} a form of teleportation, Shadow step, an <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> makes the rogue appear behind an enemy.|$|R

5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E
5|$|Units have {{a primary}} job which determines the stat boosts they receive when they level {{up and the}} {{attributes}} associated with that class. A unit may also have a secondary job set of abilities, where it can use any abilities of the selected job, but with the stat profile of the primary job. For example, an Assassin with a Sniper secondary job could use abilities from both jobs, but has the stat profile and appearance of an Assassin, its primary job. This may deny the use of some abilities depending on their equipped weapon. In the previous example, any <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> require the possession of a great bow, {{will not be allowed}} for use if the character has a Katana equipped.|$|E
5|$|Clark Kent first {{appears in}} the pilot episode of Smallville as a teen with superhuman <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> he uses to help others. Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole) as an infant, when he crash lands on Earth {{on the day of}} the Smallville meteor shower in 1989. Twelve years later, trying to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father, Clark saves the life of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), the son of billionaire Lionel Luthor (John Glover), and the pair become quick friends. During season one, Clark struggles with the burden of keeping his powers a secret from those close to him. In particular, he is afraid to open up to Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) for fear that she would not accept him if she learned of his supernatural abilities.|$|E

5|$|During battles, {{a weapon}} limit gauge is shown, filling up over time; by waiting to attack until the gauge is filled up, the player {{can use a}} more {{powerful}} attack specific to the currently equipped weapon. The gauge resets to zero whenever the player attacks or gets hit by an attack. The player is able to use various different types of weapons, such as swords, axes and flails, each having a different attack pattern: sword attacks, for example, are mid-ranged swings and stabs, while flail attacks are long-ranged and reach out {{in a straight line}} from the hero. Most weapons {{can also be used to}} affect the environment: the player can cut down trees with axes, for instance. There are also variants of each weapon type with bonus strengths, such as flame variations, which are effective against ice monsters. At various points in the game, the hero is accompanied by non-player characters who help the player defeat enemies. These companions have different <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> the player can use, such as Fuji's healing spell and Watt's shop.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 {{crossover}} event , Black Mask commandeers Oracle's {{computers and}} satellites and engages {{in a fight}} to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.|$|E
5|$|In the Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga {{role-playing}} games, players {{take control}} of the characters Serph, Heat, Argilla, Gale and Cielo, with the characters Sera and Roland becoming playable in Digital Devil Saga 2. These characters are able to transform into a demon form, which is their main form in battle. Characters navigate to-scale environments, fighting enemies in both random encounters and story-focused boss battles. After each battle, experience points are awarded to characters. Character abilities are governed by Mantra Grids, a system where Mantras are bought using the in-game currency Macca, then mastering them using Atma Points gained from defeated enemies. The maximum number of <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> a character can learn is eight. If two or more characters equip a certain ability, they can perform a stronger version of it through a combo. Each character can learn abilities from one of four categories: Physical, Magic, Shield and Auto.|$|E
