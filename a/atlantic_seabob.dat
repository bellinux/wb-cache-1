40|$|A {{combination}} of stomach content analyses and dual stable isotope analyses {{was used to}} reveal the trophic ecology of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>seabob</b> shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri {{off the coast of}} Suriname. This coastal penaeid shrimp species has a rather omnivorous diet, feeding opportunistically on both animal prey and primary food sources. The species is a predator of hyperbenthic crustaceans, including copepods, amphipods and the luciferid shrimp Lucifer faxoni, which are mainly preyed upon during daytime, when these prey typically reside near the seabed. Benthic microalgae (BM) from intertidal mudflats and offshore sedimentary organic matter (SOM) were important primary food sources. Due to their depleted 13 C values, coastal sedimentary and suspended organic matter, and carbon from riverine and mangrove-derived detritus were not incorporated by X. kroyeri. An ontogenetic diet shift was observed from postlavae to juveniles and adults. Adult X. kroyeri were located higher in the food chain, mainly preying on larger benthic organisms. Intertidal BM were an important food source for all life stages of X. kroyeri, contributing up to 64 % to the overall diet based on a Bayesian mixing model. Because X. kroyeri is the main epibenthic organism found at high densities in nearshore waters up to 30  m depth, the species plays a crucial role in transferring energy from low trophic level prey and primary food sources up to higher levels in the food chain. Our results indicate that primary production on intertidal mudflats, through BM, forms an important energy source for the subtidal turbid-water food web in muddy tropical coasts. Conservation of intertidal areas and their associated mangrove systems will therefore likely benefit coastal shrimp production and fisheries in tropical ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the spatio-temporal patterns of the epibenthic community in the coastal waters of Suriname. Data were collected on a (bi) monthly basis in 2012 – 2013 at 15 locations in the shallow (coastal assemblage was discerned within the muddy, turbid-water zone (6 – 20 m depth), dominated by <b>Atlantic</b> <b>seabob</b> shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri (Crustacea: Penaeoidea). Near the 30 m isobath, sediments were much coarser (median grain size on average 345 ± 103 µm vs. 128 ± 53 µm in the coastal assemblage) and water transparency was much higher (on average 7. 6 ± 3. 5 m vs. 2. 4 ± 2. 1 m in the coastal assemblage). In this zone, a diverse offshore assemblage was found, characterized by brittle stars (mainly Ophioderma brevispina and Ophiolepis elegans) {{and a variety of}} crabs, sea stars and hermit crabs. In between both zones, a transition assemblage was noted, with epibenthic species typically found in either the coastal or offshore assemblages, but mainly characterized by the absence of X. kroyeri. Although the epibenthic community was primarily structured in an on-offshore gradient related to depth, sediment grain size and sediment total organic carbon content, a longitudinal (west-east) gradient was apparent as well. The zones {{in the eastern part of}} the Suriname coastal shelf seemed to be more widely stretched along the on-offshore gradient. Although clear seasonal differences were noted in the environmental characteristics (e. g. dry vs. rainy season), this was not reflected in the epibenthic community structure. X. kroyeri reached very high densities (up to 1383 ind 1000 m - ²) in the shallow coastal waters of Suriname. As X. kroyeri is increasingly exploited throughout its range, the current study provides the ecological context for its presence and abundance, which is crucial for an ecosystem approach and the sustainable management of this commercially important species and its habitat...|$|E
40|$|Tropical shrimp {{trawling}} fisheries {{are generally}} known {{to capture a}} large amount of unwanted organisms along with the targeted shrimp. To reduce this by-catch, the fishery for <b>Atlantic</b> <b>seabob</b> shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri in Suriname uses nets fitted Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and By-catch Reduction Devices (BRDs). It is unclear, however, to what extend these selectivity measures, designed to reduce capture of marine turtles and small roundfish respectively, are reducing by-catch of rays. Due to their life-history characteristics, rays (Batoidea; Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii) are generally vulnerable to overexploitation and several endangered species are known to occur in Surinamese waters. The objective of this study therefore is to assess the effect of the selectivity devices currently in place (TEDs and BRDs) on ray by-catch in the X. kroyeri trawling fishery. Hereto, sixty-five simultaneous catch-comparison hauls were conducted, comparing ray by-catch in trawls fitted with (test-net) and without (control-net) TEDs and BRDs. Five different ray species occurred in the by-catch, Gymnura micrura and Dasyatis guttata being the dominant species. Overall, catch rate of rays was reduced by 36 % in the test-net. Moreover, rays that did end up in the test-net codend were on average 21 % smaller than those in the control-net. This confirms the presumption that rays escape through TEDs rather than BRDs, smaller individuals being able to pass through the TED, but larger ones being guided to the escape opening {{at the bottom of the}} net. TEDs were most efficient in excluding Dasyatis geijskesi, the largest ray species. By-catch of D. guttata was reduced as well, but exclusion was highly dependent on size. A similar, but less pronounced relationship between size and exclusion rate was observed for G. micrura. Nevertheless, large individuals of both species were relatively rare, the bulk of the ray by-catch being made up by small sized (G. micrura and D. guttata, complemented with Urotrygon microphthalmum, a small-sized species. Although TEDs and BRDs seem efficient in reducing by-catch of large rays, they seem inappropriate to protect small-sized individuals, which are more abundant in the population. We therefore suggest that further by-catch related efforts in this fishery are concentrated on reducing the incidental capture of small-sized rays...|$|E

The shrimp {{species of}} economic value that inhabit t he coastal zone of Fortaleza county, CearÃ State, Brazil belong to family Penaei dae and genera Penaeus, namely the redspotted shrimp, P. brasiliensis, the brown shrimp, P. subtilis {{and the white}} shrimp, P. schmitti; iphopenaeus, namely the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>seabob</b> shrimp, X. kroyeri; and Trachypenaeus, namely the roughneck shrimp, T. constrictus. The fishing operations are performed on a sandy substra te, suitable for trawling, 5 - 13 m deep, 30 -km 2 area, by wooden, 7 - 12 m in overall length fishing b oats. The fishing gear is a single-hauling, 14 m long otter t rawl, 18 mm meshes. The working hypothesis of this dissertation was to evaluate whe ther {{the life cycle of}} the species in the studied area conformed to the known pattern for penaeid shrimp, namely larval and juvenile development in estuaries, recru itmnt occurs in the coastal zone and reproduction in offshore areas. The data collection was performed through direct sampling of the catch in 44 fishing trips in period July, 1997 to June, 1998, for measurement of the caught individualsâ ca rapace length, sex determination and identification of females in spa wning condition. Besides, control of yield/fishing effort and evaluation of t he by-catch as shown by frequency of occurrence and diversity indices was carried out. The main conclusions drawn from data analysis are: (a) the catchable stock is mostly made up of juvenile individuals; (b) females are larger than males in l ength and weight at the expense of a bigger tail size; (c) the sex-ratio is, in general, ignificantly favorable to females, but the reverse is true in some months; (d) spawning of penaeid species takes place in the period February-July; (e) the re cruitment of penaeid species is concentrated in the period September-February; (f) the interspecific relationship, in numbers, was as follows: P. brasiliensis (28. 1 %), P. subtilis (26. 5 %), T. constrictus (22. 2 %), X. kroyeri (12. 5 %) and P. schmitti (10. 7 %); (g) the total annual yield was 28, 881 kg, obtained by a fishing effort of 19, 221 hours, and a CPUE of 1. 40 kg/hour; (h) the annual potential production reache d a value of 5, 638 kg; (i) the peak harvest period occurs in April-August; (j) the working hypothesis was not confirmed, that is, both recruiting juveniles and re productive females are found in the coastal zone; (k) the by-catch/shrimp ratio was estimated at 3. 28 : 1, broken down to 0. 93 : 1 (28. 6 %) for the usable species and 2. 34 : 1 (71. 4 %) for the xvii discarded ones; (l) the by-catch was comprised of 9 8 fish species, out of which fourteen accounted for 90. 4 % of total numbers; (m) the by-catch ecological diversity was determined: specific diversity, Hâ = 2. 610; equitability, E = 0. 568; species richness, D = 8. 353; (n) there was found to exist a decreasing trend, with a geometrical dependence, between species numbers a nd their numerical abundance; (o) fishing management should be enforce d through the following measures: a closed season in March-April...|$|E
