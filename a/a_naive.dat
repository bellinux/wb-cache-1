5|$|Jolin, {{as well as}} Dardel, used <b>a</b> <b>naïve</b> {{style in}} their {{paintings}} before this concept had been introduced into the Swedish art world. Both Jolin and Dardel were inspired by French naïvists, not just by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but also by Séraphine Louis who lived in Sentis and Wilhelm Uhde, a specialist in naïve painting. Matisse, Jolin's and Dardel's mentor, {{was no stranger to}} naïve art but it was not prominent in his work. Jolin also appreciated the cultivated and sophisticated, older painting, and was deeply impressed during his visits to the Louvre, where he was inspired by the works of masters such as Rubens, Watteau and Chardin.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot is also {{recognized}} as a bildungsroman, wherein <b>a</b> <b>naive</b> young person matures while learning {{the ways of the}} world. Rastignac is tutored by Vautrin, Madame de Beauséant, Goriot, and others about the truth of Parisian society and the coldly dispassionate and brutally realistic strategies required for social success. As an everyman, he is initially repulsed by the gruesome realities beneath society's gilded surfaces; eventually, however, he embraces them. Setting aside his original goal of mastering the law, he pursues money and women as instruments for social climbing. In some ways this mirrors Balzac's own social education, reflecting the distaste he acquired for the law after studying it for three years.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Karen Green is {{a fictional}} character, {{one of the}} six main {{characters}} who appeared in the American sitcom Friends. Portrayed by actress Jennifer Aniston, the character was created by show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and appeared in each of the show’s 236 episodes during its decade-long run, from its premiere on September 22, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. Introduced in the show's pilot as <b>a</b> <b>naive</b> runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend Monica and relocates to New York City, Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled, inexperienced daddy's girl into a successful businesswoman. During the show's second season, the character becomes romantically involved with her friend Ross, with whom she maintains a complicated on-again, off-again relationship throughout the entire series. Together, the characters have a daughter, Emma.|$|E

José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen's love to the glamorous matador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.|$|E
5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is <b>a</b> <b>naive,</b> timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty much everything. Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E
5|$|The Sicilian Baroque style came to {{fruition}} during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive earthquake in 1693. Previously, the Baroque style {{had been used}} on the island in <b>a</b> <b>naïve</b> and parochial manner, having evolved from hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural engravings that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence {{in their use of}} the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable neoclassicism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Induction of potent {{long lasting}} {{effector}} T cell responses against liver stage malaria antigens strongly correlates with protection from malaria. While Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad 5) based malaria vaccine platforms {{have the ability}} to induce potent effector T cell responses against transgenes, high rates of pre-existing Ad 5 immunity in malaria endemic regions has prompted study of alternative Ad serotype based malaria vaccines as replacements for Ad 5 based malaria vaccines. The research described in this article examines the utility of alternative serotype adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad 4) expressing a sporozoite surface protein (circumsporozoite protein (CSP)) (Ad 4 -CSP) to induce immune responses against CSP. The immunogenicity of Ad 4 -CSP was also tested in homologous and heterologous prime boost vaccinations in both <b>Ad</b> 5 <b>naïve</b> and <b>Ad</b> 5 immune backgrounds as compared to use of Ad 5 -CSP. Results In <b>Ad</b> 5 <b>naïve</b> animals, use of Ad 4 -CSP priming vaccinations followed by boosting with Ad 5 -CSP (Ad 4 -CSP/Ad 5 -CSP) maximally increased the numbers of CSP specific cytokine secreting cytotoxic T cells relative to repeated use of Ad 5 -CSP. The Ad 4 -CSP/Ad 5 -CSP regimen also induced equivalent levels of CSP specific cell killing as did homologous prime-boost vaccinations with Ad 5 -CSP, despite stimulating lower numbers of CSP specific cytotoxic T cells. Priming with Ad 4 -CSP followed by a homologous boost resulted in significantly less CSP specific humoral responses than any other vaccination regimen tested in <b>Ad</b> <b>naïve</b> animals. In <b>Ad</b> 5 immune animals, addition of Ad 4 -CSP in homologous or heterologous prime boost resulted in inductions of higher CSP specific responses than animals repeatedly vaccinated with Ad 5 -CSP alone. However, the observed responses were well below those observed in similarly treated <b>Ad</b> <b>naïve</b> mice. Conclusions While the Ad 4 -CSP/Ad 5 -CSP and Ad 5 -CSP/Ad 5 -CSP vaccination regimens resulted in equivalent CSP specific killing in <b>Ad</b> <b>naïve</b> animals, <b>Ad</b> 4 -CSP/Ad 5 -CSP achieved this result with a lower percentage of CSP specific CD 8 + T cells and a higher number of IFNγ secreting cells, suggesting that the Ad 4 -CSP/Ad 5 -CSP vaccination regimen elicits more efficient cytotoxic T cells. In Ad 5 immune animals use of Ad 4 -CSP improved CSP specific immune responses as compared to repeated use of Ad 5 -CSP, but could not achieve the levels of immunogenicity observed when the same vaccine regimens were used in <b>Ad</b> <b>naïve</b> animals. These data indicate the existence of some level of immunological cross-reactivity between these two adenovirus subgroups. Based on these results, it is suggested that future studies should undertake similarly stringent analyses of alternative Ad serotypes to establish their effectiveness as replacements for Ad 5. </p...|$|R

40|$|Naive Bayes {{is one of}} most {{effective}} classification algorithms. In many applications, however, a ranking of examples are more desirable than just classification.

This paper investigates how to learn <b>a</b> weighted <b>naive</b> Bayes with accurate ranking from data, or more precisely, how to learn the weights of <b>a</b> weighted <b>naive</b> Bayes to produce accurate ranking. We explore various methods: the gain ratio method, the hill climbing method, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, the hill climbing method combined with the gain ratio method, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method combined with the gain ratio method. Our experiments show that <b>a</b> weighted <b>naive</b> Bayes trained to produce accurate ranking outperforms naive Bayes. ...|$|R
