5000|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} this formula is that the overall noise figure of a radio receiver is primarily established by the noise figure of its first <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage.</b> Subsequent stages have a diminishing effect on signal-to-noise ratio. For this reason, the first stage amplifier in a receiver is often called the low-noise amplifier (LNA). The overall receiver noise [...] "factor" [...] is then ...|$|E
25|$|Stability is {{an issue}} in all {{amplifiers}} with feedback, whether that feedback is added intentionally or results unintentionally. It is especially an issue when applied over multiple <b>amplifying</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R
50|$|An astable {{multivibrator}} {{consists of}} two <b>amplifying</b> <b>stages</b> connected in a positive feedback loop by two capacitive-resistive coupling networks. The amplifying elements may be junction or field-effect transistors, vacuum tubes, operational amplifiers, or other types of amplifier. Figure 1, below right, shows bipolar junction transistors.|$|R
50|$|Power for {{the active}} {{components}} may be supplied by batteries, a filtered power supply, {{or through the}} signal feeder itself (phantom power). Antennas containing active impedance translating and optionally <b>amplifying</b> <b>stages</b> are usually used only for receiving, since operation of such stages is unidirectional.|$|R
5000|$|The grid leak {{detector}} was in common {{use in the}} 1920s and 30s in radio receivers. The grid {{leak detector}} stage is a non-linear valve amplifier. The grid bias produced by the grid leak across the biassing grid leak resistor, plus the typically non-linear characteristic of the valves chosen, result in a non-linear rf <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage.</b> The stage performs two, or more often three functions: ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{diode logic}} has the {{advantage}} of simplicity, the lack of an <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage</b> in each gate limits its application. Not all logical functions can be implemented in diode logic alone; only the non-inverting logical AND and logical OR functions can be realized by diode gates. If several diode logic gates are cascaded, the voltage levels at each stage are significantly changed, so one-stage is normally used. In special designs two-stage applications are sometimes achieved.|$|E
50|$|A sample-based synthesizer's {{ability to}} {{reproduce}} the nuances of natural instruments is determined primarily by its library of sampled sounds. In the earlier days of sample-based synthesis, computer memory was expensive and samples had to be as short and as few as possible. This was achieved by looping {{a part of the}} sample (often a single wave), and then using a volume envelope curve to make the sound fade away. An <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage</b> would translate key velocity into gain so that harder playing would translate into louder playback. In some cases key velocity also modulates the attack time of the instrument, leading to a faster attack for loud passages.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, the hybrid form of jazz-rock fusion was {{developed}} by combining jazz improvisation with rock rhythms, electric instruments and the highly <b>amplified</b> <b>stage</b> sound of rock musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa. Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters, odd time signatures, syncopation, complex chords, and harmonies.|$|R
50|$|Carmen's stage {{performances}} featured Amaral and Angela Allen {{dancing on}} a specially <b>amplified</b> <b>stage</b> floor, {{so that their}} flamenco zapateado became an integral percussive addition to the music. Spanish influences in their sound included acoustic guitar interludes in flamenco style, occasional Spanish lyrics, themes of betrayed love reminiscent of Federico Garcia Lorca, and castanets, all supported by a traditional rock rhythm section.|$|R
50|$|Decreased {{impedance}} {{is implemented}} by an inverting amplifier having some moderate gain, usually 10 < Av < 1000. It may be observed as an undesired Miller effect in common-emitter, common-source and common-cathode <b>amplifying</b> <b>stages</b> where {{effective input capacitance}} is increased. Frequency compensation for general purpose operational amplifiers and transistor Miller integrator are examples of useful usage of the Miller effect.|$|R
50|$|In the {{specifications}} of operational amplifiers, the PSRR {{is defined as}} the ratio of the change in supply voltage to the equivalent (differential) output voltage it produces, often expressed in decibels. An ideal op-amp would have infinite PSRR. The output voltage will depend on the feedback circuit, as is the case of regular input offset voltages. But testing is not confined to DC (zero frequency); often an operational amplifier will also have its PSRR given at various frequencies (in which case the ratio is one of RMS amplitudes of sinewaves present at a power supply compared with the output, with gain taken into account). Unwanted oscillation, including motorboating, can occur when an <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage</b> is too sensitive to signals fed via the power supply from a later power amplifier stage.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} {{electronic}} oscillation, motorboating occurs {{when some of}} the output energy from an amplifying device like a transistor or vacuum tube gets coupled back into the input circuit of the device (or possibly into an earlier stage of the amplifier circuit) with the proper phase for positive feedback. This indicates there is an unwanted feedback path through the circuit from output to input of an <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage.</b> The technical conditions for oscillation, given by the Barkhausen stability criterion, are that the total gain around the feedback loop (comprising the amplifying device and the feedback path) at the oscillation frequency must be one (0 dB), and that the phase shift must be a multiple of 360° (2π radians). Since most amplifying devices, transistors and tubes, are inverting, with the output signal 180° opposite in phase from the input, the feedback path must contribute the other 180° of shift.|$|E
30|$|Signals {{from both}} {{photodiode}}s were amplified by a current-to-voltage <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage.</b> The {{output of the}} current-to-voltage gain stage of photodiode 2 was subtracted from that of photodiode 1, and a low-pass filtering stage was applied to yield a current output. The output signal was then calibrated to translate measured voltage to radioactivity concentration.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, {{an ideal}} voltage source cannot be {{connected}} to an ideal short circuit (R = 0), since this would result a similar paradox of finite non-zero voltage across an element with defined zero voltage (the short circuit). Also, a voltage source should not {{be connected to}} another voltage source if their voltages differ but again this arrangement is frequently used (e.g., in common base and differential <b>amplifying</b> <b>stages).</b>|$|R
5000|$|An ideal {{current source}} cannot be {{connected}} to an ideal open circuit because this would create the paradox of running a constant, non-zero current (from the current source) through an element with a defined zero current (the open circuit). Also, a current source should not {{be connected to}} another current source if their currents differ but this arrangement is frequently used (e.g., in <b>amplifying</b> <b>stages</b> with dynamic load, CMOS circuits, etc.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{elementary}} <b>amplifying</b> <b>stages</b> are inverting, two stages can be connected in succession (as a cascade) {{to form the}} needed non-inverting amplifier. In this configuration, each amplifier may be considered as an active inverting feedback network for the other inverting amplifier. Thus the two stages are connected in a non-inverting loop although the circuit diagram is usually drawn as a symmetric cross-coupled pair (both the [...] are initially introduced in the Eccles-Jordan patent).|$|R
40|$|A {{two stage}} position-sensitive gas {{proportional}} counter has been constructed by tightly coupling a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) with a Micro-Groove Detector (MGD).

40|$|This work adds a {{quantitative}} description of distortion to the structured design method of negative-feedback amplifiers. It constitutes a power-series {{representation of the}} feedback amplifier, which may include dynamic (memory) effects, where the design parameters appear explicitly. These results have been incorporated into the systematic design method. It now includes design steps for calculating the required number of amplifying stages, and the optimal bias current allocation. The power-series representation of negative-feedback amplifiers models several properties of active devices. The effects of collector-base current tracking (current drive), high-level injection of BJTs, {{and the presence of}} base resistance influences on the nonlinear distortion performance are described. Furthermore, mobility reduction, and channel length modulation of FETs are modeled. Moreover, the power-series representation also allows the mismatch of balanced stages to be considered. This power-series representation explicitly states the conditions for achieving the desired nonlinear distortion performance of negative-feedback amplifiers. One of the main findings is that the current/voltage gain of an <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage</b> is more important than its intrinsic nonlinearity in this regard. The intrinsic nonlinearity of an <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage</b> is represented by nonlinearity coefficients. The coefficients are, in general, of the same order of magnitude for all technologies and configurations. Therefore, the ability of amplifying stages to contribute to the loop gain is more important. What is more, in contrast to common belief, applying local feedback does not improve the nonlinear distortion performance of negative-feedback amplifiers. The linearity loss can be slight, assuming that local feedback is applied to the <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage</b> that dominates the linearity performance. The least harmful place for local feedback is, therefore, often the output stage...|$|E

50|$|The Flamingo Club was {{a nightclub}} in Soho, London, between 1952 and 1967. It was located at 33-37 Wardour Street from 1957 onwards and played an {{important}} role in the development of British rhythm and blues and jazz. During the 1960s, the Flamingo was one of the first clubs to employ fully <b>amplified</b> <b>stage</b> sound and used sound systems provided by ska musicians from the Caribbean. The club had a wide social appeal and was a favourite haunt for musicians, including the Beatles.|$|R
50|$|The 2016 edition {{expanded}} {{the ideas of}} the first year, adding even more bands and reconfiguring the grounds. A small forest stage and a second <b>amplified</b> <b>stage</b> were added atop the hill, while the downhill area changes included retiring the children's stage. Gone were the sweltering uphill art/music domes of the first year, replaced by an air-conditioned headphones dome. The Thursday night campground performances were replaced by a ticketed show in downtown Eau Claire by Phil Cook and the Guitarheels, who would also play the festival itself.|$|R

40|$|Audio signal preamplifiers (preamps) {{represent}} the low-level {{end of the}} dynamic range of practical audio circuits using modern IC devices. In general, amplifying stages with input signal levels of 10 mV or less fall into the preamp category. This section discusses some basic types of audio preamps, which are: ■ Microphone — including preamps for dynamic, electret and phantom powered microphones, using transformer input circuits, operating from dual and single supplies. ■ Phonograph — including preamps for moving magnet and moving coil phono cartridges in various topologies, with detailed response analysis and discussion. In general, when working signals drop {{to a level of}} ≈ 1 mV, the input noise generated by the first system <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage</b> becomes critical for wide dynamic range and good signal-to-noise ratio. For example, if internally generated noise of an input stage is 1 µV and the input signal voltage 1 mV, the best signal-to-noise ratio possible is just 60 dB. In a given application, both the input voltage level and impedance of a source are usually fixed. Thus, for best signal-to-noise ratio, the input noise generated by the first <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage</b> must be minimized when operated from the intended source. This facto...|$|E
40|$|Measuring fast current pulses {{requires}} devices {{with ample}} broad bands. The approach {{of this paper}} is to present a simple sensor based on the Faraday’s Law together with an integrating and <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage.</b> Its validation is done by means of the detection of Partial Discharges (PD) in electric insulation systems following the guidelines given in the standard IEC 60270. These measurements are also taken with a high frequency current transformer with the aim of comparing the results obtained with the proposed probe...|$|E

With the new design, time jitter is reduced {{for the first time}} to a value which approaches that due to noise in the input <b>amplifying</b> <b>stage.</b> Additionally, with fiber-optic transmission of the output signal, crosstalk between units has been eliminated. The measured values are in good agreement with circuit noise calculations and approximately ten times lower than that for ZCD's presently installed in the JPL test facility. Crosstalk between adjacent units was reduced even more than the jitter...|$|E

For that purpose different topologies of CMOS <b>amplifying</b> <b>stages</b> are presented and circuits for testing their basic small signal parameters and characteristics are discussed. Generalized tabular and graphical results from practical measurements are shown. They can be used in research and education on microelectronic circuits...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} with classic <b>amplifying</b> <b>stages</b> that are biased {{from the side}} of the base (and so they are highly β-dependent), the differential pair is directly biased {{from the side of}} the emitters by sinking/injecting the total quiescent current. The series negative feedback (the emitter degeneration) makes the transistors act as voltage stabilizers; it forces them to adjust their VBE voltages (base currents) to pass the quiescent current through their collector-emitter junctions. So, due to the negative feedback, the quiescent current depends only slightly on the transistor's β.|$|R

Aiming at the the design of low-distortion amplifiers, a simple model for a differential pair is derived using the Volterra series. The parameters in this model correspond to the well-known small-signal parameters, furthermore the effect of the non-ideal tail-current source is made explicit in the model. The model gives insight in the way distortion is generated in a differential pair and it therefore allows the establishment of some simple design rules. Although being derived from a very simple model, the expressions give a good accordance with simulations...|$|R
