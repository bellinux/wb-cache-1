40|$|A {{theory of}} action {{must come to}} terms with both the details of {{language}} use {{and the way in which}} the social, cultural, material and sequential structure of the environment where action occurs figure into its organization. In this paper it will be suggested that a primordial site for the analysis of human language, cognition, and action consists of a situation in which multiple participants are attempting to carry out courses of <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>concert</b> with each other through talk while attending to both the larger activities that their current actions are ambedded within, and relevant phenomena in their surround. Using as data video recordings of young girls playing hopscotch and archaeologists classifying color, it will be argued that human action is built throught the simultaneous deployment of a range of quite different kinds of semiotic resources. Talk itself contains multiple sign systems with alternative properties. Strips of talk gain their power as social action via their placement within larger sequential structures, encompassing activities, and participation frameworks constituted through displays of mutual orientation made by the actors' bodies. The body is used in a quite different way to perform gesture, again a class of phenomena that encompasses structurally different types of sign systems. Both talk and gesture can index, construe or treat as irrelevant, entities in the participants' surround. Moreover, material structure in the surround, such as graphic fields of various types, can provide semiotic structure without which the constitution of particular kinds of action being invoked through talk would be impossible.

40|$|The endocrine-metabolic {{hallmarks}} of {{polycystic ovary syndrome}} are hyperinsulinism, hyperandrogenism, dyslipidemia, and anovulation. We hypothesized that dyslipidemia and anovulation in nonobese women with polycystic ovary syndrome are essentially secondary to the concerted effects of hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the efficacy of anti-androgen (flutamide) or insulin-sensitizing (metformin) monotherapy to that of combined therapy in normalizing the endocrine-metabolic and anovulatory status of nonobese, young women with hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism. Thirty-one young women (mean age, 18. 7 yr; body mass index, 21. 9 kg/m(2); hirsutism score, 16; monthly ovulation rate monitored by weekly serum progesterone, 10 %) {{were randomly assigned to}} receive once daily flutamide (250 mg; n = 10), metformin (1275 mg; n = 8), or combined flutamide- metformin therapy (n = 13) for 9 months. At baseline, there were no endocrine-metabolic differences among treatment groups. Compared with monotherapy, combined flutamide-metformin therapy resulted in greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, in testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and triglyceride levels, and in low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio (all P < 0. 005). Monthly ovulation rates increased after 9 months to 75 and 92 %, respectively, with metformin alone or with combined therapy, but were unimproved with flutamide alone. All treatments were well tolerated. In conclusion, combined anti-androgen and insulin-sensitizing treatment in young, nonobese women with hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism had additive benefits on insulin sensitivity, hyperandrogenemia, and dyslipidemia.

40|$|Prompt {{killing of}} many strains of Escherichia coli during {{phagocytosis}} in vitro by isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) requires {{the presence of}} nonlethal doses of nonimmune serum (B. A. Mannion, J. Weiss, and P. Elsbach, J. Clin. Invest. 86 : 631 - 641, 1990). Because this requirement is bypassed in a phospholipase A (PLA) -rich mutant (pldA) of E. coli, we have examined the effect of serum on bacteria] phospholipid (PL) degradation during phagocytosis of wild-type (pldA+) and PLA-deficient (pldA) E. coli. In parallel with increased killing, nonlethal doses of serum increased the degradation of prelabeled bacterial PL during phagocytosis by two- to fivefold, to nearly the same levels (ca. 50 to 60 %) as those produced during phagocytosis of E. coli pldA {{in the absence of}} serum. The effects on the E. coli pldA mutant imply that there is a serum-mediated enhancement of granule-associated group II PMN PLA 2 activity. At the same doses, serum promoted action against E. coli in the presence of purified rabbit and human group II PLA 2 but did not activate bacterial PLA. Related PLA 2 s that lack specific structural determinants needed for optimal activity against E. coli treated with the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) of PMN are also less active than wild-type group II PLA 2 against serum-treated E. coli. Treatment of E. coli with C 7 - or C 9 -depleted serum did not enhance bacterial killing or PL degradation during phagocytosis or the action of purified PLA 2. In summary, these findings suggest that (i) nonlethal assemblies of the membrane attack complex promote intracellular killing and destruction of E. coli ingested by PMN, in part by promoting the action of granule-associated PLA 2 against ingested bacteria, and (ii) structural determinants first implicated in PLA 2 action against BPI-treated E. coli are also important in PLA 2 <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>concert</b> with other host defense systems, such as complement...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{intracellular}} microelectrodes and {{injection of}} biocytin {{were used to}} study the actions of IL- 1 β and IL- 6 on electrical and synaptic behavior in morphologically identified guinea pig small intestinal submucous neurons. Exposure to nanomolar concentrations of either IL- 1 β or IL- 6 stimulated neuronal excitability. The excitatory action consisted of depolarization of the membrane potential, decreased membrane conductance, and increased discharge of action potentials. Excitatory action of IL- 1 β was suppressed by the natural IL- 1 β human receptor antagonist. Electrical stimulation of sympathetic postganglionic axons evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), and stimulation of cholinergic axons evoked nicotinic fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Both kinds of synaptic potentials occurred in neurons with uniaxonal morphology believed to be secretomotor neurons. Either IL- 1 β or IL- 6 suppressed the noradrenergic IPSPs and the fast EPSPs, and the two acted synergistically when applied in combination. Suppression of the IPSP resulted from presynaptic inhibition of the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves.

There is no legal mandate or management mechanism requiring a comprehensive review of the potential cumulative impacts of these development activities throughout the Salish Sea and across the international border. This project identifies ongoing and proposed energy-related development projects that will increase marine vessel traffic in the Salish Sea and evaluates the threats each project poses to natural resources important to the Coast Salish. While recognizing that Coast Salish traditions identify all species as important and connected, we used expert elicitation to identify 50 species upon which we could evaluate impact. These species were chosen because Coast Salish depend upon them heavily for harvest revenue or as a staple food source, they were particularly culturally or spiritually significant, or they were historically part of Coast Salish lifeways. We identified six development projects, each of which had three potential impacts (pressures) associated with increased marine vessel traffic: oil spill, vessel noise and vessel strike. Projects varied in their potential for localized impacts (pressures) including shoreline development, harbor oil spill, pipeline spill, coal dust accumulation and nearshore LNG explosion. Based on available published data, impact for each pressure/species interaction was rated as likely, possible or unlikely. Impacts are likely to occur in 23 to 28 % of the possible pressure/species scenarios and are possible in another 15 to 28 % additional pressure/species interactions. While it is not clear which impacts will be additive, synergistic, or potentially antagonistic, studies that manipulate multiple stressors in marine ecosystems suggest that threats associated with these six projects are likely to have an overall additive or even synergistic interaction and therefore impact species of major cultural importance to the Coast Salish, an important concept that would be lost by merely evaluating each project independently. Failure to address multiple impacts will affect the Coast Salish and the 7 million other people that also depend on this ecosystem. These findings show the value of evaluating multiple threats, and ultimately conducting risk assessments at the scale of ecosystems and highlight the serious need for managers of multinational ecosystems to actively collaborate on evaluating threats, assessing risk, and managing resources...|$|R

In the chimera, [n/c]CC, the amino-terminal amino acids Met- 1 to Asp- 162 of the SERCA (isoform 1) (SERCA 1) ATPase were replaced with the corresponding portion (Met- 1 -Asp- 200) of the Na+,K(+) -ATPase alpha 1 subunit. In the chimera CC[c/n], the carboxyl-terminal amino acids (Ser- 830 to COOH) of the SERCA 1 ATPase were replaced with the corresponding segment (Leu- 861 to COOH) of the Na+,K(+) -ATPase alpha 1 subunit, and in the chimera CNC, the middle part (Gly- 354 -Lys- 712) of the SERCA 1 ATPase was exchanged with the Na+,K(+) -ATPase alpha 1 subunit (Gly- 378 -Lys- 724). None of the chimeric molecules exhibited any detectable ouabain-sensitive Na+,K(+) -ATPase activity, but they did exhibit thapsigargin-sensitive Ca(2 +) -ATPase activity. Therefore, the segments Ile- 163 -Gly- 354 and Lys- 712 -Ser- 830 of the SERCA 1 ATPase are sufficient for Ca 2 + and thapsigargin sensitivity. The SERCA 1 -ATPase activity of [n/c]CC, but not of CCC, CNC, or CC[c/n], was further stimulated by addition of Na+ in the assay medium containing Ca 2 +. This additional stimulation of SERCA 1 -ATPase activity by Na+ was abolished when the amino-terminal region (Met- 1 -Leu- 69) of [n/c]CC was deleted ([delta n/c]CC). In the absence of Na+, the SERCA 1 -ATPase activity of [n/c]CC was inhibited by ouabain, and, {{in the presence of}} Na+, its activity was stimulated by this drug.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2009. Major: Political Science. Advisor: Mary G. Dietz. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 265 pages. This dissertation aims {{to develop a}} theoretical framework for reconceptualizing spontaneous popular action by relating it explicitly to democratic politics. Developing such a framework is necessary to address the inadequacies which emerge from democratic theory literature `s conceptualization of spontaneous popular action {{in terms of an}} unmediated, direct form of collective political act. A conceptualization of this kind is deeply problematic, I argue, because it opens up the way to misleading accounts that assume the immediate unity of different actors who participate in real democratic events. By making this argument, I am not trying to undermine the importance of spontaneous, non-institutional, and extra-parliamentary forms of popular action for democratic politics. On the contrary, I suggest that if we want to fully grasp and evaluate the democratic significance of such instances of popular action, we need an alternative conceptualization that brings to light, rather than erases, the mediatory political and ethical practices that go into the formation of these events. In order to formulate that alternative, I undertake an inquiry that proceeds along two related lines of theorization. First, focusing on the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Antonio Negri and Jürgen Habermas I provide a critical analysis of influential theories of democracy that put popular action at the center of their analyses. In the second "constructive" part of the project, I reinterpret Aristotle's notion of political friendship with a view to construct an alternative way of thinking about democratic politics. Interpreted here as an ongoing activity that involves the collective practices of judging and understanding among different individuals, who deliberate about what is to their interest, choose a course of action, and do what they resolve in common, Aristotle's notion of political friendship makes it possible for us to discern the dynamics of popular action. As such political friendship is a descriptive concept that reveals the mediated and temporal quality of <b>action</b> <b>in</b> <b>concert.</b> It is at the same an ethical concept that embodies the distinctly democratic values of reciprocity and equality, as well as the value of plurality.

Mutation of Ser- 271 to Ala allowed nuclear export of 5 -LO that was blocked by the specific nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin b, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser- 271 serves to interfere with exportin- 1 -mediated nuclear export. Consistent with previous reports that purified 5 -LO can be phosphorylated on Ser- 271 in vitro by MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, the nuclear export of 5 -LO was increased by either treatment with the p 38 inhibitor SB 203, 580 or co-expression of a kinase-deficient p 38 MAPK. Nuclear export of 5 -LO can also be induced by KN- 93, an inhibitor of Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, {{and the effects of}} SB 203, 580 plus KN- 93 are additive.
