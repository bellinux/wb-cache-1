40|$|BACKGROUND: Inappropriate {{prescribing}} is a well-documented {{problem in}} older people. The new screening tools, STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Peoples' Prescriptions) <b>and</b> <b>START</b> (Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment) have been formulated to identify potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and potential errors of omissions (PEOs) in older patients. Consistent, reliable application of STOPP <b>and</b> <b>START</b> {{is essential for}} the screening tools to be used effectively by pharmacists. OBJECTIVE: To determine the interrater reliability among a group of clinical pharmacists in applying the STOPP <b>and</b> <b>START</b> criteria to elderly patients' records. METHODS: Ten pharmacists (5 hospital pharmacists, 5 community pharmacists) were given 20 patient profiles containing details including the patients' age and sex, current medications, current diagnoses, relevant medical histories, biochemical data, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Each pharmacist applied the STOPP <b>and</b> <b>START</b> criteria to each patient record. The PIMs and PEOs identified by each pharmacist were compared with those of 2 academic pharmacists who were highly familiar with the application of STOPP <b>and</b> <b>START.</b> An interrater reliability analysis using the kappa statistic (chance corrected measure of agreement) was performed to determine consistency between pharmacists. RESULTS: The median kappa coefficients for hospital pharmacists and community pharmacists compared with the academic pharmacists for STOPP were 0. 89 and 0. 88, respectively, while those for START were 0. 91 and 0. 90, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Interrater reliability of STOPP <b>and</b> <b>START</b> tools between pharmacists working in different sectors is good. Pharmacists working in both hospitals and in the community can use STOPP <b>and</b> <b>START</b> reliably during their everyday practice to identify PIMs and PEOs in older patients.
