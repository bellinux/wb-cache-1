500|$|The Mega Buster {{is quite}} weak on its own, {{so in order}} to delete viruses more efficiently, the player must access special {{abilities}} called [...] "Battle Chips". These are minor programs that contain data that the Navi can utilize to perform more powerful attacks, summon other Navis for help, or execute supportive actions such as restoring HP or destroying tiles on the enemies' side of the battlefield. Battle Chips are uploaded to MegaMan.EXE by Lan's PET in a process called [...] "Customization." [...] Each turn in battle presents the player with five random chips from which to choose, though the player is limited to chips of the same variety or chips with the same <b>alphabetic</b> <b>code.</b> Once the [...] "Battle Gauge" [...] (or [...] "Custom Gauge") {{at the top of the}} screen fills during battle, another random set of chips can be chosen from a general pool called the [...] "folder". At any given time, the player may only have exactly 30 chips in the folder from which the Customization process may draw. The player is only allowed to carry up to ten of the same kind of chip and up to five Navi-summon chips in the folder. However, a player may possess any number of other chips in inactive reserve, called the [...] "sack", which may be moved to the active folder outside of battle. Every chip and enemy is aligned to one of five elements: Neutral, Fire, Water, Electric, and Wood. If MegaMan.EXE hits an enemy with an attack aligned to an element they are weak against, the attack will do double damage.|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, Congress {{asked the}} U.S. Department of Education (ED) {{to compile a}} list of {{available}} programs on beginning reading instruction, evaluating each {{in terms of the}} effectiveness of its phonics component. As part of this requirement, the ED asked Dr. Marilyn J. Adams to produce a report on the role of phonics instruction in beginning reading, which resulted in her 1994 book Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning about Print. In the book, Adams asserted that existing scientific research supported that phonics is an effective method for teaching students to read at the word level. Adams argued strongly that the phonics and the whole language advocates are both right, and that phonics is an effective way to teach students the <b>alphabetic</b> <b>code,</b> building their skills in decoding unknown words. By learning the <b>alphabetic</b> <b>code</b> early, she argued, students can quickly free up mental energy they had used for word analysis and devote this mental effort to meaning, leading to stronger comprehension earlier in elementary school. Thus, she concluded, phonics instruction is a necessary component of reading instruction, but not sufficient by itself to teach children to read. This result matched the overall goal of whole language instruction and supported the use of phonics for a particular subset of reading skills, especially in the earliest stages of reading instruction. Yet the argument about how to teach reading, eventually known as [...] "the Great Debate," [...] continued unabated.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a subset}} of the much older International Code of Signals (INTERCO), which {{originally}} included visual signals by flags or flashing light, sound signals by whistle, siren, foghorn, or bell, as well as one, two, or three letter codes for many phrases. The same <b>alphabetic</b> <b>code</b> words are used by all agencies, but each agency chooses one of two different sets of numeric code words. NATO uses the regular English numeric words (Zero, One, with some alternative pronunciations), whereas the IMO provides for compound numeric words (Nadazero, Unaone, Bissotwo...). In practice these are used very rarely, as they frequently result in confusion between speakers of different languages.|$|E

40|$|Click on the link below {{to access}} the article (may not be free). A means of {{presenting}} information temporally has been developed from the basic research on reading. Temporal displays allowed for faster processing speeds by {{reducing the number of}} saccades normally required to process spatially distributed information; however, a potential disadvantage to using temporal displays was an increased rate of error. Payne and Lang reported that a tradeoff between speed and accuracy is sometimes the result of using temporally distributed displays. As they used an <b>alphabetic</b> <b>coding</b> scheme which may not have facilitated the most optimal stimulus-response mapping, the current experiment tested the effects of a directional coding scheme on a temporally distributed display with 24 subjects. Analysis indicated the coding scheme did improve processing speed on the temporal display, but the error rate for the temporal display was higher than with the <b>alphabetic</b> <b>coding</b> scheme. Therefore, the limitation of temporal displays in a tradeoff between speed and accuracy persisted using the directional coding scheme. peer reviewe...|$|R
