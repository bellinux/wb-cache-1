5|$|Descendants of Wyatt Earp's cousins {{assert that}} Earp carried the pistol {{featured}} in the auction and while in Tombstone, although the grips, barrel, and cylinder have been replaced. Only the frame is original, and its serial number has been filed off.

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the campaign, about 600 men from the regiment– including <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> reinforcements that arrived in early October– carried out mainly defensive duties before leaving with the last Australian troops to be evacuated from the peninsula on 20 December. They did not take part in any large-scale battles, but were involved in fighting off a number of sharp attacks. The exact number of casualties suffered is not known, but 18 men from the regiment are known to have been killed in this time.|$|E

5|$|Hubbard {{was posted}} to the Office of the Cable Censor in New York City after {{returning}} to the US {{at the end of}} March 1942. As the office had recently ceased to be an organ of Naval Intelligence, his status was amended to Deck Officer. He was also promoted (as part of <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> other officers of the same grade) on June 15, 1942 to lieutenant, senior grade, the highest rank he was to hold during his active service.|$|E
5|$|Nick Sheppard, {{formerly}} of the Bristol-based band the Cortinas, and Vince White were recruited as the Clash's new guitarists. Howard continued as the drummer. The reconstituted band played its first shows in January 1984 with <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> new material and launched into the self-financed Out of Control Tour, travelling widely over the winter and into early summer. At a striking miners' benefit show ("Scargill's Christmas Party") in December 1984, they announced that a new album would be released early in the new year.|$|E
5|$|Production of the Heinkel {{continued}} {{after the}} war as the Spanish-built CASA 2.111. Spain received <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> He 111H-16s in 1943 along with an agreement to licence-build Spanish versions. Its airframe was produced in Spain under licence by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA. The design differed significantly in powerplant only, eventually being equipped with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. The Heinkel's descendant continued in service until 1973.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts {{have adopted}} a range of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> 10 were {{produced}} and five were built from existing H-6s. The machines {{were joined by}} a center wing formed by two sections 6.15m (20ft) in length. The powerplants were five Junkers Jumo 211F engines producing 1,000kW (1,340hp) each. The total fuel capacity was 8,570L (2,260US gal). This was increased by adding of four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks. The He111Z could tow a Gotha Go 242 glider or Me 321 for up to 10 hours at cruising speed. It could also remain airborne if the three central powerplants failed. The He 111Z-2 and Z-3 were also planned as heavy bombers carrying 1,800kg (3,970lb) of bombs and having a range of 4,000km (2,500mi). The ETC installations allowed for a further four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks to be installed.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1943, {{following}} {{the capture of}} southern Italy, Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans. NDH military command was aware of this danger {{and was trying to}} persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters to the ZNDH. However, instead of Bf 109s, the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the first of <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Beneš-Mráz Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of hostilities, the battalion's personnel were returned to Australia in small drafts, as the 2/1st undertook garrison duties in the Balikpapan area. The longer-serving men were repatriated and discharged early, while volunteers were transferred to other units that were being raised {{as part of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force that would be deployed to Japan. In November, <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> men were transferred to the 21st Brigade for occupation duties in the Celebes as the Australian forces began preparing to hand over the territories to Dutch authorities. By December, the battalion consisted of less than fifty personnel, {{and at the end of}} the month this cadre embarked upon the transport Kings Point Victory to make the journey back to Australia. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 26 January 1946.|$|E
5|$|In August 1941, No. 450 Squadron {{personnel}} were separated from No. 260 Squadron, when the latter received its own ground crew. No. 450 Squadron moved to Rayak airfield, Lebanon, {{where it was}} allocated Hurricanes and Miles Magister trainers. <b>A</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> 20 trainee Australian, British and Canadian pilots—the majority being Australian—were posted to the squadron in early October, and it began duties as an Operational Training Unit. A fortnight later these pilots were posted out and, lacking trained pilots, the squadron's aircraft were re-allocated. On 20 October, the squadron moved to Burg El Arab, Egypt, and began operating as an advanced repair, salvage and service unit, {{taking part in the}} North African Campaign.|$|E

5|$|No. 37 (Transport) Squadron {{was formed}} on 15July 1943 at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, {{with a staff}} of two {{officers}} and thirteen airmen. Its inaugural commanding officer, Squadron Leader Neville Hemsworth (late of No.34 Squadron), arrived on 21July, and its first aircraft, a single-engined Northrop Delta (also formerly of No.34 Squadron), was delivered on 2August. The squadron was allocated the first of <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> ten twin-engined Lockheed C-60 Lodestar transports on 23August. The Delta was written off following an accident on 30September. By then the squadron's staff numbered 190, including forty-five officers. It was declared operational on 11October 1943, undertaking regular courier flights across Australia to destinations including Perth, Western Australia; Darwin and Alice Springs, Northern Territory; Adelaide, South Australia; Maryborough, Queensland; and Launceston, Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1947, <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> {{troops of}} the Indian Army was {{deployed}} {{in response to the}} invasion by Pakistan on 22 October into the Kashmir Valley, which is a part of India. On 31 October, D Company of 4th Battalion of Kumaon Regiment, under the command of Sharma, was airlifted to Srinagar. During this time, his left hand was in a plaster cast as a result of injuries sustained previously on the hockey field, but he insisted on being with his company in combat and was subsequently given permission to go.|$|E
5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted diesel engines, {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. VAT also tested Südwerke's two-stroke diesel engines {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences for diesel engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on the assembly line. In 1955, VAT bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel engines. These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E

5|$|After VVKJ acceptance, a {{group of}} pilots {{conducted}} 16 mock dogfights between the IK-2 and the Hawker Fury I biplane already in service with the VVKJ, during which the IK-2 displayed overall superiority over the British-built aircraft. At one point, Bajdak declared his continuing doubts about the aircraft, and Dobnikar challenged him to a duel, with Bajdak flying his preferred aircraft, the Fury I. After Dobnikar won the climbing competition and a race to Zemun and back from Belgrade, the final dogfight forced Bajdak to concede that the IK-2 was the better aircraft. On 20 November 1937, the VVKJ submitted a proposal to order <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> 12 IK-2s, which was approved the following month. The production version included some additional improvements, but continued testing resulted in further delays, with the aircraft not entering service for another year. By this time, international consensus had coalesced around {{the superiority of the}} low-wing monoplane, and the IK-2 was already obsolescent {{by the time it was}} delivered to VVKJ fighter units.|$|E
5|$|By late 1961, Hawker {{had been}} able to {{demonstrate}} the validity of its design concept, despite a lack of support from the RAF and little from the Her Majesty's Civil Service. In early 1962, official support emerged {{in the form of the}} Operational Requirements branch of the Ministry of Aviation, which approached the Treasury seeking its sanction of <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> nine production-standard aircraft to be operated by an evaluation unit to be administered by the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with the procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating at Ravenshoe, in Queensland, in {{the early}} months of 1943 the 2/33rd was reorganised as part of the 7th Division's {{conversion}} to the jungle divisional establishment. As a part of this, the battalion's establishment was dropped to just over 800 men and it lost its carrier platoon, receiving in its place a machine gun platoon equipped with four Vickers machine guns. In addition, the anti-aircraft platoon was re-roled as a tank-attack platoon and the transport platoon was reduced to a third, with its complement of 74 vehicles and 14 motorcycles being replaced by 25 jeeps. Following this, an intense period of training was undertaken as the battalion received <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> around 300 reinforcements to replace its losses in New Guinea; by July it was ready to deploy once again and subsequently returned to New Guinea to join the Salamaua–Lae campaign.|$|E
