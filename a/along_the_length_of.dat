5|$|During the Japanese heyday in Middle Road, {{the area}} was synonymous with the Echigoya, a Japanese draper shop.

5|$|The {{conditions}} {{surrounding the}} emplacement of the sulfur {{have caused the}} sulfur to assume various colours, including black, brown-orange, orange, red, yellow, and yellow-orange. These colours vary <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the flows and between various flows, indicating that temperatures varied between one flow and another. Liquid sulfur has different viscosity and rheomorphic properties at different temperatures, and some variation occurred at Lastarria's flows as well.|$|E
5|$|The prehistoric {{breakup of}} the supercontinent Gondwana {{separated}} the Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest.|$|E
5|$|The sinew, {{soaked in}} animal glue, is then laid in layers {{on the back}} of the bow; the strands of sinew are {{oriented}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the bow. The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E

5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the Tumbu fly.

It is almost impossible when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E

5|$|East of Massena, NY3 {{followed}} {{a series of}} local roads that parallel the modern divided highway section of NY37 to Rooseveltown, at which point it rejoined current NY37. The highway remained on today's NY37 up to CR51 northwest of Malone, where NY3 continued south on CR51 to modern US11 (then NY2) west of the village. After briefly overlapping NY2 (current US11) into Malone, NY3 turned south onto what is now NY30, following the route to Paul Smiths. Past Paul Smiths, NY3 continued east <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> modern NY86 to Jay, overlapping then-NY10 from Harrietstown to Saranac Lake in between. Lastly, from Jay to Plattsburgh, NY3 overlapped then-NY6 along what is now NY9N and US9.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, after {{receiving}} {{approval from the}} government, the Parks Commission began to expropriate land <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the river. The broadened strip of land was used to construct a new paved parkway, which was opened in segments. The new parkway was ornamental and designed to be aesthetically pleasing, a prime consideration of road construction at that time. The section south of the falls was completed first, opening in 1912. It was extended north to the Whirlpool Rapids, incorporating the existing River Road, by 1915. The section between the rapids and Queenston was opened between 1921 and 1923. Finally, the remaining section between Queenston and Niagara-on-the-Lake opened in 1931, completing the present parkway.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts. New and refurbished rolling stock was gradually introduced {{on a number of}} lines with automatic sliding doors <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the carriages instead of manual end gates, reducing boarding times. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded {{to such an extent that}} a large, new headquarters building designed by Charles Holden was constructed at 55 Broadway over St. James's Park station.|$|E

5|$|In the mandible, the {{diastema}} (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is relatively deep. The mental foramen (an {{opening in the}} bone) is located relatively high and before the p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1. The surfaces of the incisor are very flat, but there are small, irregular striations in the enamel <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the tooth.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the MTO {{undertook}} an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway407 became a tolled highway {{and for a time}} it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over C$7 million and several of the unique design features located <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the freeway.|$|E
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since {{the direction of the}} side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel {{in the direction of the}} side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E

5|$|SMS Prinz Heinrich was {{a unique}} German armored cruiser built {{at the turn of}} the 20th century for the Imperial German Navy, named after Kaiser Wilhelm II's younger brother Prince Henry. Prinz Heinrich was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. She was laid down in 1898 and {{completed}} in March 1902, at the cost of 16,588,000 Marks. Prinz Heinrichs design was a modification of the previous armored cruiser, , and traded a smaller main battery for higher speed and more comprehensive armor protection. The ship set a precedent for subsequent German armored cruisers by concentrating her secondary armament amidships, as opposed to Fürst Bismarck, which spread the secondary armament <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the ship.|$|E
