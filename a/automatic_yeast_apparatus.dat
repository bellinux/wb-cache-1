40|$|The {{role of the}} SEC 7 {{gene product}} in yeast intercompartmental protein {{transport}} was examined. A spectrum of N-linked oligosaccharide structures, ranging from core to nearly complete outer chain carbohydrate, was observed on glycoproteins accumulated in secretion-defective sec 7 mutant cells. Terminal alpha 1 - 3 -linked outer chain mannose residues failed {{to be added to}} N-linked glycoproteins in sec 7 cells at the restrictive temperature. These results suggest that outer chain glycosyl modifications do not occur within a single compartment. Additional evidence consistent with subdivision of the <b>yeast</b> Golgi <b>apparatus</b> came from a cell-free glycoprotein transport reaction in which wild-type membranes sustained outer chain carbohydrate growth up to, but not including, addition of alpha 1 - 3 mannose residues. Golgi apparatus compartments may specialize in addition of distinct outer chain determinants.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of yeast cell concentration and viability {{is essential for}} beer-brewing and biofuel production industries. However, the current methods of measuring viability and concentration are relatively bulky, costly, and/or tedius. We have developed an <b>Automatic</b> <b>Yeast</b> Analysis Platform (AYAP) that performs portable, cost-effective, and rapid measurement of these conditions using a lensless microscope based on partially-coherent in-line holography. This microscope weighs 70 g, has dimensions of 4 ï¿½ 4 ï¿½ 12 cm, and communicates with a touch-screen user interface. The user interface utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm to automatically measure concentration and viability of yeast samples stained with methylene blue. AYAP’s measurements agreed well with gold-standard fluorescence-based manual counting measurements, demonstrating AYAP’s dynamic concentration range of 1. 4 ï¿½ 105 to 1. 4 ï¿½ 106 cells/mL. This range of cell densities is ideal for various fermentation-based industries...|$|R

The {{targeting}} {{signals of}} two yeast integral membrane dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs), DPAP B and DPAP A, which {{reside in the}} vacuole and the Golgi apparatus, respectively, were analyzed. No single domain of DPAP B is required for delivery to the vacuolar membrane, because removal or replacement of either the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, or lumenal domain {{did not affect the}} protein's transport to the vacuole. DPAP A was localized by indirect immunofluorescence to non-vacuolar, punctate structures characteristic of the <b>yeast</b> Golgi <b>apparatus.</b> The 118 -amino acid cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is sufficient for retention of the protein in these structures, since replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP B with that of DPAP A resulted in an immunolocalization patter...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring yeast cell {{viability}} and concentration {{is important in}} brewing, baking and biofuel production. However, existing methods of measuring viability and concentration are relatively bulky, tedious and expensive. Here we demonstrate a compact and cost-effective <b>automatic</b> <b>yeast</b> analysis platform (AYAP), which can rapidly measure cell concentration and viability. AYAP is based on digital in-line holography and on-chip microscopy and rapidly images a large field-of-view of 22. 5 mm 2. This lens-free microscope weighs 70 g and utilizes a partially-coherent illumination source and an opto-electronic image sensor chip. A touch-screen user interface based on a tablet-PC is developed to reconstruct the holographic shadows captured by the image sensor chip and use a support vector machine (SVM) model to automatically classify live and dead cells in a yeast sample stained with methylene blue. In order to quantify its accuracy, we varied the viability and concentration of the cells and compared AYAP's performance with a fluorescence exclusion staining based gold-standard using regression analysis. The results agree very well with this gold-standard method and no significant difference was observed between the two methods within a concentration range of 1. 4 × 105 to 1. 4 × 106 cells per mL, providing a dynamic range suitable for various applications. This lensfree computational imaging technology that is coupled with machine learning algorithms would be useful for cost-effective and rapid quantification of {{cell viability}} and density even in field and resource-poor settings...|$|R
40|$|The factor TUF interacts {{specifically}} with RPG or HOMOL 1 sequences, which are present upstream of many genes coding for the <b>yeast</b> translational <b>apparatus.</b> Here we present {{evidence that the}} RPG and HOMOL 1 motifs are variants of a consensus UASrpg (upstream activating sequence) recognized by the same factor. Factor TUF was identified by using two highly selective methods. The DNA-protein complex was isolated by pore-limit electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gradient gels and found to contain a single polypeptide of 150 kDa. In a two-step protein-blotting/nuclease-protection ("footprinting") procedure, the same 150 -kDa polypeptide blotted on nitrocellulose exhibited the same specific DNA-binding properties as TUF factor. A 50 -kDa DNA-binding domain of TUF was isolated by selective proteolysis. This suggests a bipolarization of the TUF protein, with distinct functional domains...|$|R
40|$|A human eIF- 2 -alpha cDNA (encoding alpha-subunit of the {{eukaryotic}} initiation factor- 2) {{was expressed}} {{under the control}} of the galactose-regulated GAL 1, 10 promoter, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in order to study the possible interactions of human eIF- 2 -alpha with the <b>yeast</b> protein synthesis <b>apparatus.</b> Isoelectric focusing coupled with Western-blot analysis demonstrated that the human eIF- 2 -alpha subunit synthesized in yeast under a variety of growth conditions was detected as two bands which co-migrated with the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of rabbit eIF- 2 -alpha, suggesting covalent modification in vivo. Cell fractionation studies further demonstrated that the synthesised human eIF- 2 -alpha protein, though present in the cytoplasm, was largely associated with the yeast ribosomes, but could be removed from these by washing with 0. 3 M KCl. This possible association of the synthesised human subunit into a three-subunit (alpha, beta and gamma) eIF- 2 complex was further examined by partial purification of the yeast eIF- 2 complex and estimation of the molecular mass of this complex. Immunoreactive eIF- 2 -alpha was found in fractions with eIF- 2 activity and the estimated molecular mass (130 kDa) corresponded to that predicted for the eIF- 2 trimer. These analyses suggest that human eIF- 2 -alpha subunit synthesised in yeast can become involved with the <b>yeast</b> protein synthetic <b>apparatus,</b> though whether this is a functional incorporation requires further genetic studies...|$|R
40|$|Chromosomes {{segregate}} at mitosis along microtubules {{attached to}} the kinetochore, an organelle that assembles at the centromere. Despite major advances in defining molecular components of the <b>yeast</b> segregation <b>apparatus,</b> including discrete centromere sequences and proteins of the kinetochore, relatively little is known of corresponding elements in more complex eukaryotes. We show here that human CENP-C, a human autoantigen previously localized to the kinetochore, assembles at centromeres of divergent species, and that the specificity of this targeting is maintained by an inherent destruction mechanism that prevents the accumulation of CENP-C and toxicity of mistargeted CENP-C. The N-terminus of CENP-C is not only required for CENP-C destruction but renders unstable proteins that otherwise possess long half-lives. The conserved targeting of CENP-C is underscored by the discovery of significant homology between regions of CENP-C and Mif 2, a protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae required for the correct segregation of chromosomes. Mutations in the Mif 2 homology domain of CENP-C impair the ability of CENP-C to assemble at the kinetochore. Together, these data indicate that essential elements of the chromosome segregation apparatus are conserved in eukaryotes...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the SEC 63 gene are {{associated}} with defects in protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) {{as well as in}} nuclear protein localization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To identify proteins that might interact and/or function with SEC 63 p, we cloned a high copy suppressor (HSS 1) of the temperature-sensitive lethal phenotype of the sec 63 - 101 mutant. HSS 1 is an allele-specific sec 63 suppressor that encodes an integral ER membrane glycoprotein of 206 amino acids with the N-terminus in the ER lumen and C-terminal region in the cytoplasm. Haploid strains disrupted for HSS 1 are temperature-sensitive for growth and accumulate precursor forms of Kar 2 p and invertase. The HSS 1 null allele is synthetically lethal in combination with mutations affecting ER translocation. We propose that HSS 1 p is important for ER translocation and interacts with previously identified components of the <b>yeast</b> translocation <b>apparatus.</b> HSS 1 is identical to SEC 66, which encodes a glycoprotein complexed with SEC 62 p and SEC 63 p...|$|R
25|$|The {{subcellular}} localization of the Golgi apparatus varies among eukaryotes. In mammals, {{a single}} Golgi apparatus is usually {{located near the}} cell nucleus, close to the centrosome. Tubular connections are responsible for linking the stacks together. Localization and tubular connections of the Golgi apparatus are dependent on microtubules. If microtubules are experimentally depolymerized, then the Golgi apparatus loses connections and becomes individual stacks throughout the cytoplasm. In <b>yeast,</b> multiple Golgi <b>apparatuses</b> are scattered throughout the cytoplasm (as observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In plants, Golgi stacks are not concentrated at the centrosomal region and do not form Golgi ribbons. Organization of the plant Golgi depends on actin cables and not microtubules.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the localization of Kex 1 p, a type I transmembrane carboxypeptidase involved in precursor processing within the yeast secretory pathway. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated the presence of Kex 1 p in a punctate organelle resembling the <b>yeast</b> Golgi <b>apparatus</b> as identified by Kex 2 p and Sec 7 p (Franzusoff, A., K. Redding, J. Crosby, R. S. Fuller, and R. Schekman. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 112 : 27 - 37). Glycosylation studies of Kex 1 p were consistent with a Golgi location, as Kex 1 p was progressively N-glycosylated in an MNN 1 - dependent manner. To address the basis of Kex 1 p targeting to the Golgi apparatus, we examined the cellular location {{of a series of}} carboxy- terminal truncations of the protein. The results indicate that a cytoplasmically exposed carboxy-terminal domain is required for retention of this membrane protein within the Golgi apparatus. Deletions of the retention region or overproduction of wild-type Kex 1 p led to mislocalization of Kex 1 p to the vacuolar membrane. This unexpected finding is discussed in terms of models involving either the vacuole as a default destination for membrane proteins, or by endocytosis to the vacuole following their default localization to the plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae sec 7 mutants exhibit {{pleiotropic}} {{deficiencies in}} the transit of proteins through the Golgi apparatus, and elaborate an array of Golgi apparatus-like cisternae at a restrictive growth temperature (37 degrees C). The SEC 7 gene encodes an essential high- molecular weight protein (227 kD) that is phosphorylated in vivo. In cell lysates, Sec 7 protein (Sec 7 p) is recovered in both sedimentable and soluble fractions. A punctate immunofluorescent pattern of Sec 7 p- associated structures seen in SEC cells coalesces in sec 14 mutant yeast that accumulate exaggerated Golgi cisternae at 37 degrees C. Sec 7 p may function as a peripheral membrane protein that cycles between a soluble, cytosolic pool and a sedimentable, membrane-associated complex for its essential role in vesicular traffic through the Golgi apparatus. The transmembrane Kex 2 protease, which processes precursors of secreted peptides within the yeast secretory pathway, is also localized by indirect immunofluorescence to multiple structures in the yeast cell (Redding, K., and R. Fuller, manuscript submitted for publication). In double-immunofluorescence labeling experiments, significant colocalization of Sec 7 and Kex 2 proteins was found. Colocalization of the two antigens, one implicated in protein transport through the Golgi apparatus {{and the other in}} processing within a late Golgi compartment, supports the conclusion that we have visualized the <b>yeast</b> Golgi <b>apparatus...</b>|$|R
40|$|SEC 15 encodes a 116 -kD {{protein that}} is {{essential}} for vesicular traffic from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface in yeast. Although the sequence predicts a largely hydrophilic protein, a portion (23 %) of Sec 15 p is found {{in association with the}} plasma membrane. The remainder is not associated with a membrane but is found in a 19. 5 S particle which is not dissociated by 0. 5 M NaCl. Sec 15 p may attach directly to the plasma membrane since it is not found on the Golgi apparatus nor on the secretory vesicle precursors to the plasma membrane. Loss of function of most of the late-acting sec gene products does not alter the distribution of Sec 15 p. However, the sec 8 - 9 mutation {{and to a lesser extent}} the sec 10 - 2 mutation result in a shift of Sec 15 p to the plasma membrane, suggesting a role for these gene products in the regulation of the Sec 15 p membrane attachment/detachment processes. Depletion of Sec 15 p by repression of synthesis indicates that the plasma membrane bound pool is the most stable. During the course of these studies we have found that two activities associated with the <b>yeast</b> Golgi <b>apparatus,</b> Kex 2 endopeptidase and GDPase, are in separable subcompartments...|$|R
40|$|Under {{conditions}} of environmental stress, prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes {{such as the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae selectively utilize particular subunits of RNA polymerase II (pol II) to alter transcription to patterns favoring survival. In S. cerevisiae, a complex of two such subunits, RPB 4 and RPB 7, preferentially associates with pol II during stationary phase; of these two subunits, RPB 4 is specifically required for survival under nonoptimal growth conditions. Previously, we have shown that RPB 7 possesses an evolutionarily conserved human homolog, hsRPB 7, which was capable of partially interacting with RPB 4 and the <b>yeast</b> transcriptional <b>apparatus.</b> Using this as a probe in a two-hybrid screen, we have now established that hsRPB 4 is also conserved in higher eukaryotes. In contrast to hsRPB 7, hsRPB 4 has diverged so {{that it no longer}} interacts with yeast RPB 7, although it partially complements rpb 4 − phenotypes in yeast. However, hsRPB 4 associates strongly and specifically with hsRPB 7 when expressed in yeast or in mammalian cells and copurifies with intact pol II. hsRPB 4 expression in humans parallels that of hsRPB 7, supporting the idea that the two proteins may possess associated functions. Structure-function studies of hsRPB 4 -hsRPB 7 are used to establish the interaction interface between the two proteins. This identification completes the set of human homologs for RNA pol II subunits defined in yeast and should provide the basis for subsequent structural and functional characterization of the pol II holoenzyme...|$|R
40|$|The role of clathrin in {{retention}} of Golgi membrane proteins has been investigated. Prior work {{showed that a}} precursor form of the peptide mating pheromone alpha-factor is secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells which lack the clathrin heavy chain gene (CHC 1). This defect can {{be accounted for by}} the observation that the Golgi membrane protein Kex 2 p, which initiates maturation of alpha-factor precursor, is mislocalized to the cell surface of mutant cells. We have examined the localization of two additional Golgi membrane proteins, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A (DPAP A) and guanosine diphosphatase (GDPase) in clathrin-deficient yeast strains. Our findings indicate that DPAP A is aberrantly transported to the cell surface but GDPase is not. In mutant cells carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of CHC 1 (chc 1 -ts), alpha- factor precursor appears in the culture medium within 15 min, and Kex 2 p and DPAP A reach the cell surface within 30 min, after imposing the nonpermissive temperature. In contrast to these immediate effects, a growth defect is apparent only after 2 h at the nonpermissive temperature. Also, sorting of the vacuolar membrane protein, alkaline phosphatase, is not affected in chc 1 -ts cells until 2 h after the temperature shift. A temperature-sensitive mutation which blocks a late stage of the secretory pathway, sec 1, prevents the appearance of mislocalized Kex 2 p at the cell surface of chc 1 -ts cells. We propose that clathrin plays a direct role in the {{retention of}} specific proteins in the <b>yeast</b> Golgi <b>apparatus,</b> thereby preventing their transport to the cell surface...|$|R
40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CRY 1 gene encodes ribosomal protein rp 59, a {{component}} of the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Mutations in CRY 1 can confer resistance to the alkaloid cryptopleurine, an inhibitor of the elongation step of translation. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned CRY 1 gene was determined. The predicted amino acid sequence shows that CRY 1 encodes a 14, 561 -dalton polypeptide that has 88 % amino acid sequence homology to the hamster or human S 14 ribosomal protein responsible for emetine resistance and 45 % homology to Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S 11. Analysis of the DNA sequences upstream from CRY 1 revealed the presence of three sequences, HOMOL 1 (consensus, A/TACATCC/TG/ATA/GCA), RPG (consensus, ACCCA/GTACATT/CT/A), and a thymine-rich sequence, found upstream of more than 20 other cloned yeast genes encoding components of the translational apparatus. We exploited the ability to assay the expression of CRY 1 in vivo by using the cryptopleurine resistance phenotype to demonstrate that these three consensus sequences are necessary for the transcription of CRY 1. We previously showed that the upstream promoter element of the yeast RP 39 A gene consists of these identical sequence motifs. Therefore, we suggest that these three sequences define a consensus promoter element for the genes encoding the <b>yeast</b> translational <b>apparatus.</b> CRY 1 is one of several hundred yeast genes, including ribosomal protein genes, whose expression is transiently decreased 10 -fold upon heat shock.

CES 5 is identical to CET 1, which encodes the RNA triphosphatase component of the <b>yeast</b> capping <b>apparatus.</b> Purified recombinant Cet 1 catalyzes hydrolysis of the γ phosphate of triphosphate-terminated RNA {{at a rate of}} 1 s− 1. Cet 1 is a monomer in solution; it binds with recombinant Ceg 1 in vitro to form a Cet 1 -Ceg 1 heterodimer. The interaction of Cet 1 with Ceg 1 elicits > 10 -fold stimulation of the guanylyltransferase activity of Ceg 1. This stimulation is the result of increased affinity for the GTP substrate. A truncated protein, Cet 1 (201 - 549), has RNA triphosphatase activity, heterodimerizes with and stimulates Ceg 1 in vitro, and suffices when expressed in single copy for cell growth in vivo. The more extensively truncated derivative Cet 1 (246 - 549) also has RNA triphosphatase activity but fails to stimulate Ceg 1 in vitro and is lethal when expressed in single copy in vivo. These data suggest that the Cet 1 -Ceg 1 interaction is essential but do not resolve whether the triphosphatase activity is also necessary. The mammalian capping enzyme Mce 1 (a bifunctional triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase) substitutes for Cet 1 in vivo. A mutation of the triphosphatase active-site cysteine of Mce 1 is lethal. Hence, an RNA triphosphatase activity is essential for eukaryotic cell growth. This work highlights the potential for regulating mRNA cap formation through protein-protein interactions...|$|R

DPAP A was localized by indirect immunofluorescence to non-vacuolar, punctate structures characteristic of the <b>yeast</b> Golgi <b>apparatus.</b> The 118 -amino acid cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is sufficient for retention of the protein in these structures, since replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP B with that of DPAP A resulted in an immunolocalization pattern indistinguishable from that of wild type DPAP A. Overproduction of DPAP A resulted in its mislocalization to the vacuole, because cells expressing high levels of DPAP A exhibited vacuolar as well as Golgi staining. Deletion of 22 residues of the DPAP A cytoplasmic domain resulted in mislocalization of the mutant protein to the vacuole. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention, and removal of the retention signal, or saturation of the retention apparatus by overproducing DPAP A, resulted in transport to the vacuole. Like wild type DPAP B, the delivery of mutant membrane proteins to the vacuole was unaffected in the secretory vesicle-blocked sec 1 mutant; thus, transport to the vacuole was not via the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis. These data are consistent with a model in which membrane proteins are delivered to the vacuole along a default pathway. PHS 38006 /PH/PHPPO CDC HHS/United States 1527174 PMC 228962...|$|R

Multiple copies of ATX 2 {{were found to}} reverse the aerobic auxotrophies of sod 1 (delta) mutants for lysine and methionine and also to enhance the resistance of these yeast strains to paraquat and atmospheric levels of oxygen. ATX 2 encodes a novel 34. 4 -kDa polypeptide {{with a number of}} potential membrane-spanning domains. Our studies indicate that Atx 2 p localizes to the membrane of a vesicular compartment in yeast cells reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus. With indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, Atx 2 p exhibited a punctate pattern of staining typical of the Golgi apparatus, and upon subcellular fractionation, Atx 2 p colocalized with a biochemical marker for the <b>yeast</b> Golgi <b>apparatus.</b> We demonstrate here that this vesicle protein normally functions in the homeostasis of manganese ions and that this role in metal metabolism is necessary for the ATX 1 suppression of SOD 1 deficiency. First, overexpression of ATX 2 caused cells to accumulate increased levels of manganese. Second, a deletion in ATX 2 caused a decrease in the apparent available level of intracellular manganese and caused sod 1 (delta) mutants to become dependent upon exogenous manganese for aerobic growth. Third, ATX 2 was incapable of suppressing oxidative damage in cells depleted of manganese ions or lacking the plasma membrane transporter for manganese. The effect of ATX 2 overexpression on manganese accumulation and oxygen resistance is similar to what we have previously reported for mutations in PMR 1, which encodes a manganese-trafficking protein that also resides in a vesicular compartment. Our studies are consistent with a model in which Atx 2 p and Pmr 1 p work in opposite directions to control manganese homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae becomes thermosensitive due to the inactivation of the mitochondrial DNA helicase gene, PIF 1. A suppressor of this thermosensitive phenotype was isolated from a wild-type plasmid library by transforming a pif 1 null strain to growth on glycerol at the non-permissive temperature. This suppressor is a nuclear gene encoding a 135 amino acid protein that is itself essential for mtDNA replication; cells lacking this gene are totally devoid of mtDNA. We therefore named this gene RIM 1 for replication in mitochondria. The primary structure of he RIM 1 protein is homologous to the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) from Escherichia coli and to the mitochondrial SSB from Xenopus laevis. The mature RIM 1 gene product has been purified from yeast extracts using a DNA unwinding assay dependent upon the DNA helicase activity of SV 40 T-antigen.

Transformation of rad 52 mutant yeast cells with dicentric plasmids gave rearranged plasmids similar to those observed with RAD+ yeast cells, but the transformation frequency was only 5 - 10 % compared to transformation with monocentric plasmids. Also, the ratio of unrearranged dicentric plasmid to deleted plasmids was greatly reduced in the rad 52 -transformed cells. These observations are consistent with a model in which centromeric DNA sequences can interact independently with the <b>yeast</b> cell spindle <b>apparatus.</b> Occasional movement of centromeres to opposite poles may result in mechanical breakage of plasmid sequences.
