5|$|Arbroath has one museum, {{the former}} Bell Rock Lighthouse Signal Tower. In 1807 Arbroath became {{the base of}} {{operations}} for the building of the Bell Rock Lighthouse. The shore station for the lighthouse – the Bell Rock Signal Tower – was completed in 1813 and acted as <b>a</b> <b>lifeline</b> for the keepers offshore. Signal Tower Museum was opened in 1974 as a visitor centre detailing the history of the lighthouse and the town of Arbroath.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Catholic Church's {{refusal to}} countenance {{occasional}} attendance at Protestant services, {{as well as}} the excommunication of Elizabeth by Pope Pius V in 1570, presented the choice to Roman Catholics more starkly. The arrival of the seminary priests, while it was <b>a</b> <b>lifeline</b> to many Roman Catholics, brought further trouble. Elizabeth's ministers took steps to stem the tide: fines for refusal to attend church were raised from 12d. per service to £20 a month, fifty times an artisan's wage; it was now treason to be absolved from schism and reconciled to Rome; the execution of priests began—the first in 1577, four in 1581, eleven in 1582, two in 1583, six in 1584, fifty-three by 1590, and seventy more between 1601 and 1608. It became treasonable for a Roman Catholic priest ordained abroad to enter the country. Because the papacy had called for the deposing of the Queen, the choice for moderate Roman Catholics lay between treason and damnation. The List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation was extensive.|$|E

25|$|Although the Livingstone Falls prevent access {{from the}} sea, {{nearly the entire}} Congo above them is readily navigable in sections, {{especially}} between Kinshasa and Kisangani.

25|$|Under some {{circumstances}} a guide {{line can be}} used as a reference for the divers to find the hole after the dive or in an emergency in a similar way to cave diving or wreck penetration instead of <b>a</b> <b>lifeline.</b> In these cases the divers should be competent in procedures for diving with a guideline.|$|E

25|$|In {{all three}} of these situations, a guide line or {{lifeline}} from the exit to the diver is the standard method of reducing the risk of being unable to find the way out. <b>A</b> <b>lifeline</b> fixed to the diver is more reliable as {{it is not easy to}} lose, and is often used when diving under ice, where the line is unlikely to snag and the distance is reasonably short, and can be tended by a person at the surface. Static guidelines are more suitable when <b>a</b> <b>lifeline</b> is likely to snag on the environment or on other divers in the group, and may be left in situ to be used for other dives, or recovered on the way out by winding back onto the reel. Guide lines may be very much longer than lifelines, and may be branched and marked. They are used as standard practice for cave diving and wreck penetration.|$|E
25|$|On 8 July, the {{day before}} the {{expiration}} of the truce, Egyptian forces under General Muhammad Naguib renewed the war by attacking Negba. The following day, Israeli air forces launched a simultaneous offensive on all three fronts, ranging from Quneitra to Arish and the Egyptian air force bombed the city of Tel Aviv.

25|$|With the {{starving}} party weakening rapidly, {{the situation was}} saved by Pierre St Germain, who alone had the strength and willpower to construct a makeshift, one-man canoe from willow branches and canvas. The other men cheered when, on 4 October 1821, he crossed the river, trailing <b>a</b> <b>lifeline.</b> The rest of the party crossed one at a time. The boat sank lower and lower in the water as they did so, but all crossed safely.|$|E

25|$|As a government-owned railway and {{the only}} {{operator}} of a rail connection to the port of Halifax and the extensive defence establishment there, the ICR became <b>a</b> <b>lifeline</b> for the Canadian and British war effort throughout the First World War, particularly since as the CPR line to Saint John ran through the state of Maine on its eastward route from Montreal, thereby any war shipments on CPR would violate the United States' neutrality.|$|E
25|$|Out of all contestants {{that have}} played the game, few {{have been able to}} win the top prize on any {{international}} version of the show.

Carpenter did not use <b>a</b> <b>lifeline</b> until the final question, using his Phone-a-Friend not for help but to call his father to tell him he had won the million.|$|E
25|$|Deployment of {{a single}} {{tethered}} scuba diver is a reasonably safe alternative to free-swimming buddy team diving.

25|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} Burma, China {{was almost}} completely {{cut off from}} Allied aid and materiel except through the hazardous route of flying cargo aircraft over the Hump. Early on, the Roosevelt administration and the War Department had given priority to other theaters for U.S. combat forces, equipment, and logistical support. With {{the closure of the}} Burma Road and the fall of Burma, it was realized that even replacing Chinese war losses would be extremely difficult. Consequently, the Allies' initial strategy was to keep Chinese resistance to the Japanese going by providing <b>a</b> <b>lifeline</b> of logistical and air support.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the crew}} flew the plane at slow {{cruising}} speeds to nurse the engines, they were eventually overstressed from extended use.

Hooe taped down his trouser cuffs, donned a parachute, and rigged <b>a</b> <b>lifeline</b> to service the engines from the makeshift catwalks, but the inflight lubricating systems only delayed and could not prevent engine wear. Once the cylinders began missing, the Question Mark shortened its loops to remain within gliding distance of Van Nuys.
