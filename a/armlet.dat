5|$|Bronze age {{archaeology}} is to {{be found}} in abundance in the surrounding area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a mile to the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold <b>armlet.</b> Iron Age archaeology is also well represented, for example in the souterrain nearby Warddykes Cemetery and at West Grange of Conan, as well as the better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.|$|E
5|$|Like the Coronation Necklace, these {{earrings}} {{have been}} worn by queens regnant and consort at every coronation since 1901. Made for Queen Victoria in 1858 using the diamonds {{from an old}} Garter badge, they are of typical design: a large brilliant followed by a smaller one, with a large pear-shaped drop. The drops were originally part of the Koh-i-Noor <b>armlet.</b> After they had been made, Victoria wore the earrings and matching necklace in the painting Queen Victoria by the European court painter, Franz Winterhalter.|$|E
5|$|The large <b>armlet</b> of pierced gold (opus interrasile) showed {{traces of}} {{hematite}} {{on the reverse}} side, which {{probably would have been}} used as a type of jeweller's rouge. This is the earliest known and documented use of this technique on Roman jewellery. Gilt items showed the presence of mercury, indicating the mercury gilding technique. The black inlay on the cast silver tigress shows the niello technique, but with silver sulphide rather than lead sulphide. The settings of stones where garnet and amethyst remain, in the body chain, have vacant places presumed to be where pearls were set, and show elemental sulphur as adhesive or filler.|$|E

25|$|In 1818 a canal, {{which was}} dug to drain spring flood waters from Lake Suvanto (now Lake Sukhodolskoye, a 40-km long narrow {{lake in the}} eastern part of the Isthmus) into Lake Ladoga, {{unexpectedly}} eroded and turned into the Taipaleenjoki (now Burnaya River). The Taipaleenjoki started draining Suvanto and decreased its level by 7 m. Originally waters of Lake Suvanto flowed into the Vuoksi River through a waterway at Kiviniemi (now Losevo), but as a result of the change, the waterway dried out. In 1857 the canal was dug there, but the stream reversed direction, revealed rapids and rendered navigation at Kiviniemi impossible. Since 1857 Suvanto and the Taipaleenjoki have constituted the southern <b>armlet</b> of the Vuoksi River, which has decreased the level of the original northern <b>armlet</b> emptying into Ladoga near Kexholm (now Priozersk) by 4 m, isolating it as a separate river basin.|$|E

25|$|If the {{prevailing}} fashion be {{to reject the}} long sleeve, and to partially display the arm, let the glove advance considerably above the elbow, and there be fastened with a draw-string or <b>armlet.</b> But this should only be the case when the arm is muscular, coarse, or scraggy. When it is fair, smooth, and round, it will admit of the glove being pushed down to a little above the wrists.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} old towns of Vyborg and Priozersk, and churches on the Konevets island of Lake Ladoga, since the late 19th century {{a number of other}} archaeological sites have been {{discovered}} on the isthmus. Numerous archaeological remnants of the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Copper Age and Bronze Age occur all over the isthmus. The eastern part of the Karelian Isthmus hosts a number of medieval remnants. There are many grave pits of Karelians of the 10th–15th centuries with metal and ceramic artifacts along the northern <b>armlet</b> of the Vuoksi, near Lake Sukhodolskoye and in a few other places in Priozersky District. On the southern shore of Lake Sukhodolskoye small medieval burial mounds are abundant as well. A lot of large cult stones have been found along these bodies of water, as well as agglomerations of cairns. Remnants of several rural settlements were also discovered there {{as well as on the}} shore of Lake Ladoga. Remnants of the Tiuri (Tiversk) town (10th–15th centuries) were excavated on a former island in the northern Vuoksi <b>armlet</b> near the Tiuri village (now Vasilyevo). A few treasures of silver adornments and medieval Arabian and Western European coins have also been found, as the isthmus laid on the Volga trade route (at that time, the Vuoksi River had a distributary emptying into the Bay of Vyborg).|$|E

25|$|On 28 May 1845, a {{party of}} {{jewellery}} representatives was sent from Birmingham to Buckingham Palace {{with the intention of}} persuading Queen Victoria to wear British made jewellery for the purpose of promoting it, and a meeting took place with the Royal couple. The group gave the Queen and the Prince an <b>armlet,</b> a brooch, a pair of ear-rings, a waist buckle, a watch-chain, a seal and key, together valued at over 400 guineas. All products were manufactured by Thomas Aston of Regent's Place and Mr. Baleny of St Paul's Square. The party claimed that 5,000 families were dependent on the jewellery trades in Birmingham.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 May 1940, {{eight days}} after the {{formation}} of the LDV, it was announced by the War Office that 250,000 field service caps were to be distributed as {{the first part of the}} uniform of the new force and that khaki brassards or [...] "armlets" [...] were being manufactured, each carrying the letters [...] "LDV" [...] in black. In the meantime, LDV units improvised their own brassards with whatever materials were available; local Women's Voluntary Service branches were often asked to produce these, sometimes using old puttees donated by veterans. The British Army used loose-fitting work clothes called [...] "Overalls, Denim" [...] which were made of khaki-coloured cotton twill fabric and consisted of a short jacket or [...] "blouse" [...] and trousers. They were cut to the same style as, and designed to be worn over, the 1938 pattern Battle Dress. It was announced that 90,000 sets of denim overalls would be released from military stores at once and that more would be issued as soon as they could be manufactured. On 25 June, Anthony Eden announced in the House of Commons that LDV uniform was intended [...] "to consist of one suit of overalls of design similar to that of battle dress, a field service cap, and an <b>armlet</b> bearing the letters 'L.D.V.'". On 30 July 1940, Eden further announced that the Home Guard (as the LDV had been renamed) would be issued with military boots as supplies became available.|$|E
