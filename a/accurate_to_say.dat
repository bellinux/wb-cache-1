25|$|It is not however entirely <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Holmer Green {{has never}} been {{represented}} by a Labour MP. Until quite recently, the far south-west corner of Holmer Green around the appropriately-named Wycombe Road was actually a part of Hughenden parish, Wycombe District and therefore Wycombe constituency. This peculiarity had resulted from the village's steady growth towards Hazlemere and across an old Hundred and parish boundary. Between 1945 and 1951, Wycombe and therefore a handful of Holmer Green houses were represented by Labour MP John Edwin Haire.|$|E
25|$|Moore left KPFA and Pacifica Foundation in 1952 but in 1954 {{returned}} to broadcasting, {{this time in}} television as an early staff member of KQED in San Francisco. He became the station's Director of Public Affairs. In 1960 he received a CBS Fellowship for a year's study at Columbia University, during which time he took classes in linguistic philosophy and began his reading of Ludwig Wittgenstein. It would be <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Rexroth and Wittgenstein are the two major influences on Moore's poetry.

In the medium to long-term, more appropriate laws and regulations will probably replace the buy-back scheme.

25|$|Another case {{alluded to}} in the Torcaso v. Watkins footnote, and said by some to have {{established}} secular humanism as a religion under the law, is the 1957 tax case of , 249 F.2d 127 (D.C. Cir. 1957). The Washington Ethical Society functions much like a church, but regards itself as a non-theistic religious institution, honoring the importance of ethical living without mandating a belief in a supernatural origin for ethics. The case involved denial of the Society's application for tax exemption as a religious organization. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the Tax Court's ruling, defined the Society as a religious organization, and granted its tax exemption. The Society terms its practice Ethical Culture. Though Ethical Culture {{is based on a}} humanist philosophy, it is regarded by some as a type of religious humanism. Hence, it would seem most <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that this case affirmed that a religion need not be theistic to qualify as a religion under the law, rather than asserting that it established generic secular humanism as a religion.|$|E

It would have been more <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> have called the two new districts [...] "New Borough North (of) Old Sheen" [...] and [...] "New Borough East (of) Old Sheen, but the impracticalities of such pedantry, whilst befitting an encyclopaedic entry, are obvious when translated to civic government.

50|$|The fall of Alexandria and the {{acquisition}} of the Byzantine Empire's oriental provinces of Egypt and Syria are generally seen as a critical step towards the culmination of uniquely Islamic identity. The importance of Alexandria as the staging point for future conquests and economic purposes should not be dismissed. It is <b>accurate</b> then <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that the loss of}} these provinces {{paved the way for the}} future Muslim conquest of the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa, which included key cities such as Cyrenaica (642), Tripoli (643), and Kairouan (670). Thus the fall of Alexandria accentuated a clearly defined geopolitical shift in influence from the regions of interior Arabia to those of the Mediterranean and in the ensuing centuries, the significance of these conquests would allow Egypt to become the seat of dominant Muslim law.|$|R

500|$|However, Rome's {{social classes}} were {{qualified}} rather than {{created by the}} census. It is perhaps more <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> therefore that the army's structure was slightly refined during this period rather than radically reformed. Prior to these reforms, the infantry was divided into the classis of rich citizens and the infra classem of poorer citizens. The latter {{were excluded from the}} regular line of battle on the basis that their equipment was of poor quality. During the reforms, this crude division of poorer and richer citizens was further stratified. The army thereafter consisted of a number of troop types based upon the social class of propertied citizens, collectively known as adsidui. From the poorest in the [...] "fifth class" [...] to the richest in the [...] "first class" [...] and the equestrians above them, military service was compulsory for all. However, Roman citizens at this time generally viewed military service as a proper undertaking of duty to the state, in contrast to later views of military service as an unwelcome and unpleasant burden. Whereas there are accounts of Romans in the late empire mutilating their own bodies in order to exempt themselves from military service, there seems to have been no such reluctance to serve in the military of early Rome. This may in part be due to the generally lower intensity of conflict in this era; to the fact that men were fighting close to and often in protection of their own homes, or due to—as posited by later Roman writers—a greater martial spirit in antiquity.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} said that {{deregulation}} was an important source of the recent financial crisis. It may be more <b>accurate,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a deregulatory mindset was an important source of the crisis - a mindset that, to a very significant extent, grew out of profound changes in academic thinking about the role of government. As scholars of political economy quietly shifted their focus from market failure to government failure over {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, they set the stage for a revolution in both government and markets, the full ramifications of which are still only beginning to be understood. This intellectual sea-change generated some positive effects, but also some negative ones, including (it seems) an excessively negative impression of the capacity of government to address problems in the marketplace. Today, as we consider the need for new regulation, particularly in the wake of the financial crisis, another fundamental shift in academic thinking about the role of government may be required - involving nothing less than a reversal of the prevailing null hypothesis in the study of political economy. ...|$|R

It would be more <b>accurate,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that governments around the world are letting agriculture down.

But it is no use going about our business as usual while telling poor farmers they must produce more. These farmers are doing as well as they can without better technologies and better policies. And both developing and developed countries must play their part in bringing about these improvements. He insists upon the need for publicly funded agricultural research. Besides the technological tools for producing more agricultural goods, farmers also require sound and supportive public policies. IFPRI 5; 2020; HungerDGONon-PR 4 page...|$|R

Deep principles of symmetry and locality greatly constrain the form of these couplings.

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{attempts to}} {{look again at}} the major concepts of the "new philosophy of science " {{in terms of their}} relevance for educa-tional research. The argument is made that such concepts as underdetermination and incommensurability have limited ap-plicability to many areas of educational research. This {{is due to the fact}} that such terms are based on the existence of genuine theories as found in the natural sciences, and the requirements for such theories cannot be (presently) met in the human sciences. There is also the related problem of ambiguity on how these terms are to be applied exactly to the field of educational research. The analysis fur-ther contends that writers in this area have not dealt with the critical concept of indeterminacy. It is argued that of all the concepts of the new philosophy of science, this term has most promise for de-fining the direction of educational research. From one view, indeter-minacy may suggest even a greater degree of relativism; looked at from another angle, it is seen that indeterminacy is a means of struc-turing and fruitfully debating the purpose of educational research.

However, there are some core outstanding issues in the use of OT for the study of phonological acquisition: 1. Where do the constraints come from? Innateness isn’t a good enough answer, given that many processes in child phonology have no parallel in adult phonology (see esp. Buckley 2003). But we do also see parallels (see esp. Boersma and Levelt 2003). We might say that (some) constraints are constructed (see e. g. Pater 2002), but can we actually provide a more explicit account? 2. How do we handle the gradualness, variation, exceptionality (and regularization) seen in acquisition? None of these is captured by the original version of OT (Prince and Smolensky 1993 / 2004) or by its original learning algorithm (Tesar and Smolensky 2000). 3. The most successful OT account of gradualness and variation in acquisition (Boersma 1997 et seq.) adds numerical values and a stochastic component.
