40|$|Annealing {{was carried}} out at 950 and 1120 degreesC under various As {{pressure}} for undoped (ND) semi-insulating (SI) LECGaAs. The effects of annealing on native defects and electrical properties were investigated. Experimental results indicate that, after an annealing at 950 degreesC for 14 h under low As pressure, the Hall mobility decreases and the resistivity increases dramatically for the samples. These changes in electrical properties are due to the generation of intrinsic <b>acceptor</b> <b>defects,</b> and the generation of the intrinsic <b>acceptor</b> <b>defects</b> originates from the outdiffusion of As interstitial at high temperature. The generation of the intrinsic defects and these changes in electrical properties can be suppressed by increasing the applied As pressure during annealing. The concentration of the main donor defect E 12 (AsGaVGa) can be decreased by about one order of magnitude by an evacuated annealing at 1120 degreesC for 2 - 8 h followed by a fast cooling. The decrease in E 12 concentration can also be suppressed by increasing the As pressure during annealing...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of kesterite Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 thin-film solar cells is currently hindered {{by the large}} deficit of open-circuit voltage (Voc), which results from the easy formation of CuZn antisite <b>acceptor</b> <b>defects.</b> Suppressing the formation of CuZn defects, especially near the absorber/buffer interface, is thus critical for the further improvement of kesterite solar cells. In this paper, it is shown {{that there is a}} large disparity between the defects in Cu- and Ag-based kesterite semiconductors, i. e., the CuZn or CuCd <b>acceptor</b> <b>defects</b> have high concentration and are the dominant defects in Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 or Cu 2 CdSnS 4, but the AgZn acceptor has only a low concentration and the dominant defects are donors in Ag 2 ZnSnS 4. Therefore, the Cu-based kesterites always show p-type conductivity, while the Ag-based kesterites show either intrinsic or weak n-type conductivity. Based on this defect disparity and calculated band alignment, it is proposed that the Voc limit of the kesterite solar cells can be overcome by alloying Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 with Ag 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4, and the composition-graded (Cu,Ag) 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 alloys should be ideal light-absorber materials for achieving higher efficiency kesterite solar cells.

A {{detailed analysis of the}} low temperature conductivity of AgInSe 2 (AIS) and tin incorporated AgInSe 2 (AIS:Sn) suggests domination by variable range hopping, grain boundary effect, and thermal activation of carriers in different temperature regimes. The enhanced conductivity in AIS:Sn is attributed to donor and <b>acceptor</b> <b>defect</b> level formation, which has pushed the Fermi levels to similar to 9 meV below the conduction band edge in n-type films and similar to 3 meV above the valence band edge in p-type films.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} recent {{progress}} in acceptor doping of ZnO {{that has been}} achieved with a focus toward the optimum strategy. There are three main approaches for generating p-type ZnO: substitutional group IA elements on a zinc site, codoping of donors and acceptors, and substitution of group VA elements on an oxygen site. The relevant issues are whether there is sufficient incorporation of the appropriate dopant impurity species, does it reside on the appropriate lattice site, and lastly whether the acceptor ionization energy is sufficiently small to enable significant p-type conduction at room temperature. The potential of nitrogen doping and formation of the appropriate acceptor complexes is highlighted although theoretical calculations predict that nitrogen on an oxygen site is a deep acceptor.

Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD), an allelic condition is generally caused by in-frame deletions within the dystrophin gene, {{resulting in the}} production of an internally deleted but variably functional protein. Antisense-Oligomer (AO) induced-exon skipping has the potential to by-pass protein truncating mutations and restore functional dystrophin expression.

Here we describe exon skipping strategies to rescue dystrophin expression in patient cell lines where more than one exon-skipping strategy may restore the reading frame. A genomic deletion of exon 44 may be addressed by the excision of exons 43 or 45. The resultant dystrophin isoforms may have different functionality.

The influences of incorporation strategies on CIGS absorbers and device performances are also reviewed. By analyzing CIGS surface structure and electronic property variation induced by alkali fluoride (NaF and KF) post-deposition treatment (PDT), we discuss and interpret the following issues: ① The delamination of CIGS thin films induced by Na incorporation facilitates CuInSe 2 formation and inhibits Ga during low-temperature co-evaporation processes. ② The mechanisms of carrier density increase due to defect passivation by Na at grain boundaries and the surface. ③ A thinner buffer layer improves the short-circuit current without open-circuit voltage loss. This is attributed not only to better buffer layer coverage in the early stage of the chemical bath deposition process, but also to higher donor defect (CdCu+) density, which is transferred from the <b>acceptor</b> <b>defect</b> (VCu−) and strengthens the buried homojunction. ④ The KF-PDT-induced lower valence band maximum at the absorber surface reduces the recombination at the absorber/buffer interface, which improves the open-circuit voltage and the fill factor of solar cells...|$|E

40|$|The {{energetic}} {{stability and}} the electronic properties of vacancies (VX) and antisites (XY) in PbSe and PbTe are investigated. PbSe and PbTe are narrow band gap semiconductors {{and have the}} potential to be used in infrared detectors, laser, and diodes. They are also of special interest for thermoelectric devices (TE). The calculations are based in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the General Gradient Approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation term, as implemented in the VASP code. The core and valence electrons are described by the Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) and the Plane Wave (PW) methods, respectively. The defects are studied in the bulk and nanowire (NW) system. Our results show that intrinsec defects (vacancies and antisites) in PbTe have lower formation energies in the NW as compared to the bulk and present a trend in migrate {{to the surface of the}} NW. For the PbSe we obtain similar results when compare the formation energy for the bulk and NW. However, the Pb vacancy and the antisites are more stable in the core of the NW. The intrinsec defects are shallow defects for the bulk system. For both PbSe and PbTe VPb is a shallow <b>acceptor</b> <b>defect</b> and VSe and VT e are shallow donor defects for the PbSe and PbTe, respectively. Similar electronic properties are observed for the antisites. For the Pb in the anion site we obtain an n-type semiconductor for both PbSe and PbTe, SeP b is a p-type for the PbSe, and T eP b is a n-type for PbTe. Due the quantum con¯nement effects present in the NW (the band gap open), these defects have different electronic properties for the NW as compared to the bulk. Now these defects give rise to electronic levels in the band gap of the PbTe NW and the VT e present a metallic character. For the PbSe NW a p-type and a n-type semiconductor is obtained for the VP b and P bSe, respectively. On the other hand, deep electronic levels are present in the band gap for the VSe and SePb.

40|$|Mg is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used p-type dopant for GaN, however the impact of Mg incorporation on structural, morphological and optical properties of GaN is still not fully understood. Another research challenge is to understand and improve the properties of nonpolar GaN as it allows the fabrication of more efficient optoelectronic devices due to the absence of polarization fields. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to explore the effect of Mg doping on polar c-plane GaN in Paper 1 and nonpolar m-plane GaN in Paper 2. The samples were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy with varying Mg content on free-standing GaN substrates. The studies were done by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and low temperature cathodoluminescence (CL) with the aim to correlate the optical and structural data obtained by these techniques. Polar c-plane GaN:Mg layers exhibit such structural defects as stackingfaults (SF) of a small size (5 - 10 nm). The basal plane SF (BSF) density was estimated to be ~ 105 − 106 cm− 1 increasing with Mgconcentrations. Comparison between as-grown and annealed sampleshas not shown significant difference in structural or optical properties. Characteristic broad emission lines observed in CL in the rangeof 3. 29 − 3. 41 eV have been attributed to SF-related emissions byanalogy with nonpolar undoped GaN films grown heteroepitaxially. Acceptor bound exciton (ABE) emission and SF-related peaks havedemonstrated metastability. CL mapping performed on the TEMsamples at the energies corresponding to SF-related peaks has confirmedthat the origin of these lines is associated with Mg-doped GaNlayers. In nonpolar m-plane GaN:Mg layers similar BSFs have been observed. In addition more extended BSFs and prismatic SFs wereidentified at the interface with the GaN substrate. For the m-planesamples with Mg concentration of ~ 1019 cm− 3 a number of fine CLlines have been detected in the region of 3. 3 - 3. 4 eV. Their shape andappearance were unlike the SF-related emissions in the case of c-planeGaN discussed in Paper 1. These peaks {{are not likely to be}} associatedwith donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination as has been proved byestimation of the separated DAP energies and by CL mapping experiment. A tentative explanation is given to these peaks as being relatedto excitons bound to some low symmetry <b>acceptor</b> <b>defect</b> centers...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Physics, Washington State UniversityStrontium {{titanate}} (SrTiO_ 3) is {{a transparent}} conducting oxide {{with a range}} of interesting properties, including a large, temperature-dependent dielectric constant and superconductivity at low temperatures. It has a wide indirect band gap of 3. 2 eV at room temperature. Annealing in a reducing atmosphere with additional strontium oxide (SrO) powder at 1200 ^oC results in the creation of native defects. These annealed samples show persistent photoconductivity (PPC) at room temperature, when exposed to light of energy 2. 9 eV or greater. The three or more order of magnitude change in resistance persists long after the light is turned off. This effect is attributed to an electron being excited from an <b>acceptor</b> <b>defect,</b> with a large barrier for recapture, to the conduction band. This work investigates many of the changes that occur and factors that affect PPC. The right amount of SrO powder is crucial to the formation of PPC. The presence of some oxygen vacancies is also necessary for PPC; however, too many will mute the dramatic change in resistivity. Peaks at 430 nm and 520 nm appear in the visible region of the spectrum. The peak at 430 nm is due to iron, while the peak at 520 nm has not been identified. The infrared region of the spectrum also shows changes. First, the intensity of the transmitted signal drops significantly after light exposure, due to free carrier absorption. Additionally, a hydrogen line at 3500 cm^- 1 and satellites are often observed in as-received samples. The satellites disappear during annealing and return during PPC. The hydrogen lines have the same thermal kinetics as the 520 nm peak. Hydrogen lines at 3355 and 3384 cm^- 1, if present, will prevent PPC. An exposed chip can be erased (i. e. returned to its pre-light exposed state) by using a heat treatment. Erasing and polishing an annealed chip prior to light exposure can result in weakly p-type behavior with high mobility holes (> 100 cm^ 2 /Vs). This is an order of magnitude higher than those commonly measured for electrons (5 - 10 cm^ 2 /Vs). The average hole densities were in the 10 ^ 9 - 10 ^ 10 cm^- 3 range, consistent with a deep acceptor. Washington State University, Physic...|$|E
