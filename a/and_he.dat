5|$|As a {{composer}} and pianist, Sorabji was largely self-taught, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{distanced himself from}} the main currents of contemporary musical life early in his career. He developed a highly idiosyncratic musical language, with roots in composers as diverse as Busoni, Debussy and Szymanowski, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> dismissed large portions of the established and contemporary repertoire.|$|E
5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people <b>and</b> <b>he</b> brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'.

5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E

5|$|Tucker's {{effectiveness}} in the lecture hall is not objectively certain, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{may well have}} encountered difficulty with public speaking as {{he had in the}} courtroom previously. His continued faculty chairmanship certainly testified to his relative popularity among colleagues, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> published numerous works—including one satire, a fiction, three books on economics and statistics, a Jefferson biography, as well as two pamphlets. Together with Robley Dunglison he founded and edited the Virginia Literary Museum (1829–1830) in which he published voluminous writings; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> frequently sent essays to newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later Appa Saheb was arrested. He was being escorted to Allahabad when he escaped to Punjab to seek refuge with the Sikhs.

40|$|While the {{transmembrane protein}} Notch plays an {{important}} role in various aspects of development, and diseases including tumors and neurological disorders, the intracellular pathway of mammalian Notch remains very elusive. To understand the intracellular pathway of mammalian Notch, the role of the bHLH genes <b>Hes</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hes</b> 5 (mammalian hairy and Enhancer-of-split homologues) was examined by retrovirally misexpressing the constitutively active form of Notch (caNotch) in neural precursor cells prepared from wild-type, Hes 1 -null, <b>Hes</b> 5 -null <b>and</b> <b>Hes</b> 1 -Hes 5 double-null mouse embryos. We found that caNotch, which induced the endogenous <b>Hes</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hes</b> 5 expression, inhibited neuronal differentiation in the wild-type, <b>Hes</b> 1 -null <b>and</b> <b>Hes</b> 5 -null background, but not in the Hes 1 -Hes 5 double-null background. These results demonstrate that <b>Hes</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hes</b> 5 are essential Notch effectors in regulation of mammalian neuronal differentiation...|$|R
