5|$|The Australian 7th and 9th Divisions {{converged on}} Lae, which fell on 16 September. MacArthur {{advanced}} his timetable, {{and ordered the}} 7th to capture Kaiapit and Dumpu, while the 9th mounted an amphibious assault on Finschhafen. Here, the offensive bogged down, partly because MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen, when in fact there were nearly 5,000. <b>A</b> <b>furious</b> battle ensued.|$|E

Johnny harbors an intense dislike for Lenny because of his obnoxious behavior and constant disrespect towards Nick, which proves to be mutual.

It was implied the laser pointing hooligan harassing Nick was Lenny trying to seek revenge against him and Johnny for his humiliation, but this was unconfirmed.|$|R
5|$|Victoria's {{household}} {{was largely}} run by her childhood governess, Baroness Louise Lehzen from Hanover. Lehzen {{had been a}} formative influence on Victoria, and had supported her against the Kensington System. Albert, however, thought Lehzen was incompetent, and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter's health. After <b>a</b> <b>furious</b> row between Victoria and Albert over the issue, Lehzen was pensioned off in 1842, and Victoria's close relationship with her ended.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>furious</b> Holiday Inn {{management}} {{presented the}} groups {{with a bill}} for $24,000, which was reportedly settled by Herman's Hermits tour manager Edd McCann. Townshend claimed that the Who were banned for life {{from all of the}} hotel's properties, but Fletcher wrote that they stayed at a Holiday Inn in Rochester, New York a week later. He also disputed a widely held belief that Moon drove a Lincoln Continental into the hotel's swimming pool, as claimed by the drummer in a 1972 Rolling Stone interview.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{on reports}} from airmen {{that there were}} no signs of enemy {{activity}} and the islands might have been evacuated, General Douglas MacArthur accelerated his timetable for capturing the Admiralties and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force. The campaign began on 29February 1944 when a force landed on Los Negros, the third-largest island in the group. By using a small, isolated beach where the Japanese had not anticipated an assault, the force achieved tactical surprise, but the islands proved to be far from unoccupied. <b>A</b> <b>furious</b> battle over the islands ensued.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlin jealously guarded his position. In late 1943, Chamberlin {{differed}} {{with one}} of his planners, Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, over a proposed landing at Hansa Bay. Fellers thought that Hansa Bay could be bypassed, but Chamberlin felt that this would be too risky. While Fellers was a newcomer to GHQ, he had known MacArthur for many years, and Fellers took his proposal directly to MacArthur, who approved it. <b>A</b> <b>furious</b> Chamberlin had Fellers fired from G-3. MacArthur made him his military secretary.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles lost in {{the finals}} to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points. Down by 16 {{entering}} the fourth quarter, and 10 with {{a minute and a}} half to go, the Lakers mounted <b>a</b> <b>furious</b> rally in the closing moments which fell just short. After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs, they {{lost in the}} finals to the Celtics again in 1968.

That night, 300 soldiers of the 1st SS Battalion were able to reinforce the hotel and defeat several attacks on the building. <b>A</b> <b>furious</b> German counterattack managed to overrun a number of American infantry positions outside of the hotel, and temporarily released pressure on the Quellenhof before being beaten off by concerted American mortar fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{on-screen}} feud between Rick Rude and Jake Roberts began {{weeks before}} SummerSlam. As {{part of his}} gimmick, Rude would—after winning a match—invite a pre-selected woman from the audience to kiss him in the ring. On one occasion, {{one of the women}} refused to comply, later identifying herself as Robert's wife, Cheryl. As the feud intensified, Rude began wearing a pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl stenciled on them, prompting <b>a</b> <b>furious</b> Roberts to charge into the ring and strip the tights off Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave Rude naked, although the live audience saw him stripped to a G-string instead.|$|E

Now confronted with <b>a</b> <b>furious</b> LeChuck, Guybrush is savagely beaten by the ghost pirate in a fight ranging across the island. The fight eventually arrives at the island's ship emporium, where Guybrush finds a bottle of root beer. Substituting the beverage for the lost elixir, he sprays LeChuck, destroying the ghost pirate. With LeChuck defeated, Guybrush and Elaine enjoy a romantic moment, watching fireworks caused by LeChuck exploding.|$|E
5|$|While {{the outcome}} of the battle was still undecided, a second British frigate——arrived. Outnumbered, the French captain saw no {{alternative}} and surrendered his ship. The late arrival of Arethusa—under Captain Robert Mends, who claimed the victory for himself—sparked <b>a</b> <b>furious</b> argument that developed into a lasting animosity between Mends and Captain Michael Seymour of Amethyst. The failure of Niémen to reach Isle de France also had serious repercussions for the French squadron there. With naval supplies severely limited, their ability to operate at sea {{for long periods of time}} was hampered and by late 1810 few of their vessels were still seaworthy.|$|E

5|$|About 14:00 on 9 April, two Staffeln of German Messerschmitt Bf 109 {{fighters from}} II. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 54 were {{observed}} heading towards Nova Topola just as two IK-2s were landing after a patrol in poor flying weather. One of the IK-2s managed to overshoot and climbed to meet them, {{but the other}} was unable to, and had to complete its landing. Podnarednik (Junior Sergeant) Branko Jovanović used the extreme manoeuvrability of his IK-2 to avoid the nine Bf 109s that swooped in to attack, while a total of eight Hurricanes and five more IK-2s from the 4th Fighter Regiment scrambled to meet the Germans. For the following seven or eight minutes, <b>a</b> <b>furious</b> dogfight ensued over Novo Topola, during which two German aircraft were claimed and two Hurricanes and one IK-2 were lost. German records indicate that only one of their aircraft was lost, and that the pilot survived. Podnarednik Stikić survived {{the loss of his}} IK-2, but was badly wounded. The Germans, low on fuel, broke off and headed north.|$|E

The priest Vitozzi received seven years and government witness Abbatemaggio five years. The jury had been held in isolation since March 1911. The reports of the proceedings were about 40,000 pages in 63 volumes.

Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and <b>a</b> <b>furious</b> Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy.
