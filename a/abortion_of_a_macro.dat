25|$|TeX {{provides}} <b>an</b> unusual <b>macro</b> language; {{the definition}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> not only includes <b>a</b> list <b>of</b> commands {{but also the}} syntax of the call. Macros are completely integrated with a full-scale interpreted compile-time language that also guides processing. TeX's macro level of operation is lexical, but it is <b>a</b> built-in facility <b>of</b> TeX, that makes use of syntax interpretation. Comparing with most widely used lexical preprocessors like M4, it differs slightly, as the body <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>macro</b> gets tokenized at definition time, that is, it is not completely raw text. Except for a few very special cases, this gives the same behaviour. The TeX macro language has been successfully used to extend TeX to, for instance, LaTeX and ConTeXt.|$|R
5000|$|In another respect Catholic {{canon law}} {{continued}} even after 1869 to maintain <b>a</b> distinction between <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> formed and <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unformed fetus. As indicated above in a quotation from Thomas Aquinas, one who procured the <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quickened fetus was considered [...] "irregular", meaning {{that he was}} disqualified from receiving or exercising Holy Orders. Pope Sixtus V extended this penalty even to early-term <b>abortion</b> (section 2 <b>of</b> his bull Effraenatam), but Gregory XIV restricted it again. Pius IX made no ruling in its regard, {{with the result that}} the penalty of irregularity was still limited to late-term abortion {{at the time of the}} article [...] "Abortion" [...] in the 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia. The 1917 Code of Canon Law finally did away with the distinction.|$|R

5000|$|Even when Church law, in {{line with}} the theory of delayed ensoulment, {{assigned}} different penalties to earlier and later abortions, abortion at any stage was considered a grave evil. Thus Thomas Aquinas, who accepted the Aristotelian theory that a human soul was infused only after 40 days for a male fetus, 90 days for <b>a</b> female, saw <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unsouled fetus as always unethical, a serious crime, a grave sin, a misdeed and contrary to nature. He wrote: [...] "This sin, although grave and to be reckoned among misdeeds and against nature...is something less than homicide... nor is such to be judged irregular unless one procures the <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> already formed fetus." ...|$|R
