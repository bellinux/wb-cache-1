30|$|The present work {{demonstrates}} that SA and SNP can <b>alleviate</b> Fe deficiency-induced chlorosis separately or together. Additionally, {{the combination of}} SA and SNP in <b>alleviating</b> chlorosis is better than SA or SNP alone, but an appropriate concentration of SA and SNP was needed. The mechanism of SA and/or SNP <b>alleviating</b> Fe-deficiency induced chlorosis mainly contains: (1) promoted Fe uptake, translocation and activation, (2) modulated the balance of mineral elements, (3) protected Fe deficiency induced oxidative stress. Our results may serve as an integrated and optimized management strategy to <b>alleviate</b> Fe deficiency in peanuts production, but further study is needed.|$|R

These symptoms can be <b>alleviated</b> by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals.

These disadvantages can be <b>alleviated</b> by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E

5|$|Barry dropped {{moderate}} to heavy rainfall across Florida, peaking at 6.99inches (178mm) at Palm Beach International Airport; several other locations reported over 3inches (75mm). The rainfall <b>alleviated</b> persistent drought conditions and assisted in combating severe wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rainfall closed {{a portion of}} Eau Gallie Boulevard after a large sinkhole developed. Several other roads across the area were flooded, and on Interstate 95 near Lake Worth, a sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet roads caused several traffic accidents across the state; in both Brevard and Volusia counties, a motorist was killed from an accident. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer led to disruptions near Orlando after it crashed into a guardrail.|$|E
