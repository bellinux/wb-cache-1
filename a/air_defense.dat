5|$|In October 1940, Saville flew to London with Chaney for {{temporary}} {{duty as a}} military air observer studying British air defenses, and returned to Mitchel Field after two months to become executive officer at the temporary rank of major of the First Interceptor Command. He began drafting a comprehensive <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> doctrine which combined features of the British system with those advocated by Chennault and himself. Saville was promoted to the permanent rank of major in February, 1941, and from March 25 to April 12, he conducted an intensive course in <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> given to 60 fighter group staff, including Kenneth P. Bergquist, posted to Hawaii's fighter wing. In August 1941, he returned to London and observed British <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> measures until December 1941. During this time, Saville's <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Doctrine draft was reviewed by the USAAC, {{but it was not}} approved or published. Saville's proposed defense involved rigorous round-the-clock coordination between ground observers, radar installations, and centralized command posts to filter reports to defense forces consisting of anti-aircraft artillery batteries, barrage balloons, and fighter wings. Unusually, Saville proposed that fighter wings involved in <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> be completely separate from fighter wings making attacks on enemy air forces.|$|E
5|$|Saville and Fairchild went to Congress in 1950, and {{obtained}} $114million {{for the development}} of an electronic computer-based <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> system, a project headed by George E. Valley Jr, who was a physicist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The computer, named Whirlwind, helped the USAF develop the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> system.|$|E

500|$|To {{compensate}} for the weaknesses of Egyptian air power, the Egyptians developed their <b>air</b> <b>defenses.</b> They fielded immobile SA-2 and SA-3 SAMs, {{the backbone of the}} <b>air</b> <b>defenses,</b> as well as mobile SA-6 SAMs and ZSU-23-4 SPAAGs (Self Propelled Anti-Air Gun), portable infantry SA-7s, in addition to thousands of conventional anti-air artillery. These <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> would provide a protective [...] "umbrella" [...] over Egyptian ground forces. However, the SA-2 and SA-3 systems, being immobile, could only be moved over a nine-hour period at best, exposing the <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> to degradation in case of a redeployment to keep up with advancing forces. On the other hand, the SA-6 systems were available in limited numbers insufficient to provide adequate protection to advancing armored forces.|$|R
50|$|The Tactical Air Launched Decoy (TALD) was {{intended}} to confuse and saturate enemy <b>air</b> <b>defenses,</b> {{as part of an}} overall SEAD (Suppression of Enemy <b>Air</b> <b>Defenses)</b> strategy thus allowing attacking aircraft and weapons a higher probability of penetrating to the target. The Improved TALD is a turbojet-powered version.|$|R
5|$|Once it {{was clear}} that U.S. {{territory}} was not in danger of being attacked by enemy air units, Saville's expertise in <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> was not needed. In March 1943, he was made director of tactical development at the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) at Orlando, Florida, where he reorganized the Army Air Forces Board by July 2, 1943. Saville's structure put tactical and strategic development on equal footing, and tied together the efforts of the Chief of Air Staff for Operations, Commitments, and Requirements (OC), the Proving Ground Command and the School of Applied Tactics. Saville charged the AAFSAT with developing <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> doctrines and tactics, and with the testing of <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> equipment and methods.|$|E
5|$|Saville was a {{technical}} and scientific-minded leader who helped pioneer advanced mathematics for operations research, and computer systems for centralized coordination of <b>air</b> <b>defense.</b> He advocated {{the expansion of}} radar installations to create an unbroken <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> network. He explored {{the concept of a}} military aircraft designed around an integrated electronics fire-control system built by various subcontractors. After retiring from the military, Saville worked in the defense industry.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, the 102d Tactical Fighter Wing {{moved to}} Otis Air Force Base, and was reassigned from the <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Command to the Tactical Air Command the next year. The wing flew the F-84F Thunderstreak from 1964 until June 1971, when a {{squadron}} of F-100D Super Sabres was transferred directly from units fighting the Vietnam War. These were superseded soon after by the Mach 2 F-106 Delta Darts and on 10 June 1972, the unit became the 102d <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Wing. On 30 December 1973, Otis Air Force Base was inactivated and transferred to the Massachusetts Air National Guard as Otis Air National Guard Base.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, Quesada {{took the}} First <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Wing to North Africa. Shortly thereafter, {{he was given}} command of the XII Fighter Command and in this {{capacity}} would work out the mechanics of close air support and Army-Air Force cooperation.|$|E
5|$|In September, Saville told Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington, and the {{assembled}} Air Force staff that America's air defenses were wholly inadequate. The Chiefs of Staff agreed that <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> {{was second in}} importance only to a strong retaliation force, one that would give pause to an aggressor. In November, Saville was named commanding general of ADC. He worked to combine it with Tactical Air Command (TAC) to form {{the backbone of the}} Continental Air Command (CONAC) organization. In February 1949, Saville updated the House Armed Services Committee on the necessity of radar <b>air</b> <b>defense,</b> and in March the Lashup plan was approved by Congress.|$|E

At Câmpina, <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> on overlooking hills were able to fire down into the formation.|$|R
5|$|In {{preparation}} for these new requirements, Fort Lewis began to receive new corps support units which {{were coming out}} of Europe. One of these was the 7th Engineer Brigade which was inactivated on 16 January 1992 and immediately reactivated as the 555th Engineer Group. On 16 February 1992 the 210th Field Artillery Brigade, also from Europe, was activated. In 1997, the 35th <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Artillery Brigade moved to Fort Bliss, Texas, to join other <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> brigades. The corps and Fort Lewis would see a reshuffling of units {{in and out of the}} area through 2000. Plans were drawn up for emergency operations for I Corps should a major conflict emerge in the Pacific region. Plans exist for I Corps to rapidly deploy in defense of Japan or South Korea.|$|E

50|$|The 20th Operations Group is {{the flying}} {{component}} of the 20th Fighter Wing. The unit employs approximately 80 F-16CJ fighter aircraft in a mission-ready, multi-role capability to mobilize, deploy and tactically employ forces worldwide for any contingency in support of US national objectives. It is responsible for providing the people and resources necessary for conventional air-to-surface, air superiority, suppression of enemy <b>air</b> <b>defenses,</b> destruction of enemy <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> and maritime operations.|$|R

5|$|Olds was {{assigned}} to command the 71st Fighter Squadron, which was soon detached from the 1st FG to the <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Command and based at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport in Pennsylvania. As a result, he missed service in the Korean War despite repeated applications for a combat assignment. Discouraged and {{at odds with the}} Air Force, in which he was seen as an iconoclast, Olds reportedly {{was in the process of}} resigning when he was talked out of it by a mentor, Maj Gen Frederic H. Smith, Jr., who brought him to work at Eastern <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Command headquarters at Stewart AFB.|$|E
5|$|On 30 December 1941, 2nd Squadron moved {{south from}} Toungou to Mingaladon with 18 fresh aircraft, {{relieving}} the 3rd Squadron {{who had been}} there since 12 December.

5|$|After the war, he {{commanded}} the Far East Air Forces, the Continental Air Command, and the <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Command.

Both his son, Ennis Whitehead, Jr., and his grandson, Ennis Whitehead III, became generals as well, rising to major general and brigadier general respectively.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
