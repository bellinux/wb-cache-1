The Environmental Technology Verification – Arsenic Mitigation (ETV-AM) Program is multi year, CIDA funded initiative designed to work in association with the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and other international and national development partners working in the arsenic mitigation sector. The initiative is an intensive program designed to assess technologies based upon a rigorous performance criterion, followed by verification under conditions of actual use. Only those technologies meeting the specific requirements of Bangladesh will be implemented. The primary objective of ETV-AM is to complete a thorough <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> of arsenic mitigation technologies that are currently being utilized or proposed for use in Bangladesh, based upon standards established in association with the GoB.

40|$|The {{paper is}} aiming to {{implement}} the general principles of risk prevention at employer’s level, with respect to occupational risks evaluation, the elimination of risk and accident factors, and information of workers which are using the machinery in the forestry sector. For the use of machinery in the forestry sector {{in terms of economic}} performance and a level of maximum safety, it is necessary to ensure the user guides set by the manufacturer in terms of commissioning, use and to provide appropriate safe working operations and interventions and to guarantee the technical and environmental requirements, including appropriate measures and means of protection against accidents and occupational disease. The impact of occupational risks for machinery used in this sector can be reduced through the application of modern principles in conformity assessment and certification and, where appropriate, through technical diagnostics and inspection, taking into account the provisions of the new Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 / EC which is imposing the obligation of manufacturer to implement conformity assessment procedures in accordance with the methods of <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> of safety at the certification bodies, notified at the European Commission.

40|$|Alkali-activated ground {{granulated}} blast-slag (AAS) is {{the most}} obvious alternative material for ordinary Portland cement (OPC). However, {{to use it as}} a structural material requires the <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> of its durability. The most important factor for a durability evaluation is the degree of carbonation resistance, and AAS is known to show lower performance than OPC. A series of experiments was conducted with a view to investigate the carbonation characteristics of AAS binder. As a consequence, it was found that the major hydration product of AAS was calcium silicate hydrate (CSH), with almost no portlandite, unlike the products of OPC. After carbonation, the CSH of AAS turned into amorphous silica gel which was most likely why the compressive strength of AAS became weaker after carbonation. An increase of the activator dosage leads AAS to react more quickly and produce more CSH, increasing the compaction, compressive strength, and carbonation resistance of the microstructure...|$|E
