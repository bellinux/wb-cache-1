Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress.|$|E
25|$|A {{sophisticated}} <b>academic</b> <b>language</b> {{for talking}} about the sociology of roles {{did not exist in}} the mid-19th century. Marx therefore borrowed from theatre and literature to express his idea. Although György Lukács pioneered a sociology of drama in 1909, a sociology of roles began only in the 1930s, and a specific sociology of theatre (e.g. by Jean Duvignaud) first emerged in the 1960s. Marx's concept is both that an identity appears differently from its true identity (it is masked or disguised), and that this difference has very real practical consequences (the mask is not simply a decoration, but performs a real function and has real effects, even independently of the mask bearer).|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{relatively}} high proportion of immigrants through Portugal, the majority of Spanish and Portuguese Jews of the 16th and 17th centuries spoke Portuguese as their first language. Portuguese was used for everyday communication {{in the first few}} generations, and was the usual language for official documents such as synagogue by-laws; for this reason, synagogue officers still often have Portuguese titles such as Parnas dos Cautivos and Thesoureiro do Heshaim. As a basic <b>academic</b> <b>language,</b> Portuguese was used for such works as the halakhic manual [...] by Menasseh Ben Israel and controversial works by Uriel da Costa.|$|E
2500|$|Cook {{first set}} about his {{statistical}} baseball studies {{with the goal}} of proving that Ty Cobb, holder of the highest career batting average at [...]366, was better than Babe Ruth, the premier power hitter {{of the first half of}} the 20th century. Additionally Cook sought to understand strategical issues such as batting order and relief pitching, rather than accept the traditional strategies of baseball. Sports Illustrated writer Frank Deford learned of Cook's work and interviewed him for the lead story of a 1964 issue with the title [...] "Baseball is Played All Wrong". [...] Using tools of the time, such as a slide rule and a Friden STW mechanical calculator, Earnshaw Cook published the culmination of his work, Percentage Baseball (MIT Press), in 1964. Percentage Baseball was the first book of baseball statistics studies to gain national media attention. Though Cook received some support from Los Angeles Dodgers manager Walter Alston and Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck, most baseball executives and managers rejected Cook's mathematical approach and <b>academic</b> <b>language.</b> He was also criticized for lax mathematical models and inadequate numerical evidence by statisticians, such as George Lindsey (himself a baseball statistician), who advised that it be [...] "kept out of the sight of students of the theory of probability." [...] Modern author Michael Lewis describes Cook's prose as [...] "crafted to alienate [...] converts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2017, the SOAS Students Union courted {{controversy}} {{in the news media}} when they released a report titled 'Degrees of Racism: Attainment Gap Report'. ITV news published a story titled [...] "Black and ethnic minority students unhappy about 'too white' university staff." [...] The ITV News article reported that “Some black and ethnic minority students at a leading university have said they are unhappy about being taught by old white professors” The report itself investigated the reasons why a greater proportion of white students at SOAS attain a 2:1 or first class degree, compared to BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) students. Some participants within the report stated that there is an “over representation of white people among staff and students on some courses.” Furthermore, the BME participants highlighted the impact of the “whiteness of the curriculum than that of any other aspect of learning and teaching.” The report also stated that, “discussions dominated by ‘white male students’, made minority female students feel uncomfortable, intimidated or threatened” and that “Having white students voice dominate was especially frustrating when the discussion was about political or theoretical interventions of people of color, or about racist violence.” One BME student also had issues with “white teachers teaching white students about black/brown people.” Some BME students felt silenced also “by the pressure to communicate using <b>academic</b> <b>language</b> that – for reasons of structural racism – was closer to the everyday speech of middle-class, white students than their own.” The report recommended that “All academics must be prepared to acknowledge that, no matter their research specialism, they are capable of racism, and should be prepared to discuss how.” Other recommendations included “Introduce mandatory unconscious bias workshops for all assessors and staff on recruitment or promotion panels.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Cognitive <b>academic</b> <b>language</b> {{proficiency}} (CALP) is a language-related term {{developed by}} Jim Cummins {{which refers to}} formal academic learning, as opposed to BICS. In schools today, the terms BICS and CALP are most frequently used to discuss the language proficiency levels {{of students who are}} in the process of acquiring a new language. These students typically develop proficiency in BICS well before they acquire a strong grasp of CALP or <b>academic</b> <b>language.</b> As a result, students may initially appear fully proficient and fluent, while still struggling with significant language gaps. In a 1996 ethnographic study of Salvadorean students in Washington, D.C., Carolyn Vincent found that the students' language attainments were [...] "largely deceptive." [...] Students were less proficient than they appeared because they were able [...] "to converse on a few everyday, frequently discussed subjects" [...] but often lacked proficiency in <b>academic</b> <b>language.</b> Although the terms BICS and CALP are still widely used, Jim Cummins has more recently used the terms conversational language and <b>academic</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
