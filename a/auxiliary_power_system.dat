50|$|On February 7, Missile 13A was {{launched}} from LC-14. The engines switched to an improved {{variant of the}} MA-1 system with bell-shaped thrust chambers and 150,000 pounds of thrust, also the verniers {{were added to the}} autopilot loop for the first time. The APS (<b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Power</b> <b>System)</b> ceased operating at liftoff due to improper disconnect of a pad umbilical. At T+108 seconds, the engines started oscillating in all three axes and at T+117 seconds, the B-1 engine shut down. One second later, the B-2 engine shut down. The Atlas broke up at T+163 seconds. The failure was attributed to a short in the vernier engine feedback transducer which caused the unexpected engine oscillation, but the actual loss of thrust was believed to be due to a turbopump failure. Missile 11A {{was launched}} from LC-12 on February 20. This was the first flight where a roll program was added to the autopilot. Once again, the vernier feedback transducer shorted, leading to complete loss of control at T+109 seconds. The engines shut down starting at T+120 seconds and missile breakup occurred at T+126 seconds. Film and photographic data suggested that the loss of thrust was caused by a ruptured LOX duct. The propulsion system also operated fuel-rich during the flight.|$|E

However the exclusion of an inverter also prevents the solar cells to have adirect connection to the grid, which in turn makes them ineligible for the Swedishgovernmental solar power investment support program. The lesser load on therectifiers will not affect their lifetime according to manufacturers and thus achieves noeconomic gain. Avoiding conversion losses will increase the gain from the producedelectricity by enabling even more power to be sold to the grid.

30|$|In {{spite of}} the {{excellent}} characteristics of DC microgrids, effective fault protection schemes for DC microgrids still remain a challenge. In addition, protection standards and guidelines that can be widely accepted in industrial and commercial applications have not been proposed [11]. Some organizations have developed practical standards in specific fields such as the European standard ETSI EN 300 132 - 3 - 1 [12], IEEE Standard 946 [13] and IEC SG 4 [14], which are respectively designed for data/telecom <b>systems,</b> DC <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>systems</b> and LVDC distribution systems. However, they did not reach a consensus and the widespread acceptance of standards still {{have a way to}} come. Due to the high magnitude and significant changing rate of the fault currents, fault detection and isolation should be evaluated as soon as possible. Previous researches indicate that typical voltage sourced converters (VSCs) can only tolerate twice the converter full-load current rating and the fault clearing time should be around 2 ms [3], [15]. In addition, the implementation of protection has to restrain the transient voltage and requires operating the devices in a coordinated way.|$|R

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is {{in a state}} of flux at the moment. Traditional combustion engine technologies are becoming challenged by newer, more efficient and environmentally friendly propulsion methods. These include bio-fuel, hybrid, and hydrogen fuel-cell technologies. Propulsion alone, however, is not the only area where improvements can be made in vehicle efficiency. Current vehicle research and development focuses heavily on propulsion systems with relatively few resources dedicated to auxiliary systems. These auxiliary systems, however, can have a significant impact on overall vehicle efficiency and fuel economy. The objective of this work is to improve the efficiency of a Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) through intelligent auxiliary system control. The analysis contained herein is applicable to all types of vehicles and may find applications in many vehicle architectures. A survey is made of the various types of alternative fuels and vehicle architectures from conventional gasoline vehicles to hybrids and fuel cells. Trends in <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>systems</b> and previous papers on control of these systems are discussed. The FCEV developed by the University of Waterloo Alternative Fuels Team (UWAFT) is outlined and the design process presented. Its powertrain control strategy is analyzed with a proposal for modifications as well as the addition of an auxiliary control module to meet the aforementioned objectives. Simulations are performed to predict the efficiency and fuel economy gains that can potentially be realized using these proposed techniques. These gains prove to be significant, with an almost 2 % improvement realized through intelligent control of the air conditioning compressor, and further gains possible through other <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> reduction techniques...|$|R
