5|$|By September, Brooks {{was back}} at a work camp, this time in Svitavy in the Sudetenland. He escaped that month with five other men, this time making it to Lüneburg inside a coal train prior to his recapture. Sent to a {{prisoner}} of war camp near Wiener Neustadt, he once more tried to escape but failed, suffered a severe beating {{at the hands of the}} Germans, and was again sent back to Stalag VIII-B for two weeks of solitary confinement. Working as a truck helper from a saw mill in Toszek, he slowly acquired maps of Europe and the surrounding region as well as contact information for the Polish Underground State. Having escaped twice <b>already,</b> <b>he</b> risked transfer to a special punishment camp if caught again but, nevertheless, he fled his detention once more, this time with a Scottish soldier by the name of John Duncan, in May 1943.|$|E

In September 2008, Conservative leader Stephen Harper pledged this, saying a decade at war is enough, after having extended the withdrawal deadline twice <b>already.</b> <b>He</b> acknowledged that neither the Canadian public nor the troops themselves had any appetite to stay longer in the war and said that only a small group of advisers might remain.|$|E

The north end was remodeled into a caretaker's residence, although it had to be rebuilt to its original appearance after a fire destroyed it. Laura Hasbrouck died childless in 1964 and willed it to Richard Relyea Hasbrouck, a descendant of Maurice Hasbrouck's brother Huram, specifically to keep it in the family, since he had two sons <b>already.</b> <b>He</b> only found out when the estate's lawyer called and said he had to start paying taxes on the property.|$|E
25|$|These can be {{supported}} by Hesiod's account:Now all the gods were divided through strife; for at that very time Zeus who thunders on high was meditating marvelous deeds, even to mingle storm and tempest over the boundless earth, and <b>already</b> <b>he</b> was hastening to make an utter end of the race of mortal men, declaring that he would destroy {{the lives of the}} demi-gods, that the children of the gods should not mate with wretched mortals, seeing their fate with their own eyes; but that the blessed gods henceforth even as aforetime should have their living and their habitations apart from men. But on those who were born of immortals and of mankind verily Zeus laid toil and sorrow upon sorrow.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Michael Bumgarner, then {{commander}} of Camp America {{and head of}} the guard forces, said shortly after the events that each of the prisoners had had a ball of cloth in his mouth, either to induce choking or to muffle the voice. (Scheduled for rotation <b>already,</b> <b>he</b> was stripped of his command early shortly after his public comments.) The NCIS report had acknowledged that the bodies of the three men showed signs of torture, including hemorrhages, needle marks, and significant bruising. The government retained the throat organs (larynx, hyoid bone), which were removed prior or during the autopsy conducted by pathologists affiliated with the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology when they sent the men's bodies to their home countries. This made it impossible for the pathologists who conducted second autopsies for the families of the dead men to determine whether the men were already dead when their bodies were suspended by nooses.|$|E

25|$|The joint rule of Maxentius and Maximian in Rome {{was tested}} further when Galerius himself marched to Italy {{in the summer}} of 307 with an even larger army. While {{negotiating}} with the invader, Maxentius could repeat what he did to Severus: by the promise of large sums of money, and the authority of Maximian, many soldiers of Galerius defected to him. Galerius was forced to withdraw, plundering Italy on his way. Some time during the invasion, Severus was put to death by Maxentius, probably at Tres Tabernae near Rome (the exact circumstances of his death are not certain). After the failed campaign of Galerius, Maxentius' reign over Italy and Africa was firmly established. Beginning in 307 <b>already,</b> <b>he</b> tried to arrange friendly contacts with Constantine, and {{in the summer of}} that year, Maximian travelled to Gaul, where Constantine married his daughter Fausta and was in turn appointed Augustus by the senior emperor. However, Constantine tried to avoid breaking with Galerius, and did not openly support Maxentius during the invasion.|$|E

500|$|While Christopher {{was hoping}} to start, the Indians felt, like the Athletics, {{that he would be}} better as a relief pitcher for them. Early in the season, Christopher told Veeck that 1948 would be his final year, as his wife joined the doctors' side, wanting him to retire and noting that he was playing on [...] "borrowed time" [...] <b>already.</b> <b>He</b> spent the season as the Indians' chief relief pitcher {{alongside}} Ed Klieman, both of whom were considered two of the best relievers in the league that season. Christopher finished the season with 45 games played, a 3–2 record, a 2.90 ERA, and 17 saves, which led the league. In the 1948 World Series, he pitched in game five, facing Mike McCormick and Eddie Stanky. He allowed singles to both hitters and allowed two runs to score, and was relieved by Satchel Paige, ending his only playoff appearance.|$|E
500|$|The body suits worn by Khan and Rampal were {{designed}} by Robert Kurtzman and Tim Flattery, and made {{by a team of}} specialists based in Los Angeles. Sinha spent around three months conceptualising the costumes, watching various superhero films to design a costume not created <b>already.</b> <b>He</b> then wrote a 23-page document with his sketches and details of what he wanted, and gave it to the designers to work upon. To create the suit, Khan was required to enter a small chamber where a warm latex-like liquid was released up to his neck and allowed to solidify, forming the mould which was then peeled off his body. The suit was joined by a concealed zipper and subsequently modified. Computer-generated embellishments such as light beams and electricity were added to the suits after Khan expressed dissatisfaction with the initial rushes of the film. A total of 21 costumes were made for the film, with each suit reportedly costing [...]|$|E
500|$|Speer overcame these {{difficulties}} by centralizing {{power over the}} war economy in himself. Factories were given autonomy, or as Speer put it, [...] "self-responsibility", and each factory concentrated on a single product. Backed by Hitler's strong support (the dictator stated, [...] "Speer, I'll sign anything that comes from you"), he divided the armament field according to weapon system, with experts rather than civil servants overseeing each department. No department head could be older than 55—anyone older being susceptible to [...] "routine and arrogance"—and no deputy older than 40. Over these departments was a central planning committee headed by Speer, which took increasing responsibility for war production, and as time went by, for the German economy itself. According to the minutes of a conference at Wehrmacht High Command in March1942, [...] "It is only Speer's word that counts nowadays. He can interfere in all departments. <b>Already</b> <b>he</b> overrides all departments... On the whole, Speer's attitude is to the point." [...] Goebbels would note in his diary in June 1943, [...] "Speer is still tops with the Führer. He is truly a genius with organization." [...] Speer was so successful in his position that by late 1943, he was widely regarded among the Nazi elite as a possible successor to Hitler.|$|E

2500|$|As the third-most prestigious Indian ruler, Sayajirao {{was third}} {{in line to}} {{approach}} the King-Emperor; <b>already,</b> <b>he</b> had caused consternation among the British officials by refusing to wear his full regalia of jewels and honours (to lend a touch of exoticism, {{it was expected that}} the rulers on formal occasions would present themselves in jewels). While some accounts state that he refused to bow, Sayajirao actually did bow, albeit perfunctorily and only once before turning his back on the King-Emperor. According to his granddaughter Gayatri Devi, she states in her autobiography that due to some reason he had been unable to attend the rehearsals and didn't know how to greet The King-Emperor. Other eyewitness reports state he walked away [...] "laughing".|$|E

2500|$|Geiger {{wrote that}} at {{seventeen}} <b>already,</b> <b>he</b> discerned that the late Tannaim and the Amoraim imposed a subjective interpretation on the Oral Torah, attempting to diffuse its revolutionary potential by linking {{it to the}} Biblical text. Believing that Judaism became stale {{and had to be}} radically transformed if it were to survive modernity, he found little use in the legal procedures of Halakha, arguing that hardline rabbis often demonstrated they will not accept major innovations anyway. His venture into higher criticism led him to regard the Pentateuch as reflecting power struggles between the Pharisees on one hand, and the Saducees who had their own pre-Mishnaic Halakha. Having concluded the belief in an unbroken tradition back to Sinai or a divinely dictated Torah could not be maintained, he began to articulate a theology of progressive revelation, presenting the Pharisees as reformers who revolutionized the Saducee-dominated religion. His other model were the Prophets, whose morals and ethics were to him the only true, permanent core of Judaism. He was not alone: Solomon Formstecher argued that Revelation was God's influence on human psyche rather than encapsulated in law; Aaron Bernstein was apparently the first to deny inherent sanctity to any text when he wrote in 1844 that [...] "The Pentateuch is not a chronicle of God's revelation, it is a testimony to the inspiration His consciousness had on our forebears." [...] Many others shared similar convictions.|$|E
2500|$|In mid June Darwin {{returned}} home to Shrewsbury, and continued [...] "working like a tiger" [...] for the Canary scheme, [...] "at present Spanish & Geology, the former I find as intensely stupid, as the latter most interesting". By then his most likely companion on the trip was the tutor Marmaduke Ramsay. Darwin was [...] "trying to make a map" [...] of Shropshire, [...] "but dont find it so easy as I expected." [...] He ordered a clinometer, and on 11 July wrote to tell Henslow that it had arrived and he had tried it out in his bedroom. [...] "As yet I have only indulged in hypotheses; but they are such powerful ones, that I suppose, if they were put into action but for one day, the world would come to an end." [...] In efforts to learn the basics of geology he extended his mapping of strata {{as far away as}} Llanymynech, some [...] from Shrewsbury, using the terminology he had learnt in Edinburgh from Robert Jameson. <b>Already</b> <b>he</b> was anxious that he had not heard from Sedgwick, and when he investigated ship sailings he found that they were only available in certain months. For this reason, the trip to Teneriffe had to be postponed to the following June, and it looked increasingly unlikely that Henslow would come on the trip. Darwin wrote to one of his student friends that he was [...] "at present mad about Geology" [...] and had plans to ride through Wales then meet with other students at Barmouth.|$|E
