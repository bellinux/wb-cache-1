Despite the common perception of hammers hitting blocks, signifying {{the creation of the}} basic sale contract, 1 a typical <b>auction</b> <b>sale</b> necessarily involves the making of several forms of contract other than the obvious primary sale agreement. The purpose of this article, therefore, is threefold, namely, to (1) examine these various forms of contractual relationship 2 which may come into existence {{as a result of a}} traditional (face to face) auction sale; (2) consider specifically the selling of land at public auction with a view to advocating a change in the law requiring the formality of writing for sales contracts of land for both private and public auctions, and (3) compare briefly the contractual elements of an online ascending model of <b>auction</b> <b>sale</b> typified by the eBay phenomenon...|$|R
