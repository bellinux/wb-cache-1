5000|$|The {{courts have}} {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. {{can be used to}} avoid taxation of wages. For example, in Parker v. Commissioner, a case where a taxpayer unsuccessfully argued that wages were not taxable, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated (in part): Appellant cites Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 31 S. Ct. 342, 55 L. Ed. 389 (1911), in support of his contention that the income tax is an excise tax applicable only against special privileges, such as the privilege of conducting a business, and is not <b>assessable</b> against <b>income</b> in general. Appellant twice errs. Flint did not address personal income tax; it was concerned with corporate taxation. Furthermore, Flint is pre-sixteenth amendment and must be read in that light. At this late date, it seems incredible that we would again be required to hold that the Constitution, as amended, empowers the Congress to levy an income tax against any source of income, without the need to apportion the tax equally among the states, or to classify it as an excise tax applicable to specific categories of activities.|$|R

40|$|The extreme {{importance}} of a source of tax in selecting taxes by the legislator is advanced in legal and financial literature. Taxes hitting the perceptible source of tax should therefore be preferred by a fiscal system. The systematics of taxation adopted in Poland follows this proposition, it is income which {{is considered to be}} one of the most substantial tax sources. In unsocialized units of economy income is taxed in a form of income tax assessment. This type of tax has been a subject to a well pronounced evolution in Poland, to start with the Decree of 8 Jan. 1946 and subsequent later changes until the enactment of the Income Tax Act of 16 Dec, 1972. Consecutive changes amounted to the increase of rates of taxation against former regulations, so the assessment became heavier. Tax which represents an act of intervention into the area of individual's private income goes a long way toward a regulation of the real income level of respective groups of a society. Structure of wealth of taxpayers is also ďifferenciated, eg. states of finances of taxpayers employing and not emploing wage workers have to be discriminated. <b>Assessable</b> excess <b>income</b> over zł 72 000 per annum is considered to be high.

Of course I know there are some people who say you can tax the foreigner--but I am quite sure that you will not expect me to waste your time in dealing with that gospel of quacks and creed of gulls. The choice is between wealth and wages, and we think that, in view of that great increase in accumulated wealth which has marked the last ten years, and is the feature of our modern life, it is not excessive or unreasonable at the present stage in our national finances to ask for a further contribution from the direct taxpayers of something under eight millions a year. That is the total of all the new taxes on wealth which our Budget imposes, and it is about equal to the cost of four of those Dreadnoughts for which these same classes were clamouring a few months ago.

In December 2002, the Howard government enacted the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth). This legislative package created a prospective concession primarily aimed at qualifying limited partnerships who participate in the Australian venture capital market. Subject to a rather stringent qualification criteria, such partnerships are treated as fiscally transparent for the purposes of Australian taxation law. In addition, the gains made upon the disposal of portfolio investments by these partnerships may not be subject to Australian capital gains tax ("CGT") or otherwise <b>assessable</b> as ordinary <b>income.</b> The central concept of these measures is the venture capital limited partnership ("VCLP"), and other fund of fund organisational forms which are founded on the limited partnership. For this reason, the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth) are collectively identified as the "VCLP Concessions". This thesis has been prepared as a rigorous assessment of the VCLP Concessions. It draws upon an analysis of the nature and structure of venture capital investing to determine whether the particular features of the VCLP Concessions appropriately cater for the needs of prospective foreign investors.

The Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) is based on information held by HM Revenue and Customs tax offices on individuals who could be liable to UK income tax. It is carried out annually by HMRC and covers <b>income</b> <b>assessable</b> to tax for each tax year. Not {{all of them are}} taxpayers because the operation of personal reliefs and allowances may remove them from liability. Where income exceeds the threshold for operation of Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE), the survey provides the most comprehensive and accurate official source of data on personal incomes. The SPI is compiled to provide a quantified evidence base from which to cost proposed changes to tax rates, personal allowances and other tax reliefs for Treasury Ministers. It is used to inform policy decisions within HMRC and the Treasury, as well as for tax modelling and forecasting purposes. In addition, it is used to provide summary information for the National Accounts that are prepared by the Office for National Statistics. Finally, it is used to provide information to Members of Parliament, other Government Departments, companies, organisation and individuals. The UK Data Archive currently holds the Public Use Tape (PUT) data for 1985 - 86 and 1995 - 96 onwards (data for 2008 - 09 is currently unavailable). For further details of sampling and coverage criteria, see documentation. Further information about the SPI, including income tax and personal incomes statistics, is available on the gov. uk Statistics at HMRC webpages. Main Topics : The Public Use Tape (PUT) dataset is an anonymised dataset and is based on the SPI. It allows users to produce their own analysis. The dataset contains a range of variables about personal incomes arising from employment, self employment, pension, benefits, property, savings, investments and other income sources. The dataset also contains variables about allowances, deductions and reliefs, which people might be due. There is also a regional code variable on the dataset and a trade code for cases which are self-employed.

40|$|Fra i temi affrontati dalla legge 11 marzo 2011, n. 23, recante delega al governo per un sistema fiscale più equo, spiccano le questioni fondamentali della riforma catastale e della fiscalità energetico-ambientale, di cui si tratta nel presente studio. La nuova riforma del catasto dei fabbricati aspira a realizzare un sistema fiscale più perequato at-traverso la rimozione della disparità fra redditi (e valori) catastali e redditi (e valori) osservabili nei mercati immobiliari. Il tema catastale è rilevante per i molteplici effetti fiscali che ne derivano, e il divario esistente fra i valori di mercato e quelli catastali, hanno suscitato un grande interesse degli studiosi di estimo, stimolando la produzione di una mole di interventi di natura teorica, sulle finalità ed obiettivi del catasto, ed operativa, con sperimentazioni e proposte di procedimenti estimativi immobiliari professionali o appositamente concepiti per le applicazioni ca-tastali. Questi studi affrontato le tematiche suddette principalmente in rapporto agli immobili a destinazione ordinaria e ai fondi agricoli. Le problematiche di equità fiscale che la legge delega intende affrontare mediante la riforma del catasto dei fabbricati emergono, tuttavia, non soltanto nell’ambito delle {{categorie}} di immobili a destinazione ordinaria, ma altresì per gli immobili a destinazione speciale. Questo contributo approfondisce il tema in rapporto agli impianti per la produzione energetica da fonti alternative diffuse sul territorio (irraggiamento solare e vento). Il diverso “potenziale energetico locale” dei vari siti geografici, consente di rilevare una “rendita solare” differenziale che si concretizza in una variegata redditività di analoghi impianti a fonti rinnovabili diffuse installati su territori con localizzazione geografica differente. Alla luce di tale osservazione, si evidenziano i li-miti del procedimento adottato dal sistema normativo italiano e dalla prassi catastale per la stima della rendita catastale degli impianti a fonti rinnovabili e si proporre un rimedio coerente con gli obiettivi di incentivazione delle produzioni energetiche a più elevata qualità ambientale, da perseguire anche mediante un’adeguata fiscalità energetica, come prescrive l’art. 15 della legge delega in oggetto. Among {{the topics}} {{addressed by the}} Law of 11 March 2014 n. 23, delegating to the government for a fairer tax system, there are two fundamental issues which {{are the subject of}} this study, the cadastral reform and the energy and environmental taxation. The new reform of the cadastre of buildings aspires to achieve a more equalized tax system by removing the disparity between cadastral <b>incomes</b> (and <b>assessable</b> values) and <b>incomes</b> (and property values) observable in real estate markets. The Law n. 23 / 2014 also introduces the necessity of defining an energy-environmental taxation in order to promote the growth of green economy. The definition of an energy and environmental taxation is very broad issue. It includes many aspects related to the activities of production and consumption. However, with regard {{to the development of the}} electric energy market from renewable sources, it is referable to the theme of greater correspondence between cadastral incomes and values and respective incomes and values in actual market. The disparity in the definition of cadastral incomes and values affects the whole system of taxation that comes from them. It is the whole system of real estate taxation, including on property taxes or taxes on other real rights on real estate, the taxes due in the sale and transfer by gift or inheritance of properties and also the income tax of individuals. For the resulting consequences on the tax system, the gap between real estate market values and cadastral values have aroused great interest of appraisal scholars, that agree on the need for similarity of assessed values registered in the cadastre and values detectable on actual market. This condition must be satisfied in order to allow the cadastre to perform properly its own fiscal function. The cadastral estimation applied to buildings in ordinary destination generates inequalities arising in part from the macroscopic analysis of the built environment - which set aside an accurate segmentation of the housing market - and in part by the application of the estimation procedure "for classes and rates", in which the linking scales of real estate earnings and the linking scale of municipalities allow us to attribute to individual real estate units the relative rates of cadastral estimation. These apply to consistencies of the surface obtained, in their turn, with automatic coefficients for the conversion of the cadastral rooms. Issues of tax equity similar to those that the delegating law wants to address through the reform of the cadastre of buildings belonging to ordinary cadastral categories (A, B and C) emerge also in relation to real estate immovable for special purposes and for lands. For what concerns power plants using renewable energy sources, the theme of the lack of fairness in taxation for real estate properties for special purpose is of great importance for supporting the development of green economy in Italy. The present contribution deals with the theme of equity in attribution of cadastral incomes to installations for the production of electric energy using alternative sources scattered on the land (solar irradiation and wind power). A remedy for reducing inequality of incomes attributed according to current cadastral praxis is proposed. In Italy, the electricity production market from renewable sources was still negligible at the end of the nineties. Following the impetus provided by incentive policies adopted since 2001, the program "Photovoltaic roofs" and the five subsequent versions of the so-called "Energy Account", it has developed rapidly in the fields of photovoltaic and wind power. With the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (PAN) and the recent National Energy Strategy (SEN), developed in the context of energy and environmental policies promoted by the Euro-pean Union, Italy has made specific commitments on development of use of renewable energy sources and on the reduction of the production of greenhouse gases. These commitments require, among other things, a new increase in the produc-tion of electric energy by technologies free from production of greenhouse gases. Therefore, the issue of fairness in the attribution of cadastral income to installations producing electric energy by renewable sources, already involving a large number of plants, will affect in the short to medium term a growing number of installations, and most importantly, a significantly higher in-stalled power, with considerable effects on tax revenues resulting from the tax base of cadastral nature. In general, the photovoltaic and wind power plants belong to the cadastral category "D/ 1 - factories", unless they have a modest power and are in-tended for self-consumption or are classifiable in the category "D/ 10 " of "factory buildings for the production functions related to agricultural activities". Operational difficulties related to the lack of active markets for lease and sale of property units intended for special and particular use are found more so in the still latent market for solar and wind power installations. This circumstance makes it inapplicable, in cadastral praxis, the direct estimation procedure of the cadastral income for derivation from the gross average annual lease fee. A similar difficulty arises in the application of the indirect estimating method of the cadastral income derived from the capital value. Therefore, the cadastral praxis commonly resorts to the indirect process deriving income from the capital value expressed by the value of the reconstruction cost. Therefore, the annual income of wind and photovoltaic power plants surveyed in the cadastral category D/ 1 is determined by multiplying the reconstruction cost of the installation by an appropriate fruitfulness rate. Based on the in-dications of the prevailing case law, the latter is assumed to be equal to 2...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a larger project {{described}} at [URL] as follows: This project draws its inspiration from two significant recent developments in law and feminist scholarship. The first has been the emergence in Canada and the UK of feminist judgment-writing projects, in which feminist academics, lawyers and activists have written alternative judgments in a series of legal cases, imagining the different decision that might have been made by a feminist judge hearing the case. The second has been the incremental shift in recent years in the number of women judges and Magistrates presiding in courts and tribunals throughout Australia. As part of this project, a group of scholars will write alternative feminist judgments. This paper is one of the alternative feminist judgements. The case used for this discussion is Lodge v Federal Commissioner of Tax [1972] HCA 49. In that case, a woman, earning income by way of commission in her occupation as a law costs clerk, which she carried out at her home, claimed to deduct from her <b>assessable</b> <b>income</b> child care fees that enabled her to devote time and attention to her work. The High Court held that no right to a deduction had arisen. It found that, although the purpose of the expenditure was for gaining <b>assessable</b> <b>income,</b> it did not take place in, or in the course of, preparing bills of cost. Further, the expenditure was of a ‘private or domestic’ nature. This seminal taxation decision, which prevents deductions for childcare, has broad financial ramifications for workers in the home and those with childcare responsibilities.
