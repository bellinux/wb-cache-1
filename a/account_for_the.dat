Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cost of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cost of fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E
