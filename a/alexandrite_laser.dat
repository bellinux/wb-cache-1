50|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2000 at the ASVAK Laser Center in Ankara, Turkey comparing <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> and electrolysis for hair removal on 12 patients concluded that laser hair removal was 60 times faster, less painful and {{more reliable than}} electrolysis. It {{is important to note}} that the type of electrolysis performed in the study was galvanic electrolysis, rather than thermolysis or a blend of the two. Galvanic current requires 30 seconds to more than a minute to release each hair whereas thermolysis or a blend can require much less. This study thus did not test the capability of all forms of modern electrolysis.|$|E

5000|$|Q-switched Alexandrite: 755 nm. The weakest {{of all the}} q-switched {{devices and}} {{somewhat}} similar to the Ruby laser in that the Alexandrite creates a red light which is highly absorbed by green and dark tattoo pigments. However, the <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> color is slightly less absorbed by melanin, so this laser has a slightly lower incidence of unwanted pigmentary changes than a ruby laser. This laser works well on green tattoos but because of its weaker peak power it works only moderately well on black and blue ink. It does not work at all (or very minimally) on red, orange, yellow, brown, etc. This laser wavelength is also available in a picosecond speed with anecdotal claims that it removes ink faster.|$|E
50|$|One small Greek {{study showed}} that the R20 method--four passes with the laser, twenty minutes apart--caused more {{breaking}} up of the ink than the conventional method without more scarring or adverse effects. However, this study was performed on a very small patient population (12 patients total), using the weakest of the QS lasers, the 755 nm <b>Alexandrite</b> <b>laser.</b> One of the other main problems with {{this study was the}} fact {{that more than half of}} the 18 tattoos removed were not professional and amateur tattoos are always easier to remove. Proof of concept studies are underway, but many laser experts advise against the R20 method using the more modern and powerful tattoo removal lasers available at most offices as an increase in adverse side effects including scarring and dischromia is likely. Patients should inquire about the laser being used if the R20 treatment method is offered by a facility as it is usually only offered by clinics that are using the weak 755 nm Alexandrite as opposed to the more powerful and versatile devices that are more commonly used. Moreover, dermatologists offering the R20 method should inform patients that it just one alternative to proven protocols and is not a gold standard treatment method to remove tattoos.|$|E

A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study was performed on 90 female subjects. The patients were divided into two groups: <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> plus 15 % licorice gel (group A) and placebo (group B). Each subject received one of both products over one side of the face, twice daily for 24 weeks on the hirsute locations. Each group underwent five sessions of <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> at 6 -week intervals.

40|$|Background and Objective Basal Cell Nevus {{syndrome}} (BCNS) {{is characterized}} by numerous basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Multiple treatments with the pulsed dye laser (PDL) have been shown, in small studies, to be effective {{for the treatment of}} superficial and nodular BCCs. Like PDL, the <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> can be vessel-selective, but has the added advantage of deeper tissue penetration. We evaluated the utility of the <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> in reducing the tumor burden in BCNS with a single treatment. Study Design/Materials and Methods A case report and review of the literature are presented. A 45 -year-old man with BCNS and a history of radiation therapy presented with an extraordinarily high tumor burden (> 250 BCCs). As a compassionate measure to reduce the tumor burden, we investigated the utility of a single treatment of the long-pulsed 755 [*]nm <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> to several BCC lesions. The treated lesions were evaluated at 2 -month and 7 -month clinical follow-up. Histopathologic analysis of a treated lesion was performed at 7 -month clinical follow-up. Results At 2 -month, and 7 -month clinical follow-up, 15 of 18 treated lesions or about 83 % of the <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> treated lesions showed a complete clinical response and appeared as hypopigmented areas with scarring. Histopathologic analysis of a treated lesion at 7 -month clinical follow-up showed no evidence of residual tumor. Conclusions The long-pulsed <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> may be helpful in significantly reducing tumor burden in difficult to manage BCNS patients with a single treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE Although the {{alexandrite}} 755 -nm-wavelength laser {{is effective}} in the treat-ment of unwanted hair, there are no published studies gauging {{the efficacy of the}} variable long-pulse <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> in the treatment of superficial pigmented lesions. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS Eighteen patients underwent a single treatment session using a variable pulse-width <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser.</b> Test sites were performed using a 10 -mm spot size and up to four pulse widths (3, 20, 40, 60 ms) with and without epidermal cooling. Full treatments were performed 3 weeks later using optimum test parameters. The patients were evaluated at 3 and 6 weeks. RESULTS Patients with darker lentigines had greater lesion clearance than those patients with lighter colored lentigines. Shorter pulse widths and treatment without cryogen cooling both, independently, lowered the fluence threshold for lentigo clearance.

The tapered diode (TD) provides up to 1. 1 W of output power and its wavelength can be finetuned to either 680. 4 nm (R 1 line) or 678. 5 nm (R 2 line) for efficient in-line pumping.
