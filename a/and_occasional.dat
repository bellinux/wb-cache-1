40|$|This general {{qualitative}} {{study examined the}} differentiated nature of short- <b>and</b> long-term <b>occasional</b> teaching. Five occasional teachers experienced in transitioning between short- <b>and</b> long-term <b>occasional</b> teaching work arrangements each completed a semi-structured interview. Findings demonstrated that the work arrangements were differentiated in three key areas: (1) General teacher expectations; (2) School interactions; and (3) Professional presence. More favourably perceived long-term occasional teaching experiences in all three areas contributed {{to the formation of}} an internal teacher workforce values hierarchy that subordinated the short-term occasional teaching work arrangement. In addition, the short- to long-term occasional teaching transition was experienced as a progressive hierarchical shift, whereas a regressive hierarchical shift marked the long- to short-term occasional teaching transition. Hierarchical differentiation among the separate short- <b>and</b> long-term <b>occasional</b> teaching workgroups was found based on the amount of accumulated work. Policy and practice implications include approaching short- <b>and</b> long-term <b>occasional</b> teaching as heterogeneous work arrangements...|$|R
