When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and was tired of being ignored as a director and having to churn out special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process.

The scope and size of the effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million for doing the film's effects and Paramount accepted.

40|$|Abstract. 1 The {{conventional}} wisdom and practice is that planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> tasks are solved separately using different methods and approaches. However, recent development in industrial planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> demands for mixing both tasks to allow modelling of wider class of problems. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present a framework for mixing planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> tasks within single system. We analyse traditional views of planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> we highlight the drawbacks of separating both tasks when applied to modelling complex process environments. We give some real-life examples where the mixed approach helps to model the problems and we propose a generic framework for such mixture. We also argue for using constraint programming as underlying solving technology and, finally, we describe some constraint models based on the proposed framework. Although, we concentrate on planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> in complex process environments we believe that the results contribute to both planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> communities in general. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> attracts an unceasing {{attention}} of computer science community. However, despite of similar character of both tasks, in most current systems planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems are solved independently using different methods. Recent development of Constraint Programming brings a new breeze to these areas. It allows {{using the same}} techniques for modelling planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems as well as exploiting successful methods developed in Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research. In the paper we analyse the problems behind planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> in complex process environments and we propose to enhance the traditional schedulers by planning capabilities to solve these problems. We argue for using dynamic models to capture such mixed planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> environment. Despite of studying the proposed framework using the complex process environment background {{we believe that the}} results are applicable in general to other (nonproduction) problem areas where mixed planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> capabilities are desirable. ...|$|R
