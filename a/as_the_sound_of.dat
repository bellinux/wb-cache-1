5|$|Born to a Pentecostal-minister father, D'Angelo {{was brought}} up to an early {{appreciation}} of gospel music, while his mother, a jazz enthusiast, {{introduced him to the}} musical complexities of trumpeter Miles Davis and the funk and soul music of the 1970s. In addition to old gospel records, these factors inspired him during the making of Brown Sugar, as D'Angelo drew upon his roots of traditional gospel and soul, and infused the sound of contemporary R and hip hop music to create a stylistically unique and soulful sound for the album. The album has been noted by critics for its classic soul elements and influences, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> live instruments and organic grooves, which are reminiscent of the work of Stevie Wonder and Sly & the Family Stone. Its production contrasts the producer-driven and digital approach of contemporary R {{at the time of its}} release.|$|E
5|$|In 1910s, London, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) {{is called}} to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a {{sapphire}} ring on its finger. Chester steals it, accidentally tipping over {{a glass of water}} which drips on the floor; she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and witnesses strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her, and the lights in her apartment go out <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the dripping water is heard from various locations. Chester finds the woman's corpse lying in her bed. It rises and floats toward her. Chester begs for forgiveness, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chester's body and calls the police. The pathologist arrives to examine the body and only finds a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor announces this observation, the concierge appears distressed and hears the dripping of water.|$|E

25|$|Jim Moray, an English folk singer, {{released}} the album 'Upcetera' in September 2016. It contains the track 'Sounds of Earth' {{in which he}} interweaves {{the stories of the}} production of the Golden Record and the romance between Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan. It refers to the recording of an EEG of Druyan as she thought of Sagan <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> someone falling in love.|$|E
25|$|It was {{eventually}} embraced, {{or at least}} accepted, by go-go fans both young and not so young. In a city that considers “swing” go-go the soundtrack of its story, this was no tiny feat. Even old-timers who deny the appeal of bounce beat understand why it exists. The brash style not only changed the way people danced and partied but became the music for {{a new chapter in}} D.C.’s story. If the swing sound carried a generation of Washingtonians through the rough ’70s and ’80s, a time when funk, jazz, and soul was a much-needed salve, bounce grounded them in the ’00s and ’10s, helped them keep their bearings at a time of shifting city demographics, when go-go’s epicenter realigned <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> black Washington, at least from the ’70s onward, was pushed to the suburbs. With its pummeling tone and tempo, bounce beat remains a perfect musical metaphor for what young people have experienced as they’ve watched their city be slowly replaced by something unrecognizable.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the {{releases}} of older Hollywood musicals such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> Music, My Fair Lady, and West Side Story, Dreamgirls debuted with three special ten-day roadshow engagements beginning on December 15, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles, and the AMC Metreon 15 in San Francisco. Tickets for the reserved seats were $25 each; the premium price included a forty-eight page full-color {{program and a}} limited-print lithograph. This release made Dreamgirls the first American feature film to have a roadshow release since Man of La Mancha in 1972. Dreamgirls earned a total of $851,664 from the roadshow engagements, playing to sold-out houses on the weekends. The film's national release, at regular prices, began on December 25. Outside of the U.S., Dreamgirls opened in Australia on January 18, and in the United Kingdom on February 2. Releases in other countries began on various dates between January and early March. Dreamgirls eventually grossed $103 million in North America, and almost $155 million worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Biff {{leaves the}} {{restaurant}} in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy has picked up. They leave a confused and upset Willy {{behind in the}} restaurant. When they later return home, their mother angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries unsuccessfully to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father {{that he is not}} meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The feud reaches an apparent climax with Biff hugging Willy and crying as he tries to get Willy {{to let go of the}} unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed (despite her urging him to follow her), lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he sees his long-dead brother Ben, whom Willy idolized. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house. Biff and Linda cry out in despair <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> Willy's car blares up and fades out.|$|E
500|$|The premiere, on September 23, 1962, [...] "sent {{shock waves}} {{through the world}} of music," [...] {{according}} to Alexander J. Morin, with a reaction by the initial audience, according to Taruskin, of near-silence and incomprehension. Copland noted that the general impression [...] "was that the premiere was not a congenial circumstance," [...] with the music not considered important <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the new concert hall. His effort to present something not bland or traditional for such an occasion and distinguished audience [...] "was not appreciated at the time." [...] Also, Taruskin states, Copland had become an emblem of success {{in the eyes of}} the American public. The fact he had written a twelve-tone composition for such an occasion seemed a repudiation of the audience he had won through years of hard effort.|$|E
500|$|Pirate radio {{stations}} {{played a major}} role in blurring reggae and soul in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970 Radio Invicta, Europe's first Soul station began broadcasting from and to South London, for one hour Monday to Friday, <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> Midnight Soul. These broadcasts were soon expanded to Bank Holidays, and then every Sunday on 92.4fm in Stereo. Radio Invicta launched the radio careers of Steve Marshall, Steve Walsh, Pete Tong, Giles Peterson, and many others. The pirate radio station London Weekend Radio (LWR) became the home of hip hop and Tim Westwood, who pioneered LWR, recruited members for the British chapter of the Zulu Nation through the pirate radio station. [...] During that time, JFM, founded by former Radio Jackie DJ Brian Anthony, and Horizon FM broadcast soul and jazz-funk.|$|E

500|$|According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, {{the song}} is {{influenced}} by the Sly and the Family Stone track [...] "Family Affair" [...] (1971). It starts <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> slap bass plays along with sequenced synth bass, as Madonna sings the opening lines, [...] "Keep, keep it together, keep people together forever and ever". As the first verse starts, a guitar comes into play with Madonna's voice being backed by percussion and banjo. After the second chorus comes near the end, Madonna utters the line [...] "Brothers and sisters, They hold the key, To your heart and your soul, Don't forget that your family is gold", the percussion sound is thinned out and a mixture of the sound from a live drummer and conga comes into the picture. The song ends with the main groove sound gradually fading out.|$|E
500|$|Hodgy reappears on [...] "Snow White", {{featuring}} more singing from Ocean. Hodgy Beats raps at a {{very fast}} rate, centered on an intense beat. The 10th track is [...] "Rella", where Tyler boasts about taking “three pills of Extenzo” to cure his erectile dysfunction, in a flow similar to rapper Eminem. [...] The production was handled by Left Brain, with elements of electronic music, sounding like [...] "something out of a Donkey Kong Country level." [...] MellowHype and Taco contemplate the issues of having not having an ideal woman on [...] "Real Bitch". The track was written to be purposely offensive, with the two rappers trading verses on what reviewers described as an atmospheric, [...] "slow-jam" [...] beat. [...] "P" [...] features a bass-driven beat influence by post-grunge, with Tyler rapping in the vein of the Wu-Tang Clan.

500|$|This England {{received}} positive critical reception. David Patrick Stearns of Philadelphia Daily News {{awarded the}} album 3.5 out of 4 stars and, also {{referring to the}} success of Music for a Time of War, wrote that the repertoire has [...] "perfectly wide appeal, especially in vital, muscular performances such as these". Stearns, who appreciated Kalmar's balance of technicality and the music's [...] "exterior atmosphere", called the performances [...] "thoughtful" [...] and [...] "incisive". He also noted the originality of the interludes and [...] "Passacaglia" [...] from Peter Grimes, claiming they [...] "won't be mistaken for anybody else's." [...] In his review for The Huffington Post, Brian Horay wrote that the orchestra delivered [...] "knockout" [...] and [...] "beefy-yet-restrained" [...] performances of the Peter Grimes compositions. Referring to This England and its preceding album, which featured Sinfonia da Requiem, Horay said the recordings [...] "showcase Kalmar and his band as supreme interpreters of Benjamin Britten's amazingly colorful brand of orchestral anxiety, inviting the listener to delve ever deeper into painful, yet rewarding, symphonic ambivalence." [...] Classical CD Review's Robert Benson called the Elgar performance [...] "brilliant" [...] and appreciated that [...] "Passacaglia" [...] was programmed before [...] "The Storm". Benson complimented Kalmar (calling him a [...] "conductor to watch") as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the recording, describing it as [...] "well-balanced orchestral sound, with a wide dynamic range". He noted the lack of audience interference with the sound and assured audiophiles that they would appreciate the quality. Steven Ritter of Audiophile Audition wrote that the Symphony performed [...] "with a brilliance and verve equal to any on record" [...] and were [...] "entirely attuned to the 'English' idiom". Ritter complimented Kalmar and the orchestra for the performances, saying [...] "Who knew Oregon could sound like this? PentaTone should hold on to this bunch as long as they can, and explore as much repertory as they can handle. Great sound, performances, and production!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Although [...] "Sleigh Ride" [...] {{is often}} {{associated}} with Christmas, and appears on Christmas compilation albums, the song's lyrics mention no holiday or religion (apart from certain recordings, such as those by the Carpenters, Walter Schumann and Air Supply, that substitute [...] "Christmas party" [...] for [...] "birthday party" [...] in the song's bridge). The song is noted for the sound of the horses' clip-clopping, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the whips used to get the horses moving.
