25|$|Traditionally the {{guillotines}} were {{manually operated}} by turning a large wheel some 150 times to raise or lower the gate; since the locks {{have to be}} left empty this operation will <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be done twice to pass through. In recent years the Environment Agency, who are the navigation authority for the river, have been installing electric operation of the guillotines {{and in some cases}} replacing them altogether with mitre gates.|$|E
25|$|Zakāt is a {{compulsory}} charity in Islam but it {{does not}} <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be in terms of financial means. Taiwanese Muslims from the Taipei Grand Mosque often visit foreign workers under detention in Sanxia, Yunlin and other detention centers for usually overstaying their employment visa. The Muslims help them with their paperwork and other needs. Other Taiwanese Muslims visit the elderly, ill and poor in the community.|$|E

25|$|In {{the lower}} middle school pupils start school at 8:00 AM and finish at 2:00PM (Although {{they can start}} later, they <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> attend school {{for at least five}} hours, with some {{differences}} based on the days they attend), while for high school, depending on the school, they attend school 5 to 7 hours a day based {{on the day of the}} week and the exact choice of school.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the church's construction, West Somers was a {{thriving}} agricultural community. Burials had begun in the cemetery almost a decade earlier; most of the area's congregants attended the established Mount Zion Methodist Church some distance away. One of West Somers's more prominent residents built the church so his neighbors would not <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel so far; it was so small that circus pioneer Hachaliah Bailey, also a Somers resident, likened it to a tiger's cage.|$|E
25|$|Muslims in Taiwan {{observe the}} fasting during the Islamic month of Ramadan. In general, they face no problem {{regarding}} practicing the rituals in Taiwan. The only problem faced by {{them is to}} <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reject politely any lunch invitation from their Taiwanese colleagues during the day. Local Taiwanese might wonder as well when some of their Muslim neighbors wake up really {{early in the morning}} to cook their suhoor, meal eaten before they start their fast.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} only highly skilled workers that can enjoy such benefits as written in their contracts, although many professional fields {{would not go}} so far as to discourage workaholic behaviour. Unskilled workers will almost <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> rely on bare minimum legal requirements. The legal requirements are low in many countries, in particular, the United States. In contrast, the European Union has gone quite far in assuring a legal work–life balance framework, for example pertaining to parental leave and the non-discrimination of part-time workers.|$|E
25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep that in mind.|$|E
25|$|Renewable energy doesn't <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{come from}} a {{developing}} country. The Developing Areas Study Group session {{is a group of}} speakers from all over the energy businesses discuss the potential ideas to get developing countries the renewable energy that they need. Papers written by W. Morgan, R. Moss and P. Richard discuss the opportunities of renewable resources that lie within the developing country as well. Morgan and Richard claim firewood and agriculture could play a great role in an alternative energy solution in developing countries, while Richards claims that efficient use of agriculture could lead to renewable energy. Morgan also points out that green plants could play a great role in producing synthetic fuel alcohol, which would not only impact the developing country, but {{the world as a whole}} in providing an alternative fuel source.|$|E

25|$|Ferguson's {{research}} {{opened the}} way for many of the achievements of the Celtic Revival, especially those of Yeats and Douglas Hyde, but this narrative of Irish poetry which leads to the Revival as culmination can also be deceptive and occlude important poetry, such as the work of James Henry (17981876), medical doctor, Virgil scholar and poet. His large body of work was completely overlooked until Christopher Ricks included him in two anthologies, and eventually edited a selection of his poetry. Various in his means, cosmopolitan in his range and possessed of an acute wit, Henry shows the negative force of nationalism in Irish criticism: his omission from standard accounts and anthologies for over 100 years can only be due to his blithe disregard of the matter of Ireland. 'Irish poetry', James's example suggests, does not <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be about Ireland.|$|E
500|$|Erin Aubry Kaplan {{writes on}} Salon.com that the {{question}} posed by the film is how to assess the [...] "hopeless story of a ghetto teen... in the Age of Obama." [...] She {{goes on to say}} that [...] "'Precious' proves you don't <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose between artistic and commercial success; the film's first opening weekend was record-breaking. It's a sign how much we needed to tell this story. And, perhaps, how many stories there are left to tell." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the scene}} where the boys are talking to Chef, he leaves without {{answering}} the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, [...] "Dammit, children, why do I <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{be the one to}} explain all this stuff to you. Ask your parents for once!". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are trying to think of what {{is the most important thing}} for a man, Cartman says [...] "Ham?", to which Stan angrily replies, [...] "No, not ham, you fat fuck!". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in The Spirit of Christmas, the 1995 short film that was the precursor to South Park.|$|E

500|$|According to Ocean, {{the music}} video for [...] "Novacane" [...] {{was a simple}} process. Talking about {{the concept of the}} video, he stated [...] "I was just trying to connect or {{articulate}} visually the feeling of being numb. The feeling of wanting to feel something you can't feel. A lot of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic {{and a little bit of}} special effects." [...] The video doesn't last the entirety of the song, which director Nabil Elderkin stated was for artistic reasons. In an interview with Pitchfork, he reasoned [...] "to me, videos don't <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be the length of the song. I like the idea of people thinking, 'What was that?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Thatcher {{refused to}} meet the union's demands and {{compared}} the miners' dispute to the Falklands conflict, declaring {{in a speech in}} 1984: [...] "We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands. We <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be aware of the enemy within, which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty." [...] After a year out on strike, in March 1985 the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The cost to the economy was estimated to be at least £1.5billion, and the strike was blamed for much of the pound's fall against the US dollar. The government closed 25unprofitable coal mines in 1985, and by 1992 a total of 97 mines had been closed; those that remained were privatised in 1994.|$|E
500|$|The plot of Rob-B-Hood {{received}} mixed reviews: The Chinese newspaper Xiao Xiang Chen Bao {{found it}} concise, hilarious and touching, whereas Jay Weissberg criticised it for being unoriginal. In addition, Felix Cheong of Channel NewsAsia found the subplots involving the antagonists' families redundant, detracting {{from the main}} story and making the film [...] "tediously long". However, Chan was praised for his decision to play a darker character in Rob-B-Hood. Andrew Sun of South China Morning Post stated that [...] "one {{of the best things}} Chan can do for his flagging movie career is to play a heavy—a nasty, scum-of-the-earth antagonist, since you do not <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play a hero to be a hero." [...] Sun emphasised the need for Chan to show flexibility in his roles, citing a number of actors that have thrived by playing the occasional villain.|$|E

500|$|In {{retrospective}} reviews, critics saw {{the series}} as {{similar to the}} Scooby-Doo franchise. Aubrey Sitterson of Geek.com included Speed Buggy on their unranked list of [...] "favorite Scooby-Doo knockoffs". He noted similarities between Speedy and Scooby-Doo's [...] "Mystery Machine", and joked that Tinker is [...] "basically just Shaggy in a jumpsuit". However, he hinted that Speed Buggys success could have been derived from its shared storylines as seen on Josie & the Pussycats. Similarly, Harris from The A.V. Club agreed and wrote that {{the main difference between}} the two shows was that Speed Buggy [...] "substitut racing for rock 'n' roll". He also claimed that the main character [...] "confirm that sidekicks don't <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be animals". Speed Buggy and the Scooby-Doo gang would be featured in a crossover episode ("The Weird Winds of Winona") in the second installment of the Scooby-Doo franchise, The New Scooby-Doo Movies (1972-1973).|$|E
500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that you <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
500|$|The first single, [...] "Heroin", was {{accompanied}} {{with the most}} music videos, {{with a total of}} five for several different remixed versions of the cover. Each was a [...] "Blendo" [...] video which rapidly shifted random imagery and colours in time with the music. Four of the music videos for the song were directed by Brett Leonard, with a fifth being credited to Howard Deutch. Each used stock footage shot by Idol and Leonard, filmed personally and edited on Idol's computer. Idol did so with the intention of sending a [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] message that mocked and rejected the standards of MTV music video creation. [...] "We did it all on camcorder and we sort of wanted to say {{you can make your own}} videos, and you don't <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it in a very MTV way." [...] None were released for rotation on television; instead, one was included in the video album release, Cyberpunk: Shock to the System.|$|E
