40|$|Introduction: Multileaf {{collimator}} (MLC) is {{state of}} the art among the radiation field shaping systems for conformal radiotherapy techniques. Some advantages of this system are as follow: reduction of treatment time, higher precision in conforming the radiation field to the projection of the target volume and lowering the chance of errors made by technologists. The purpose of this research was to design and construct the mechanical section of a prototype MLC.   Material and Methods: The MLC consists of a base plate, 52 leaves, 2 leaf carriages, 2 nuts and 52 triangular thread screws. The leaves are arranged in two opposing banks each containing 26 leaves. The carriages are used to extend the movement of the leaves. The components of the MLC are fabricated by machining processes. The MLC is designed to be mounted on the conventional linear accelerators as an add-on accessory. The leaves were made of aluminum. The dimensions of the leaves are 5 x 200 x 50 mm.   Result: The collimator system weighs approximately 37 kg excluding the leaves. The projected width of each leaf on the isocenter of a Varian linear accelerator is 10 mm. The movement of the leaves is accomplished by using the triangular thread screws. The screws required to have a low <b>axial</b> <b>backlash</b> which in turn results in lower precision positioning of the leaves. The positioning accuracy of each leaf is approximately 1. 4 mm. Discussion and Conclusion: Mashhad MLC system, in it’s present form and design weighs 37 kg. but if Aluminum blades are replaced by tungsten ones then the over all weights of MLC may exceed the weight limit a linac may hold. Therefore futher modifications are required to reduce the MLC total weight. It is desirable to use ball screws and roller cages instead of triangular thread screws to achive a higher positioning pereision of the blade...|$|E
40|$|Planetary roller drives (PRD) with <b>axial</b> <b>backlash</b> {{have the}} highest load {{capacity}} amongst the prospective roller drives. PRD consists of a screw and a nut, between which thread rolls are installed in separators, force calculation of which is sufficient to assess the PRD force loading. For several reasons, the load is unevenly distributed between the roll turns operating with the screw and nut turns. These include rollers size variation by the average diameter of their thread, PRD parts' thread manufacturing errors, primarily thread pitch errors, and other reasons. The article discusses one of them – a special feature of thread roll loading. If we neglect the circumferential forces due to their smallness, then the roll's turns mating with the nut along one of the roll's generatrices and the roll turns mating with the screw along the opposite generatrix will be loaded with axial and radial forces. Since the PRD parts thread turn flank angle is symmetrical and equal to 90 °, then the radial force {{is equal to the}} axial one on each turn. If we sum the axial forces on the mating roll turns along one of the generatrices, then from the equation of equilibrium one gets that the sum vector value is equal to the sum vector value along the other roll generatrix. Here the sum vectors will have the opposite direction, and the arm between them equals to the average roll thread diameter. Multiplying the sum vector modulus by that arm, one gets the roll overturning moment that does not depend on the distribution of the axial forces along the roll axis. This moment is the cause of uneven load distribution between the roll turns mating with the nut and the screw. The overturning moment can be balanced on the two forming roll generatrices only by radial forces, distribution of which along the roll axis will be uneven. The PRD parts thread turns load distribution irregularity factor is introduced as the ratio of the maximum force acting on the most loaded roll turn to a nominal force. It is determined in the example that the value of this factor is equal to 1. 454 or 45. 4 %, i. e. the influence of the PRD roll loading characteristics on the drive threaded parts turns loading irregularity is strong...|$|E
40|$|Minimising {{noise is}} {{becoming}} an increasingly important factor in motor vehicle development. The im-portance of this development goal is increasing with rising customer expectations and increasingly stringent legal restrictions on noise emissions. The cause of rattling and clattering noise is torsional vibration of transmission components that are not under load, that move backwards and forwards within their func-tional clearances. This noise is perceived as distinct from other sources of noise, and is intrusive because of its undesirable character. The transmission parameters <b>backlash,</b> <b>axial</b> clearance and main centre distance were varied by experimental analyses in test stand trials, showing the eect on propensity to rattle and clat-ter. By optimising these parameters, {{it was possible to}} minimise the rattling and clattering noise. Measures internal to the transmission to reduce loose part vibration in vehicle transmissions were also considered. The calculated noise level with the EKM-Simulation program correlates with the measured noise level. Parame-ter studies with the EKM-Simulation program, which contains all relevant parameters for the excitation of rattling noise caused by idle gears, shows the signicant parameters for the investigated transmissions...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the matter of {{powertrain}} vibration reduction, focusing on the transmission. These units, depending on the purpose of utilization, consist of {{a high number of}} dimensionally complex components. These need to possess features, selected already in the design phase, which would guarantee smooth and quiet operation. A properly designed tooth profile and the related specified accuracy of manufacturing {{are one of the most}} important features. The basic function and the purpose of transmissions application indicate a relatively wide range of operating speeds and transmitted loads. Moreover, combination of both loading with improperly designed string’s parameter can cause a number of various problems. The vibration initiation with related noise from gear mesh belong to the most significant sources of issues. There are multiple mechanisms of oscillation initiation. Even when using the latest trends in the development of teeth, when their shape is upgraded and developed to meet specifically given load range, the above mentioned irregularity of transferred torque cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, it is necessary, already in the design phase, to eliminate the transmission paths by which are vibrations transmitting to other components. People perceive this action in the form of vibration, noise, or temperature change in the surroundings. With the increasing comfort levels and number of produced vehicles the reduction of vibration and noise of machinery parts becomes stricter, including gears. The experimental approach is primarily used to assess the accuracy of designed gearboxes, but it is a very expensive and a time consuming method. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a process that utilizes both numerical simulation and experimental approach but also combines the advantages of both, particularly time and cost savings and comparability of results. For this purpose, the experimental gearbox is designed and manufactured including the single-stage gear enabling variable configurations in terms of the ratio change. The gearbox is subjected to numerical simulation of different complexity levels, as well as technical experiment. Furthermore, the universal virtual prototype in Multi-Body System ADAMS is created, which reflects the impact of several key parameters for proper functionality, such as <b>axial</b> distance, <b>backlash,</b> gear mesh stiffness, shaft mounting stiffness (bearings) and modal properties of the shafts and gearbox housing. Last but not least, the impact of imbalance or irregularity of input shaft speed is incorporated. The last part focuses on a brief description of the application of the presented methodology – modelling of vibrations on the tractor gearbox...|$|R
