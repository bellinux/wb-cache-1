5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
2500|$|Exposure to the {{brightness}} of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding goggles and helmets with dark face plates—much darker than those in sunglasses or oxy-fuel goggles—are worn to prevent this exposure. In recent years, new helmet models have been produced featuring <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> which automatically self-darkens electronically. To protect bystanders, transparent welding curtains often surround the welding area.

2500|$|The Hopewell {{created some}} of the finest craftwork and artwork of the Americas. Most of their works had some {{religious}} significance, and their graves were filled with necklaces, ornate carvings made from bone or wood, decorated ceremonial pottery, ear plugs, and pendants. Some graves were lined with woven mats, mica (a mineral consisting of thin glassy sheets), or stones. The Hopewell produced artwork in a greater variety and with more exotic materials than their predecessors the Adena. Grizzly bear teeth, fresh water pearls, sea shells, sharks' teeth, copper and even small quantities of silver were turned into beautifully crafted pieces. The Hopewell artisans were expert carvers of pipestone, and many of the mortuary mounds are full of exquisitely carved statues and pipes. The Mound of Pipes at Mound City produced over 200 stone smoking pipes depicting animals and birds in well-realized three-dimensional form, and the Tremper Site in Scioto County produced over 130. Some artwork went beyond the ordinary exotic, as Hopewell artists were expert carvers of human bone. A rare mask from Mound City was created using a human skull as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{wallpaper}} steamer is an electrical device which boils water continuously {{in order to}} produce steam. This steam is then allowed to pass through a narrow bore tube to <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate.</b> This face plate is then held against a wallpapered wall. The steam passes through the paper, saturates the backing paper and partially dissolves the desiccated wallpaper paste. This then allows the wallpaper to be pulled from, or scraped off the wall.|$|E

50|$|A {{strike plate}} is a metal plate affixed to a doorjamb {{with a hole}} or holes for the bolt of the door. When the door is closed, the bolt extends into {{the hole in the}} strike plate and holds the door closed. The strike plate protects the jamb against {{friction}} from the bolt and increases security {{in the case of a}} jamb made of a softer material (such as wood) than the strike plate. A plate on the lockset itself (on the door, not the jamb) is instead called <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

5000|$|MT-RJ (Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack) uses a {{form factor}} and latch {{similar to the}} 8P8C (RJ45) connectors. Two {{separate}} fibers are included in one unified connector. It is easier to terminate and install than ST or SC connectors. The smaller size allows twice the port density on <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> than ST or SC connectors do. The MT-RJ connector was designed by AMP, but was later standardized as FOCIS 12 (Fiber Optic Connector Intermateability Standards) in EIA/TIA-604-12. There are two variations: pinned and no-pin. The pinned variety, which has two small stainless steel guide pins {{on the face of}} the connector, is used in patch panels to mate with the no-pin connectors on MT-RJ patch cords.|$|E
50|$|Tiles under {{compression}} suffer {{far less}} from impacts; {{in their case}} it can be advantageous to have <b>a</b> metal <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> bringing the tile also under perpendicular compression.

In this design the module is affixed {{by a single}} diagonally inclined mounting flange, together with a protuberance (ramp) on the opposite side. In the patent description, it is stated that [...] "the jack assembly may be mounted to <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> by first inserting {{the bottom of the}} jack assembly into a jack opening until the ramp of the housing engages a mounting surface of the face plate. The jack assembly is then rotated and snapped into place due to deflection of the cantilever latch of the housing." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 17 January 2008, a British Airways Boeing 777-236ER, {{operating}} as BA038 from Beijing to London, crash-landed at Heathrow after both Trent 800 engines lost power during the aircraft's final approach. The subsequent investigation found that ice {{released from the}} fuel system had accumulated on the fuel-oil heat exchanger, leading to a restriction of fuel flow to the engines. [...] This resulted in Airworthiness Directives mandating {{the replacement of the}} heat exchanger. [...] This order was extended to the 500 and 700 series engines after a similar loss of power was observed on one engine of an Airbus A330 in one incident, and both engines in another. The modification involves replacing <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> with many small protruding tubes with one that is flat.|$|E
5000|$|Antenna types vary {{depending}} on location; an urban area with nearby transmitters will require a smaller antenna than a rural site with distant stations. The antenna is often mounted outdoors on the roof or a tower. A coaxial or twinlead cable is run from the antenna to the location where the television is located. One common type of cable is designated RG-6 Tri-shield or quad-shield cable. The cable is terminated on a television outlets, typically an F connector mounted on <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate.</b> If there are multiple outlets, an RF splitter is used to divide the signal among them; outlets on the splitter are connected to television outlets at each location (living room, rec room, bedrooms, den, for example). RF splitters come with different types; some include amplifiers for multiple outlets.|$|E

5000|$|Bumblebee {{is one of}} {{the main}} group of Autobots in the 2010 computer-animated series Transformers: Prime. Bumblebee is younger than most of the Autobots, and lost his voice box thanks to Megatron during the Great War. Bumblebee remains more playful than the other Autobots despite his lack of voice, and has come to rely on his speed as his most {{valuable}} asset in battle. Bumblebee is extremely similar to his movie counterpart, sharing similar vehicle and robot forms, the same lack of voice, and his close relationship to a human boy. It is also revealed in the series finale episode [...] "Deadlock" [...] that Bumblebee's mouth was covered by <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> vaguely resembling that of Optimus Prime's that helped him to create the alternative beeping noises he uses as his main form of communication throughout the series. Later in the series he changes his color scheme by reversing the colors, resembling Bumblebee's original 1967 paint scheme in the 2014 Age of Extinction film.|$|E

50|$|Armor in India can {{be found}} dating back to 500 BC and Vedic literature; there are several {{different}} types: leather and fabric, scale, brigandine, lamellar, mail, plate, and a combination of mail and plate. In Arms and Armour: Traditional Weapons of India it is read that the wrastrana, a breast plate, has been in use since prehistoric times though the most popular is the char-aina meaning four mirrors is a coat of mail overlaid with four elaborately designed plates. The helmets consisted of a sliding nose guard {{with a piece of}} chainmail hanging from it designed to protect the neck and shoulders. Armor was not just limited to human soldiers but extended to their horses and elephants as well. The horse armor was made up of mail and plates or lamellae which covered the neck, chest, and hindquarters underneath which was some form of padding to keep it in place while <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> protected the animal’s face. The elephants, used as a battering ram or to break and trample enemy lines, were also donned in armor for battle. The elephant's head was covered by a steel mask and covered half of the trunk while the throat and sides were protected by lamellae armor while the tusks were tipped with sharp metal.|$|E
25|$|A socket may be {{surrounded}} by a decorative or protective cover called <b>a</b> wall <b>plate,</b> <b>face</b> <b>plate,</b> outlet cover, socket cover, or wall cover. In some designs this is an integral piece with the socket itself, bought and installed as a single unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} at the time used a slot in the metal to lock the ring to a jewel. Other features included <b>a</b> decorated <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> and <b>a</b> triangular cross-section.
