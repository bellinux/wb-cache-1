5|$|<b>Antibody</b> and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between <b>antibody</b> and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means {{it is possible for}} an <b>antibody</b> to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} <b>antibodies</b> {{were used}} in this study: mouse monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> against β-actin (Sigma); Rabbit polyclonal <b>antibodies</b> against Sp 1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse monoclonal [Ubi- 1] <b>antibodies</b> against Ubiquitin (Abcam), the rabbit polyclonal <b>antibodies</b> against HA (Abcam), the mouse monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> against GFP (Abcam), mouse anti-RH (Qiagen), the mouse monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> against FLAG (sigma), the rabbit monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> against SUMO 2 / 3 (Cell Signaling Technology), normal rabbit IgG (CST), the rabbit polyclonal <b>antibodies</b> against RNF 4 (Abgent), and the rabbit polyclonal <b>antibodies</b> against SENP 3 (Protein Techgroup).|$|R
50|$|If {{all these}} <b>antibodies</b> are negative, {{then it should}} be {{determined}} anti-DGP <b>antibodies</b> (<b>antibodies</b> against deamidated gliadin peptides). IgG class anti-DGP <b>antibodies</b> {{may be useful in}} people with IgA deficiency. In children younger than two years, anti-DGP <b>antibodies</b> perform better than anti-endomysial and anti-transglutaminase <b>antibodies</b> tests.|$|R
50|$|Antigenic Source: VGKC-complex <b>antibodies</b> {{were present}} in 23 of 29 (79%), CASPR2, LGI1 <b>antibodies,</b> or both, CASPR2 <b>antibodies</b> were {{generally}} higher titer than LGI1 <b>antibodies</b> and associated with thymoma. LGI1 <b>antibodies</b> were associated with serum hyponatremia.|$|R
5|$|<b>Antibody</b> genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the <b>antibody</b> that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single <b>antibody</b> {{to be used by}} different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antibody</b> mimetics are organic {{compounds}} that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered <b>antibody</b> mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, <b>antibody</b> fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. <b>Antibody</b> mimetics {{such as the}} Affimer and the DARPin have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for <b>antibody</b> screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for <b>antibody</b> screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5000|$|Dermatomyositis is {{associated}} with autoantibodies, especially antinuclear <b>antibodies</b> (ANA). [...] Around 80% of people with DM test positive for ANA and around 30% of people have myositis-specific autoantibodies which include <b>antibodies</b> to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (anti-synthetase <b>antibodies),</b> including <b>antibodies</b> against Histidine—tRNA ligase (also called Jo-1); <b>antibodies</b> to signal recognition particle (SRP); and anti-Mi-2 <b>antibodies.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> against {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) was investigated in sera from 73 HIV- 1 seropositive subjects at different clinical stages. Virus neutralization was measured as survival of MT- 4 cells in a 6 - 7 day microassay. Sixty-three sera were also tested for <b>antibodies</b> inducing virus-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> were found in 59 % of sera tested, the positivity rate being 50 % (9 / 17) in asymptomatic subjects, 67 % (12 / 18) in patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and 54 % (14 / 26) in AIDS patients (not significant differences). ADCC <b>antibodies</b> were present in 43 % of the sera. Neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> and ADCC-inducing <b>antibodies</b> were found simultaneously in 35 % (22 / 63) of the sera. Neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> alone were found in 22 % (14 / 63) and ADCC <b>antibodies</b> alone in 6 % (4 / 63) of the sera tested. Thirty-seven per cent (23 / 63) of the sera were negative for both types of <b>antibodies,</b> 62 % of the sera with neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> also had ADCC inducing <b>antibodies</b> and 85 % of the sera with ADCC <b>antibodies</b> had neutralizing <b>antibodies.</b> The titres of ADCC <b>antibodies</b> were {{higher than those of}} neutralizing <b>antibodies.</b> Thus, the {{presence of}} ADCC <b>antibodies</b> was related to the presence of neutralizing <b>antibodies,</b> but no correlation was found between the titres of these <b>antibodies</b> in sera positive for both activities...|$|R
40|$|Anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> {{have been}} raised against <b>antibodies</b> to retinol-binding protein (RBP) and to insulin. After {{absorption}} the anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> recognized the antigen-combining sites of the <b>antibodies</b> used as the immunogen but of no other <b>antibodies.</b> Some of the anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> raised against <b>antibodies</b> to RBP bound specifically to rat intestine epithelial cells, which have a physiological cell-surface receptor for RBP. The RBP receptor mediates the uptake of retinol from RBP to the cells. This uptake was abolished in a concentration-dependent manner by the anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies,</b> which obviously competed with RBP for binding to the receptor...|$|R

5|$|Icos {{manufactured}} many antibodies {{for various}} companies. In August2001, the company partnered with Seattle Genetics to manufacture {{a component of}} their top experimental <b>antibody</b> drug SGN-15. In November2001, Icos signed a production agreement with GPC Biotech to manufacture a class of GPC's antibodies that targeted B-cell lymphomas. In January2002, Icos {{signed an agreement with}} Eos Biotechnology, under which Icos would produce Eos's most promising monoclonal <b>antibody</b> candidate, and Eos would have non-exclusive rights to Icos's CHEF1 enhanced mammalian protein production technology. Eos's <b>antibody</b> inhibited angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and was being researched as a treatment for solid tumors. In October2003, Icos partnered with Protein Design Labs to manufacture their M200 <b>antibody.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>antibodies</b> {{used for}} {{specific}} detection can be polyclonal or monoclonal. Polyclonal <b>antibodies</b> {{are made by}} injecting animals with the protein of interest, or a peptide fragment and, after a secondary immune response is stimulated, isolating <b>antibodies</b> from whole serum. Thus, polyclonal <b>antibodies</b> are a heterogeneous mix of <b>antibodies</b> that recognize several epitopes. Monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> are made by injecting the animal and then taking a specific sample of immune tissue, isolating a parent cell, and using the resulting immortalized line to create <b>antibodies.</b> This causes the <b>antibodies</b> to show specificity for a single epitope.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{monoclonal}} <b>antibodies</b> {{in medicine}} for in-vivo diagnostic methods and for therapeutic purposes will {{increase in the}} future. Although monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> possess a high specificity, the animal origin of these <b>antibodies</b> remains a problem. Repeated administration of animal monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> (in vivo) may induce the formation of human <b>antibodies</b> against these monoclonal <b>antibodies.</b> Because animal monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> are also used in laboratory assays (in vitro), the presence of human <b>antibodies</b> against these animal monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> may cause spuriously elevated or depressed results of these assays. The clinician should be alert to this possibility. A case history is presented to demonstrate the problem...|$|R
50|$|Anti-thyroid autoantibodies (or simply anti-thyroid <b>antibodies)</b> are autoantibodies {{targeted}} {{against one}} or more components on the thyroid. The most clinically relevant anti-thyroid autoantibodies are anti-thyroid peroxidase <b>antibodies</b> (anti-TPO <b>antibodies),</b> thyrotropin receptor <b>antibodies</b> (TRAbs) and thyroglobulin <b>antibodies.</b> TRAbs are subdivided into activating, blocking and neutral <b>antibodies,</b> depending on their effect on the TSH receptor. Anti-sodium/Iodide (Anti-Na+/I−) symporter <b>antibodies</b> are a more recent discovery and their clinical relevance is still unknown. Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis are commonly associated {{with the presence of}} anti-thyroid autoantibodies. Although there is overlap, anti-TPO <b>antibodies</b> are most commonly associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and activating TRAbs are most commonly associated with Graves' disease. Thyroid microsomal <b>antibodies</b> were a group of anti-thyroid <b>antibodies,</b> they were renamed after the identification of their target antigen (TPO).|$|R
5|$|In contrast, the B cell antigen-specific {{receptor}} is an <b>antibody</b> molecule on the B cell surface, and recognizes whole pathogens {{without any}} need for antigen processing. Each lineage of B cell expresses a different <b>antibody,</b> so the complete set of B cell antigen receptors represent all the antibodies that the body can manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Most people {{infected}} with HIV develop specific antibodies (i.e. seroconvert) within three to twelve {{weeks of the}} initial infection. Diagnosis of primary HIV before seroconversion is done by measuring HIV-RNA or p24 antigen. Positive results obtained by <b>antibody</b> or PCR testing are confirmed either by a different <b>antibody</b> or by PCR.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} tests (NAATs), direct fluorescein tests (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are highly}} sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present. Serology testing for antibodies {{is not as}} useful since {{the presence of the}} microorganisms in healthy people can confound interpreting the <b>antibody</b> titer levels, although <b>antibody</b> levels can indicate whether an infection is recent or long-term.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} explore idiotypic, anti-idiotypic, and anti-anti-idiotypic {{responses}} to allergens, BALB/c mice were immunized with affinity- purified human idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> directed against a highly purified shrimp allergen. This {{resulted in the}} production of anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> which were quantitated by using rabbit idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> raised against the same purified allergen. The mouse anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> recognized shrimp-specific human idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> of the IgE isotype from 18 of 20 individuals, and IgG <b>antibodies</b> from 14 of 20 shrimp-sensitive patients. Immunization of BALB/c mice with affinity- purified, allergen-specific anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> induced anti- allergen IgE and IgG responses {{in the absence of the}} allergen. This paper thus presents evidence that anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> raised against allergen-specific idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> may substitute for the original allergen in the induction of allergen-specific idiotypic <b>antibodies.</b> The demonstration of shared idiotopes on IgG and IgE <b>antibodies</b> in the sera of shrimp-sensitive patients supports the use of allergen-specific anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> as surrogate allergens...|$|R
50|$|Autoantibodies to {{the thyroid}} gland may be {{detected}} in various disease states.

5|$|Some {{parts of}} an <b>antibody</b> {{have the same}} functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind to antigens (in general, identical) and, therefore, {{recognize}} specific foreign objects. This region of the <b>antibody</b> is called the Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the <b>antibody.</b>|$|E

5|$|The stem -mab is {{used for}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{as well as for}} their fragments, as long as at least one variable domain (the domain that contains the target binding structure) is included. This is the case for antigen binding fragments and single-chain variable fragments, among other artificial proteins. Other <b>antibody</b> parts (such as Fc regions) and <b>antibody</b> mimetics use different naming schemes.|$|E
5|$|The substem {{preceding}} {{the source of}} the <b>antibody</b> refers to the medicine's target. Examples of targets are tumors, organ systems like the circulatory system, or infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. The term target does not imply what sort of action the <b>antibody</b> exerts. Therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic agents are not distinguished by this nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the general}} {{structure}} of all antibodies is very similar, a small region {{at the tip}} of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of <b>antibody</b> paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of <b>antibody</b> paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the <b>antibody</b> gene, which create further diversity. This recombinational process that produces clonal <b>antibody</b> paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the <b>antibody</b> paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during <b>antibody</b> production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.|$|E
40|$|Conventional rabbit antiidiotypic <b>antibodies</b> {{were raised}} against a private rabbit anti-tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) idiotype. These rabbit antiidiotypic <b>antibodies</b> were covalently coupled to {{lipopolysaccharide}} and then injected into BALB/c mice. As compared with controls, these mice, which {{have never seen}} the antigen, synthesized anti-TMV <b>antibodies</b> that are strongly idiotypically cross-reactive with the starting rabbit idiotype. Monoclonal anti-TMV <b>antibodies</b> were prepared from these mice. Furthermore, xenogeneic or syngeneic antiidiotypic <b>antibodies,</b> raised against these monoclonal anti-TMV <b>antibodies,</b> recognized specifically the rabbit idiotype. Rabbit antiidiotypic <b>antibodies</b> alone can induce the same effects, but the concentration of anti-TMV <b>antibodies</b> is lower...|$|R
50|$|Monospecific <b>antibodies</b> are <b>antibodies</b> whose {{specificity}} to antigens is singular (mono- + specific) in any {{of several}} ways: <b>antibodies</b> that all have affinity for the same antigen; <b>antibodies</b> that are specific to one antigen or one epitope; or <b>antibodies</b> specific to one type of cell or tissue. Monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> are monospecific, but monospecific <b>antibodies</b> may also be produced by other means than producing them from a common germ cell. Regarding <b>antibodies,</b> monospecific and monovalent overlap in meaning; both can indicate specificity to one antigen, one epitope, or one cell type (including one microorganism species). However, <b>antibodies</b> that are monospecific to a certain tissue, or all monospecific to the same tissue because clones, can be polyvalent in their epitope binding.|$|R
40|$|Using {{dithiothreitol}} (DTT) technique, IgM anti-HLA anti-idiotypic <b>antibodies</b> {{were detected}} in a multiparous multitransfused woman. These <b>antibodies</b> {{were able to}} inhibit the binding of specific IgG anti-HLA <b>antibodies</b> on their corresponding antigen.
