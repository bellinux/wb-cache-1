5|$|Fleshy lobe-fins {{supported}} on bones rather than ray-stiffened fins {{seem to have}} been an ancestral trait of all bony fishes (Osteichthyes). The lobe-finned <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tetrapods evolved them further, while the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) evolved their fins in a different direction. The most primitive group of actinopterygians, the bichirs, still have fleshy frontal fins.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, these {{characteristics}} were {{not present in}} the Triassic <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mammals. Nearly all mammaliaforms possess an epipubic bone, the exception being modern placentals.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Chinese astronomy, Alpha, Beta and Gamma Pyxidis formed part of Tianmiao, a {{celestial}} temple honouring the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor, along with stars from neighbouring Antlia.|$|E
50|$|According to the first-century Jewish {{historian}} Josephus, he is <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bactrians. Jerome (c. 390) considers Gether <b>the</b> <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Acarnanians. Isidore <b>of</b> Seville (c. 635) {{makes him}} <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Acarnanians or Curians.|$|R
50|$|Although {{presented}} as an <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eóganachta in later medieval genealogies, Lugaid is regarded by T. F. O'Rahilly {{as one of}} several late emanations <b>of</b> Lugaid Loígde, <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corcu Loígde.|$|R
50|$|A second {{estimate}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> {{this virus}} suggests a most recent common <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human strains evolved ~1500 years ago. The most recent common <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> avian strains was placed at 6000 years ago. The mutation rate {{was estimated to}} be ~10−6 substitutions/site/year.|$|R
5|$|The Cekaracecekaramalai written {{during the}} Aryacakravarti rule in Jaffna {{asserts that the}} direct <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings belonged {{to a group of}} 512 Ariyar (a Brahmin priestly caste) of the Pasupata sect of the Rameswaram Hindu temple. The source also claims that two out of the 512 were {{selected}} as Kings of Ariyars. It also explains that a direct ancestor of the kings was a scribe in the Pandyan kingdom and was called during a war with other kingdoms to assist the king, and that the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kings fought in wars against kings in the Hoysala and Karnataka.|$|E
5|$|Ancestral {{rhinoceroses}} first diverged {{from other}} perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests {{the ancestors of}} modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, {{first appeared in the}} Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of darts in many superfamilies of the Stylommatophora, it seems likely that love darts appeared during the early evolution of the Pulmonata, and that the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stylommatophora possessed darts already.|$|E
50|$|Alwyn MacArchill was a mid-12th century man {{who appears}} in {{numerous}} charters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings <b>of</b> Scots. He, and his son, held <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> rannair - a distributor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> food and provisions - to <b>the</b> King <b>of</b> Scots. Over <b>the</b> years, some historians {{have suggested that}} he was an <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earls <b>of</b> Lennox; some made him the first earl, others made him a male-line <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first earl, another suggestion is that he is an <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first earl in the female-line.|$|R
50|$|Example: <b>The</b> rodents consist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{house mouse}} (A) {{that is not}} also an <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern cottontail rabbit (C) {{together}} with all descendants <b>of</b> that <b>ancestor.</b> Here, <b>the</b> ancestor is the very first rodent. B is some other descendant, perhaps the red squirrel.|$|R

He was crowned at Compiègne in February 888 by Walter, Archbishop of Sens.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{people used}} the {{turntable}} trebuchet, the single-pole trebuchet and the squatting-tiger trebuchet. They were all called 'fire trebuchets' {{because they were}} used to project fire-weapons like the (fire-)ball, (fire-)falcon, and (fire-)lance. They were the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cannon.|$|E
50|$|Gilbert de la Hay (died April 1333), <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earls <b>of</b> Erroll, was <b>the</b> {{older brother}} <b>of</b> William de la Hay, <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earls <b>of</b> Kinnoull.

5|$|The <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lipizzan can {{be traced}} to {{approximately}} A.D. 800. The earliest predecessors of the Lipizzan originated in the 7th century when Barb horses were brought into Spain by the Moors and crossed on native Spanish stock. The result was the Andalusian horse and other Iberian horse breeds.|$|E
5|$|A disused quarry at East Kirkton in the Bathgate Hills is the {{location}} where the Carboniferous fossil of Westlothiana lizziae (aka 'Lizzie') {{was found in}} 1984. This lizard {{is one of the}} earliest known <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reptiles. The specimen was purchased in part by public subscription and is now on display in the National Museum of Scotland. The site was originally discovered in the early 19th century and has also provided fossil eurypterids, sharks and a variety of primitive acanthodian fish.|$|E
5|$|After the Mongol withdrawal, Béla IV {{abandoned}} his policy of recovering former crown lands. Instead, he granted large estates to his supporters, and {{urged them to}} construct stone-and-mortar castles. He initiated {{a new wave of}} colonization that resulted in the arrival of a number of Germans, Moravians, Poles, and Romanians. The king re-invited the Cumans and settled them in the plains along the Danube and the Tisza. A group of Alans, the <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jassic people, seems to have settled in the kingdom around the same time.|$|E

5|$|Andalusians were a {{significant}} influence {{on the creation of}} the Alter Real, a strain of the Lusitano, and the Azteca, a Mexican breed created by crossing the Andalusian with American Quarter Horse and Criollo bloodlines. The Spanish jennet <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andalusian also developed the Colonial Spanish Horse in America, which became the foundation bloodstock for many North and South American breeds. The Andalusian has also been used to create breeds more recently, with breed associations for both the Warlander (an Andalusian/Friesian cross) and the Spanish-Norman (an Andalusian/Percheron cross) being established in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 15th century, Portuguese {{settlers}} {{made contact}} with the Kongo Empire, maintaining a continuous presence in its territory and enjoying considerable cultural and religious influence thereafter. In 1575, Portugal established a settlement and fort called Saint Paul of Luanda on the coast south of the Kongo Empire, in an area inhabited by Ambundu people. Another fort, Benguela, was established on the coast further south, in a region inhabited by <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ovimbundu people.|$|E

5|$|Based on genome sequencing, the Tapanuli {{orangutan}} {{separated from}} other orangutans about 700,000 years ago, {{and the two}} other species diverged about 400,000 years ago. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which also included several other species, such as the three extinct species of the genus Gigantopithecus, including the largest known primate Gigantopithecus blacki. The <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ponginae subfamily split from the main ape line in Africa 16 to 19 million years ago (mya) and spread into Asia.|$|E
5|$|Between the 4th and 14th centuries, the Katyuri dynasty {{dominated}} {{lands of}} varying extent from the Katyur (modern day Baijnath) valley in Kumaon. The historically significant temples at Jageshwar {{are believed to}} have been built by the Katyuris and later remodelled by the Chands. Other peoples of the Tibeto-Burman group known as Kirata are thought to have settled in the northern highlands as well as in pockets throughout the region, and are believed to be <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern day Bhotiya, Raji, Buksa, and Tharu people.|$|E
5|$|By the Visean (mid-Carboniferous) stage, {{the early}} {{tetrapods}} had radiated into {{at least three}} or four main branches. Recognizable basal-group tetrapods {{are representative of the}} temnospondyls (e.g. Eryops) lepospondyls (e.g. Diplocaulus), anthracosaurs, which were the relatives and <b>ancestors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amniota, and possibly the baphetids, which are thought to be related to temnospondyls and whose status as a main branch is yet unresolved. Depending on which authorities one follows, modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) are most probably derived from either temnospondyls or lepospondyls (or possibly both, although this is now a minority position).|$|E
