25|$|The Kerry Slug (Geomalacus maculosus) is a hiberno-lusitanean species. It {{emerges in}} Killarney's {{frequent}} wet weather to graze on lichens on rcks and tree trunks. It is reputedly the only slug capable of rolling {{itself into a}} ball. It is on both Annex II and <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> of the EU Habitats Directive.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the EU, {{through the}} European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), {{proposed}} a roadmap to gradually lift {{the restrictions on}} the feed ban. EU Regulation No 999/2001 had outlined a complete ban on feeding mammal-based products to cattle. A regulation that modified <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> of 999/2001, was published in 2013 that allowed for certain milk, fish, eggs, and plant-fed farm animal products to be used.|$|E

30|$|However, the {{registration}} processes under REACH {{do not require}} that each chemical substance in the workplace is covered and fully examined. The regulation generally exempts certain substances (e.g. non-isolated intermediates or waste) and sectors extensively regulated by other legislation (e.g. use as a biocide). <b>Annexes</b> <b>IV</b> and V of REACH list other substances excluded from registration either because this is deemed inappropriate or because sufficient information is available already.|$|R

25|$|Laws {{exist to}} protect the Apollo {{butterfly}} in many countries. The Apollo is on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, in Appendix II in CITES, and is mentioned in <b>annex</b> <b>IV</b> of Habitats Directive. It is protected in other states: the Principality of Liechtenstein, Czech Republic (as critically threatened species in Czech code, Decree for implementation, No. 395/1992 Sb., and No. 175/2006 Sb.), Turkey and Poland.|$|E
2500|$|Residues {{from the}} {{breakdown}} of nitrofuran veterinary antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, {{have been found in}} chicken in Vietnam, China, Brazil, and Thailand. The European Union banned the use of nitrofurans in food producing animals by classifying it in <b>ANNEX</b> <b>IV</b> (list of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits can be fixed) of the Council Regulation 2377/90. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States has prohibited furaltadone since February 1985 and withdrew the approval for the other nitrofuran drugs (except some topical uses) in January 1992. The topical use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone was prohibited in 2002. Australia prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food production in 1992. Japan did not allocate MRLs for nitrofurans leading to the implementation of a [...] "zero tolerance or no residue standard". In Thailand, the Ministry of Health issued in 2001 Proclamation No. 231 MRL of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate MRL for nitrofurans. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all nitrofurans in 2002. Several metabolites of nitrofurans, such as furazolidone, furaltadone and nitrofurazone cause cancer or genetic damage in rats.|$|E
2500|$|In the European context, safety {{effectiveness}} and quality is ensured through the [...] "Conformity Assessment" [...] that {{is defined as}} [...] "the method by which a manufacturer demonstrates that its device complies {{with the requirements of}} the European Medical Device Directive". The directive specifies different procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple Declaration of Conformity (Annex VII) for Class I devices to EC verification (<b>Annex</b> <b>IV),</b> Production quality assurance (Annex V), Product quality assurance (Annex VI) and Full quality assurance (Annex II). The Medical Device Directive specifies detailed procedures for Certification. In general terms, these procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific deliveries such as the risk management file, [...] the technical file and the quality system deliveries. [...] The risk management file is the first deliverable that conditions the following design and manufacturing steps. Risk management stage shall drive the product so that product risks are reduced at an acceptable level with respect to the benefits expected for the patients {{for the use of the}} device. The technical file contains all the documentation data and records supporting medical device certification. FDA technical file has similar content although organized in different structure. [...] The Quality System deliverables usually includes procedures that ensure quality throughout all product life cycle. The same standard (ISO EN 13485) is usually applied for quality management systems in US and worldwide.|$|E

50|$|<b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> of MARPOL {{was drafted}} to {{regulate}} sewage discharges from vessels. It has entered into force internationally and {{would apply to}} ships that are flagged in ratifying countries, but because the United States has not ratified <b>Annex</b> <b>IV,</b> it is not mandatory that ships follow it when in U.S. waters. However, its requirements are minimal, even compared with U.S. rules for MSDs. <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> requires that vessels be equipped with a certified sewage treatment system or holding tank, but it prescribes no specific performance standards. Within three miles (5 km) of shore, <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> requires that sewage discharges be treated by a certified MSD prior to discharge. Between three and 12 mi from shore, sewage discharges must be treated by no less than maceration or chlorination; sewage discharges beyond 12 mi from shore are unrestricted. Vessels are permitted to meet alternative, less stringent requirements {{when they are in}} the jurisdiction of countries where less stringent requirements apply. In U.S. waters, vessels must comply with the regulations implementing Section 312 of the Clean Water Act.|$|E
