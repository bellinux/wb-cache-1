5|$|The {{range of}} the Ferugliotheriidae is overall more limited, both in extent and time, than that of Sudamericidae; sudamericids have been {{recorded}} from the Late Cretaceous to Miocene of Argentina, the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar and India, the Middle Eocene of Antarctica, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous of Tanzania (TNM 02067, tentatively referred to Sudamericidae).

5|$|Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115) was {{the ruler}} of the Kingdom of the Isles, the Kingdom of Thomond, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Dublin as well. His father was Tadc, son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster, which meant that Domnall {{was a member of}} the Meic Taidc, a branch of the Uí Briain. Domnall's mother was Mór, {{daughter}} of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles, which may have given Domnall a stake to the kingship of the Isles.|$|E

5|$|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065) was a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} eleventh-century Irish Sea region. At his height, he reigned as king over Dublin, the Isles, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Rhinns of Galloway. The precise identity of Echmarcach's father, Ragnall, is uncertain. One possibility is {{that this man was}} one of two eleventh-century rulers of Waterford. Another possibility is that Echmarcach's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles. If any of these identifications are correct, Echmarcach may have {{been a member of the}} Uí Ímair kindred.|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} East Anglia, (also {{known as the}} kingdom of the East Angles), was a small {{independent}} Anglo-Saxon kingdom that comprised what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> eastern part of the Fens. The kingdom was one of the seven traditional members of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. The East Angles were initially ruled (from the 6th century until 749) by members of the Wuffingas dynasty, named after Wuffa, whose name means 'descendants of the wolf'. The last king was Guthrum II, who ruled in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of Northumbria, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> whole kingdom, had probably been ruled by Ealdred son of Eadulf since 913. Faced with Ragnall's invasion, Ealdred came north seeking assistance from Constantine. The two advanced south to face Ragnall, and {{this led to a}} battle somewhere {{on the banks of the}} River Tyne, probably at Corbridge where Dere Street crosses the river. The Battle of Corbridge appears to have been indecisive; the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba is alone in giving Constantine the victory.|$|E

5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories. The best-known ones in the West, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> finest in overall quality, are mainly {{programmatic}} in nature—in other words, the musical content {{and how it is}} handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{adult male}} ruffs start to moult {{into the main}} display plumage before their return to the {{breeding}} areas, {{and the proportion of}} birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.|$|E
5|$|Ímar mac Arailt (died 1054) was an eleventh-century {{ruler of}} the Kingdom of Dublin <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of the Isles. He {{was the son of}} a man named Aralt, and appears to have been a {{grandson}} of Amlaíb Cuarán, King of Northumbria and Dublin. Such a relationship would have meant that Ímar was a member of the Uí Ímair, and that he was a nephew of Amlaíb Cuarán's son, Sitriuc mac Amlaíb, King of Dublin, a man driven from Dublin by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill in 1036.|$|E

5|$|Psittacosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were basal to almost all known ceratopsians except Yinlong <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Chaoyangsauridae. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, Psittacosaurus itself was {{probably}} not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of Psittacosaurus had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the antorbital fenestra, {{an opening in the}} skull between the eye socket and nostril, was lost during the evolution of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other archosaurs. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would evolve a second time.|$|E
5|$|The Tour de France was {{the main}} {{focal point of the}} season for BMC's leader Evans, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> team itself. He had ridden two Grand Tours each of the past two seasons, and in three of the past four, but in 2011 he focused solely on the Tour. He rode a {{different}} race program in preparation for the Tour than he had in previous years, riding fewer races. Among them were the early-season stage races Tirreno–Adriatico and Tour de Romandie, both of which Evans won, and the Critérium du Dauphiné, where he finished on the podium in second overall. The squad named to the race was chosen with the sole goal of helping Evans win the race overall. It consisted of classics specialists Hincapie and Burghardt with the aim of keeping Evans out of trouble in the flatter stages, climbers Moinard and Morabito to help in the mountains, and strong time trialists Bookwalter and Schär (and Hincapie) for the stage 2 team time trial. Hincapie made his 16th consecutive Tour start, to tie the record held by Joop Zoetemelk, having finished each except the very first.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the dusky shark extends worldwide, albeit discontinuously, in {{tropical}} and warm-temperate waters. In the western Atlantic Ocean, it is found from Massachusetts and the Georges Bank to southern Brazil, including the Bahamas and Cuba. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, {{it has been reported}} from the western and central Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and possibly elsewhere including Portugal, Spain, Morocco, and Madeira. In the Indian Ocean, it is found off South Africa, Mozambique, and Madagascar, with sporadic records in the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Red Sea. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan, mainland China and Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia, and New Caledonia in the west, and from southern California to the Gulf of California, around Revillagigedo, and possibly off northern Chile in the east. Records of dusky sharks from the northeastern and eastern central Atlantic, and around tropical islands, may in fact be of Galapagos sharks. Mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite evidence suggest that Indonesian and Australian sharks represent distinct populations.|$|E
