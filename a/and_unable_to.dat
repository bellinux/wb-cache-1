5|$|The Kentucky gubernatorial {{election}} of 1899 {{was held on}} November 7, 1899, to choose the 33rd governor of Kentucky. The incumbent, Republican William O'Connell Bradley, was term-limited <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|Advancing up {{the ridge}} {{they had just}} abandoned, Browne's {{battalion}} came under intense fire from Ruffin's emplaced infantry and artillery. Within a few salvoes, half the battalion was gone <b>and,</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> continue, Browne's men scattered amongst the cover provided by the slope and returned fire. Despite his success, Ruffin could not descend the hill to brush away the remnants of Browne's battalion, as Dilkes's brigade had by now emerged from the wood and was forming up {{at the base of}} the slope.|$|E

5|$|Although rare, {{infection}} of humans by rabies from vampire bat bites has been documented; {{for example in}} 2010 four children in Peru died after being bitten. The highest occurrence of rabies in vampire bats occurs in the large populations found in South America. However, the risk of infection to the human population is less than to livestock exposed to bat bites. Only 0.5% of bats carry rabies, {{and those that do}} may be clumsy, disoriented, <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> fly.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{campaign}} faltered as {{the race}} {{drew to a}} close. Two weeks prior to the election, Brown was injured in a fall at Leitchfield; {{as a result of}} the injury, he was confined to his home <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> deliver campaign speeches, despite several attempts to allow him to speak from a chair or wheelchair. The final vote count gave Republican William S. Taylor a small plurality with 193,714 votes to Goebel's 191,331; Brown garnered only 12,140 votes.|$|E
5|$|Confusion among Jordanians was as {{important}} as among Israelis with the attack on Hill 315 and those of diversion. With the incoming morning <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> evaluate properly the situation, the Israeli HQ gave orders at 5.30 am for the soldiers to retreat to Bad al-Oued. The losses were also significant. Indeed, the 400-strong Harel battalion numbered 16 dead and 79 injured, and the Yiftach an handful of dead and injured. The Legion numbered several dozen victims.|$|E

5|$|David Jenkins, who was {{a student}} and {{assistant}} to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> criticise his own works, too erratic {{to be a good}} conductor and too impatient for all but advanced students, but with a boyish enthusiasm, especially for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who also worked with Parry, also noted his great enthusiasm and described him as a man of great musical ability.|$|E
5|$|Final {{outcomes}} {{for people with}} SCSFLS remain poorly studied. Symptoms may resolve {{in as little as}} two weeks, or persist for months. Less commonly, patients may suffer from unremitting symptoms for many years. People with chronic SCSFLS may be disabled <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> work. Recurrent CSF leak at an alternate site after recent repair is common.|$|E
5|$|From 1972 through 1974, {{the war was}} {{conducted}} along FANK's lines of communications {{north and south of}} the capital. Limited offensives were launched to maintain contact with the rice-growing regions of the northwest and along the Mekong River and Route 5, the Republic's overland connections to South Vietnam. The strategy of the Khmer Rouge was to gradually cut those lines of communication and squeeze Phnom Penh. As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> lend one another mutual support.|$|E

5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the outcome at Vukovar {{was not a}} disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke {{the back of the}} JNA offensive and left Croatia's main adversary exhausted <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> press its offensive deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost surrounded by Serb-held territory and closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb, and although the defeat was damaging to morale, in a strategic context the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be {{inhabited}} by species of limoniid flies, such as Discobola marginata or Limonia yakushimensis, {{as well as}} several species of fungi-dwelling mites. The flies are hosts for the mites in a symbiotic association known as phoresis, whereby the mites are mechanically carried by its host. Mites are small <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> migrate the relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance; the insect hosts, in comparison, are large and can transfer the mites between their preferred feeding habitats.|$|E
5|$|Hindley's {{first job}} {{was as a}} junior clerk at a local {{electrical}} engineering firm. She ran errands, made tea, and typed. She was well liked at the firm, enough so that when she lost her first week's wage packet, the other girls had a collection to replace it. Beginning at Christmas 1958, Hindley began a short relationship with Ronnie Sinclair, and became engaged at 17. The engagement was called off several months later; Hindley apparently thought Sinclair immature, <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> provide her with the life she envisaged for herself.|$|E

5|$|In 1920 the {{dreadnought}} São Paulo {{bore the}} imperial coffins to Brazil. The Portuguese republican government granted PedroII an exhumation with dignities befitting a Head of State, and {{he received the}} same honors upon arrival in Brazil. The Count of Eu accompanied the remains, along with his only surviving son, Pedro de Alcântara. His wife, Princess Isabel, was elderly, unwell <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> participate. She died one year later, without ever seeing her homeland again. President Artur Bernardes declared a national holiday {{and the return of}} the Emperor was celebrated throughout the nation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to historical sources, Poe {{was influenced by}} other writers. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a general influence, and scenes of Pym and Dirk Peters in a cave echo scenes in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, which many reviewers noted at the time, including London publications such as the Court Gazette and the Torch. The ship of corpses recalls {{the legend of the}} Flying Dutchman, a ship which is cursed <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> return home.|$|E
5|$|In early July, a {{few days}} after a communist-led mass {{uprising}} commenced, Aćimović reshuffled his government, replacing three commissioners and appointing deputies for most of the portfolios. By mid-July, the Germans had decided that the Aćimović regime was incompetent <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> deal with the uprising, and began looking for a replacement. At the end of August this resulted in the resignation of the Commissioner Government and the appointment of the Government of National Salvation led by former Minister of the Army and Navy General Milan Nedić, in which Aćimović initially retained the Interior portfolio.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1914, when Jolin and his friends from the Matisse Academy {{returned}} to Stockholm, the group became known as De Unga (The Young Ones). Their participation and paintings created uproar in the Baltic Exhibition in Malmö. Albert Engström, artist and influential member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts {{as well as other}} members of the Swedish art world at that time, stated that they were perplexed <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> understand The Young Ones' works.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} from Byzantine sources that the Rus' caught Constantinople unprepared, while the empire was preoccupied by the ongoing Arab–Byzantine wars <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> {{deal with the}} Rus' threat. After pillaging the suburbs of the Byzantine capital, the Rus' retreated, {{although}} {{the nature of this}} withdrawal, and indeed which side was victorious, is subject to debate. The event gave rise to a later Orthodox Christian tradition, which ascribed the deliverance of Constantinople to a miraculous intervention by the Theotokos.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive <b>and</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E
