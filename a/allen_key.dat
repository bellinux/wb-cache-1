50|$|The Chinese paigu (排鼓; pinyin: páigǔ; also spelled pai gu) {{is a set}} {{of three}} to seven tuned drums (in most {{instances}} five are used), traditionally made of wood with animal skin heads. It is played by beating the heads (and sometimes also the body) with sticks. Most drums are double-sided and turnable. Both sides have different tunings. Tuning is done through the use of <b>Allen</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another type of tremolo is the locking tremolo. These bridges {{have a sort}} of vise in each saddle which clamps {{the string}} into place (usually with an <b>Allen</b> <b>key).</b> The end of the string has a clamp, which holds the string in place, {{stopping}} it from slipping. It is especially useful for songs that require tapping or heavy/hard playing styles. Once set up for tuning stability, locking tremolos are very good. However, their fulcrum points offer extremely minute contact with the body, which may disturb sound transfer.|$|E

The Wheelbase can be adjusted horizontally by 1 inch to effect {{the handling of the}} bike. The axle is tightened with a 9 m <b>allen</b> <b>key</b> and memory locked with two smaller horizontal allen bolts, creating a very stiff wheelbase. The disk-brake mount and derrailleur hanger make up either side of the moving section, and can therefore be replaced if damaged.|$|E

50|$|The most {{complete}} collection {{of his work}} in private hands remains that of the ducal house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, exhibited at Callenberg Castle in Coburg, north Bavaria. In 2012 made Wolfam Koepp of the Metropolitan Museum of Art discovered {{a particular type of}} Roentgen table with removable legs for easier transport. Was this table the earliest form of flatpack? A team from the Victoria and Albert Museum investigated further and confirmed Koepp's process and conclusions in March 2014, shedding new light on the inventor of flat-pack / ready-to-assemble furniture. Until then, Gillis Lundgren held that title from 1951 for IKEA. Its blame has now been traced back 200 years before the pretender. David Roentgen not only mastered intrigue but flat-pack home assembly without an <b>allen</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
50|$|Initial {{problems}} with this lug cracking drove further development of the M1922 resulting in the final M2 version. the main distinguishing change in the M2 variant was the incorporation of an adjustable headspace mechanism in the locking lug. This mechanism consisted of an <b>Allen</b> <b>key</b> screw that passed through the locking lug bearing against the right rear receiver wall. This headspace screw was locked in place, after adjustment, by a brass pin that bore against headspace screws' threads. the brass pin was not threaded but {{held in place by}} a lead plug. The lead plug shows a small eagle that was pressed into the plug by the special tool used by the armourer. If the eagle was disturbed the armourer would know that an attempt had been made to change the headspace by unauthorised personnel.|$|E

5000|$|A guitar tech {{is often}} a [...] "jack of all trades" [...] {{when it comes to}} making simple repairs. As such, a guitar tech can often {{resolder}} a loose wiring connection inside a guitar volume potentiometer, replace an amplifier tube, swap out a damaged speaker for a new one, stick a loose wooden part on an acoustic guitar, or adjust a misaligned neck with an <b>allen</b> <b>key.</b> In cases where there is either not enough time to make the repair, or if the equipment is damaged beyond repair, the guitar tech is often responsible for finding a replacement instrument or part, either by purchasing or renting it from a local music store or by borrowing it from another band. While another member of the road crew may be dispatched to pick up the item(s), the guitar tech usually writes down which models or brands are acceptable replacements.|$|E

5000|$|The engine {{features}} four inline cylinders inclined {{at an angle}} of approximately 45 degrees (hence the name), and this is because Vauxhall had originally planned to develop a whole family of engines all built on the same production line. There was to be slant four and V8 versions in both petrol and diesel versions, designed {{under the guidance of}} Vauxhall's then chief engineer, John Alden. Although several diesel 4-cylinder and a V8 petrol engine prototypes were built only the 4-cylinder petrol made it to series production. There is a single overhead camshaft operating two valves per cylinder. An ingenious valve train design incorporating an inclined socket head cap screw, allowed valve clearances to be adjusted with a feeler gauge and an <b>Allen</b> <b>key.</b> The block and crossflow head are both of cast iron. The layout makes good use of the cylinder inclination to lower the overall height of the engine, which allowed for more aerodynamic designs of cars to be achieved by lowering the bonnet line. It also means most of the engine is very easy to access for maintenance, {{with the exception of the}} exhaust manifold and spark plugs, which are [...] "underneath" [...] the slanted cylinders.|$|E

40|$|A {{retractable}} {{tool bit}} assembly for a tool {{such as an}} <b>allen</b> <b>key</b> is presented. The assembly includes one or more spring loaded nestable or telescoping tubular sections together with a catch mechanism for capturing and holding the tool in its retracted position. The catch mechanism consists of a latch mechanism located in a base section and which engages a conically shaped tool head located at the inner end of the tool. The tool head adjoins an eccentric oval type neck portion which extends to a rear lip of the tool head. The latch mechanism releases when the ovular neck portion rotates about the catch members upon actuation of a rotary tool drive motor. When released, all the telescoping sections and the tool extends fully outward to a use position...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{number of}} fusion {{surgeries}} increase each year which {{also increase the}} need for implant removal. In some cases, it can be extremely hard to remove a pedicle screw especially {{when there is a}} mismatch of the screw and the screwdriver. Also the screwdrivers can be contaminated during the operation, and this will cause a delay till the instruments are re-sterilized. There is a need for the removal of screws without special instruments. We describe a method for removing tulip-head polyaxial ped-icle screws without special instruments. The screws are removed using an <b>Allen</b> <b>key,</b> a rod bender and a ‘‘U’’ shaped rod. We successfully removed 76 screws in 11 recent cases without any complications. The ‘‘U’ ’ rod technique is a simple and useful technique for the removal of tulip-head polyaxial screws...|$|E
40|$|Ectoenzyme {{kinetics}} [alkaline phosphatase, aminopeptidase (AM), lipase, a-glucosidase, and b-glucosidase] {{were determined}} over a seasonal cycle at four stations, Little Madeira Bay (northeast), Duck Key (east), Bob <b>Allen</b> <b>Key</b> (south-central), and Whipray Basin (north-central), which represent distinct regions of Florida Bay. Spatial and temporal variations in ectoenzyme kinetics {{were related to}} biotic and abiotic drivers in order to discern potential ectoenzyme substrate sources. Generally, ectoenzyme activities {{were higher in the}} central bay and lowest in the eastern bay. One pronounced exception was AM activity, which was highest at the mangrove fringe along the northeastern bay and reflected increased contribution of organic nitrogen inputs from upstream Everglades wetlands. When ectoenzymes were normalized to bacterial abundances, these trends dissipated and highest cell-specific activities were observed consistently in the south-central region. Relationships between ectoenzyme kinetics and environmental and biological parameters were complex, but three main spatially determined differences were discernable. Ectoenzyme kinetics were controlled by phosphorus availability in the eastern bay, by organic matter availability in the south-central bay, by microbial community composition and organic matter availability in northeastern bay (wetlands transition area), and by microbial community composition in the north-central bay. These differences in enzyme kinetics further support the hypothesis of distinct microbial communities in different regions of Florida Bay and provide insight into biogeochemical cycles and the microbial food web within Florida Bay...|$|E
