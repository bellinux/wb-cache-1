The Trans Am body would continue to improve aerodynamically over the years, and by 1985 {{would be the most}} <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>vehicle</b> to ever be released from General Motors with a 0.29 coefficient of drag. Wind tunnels were used to form the 3rd Gen F-Body's shape, and these aerodynamic developments were fully taken advantage of by Pontiac's design team. The sleek new car had a low slung front end which featured split grilles. They fed some air to the radiator but most of the air came from an air dam underneath the front bumper. Every piece of the car was designed to reduce drag. The newly designed side view mirror housings, made of light alloy metal, were almost cone shaped, with the point facing the wind. The windshield wipers were hidden under the hood with the air intake for the climate control system. It made for a smooth flow of air over the windshield. The retractable headlamps popped up from {{the leading edge of the}} hood. The cars tended to outlive the plastic gears for the headlight doors, and since the dealers charged several hundred dollars for the repair, it was common to see Firebirds driving around with one or both headlights stuck open during the day. Smooth wheelcovers were available on the Trans Am, attached to turbine finned alloy wheels. A frameless, flush mounted, compound curved rear glass hatchback decklid provided [...] of cargo space with the rear seats folded, and an optional wiper. It provided no disturbance to the airflow over the back of the car. All of these features combined together to provide a low coefficient of drag.The front end of the vehicle featured 10.5 in power disc brakes and were now made standard on all Firebird models. Taking styling cues from the 1981 design, the new car had full width tail lights, complete with a Firebird emblem in the center. The all-new suspension design was more advanced and aggressive than anything Detroit had offered previously, easily rivaling the Corvette's handling abilities, (but not its sophistication). The front suspension utilized MacPherson struts, with inboard mounted coil springs and lower front control arms. In the rear, coil springs and shocks were positioned between the body and solid rear axle, with twin rear lower control arms/trailing links and a torsion bar, replacing the old-fashioned leaf springs design used previously in the 2nd Gens. A huge torque arm was mounted from the transmissions tailshaft to the rear axle center to further stabilize the axle's tendency to twist.|$|E

Adding electric assist to bicycles improve the range but lack the creature comfort offered by even the least attractive car. The described electric assisted velomobile construction bridges the gap between cars and electric assisted bicycles while maintaining exercise benefits, reasonable safety, low maintenance, high sustainability and very low cradle-to-grave energy consumption compared to cars. This documentation describes new solutions for velomobiles and it is the intention of the author to put on the market a vehicle with most if not all of the novel design elements described herewith. The Veloquad described has a unique set of qualities making it a truly revolutionary vehicle, not only evolutionary: - The use of a series hybrid drive with two motors not only benefits a simpler drive train for a four wheeled vehicle. It also enables the use of low cost mass produced motors for pedelecs, a clean and uncluttered platform chassis, and easy adjustment of the pedals position relative to the cyclist. The suggested implementation contains enabling solutions on how to adopt to legislative rules within the European Union on electric assisted cycles (EPAC/PEDELEC). - The adoption of high tech battery control system with active balancing and wide operating temperature is an enabling technology for the series hybrid electronic transmission. - The suggested use of PET based self-reinforced thermoplastic composite for <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>vehicle</b> body parts being light, energy absorbing and recyclable is not new, but the use of such materials in velomobiles has not been described in available sources.

40|$|The Advanced Electric Systems and Aerodynamics for Efficiency Improvements in Heavy Duty Trucks program (DE-FC 26 - 04 NT 42189), {{commonly}} referred to as the AES program, focused on areas that will primarily benefit fuel economy and improve heat rejection while driving over the road. The AES program objectives were to: (1) Analyze, design, build, and test a cooling system that provided a minimum of 10 percent greater heat rejection in the same frontal area with no increase in parasitic fan load. (2) Realize fuel savings with advanced power management and acceleration assist by utilizing an integrated starter/generator (ISG) and energy storage devices. (3) Quantify the effect of aerodynamic drag due to the frontal shape mandated by the area required for the cooling system. The program effort consisted of modeling and designing components for optimum fuel efficiency, completing fabrication of necessary components, integrating these components into the chassis test bed, completing controls programming, and performance testing the system both on a chassis dynamometer and on the road. Emission control measures for heavy-duty engines have resulted in increased engine heat loads, thus introducing added parasitic engine cooling loads. Truck electrification, in the form of thermal management, offers technological solutions to mitigate or even neutralize the effects of this trend. Thermal control offers opportunities to avoid increases in cooling system frontal area and forestall reduced fuel economy brought about by additional <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>vehicle</b> drag. This project explored such thermal concepts by installing a 2007 engine that is compliant with current regulations and bears additional heat rejection associated with meeting these regulations. This newer engine replaced the 2002 engine from a previous project that generated less heat rejection. Advanced power management, utilizing a continuously optimized and controlled power flow between electric components, can offer additional fuel economy benefits to the heavy-duty trucking industry. Control software for power management brings added value to the power distribution and energy storage architecture on board a truck with electric accessories and an ISG. The research team has built upon a previous truck electrification project, formally, 'Parasitic Energy Loss Reduction and Enabling Technologies for Class 7 / 8 Trucks', DE-FC 04 - 2000 AL 6701, where the fundamental concept of electrically-driven accessories replacing belt/gear-driven accessories was demonstrated on a Kenworth T 2000 truck chassis. The electrical accessories, shown in Figure 1, were controlled to provide 'flow on demand' variable-speed operation and reduced parasitic engine loads for increased fuel economy. These accessories also provided solutions for main engine idle reduction in long haul trucks. The components and systems of the current project have been integrated into the same Kenworth T 2000 truck platform. Reducing parasitic engine loading by decoupling accessory loads from the engine and driving them electrically has been a central concept of this project. Belt or gear-driven engine accessories, such as water pump, air conditioning compressor, or air compressor, are necessarily tied to the engine speed dictated by the current vehicle operating conditions. These conventional accessory pumps are sized to provide adequate flow or pressure at low idle or peak torque speeds, resulting in excess flow or pressure at cruising or rated speeds. The excess flow is diverted through a pressure-minimizing device such as a relief valve thereby expending energy to drive unnecessary and inefficient pump operation. This inefficiency causes an increased parasitic load to the engine, which leads to a loss of usable output power and decreased fuel economy. Controlling variable-speed electric motors to provide only the required flow or pressure of a particular accessory system can yield significant increases in fuel economy for a commercial vehicle. Motor loads at relatively high power levels (1 - 5 kW, or higher) can be efficiently provided current from high-efficiency generators or batteries with system voltages in the range of 250 to 360 volts DC (VDC). In the previous project, the electric accessories could be powered from one of three sources: an AC voltage source ('shore power'), an on-board diesel generator (auxiliary power unit), or an ISG located in the flywheel housing and driven by the main engine. The electric accessories and power sources, including the ISG, have remained in place for the current upgrade of the research platform vehicle. In this project, more emphasis has been placed on determining the best way to use the ISG to power the vehicle and accessories, thereby yielding additional value from existing hardware...|$|E
