40|$|SummaryIntroductionAspirin {{hypersensitivity}} represents {{two distinct}} clinical syndromes, such as aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and aspirin-intolerant chronic urticaria/angioedema (AICU) which have different clinical phenotypes resulting from different genetic backgrounds in a Korean population. Persistent eosinophilic inflammation in airway is a characteristic feature of AERD and chemokine CC motif receptor 3 (CCR 3) {{plays an important}} role in eosinophilic infiltration into the asthmatic airway. ObjectivesThe main objective of this study is to investigate the association between CCR 3 gene polymorphisms and <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> including AERD and AICU. MethodsCCR 3 mRNA expression was measured after an aspirin provocation test by real-time PCR. In total, 330 patients with <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> (191 AERD and 139 AICU) and 217 normal healthy controls (NC) were genotyped for two CCR 3 promoter polymorphisms (- 520 T/G and - 174 C/T), and the functional effects of the polymorphisms were analyzed applying a luciferase reporter assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ResultsCCR 3 mRNA expression was significantly increased after aspirin provocation in AERD patients (P= 0. 002) but not in AICU patients. An in vitro functional study showed that the reporter construct having a - 520 G allele exhibited significantly higher promoter activity compared with the construct having a - 520 T allele in human myeloid (U 937), lymphoid (Jurkat), and mast (HMC- 1) cell lines (P< 0. 001). We found - 520 G and - 174 T specific bands on EMSA. ConclusionThis result suggests that the CCR 3 genetic polymorphisms may contribute to the development of the AERD phenotype and may be used as a genetic marker for differentiating between the two major <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> phenotypes...|$|E

Rapid, low-dose (81 – 325 mg/day) ASA desensitization regimens {{are known to}} be useful in establishing ASA tolerance in patients with coronary artery disease and coexisting ASA/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug hypersensitivity. We document 3 cases in Vietnam of desensitization to ASA in patients with coronary artery disease and coexisting ASA hypersensitivity. One of these 3 patients had probable immune-mediated hypersensitivity, whereas the remaining 2 had probable Cox- 1 –mediated reactions. The regimen of desensitization we employed for each patient was designed to account for the probable mechanism of hypersensitiv-ity in the individual and further modified according to the degree of tolerance observed, with all 3 patients eventually achieving a daily cardioprotective dosage of ASA.

40|$|Objective: Coronary artery {{diseases}} including myocardial ischemia (MI) remain one of {{the leading}} causes of death worldwide. This study was designed to compare the protective effect of L-arginine versus aspirin from the biochemical changes associated with MI injury. Experimental design: Four groups of male New Zealand white rabbits were investigated. Normal group (n 8) rabbits were fed standard chow pellets, untreated MI group (n 16), where hypercholesterolemia was induced by feeding the animals with a diet containing 2 % cholesterol for 28 days, L-arginine group (n 12) rabbits were fed a 2 % cholesterol-enriched diet in conjunction with L-arginine (2. 25 g %) in drinking water for 28 days, and aspirin group (n 12) rabbits were fed 2 % cholesterol-enriched diet in conjunction with aspirin administered orally (0. 7 mg/kg per d) for 28 days. After 28 days, MI was induced in all groups, except the normal group, by a single subcutaneous (sc) injectionof isoproterenol hydrochloride (0. 2 mg/kg bodyweight [bw]). Animals were sacrificed 6 hours later. Results:Our results showed that L-argininewasmore effective than aspirin in reducing platelet aggrega-tion, reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidizability, preventing aortic intimal thickening, andmaintaining histological architecture of the myocardium. Both drugs, however, had similar positive effects on plasma fibrinogen levels and on the prevention of myocardial release of cardiac troponin I and creatine kinase-MB. The effect on hypercholesterolemia was insignificant for both drugs. Aspirin was more effective than L-arginine in prolonging prothrombin time.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two common {{clinical}} syndromes of {{acetylsalicylic acid}} (<b>aspirin)</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and aspirin-exacerbated cutaneous disease (AECD), {{were subjected to}} a genome-wide association study to identify strong genetic markers for <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in a Korean population. METHODS: A comparison of SNP genotype frequencies on an Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array of 179 AERD patients and 1989 healthy normal control subjects (NC) revealed SNPs on chromosome 6 that were associated with AERD, but not AECD. To validate the association, we enrolled a second cohort comprising AERD (n = 264), NC (n = 238) and disease-control (aspirin tolerant asthma; ATA, n = 387) groups. RESULTS: The minor genotype frequency (AG or AA) of a particular SNP, rs 3128965, in the HLA-DPB 1 region was higher in the AERD group compared to the ATA or NC group (P = 0. 001, P = 0. 002, in a co-dominant analysis model, respectively). Comparison of rs 3128965 alleles with the clinical features of asthmatics revealed that patients harboring the A allele had increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled aspirin and methacholine, and higher 15 -HETE levels, than those without the A allele (P = 0. 039, 0. 037, and 0. 004, respectively).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Obesity is an {{important}} factor in the development of asthma. <b>Aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> affects 5 - 10 % of asthmatics. The association between obesity and <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in asthma is unclear. This study evaluated the association of BMI and asthma in patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) and aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA). METHODS: Aspirin provocation tests were performed in 667 asthmatic patients and changes in FEV(1) were used to categorize patients as ATA or AIA. The BMI of asthmatics was graded using the percentile BMI of 406 normal controls. RESULTS: Aspirin-induced changes in FEV(1) % ranged from 15 % to 68 %. Compared with the controls, the ATA group had a higher BMI (24. 5 +/- 0. 1 vs 23. 8 +/- 0. 2 kg/m(2), P = 0. 001). The AIA group had a lower BMI. The aspirin-induced percentage fall in FEV(1) was inversely correlated with BMI in asthmatic patients (r = - 0. 094, P = 0. 016). BMI was correlated with age and PC 20, but not with FEV(1) in asthmatic patients. In a logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and smoking status, FEV(1) and PC 20 were associated with AIA with odds ratios of 0. 986 and 0. 586, respectively. BMI was associated with AIA with an odds ratio of 0. 916. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin intolerance in asthmatics explains the lesser association with obesity.

40|$|Background: Aspirin use is {{necessary}} after a coronary angioplasty. It {{should not be}} used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity. However, rapid desensitization protocols have been reported to allow its use in such patients. One of these protocols consists in the administration of progressive doses of aspirin, from 1 to 100 mg in a period of 5. 5 hours, in a controlled environment. We report four male patients aged 45, 49, 59 and 73 years with a history of <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> who were subjected to a coronary angioplasty.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) and haplotypes were associated with <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in asthmatics. We investigated the genetic effects of the SNPs and haplotypes on {{the expression of the}} CysLTR 2 gene. Methods We measured CysLTR 2 protein and mRNA expression in EB virus-infected B cell lines from asthmatics having ht 1 +/+ and ht 2 +/+. A gel retardation assay was used to identify nuclear protein binding to the c. - 819 promoter site. The function of promoter and 3 '-UTR were assessed using pGL 3 luciferase and pEGFP reporter system, respectively. Results We found that the expression of CysLTR 2 protein was higher in B cell lines of asthmatics having ht 2 +/+ than in those having ht 1 +/+. PMA/ionomycin induced higher mRNA expression of CysLTR 2 in B cell lines from ht 2 +/+ asthmatics than those from ht 1 +/+ asthmatics. A nuclear protein from the B cell lines showed stronger DNA binding affinity with a probe containing c. - 819 T than one containing c. - 819 G. The luciferase activity of the c. - 819 T type of CysLTR 2 promoter was higher than that of the c. - 819 G type. EGFP expression was higher in the EGFP- c. 2078 T 3 '-UTR fusion construct than in the c. 2078 C construct. Conclusion The sequence variants of CysLTR 2 may affect its transcription and the stability of its mRNA, resulting in altered expression of CysLTR 2 protein, which in turn causes some asthmatics to be susceptible to <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> </p...|$|E

Sodium cromoglycate in doses of 20 - 40 mg inhibited the bronchoconstrictive reaction not only when inhaled before the challenge but also after it, {{at a time when}} progressive reduction in FEV 1 values was taking place. According to these results, it seems reasonable to postulate sequential mast cell degranulation and liberation of mediators of anaphylaxis as the mechanism through which aspirin induces bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive asthmatics.

40|$|Eleven {{patients}} with asthma and <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> have been challenged with eight non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Each drug {{was given by}} mouth {{in at least three}} different doses and the patients' symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF) rates were observed over a three-hour period. Indomethacin 5 mg caused bronchoconstriction in all patients. Therapeutic doses of mefenamic or flufenamic acid caused bronchoconstriction in most patients. Phenylbutazone 200 - 400 mg induced a moderate fall in PEF. There were no reactions to therapeutic doses of salicylamide, paracetamol, benzydamine, and chloroquine. Microsomal prostaglandin synthetase, activity was inhibited by aspirin, indomethacin, mefenamic acid, flufenamic acid, and phenylbutazone. The other four drugs had no inhibitory effect.

40|$|The use of {{analgesic}} {{anti-inflammatory agents}} {{in patients with}} asthma is clinically challenging because of the prevalence (10 – 20 %) of <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), or aspirin-induced asthma, is characterized by asthma and rhinitis triggered by the ingestion of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. AERD is associated with upper and lower respiratory-tract mucosal inflammation, progressive sinusitis, nasal polyposis, and asthma regardless of whether patients avoid triggering drugs. The mechanism underlying the propensity of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to cause this reaction is thought to involve inhibition of the synthesis of protective prostaglandins (PGs), resulting {{in an increase in}} the synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes by eosinophils and mast cells.

40|$|Background. Special {{regulatory}} role of eicosanoids {{has been}} postulated in aspirin-induced asthma. Objective. To investigate effects of aspirin on exhaled breath condensate (EBC) levels of eicosanoids {{in patients with}} asthma. Methods. We determined EBC eicosanoid concentrations using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS 2) or both. Determinations were performed at baseline and following bronchial aspirin challenge, in two well-defined phenotypes of asthma: aspirin-sensitive and aspirin-tolerant patients. Results. Aspirin precipitated bronchial reactions in all aspirin-sensitive, but in none of aspirin-tolerant patients (ATAs). At baseline, eicosanoids profile did not differ between both asthma groups except for lipoxygenation products: 5 - and 15 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5 -, 15 -HETE) which were higher in aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) than inaspirin-tolerant subjects. Following aspirin challenge the total levels of cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) remained unchanged in both groups. The dose of aspirin {{had an effect on}} magnitude of the response of the exhaled cys-LTs and prostanoids levels only in AIA subjects. Conclusion. The high baseline eicosanoid profiling of lipoxygenation products 5 - and 15 -HETE in EBC makes it possible to detect alterations in aspirin-sensitive asthma.

40|$|Aspirin {{exacerbated}} {{respiratory disease}} (AERD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> The aspirin-induced bronchospasm is mediated by mast cell and eosinophilic inflammation. Recently, {{it has been}} reported that the expression of discoidin, CUB and LCCL domain-containing protein 2 (DCBLD 2) is up-regulated in lung cancers and is regulated by transcription factor AP- 2 alpha (TFAP 2 A), a component of activator protein- 2 (AP- 2) that is known to regulate IL- 8 production in human lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells. To investigate the associations between AERD and DCBLD 2 polymorphisms, 12 common variants were genotyped in 163 AERD subjects and 429 aspirin tolerant asthma (ATA) controls. Among these variants, seven SNPs (rs 1371687, rs 7615856, rs 828621, rs 828618, rs 828616, rs 1062196, and rs 8833) and one haplotype (DCBLD 2 -ht 1) show associations with susceptibility to AERD.

40|$|Purpose of reviewThis {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the most recent {{literature}} concerning the role of inflammatory genes in nasal polyposis. the data provide evidence of a pivotal role for some inflammatory mediators in the development and maintenance of nasal polyps. Recent findingsNasal polyposis is a common disease of the nasal mucosa; the exact mechanisms leading its development are still unknown. the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of this disease is poorly understood. This lack of understanding makes definitive treatment very difficult. Activated eosinophils are a prominent feature of nasal polyps. Their presence in tissue results from a complex series of events that regulates their influx from the vasculature, as well as their movement, activation and survival within the tissue. Several studies have demonstrated that there are many potent chemoattractants that can activate eosinophils and trigger the inflammatory response. SummaryCytokines, chemokines and growth factors {{play an important role in}} the persistence of mucosal inflammation associated with nasal polyps. Metalloproteinases seem to be crucial in nasal tissue remodeling in these patients. Arachidonic acid metabolites seem to be particularly important in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps in patients with <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> We discuss the contribution of each one for the polyp formation.

The identification of <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> is therefore essential to avoid serious aspirin complications. The goal {{of the study was to}} develop plasma biomarkers to predict AERD. We identified differentially expressed genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) between subjects with AERD and those with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA). The genes were matched with the secreted protein database ([URL] to select candidate proteins in the plasma. Plasma levels of the candidate proteins were then measured in AERD (n =  40) and ATA (n =  40) subjects using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Target genes were validated as AERD biomarkers using an ROC curve analysis. From 175 differentially expressed genes (p-value < 0. 0001) that were queried to the secreted protein database, 11 secreted proteins were retrieved. The gene expression patterns were predicted as elevated for 7 genes and decreased for 4 genes in AERD as compared with ATA subjects. Among these genes, significantly higher levels of plasma eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (RNASE 2) were observed in AERD as compared with ATA subjects (70 (14. 62 ∼ 311. 92) µg/ml vs. 12 (2. 55 ∼ 272. 84) µg/ml, p-value < 0. 0003).

40|$|Drug allergy {{refers to}} a {{hypersensitivity}} reaction for which either an IgE or T-cell-mediated mechanism is demonstrated. The recognition of the drug by B and T cells is influenced by variants of HLA genes. The genetic factors involved in IgE-mediated mechanisms have been studied mainly in beta-lactam reactions, and {{they appear to be}} related to human leukocyte antigen presentation (HLA A 2 and DRw 52), TNFA - 308 G>A, class switching to IgE by B cells (variants of IL- 13 and of IL- 4 RA), and expression of IgE receptors on target cells (variant of the FcepsilonRIbeta gene). Delayed T-cell-mediated reactions are also associated with HLA alleles. Studies have reported an association of HLA-B* 1502 and HLA-B* 5801 in patients with the Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis provoked by carbamazepine, as well as of HLA-B* 5701 with abacavir hypersensitivity. HLA-B* 5701 seems to be a strong predictor in whites, but not in Hispanics or Africans. Carbamazepine hypersensitivity is also influenced by gene variants of cytochrome P 450 enzymes on the generation of reactive metabolites, while CYP 2 C 9 * 2 and CYP 2 C 9 * 3 polymorphisms influence the bioactivation of sulfamethoxazole in prohapten. Pharmacogenetic studies on <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> have identified distinct types of predictors, such as HLA genotypes, a polymorphism in the promoter of the FcepsilonRIalpha gene, and variants in genes of enzymes from the arachidonic acid pathway. In the future, identification of genetic predictors will benefit from genomewide association studies that also take ethnic differences into account. Ideally, predictors will help to prevent adverse reactions, as suggested by a recent study on the effectiveness of prospective HLA-B* 5701 screening to prevent hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir in HIV patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Nasal {{polyposis}} (NP) is {{an inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} nasal mucosa and paranasal sinuses. Mitochondria are the cellular organelles which produce cellular energy by Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and they have own inheritance material, mtDNA. mtDNA is affected by reactive oxygen samples (ROS) which are produced by both OXPHOS and the inflammatory process. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the 4977 bp and 7400 bp deletions of mtDNA in nasal polyposis tissue, and to indicate the possible association of mtDNA deletions with NP. Methods: Thirty-three patients, aged 15 to 65 years, with nasal polyposis were selected to be assessed for mitochondrial DNA deletions. The patients with possible mtDNA mutations due to mitochondrial disease, being treated with radiotherapy, of advanced age, with a familiar history, <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> or a history of asthma, were excluded. Polyp excision surgery was applied to the treatment of the NP, and after histopathological diagnosis 1 x 1 cm of polyp tissue samples were used to isolate mtDNA. The 4977 bp and 7400 bp deletion regions, and two control regions of mtDNA were assessed by using four pairs of primers. DNA extractions from the NP tissues and peripheral blood samples of the patients were made, and then Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) were made. PCR products were separated in 2 % agarose gel. Results: No patient had either the 4977 bp deletion or the 7400 bp deletion in their NP tissue, and neither were these deletions evident in their peripheral blood. Two control sequences, one of them from a non-deleted region, and the other from a possible deletion region, were detected in the NP tissues and peripheral blood of all the patients. Conclusions: We had anticipated that some mtDNA deletion might have occurred in NP tissue due to the increased ROS levels caused by chronic inflammation, but we did not detect any deletion. Probably, the duration of inflammation in NP is insufficient to form mtDNA deletions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Inside the {{paranasal}} sinuses, multiple saclike masses protrude {{from the}} lining, blocking one’s {{sense of taste}} and smell, clogging one’s nose with nasal congestion, and causing a continuous runny nose with postnasal drip. This is a common case of nasal polyposis. Nasal polyposis affects up to four percent of the general population, {{making it one of}} the most common chronic diseases of the upper respiratory tract (Settipane 1996). Moreover, in cadaveric studies, the prevalence has been as high as 40 % (Larson et al 1994). Nasal polyps commonly occur in adults over the age of 40, predominantly in males—with a 2 : 1 ratio of males to females. Young children with nasal polyps typically are diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (Mayo Clinic Staff 2011). Though polyps can be removed through Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery, they redevelop over time. In addition to surgical methods, physicians prescribe oral and nasal corticosteroids and antileukotrienes. Though immunotherapy treatment is not a traditional form of treatment in medical literature, there are many studies indicating that allergies may contribute to nasal polyposis. In Kentucky, where there are high counts of pollen, there may be a positive association between immunotherapy and nasal polyp recurrence. This local, retrospective study of 90 patients, with pathologically reported nasal polyps, researched any correlations between the recurrence of polyps and the use of immunotherapy treatment. It was found that immunotherapy treatment had no statistically significant effect on the number of revision surgeries or on the time to the recurrence of nasal polyps. Asthma and <b>aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> had statistically significant correlations with higher CT scores or more severe disease. Though allergies were dominant in most of the sample population, eosinophilic presence in polyp tissue was not found to have any significant effect on the CT score (based on the Lund-Mackay staging system). Increasing the CT score indicated a shorter time to a polyp recurrence. Thus, it is recommended that patients 4 seek immediate care of polyps at lower stages of disease. More studies need to be conducted to determine any significant associations with immunotherapy treatment and nasal polyposis recurrence. Also, further studies are needed to verify the effectiveness of the recommendation for patients to treat polyps at the earliest stage to prevent further removals, chronic symptoms, and financial investments...|$|E

In the field of asthma and rhinitis, the relationship between airway inflammation and airway dysfunction was of perennial interest to investigators, as were phenotypes and biomarkers. <b>Aspirin</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> appeared in studies in several papers and there was new interest in asthma in the elderly. The mechanisms involved in allergic disease describe advances in our understanding of T cell responses, the relationship between inflammation and disease, mast cell and basophil activation, steroid resistance and novel therapies. In the section dealing with epidemiology, studies seeking to identify risk factors for allergic disease including vitamin D are prominent, as once again are studies investigating gene-environment interactions. The clinical allergy section focuses on drug allergy, food allergy and immunotherapy. The area of oral immunotherapy for food allergy is well covered and we were grateful to Stephen Durham for guest editing an outstanding special issue on immunotherapy in the centenary year of Leonard Noon's pioneering work.
