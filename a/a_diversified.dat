(Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers <b>a</b> <b>diversified</b> understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom of This World. There exists remarkable respect for accuracy on all sides including historical facts, character names, place names, and even street names. This adds to the key blend of marvellous fantasy and historical accuracy.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly {{directed}} Puss Gets the Boot, {{which was}} nominated for an Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject. The studio wanted <b>a</b> <b>diversified</b> cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Barbera and Hanna's supervisor, Fred Quimby, {{did not want to}} produce more cat and mouse cartoons believing that there were already enough cartoons of those in existence. Surprised by the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Barbera and Hanna ignored Quimby's resistance and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Barbera and Hanna met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing Puss Gets the Boot, he never actually worked on it. Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, Tom and Jerry.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century, Shakespeare became {{associated}} with rising British nationalism, and Boydell tapped {{into the same}} mood that many other entrepreneurs were exploiting. Shakespeare appealed not only to a social elite who prided themselves on their artistic taste, {{but also to the}} emerging middle class who saw in Shakespeare's works a vision of <b>a</b> <b>diversified</b> society. The mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival was probably most responsible for reintroducing the British public to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus few good tragedies were written. Shakespeare's works filled the gap in the repertoire, and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{four major}} {{industries}} shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil. Before {{and after the}} U.S. Civil War the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic driver for the state, thus creating the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major petroleum deposits (Spindletop in particular) that initiated an economic boom which became {{the driving force behind}} the economy for much of the 20th century. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed <b>a</b> <b>diversified</b> economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2015, it is second on the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with 54. With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the nation in state export revenue since 2002, and has the second-highest gross state product. If it were a country, Texas would be the 10th largest economy in the world.|$|E

40|$|CREDITOR RIGHTS AND RISK-TAKING PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In this Master’s thesis I {{study how}} {{creditor}} rights affect risk-taking of companies. Firstly, I analyze whether {{the level of}} creditor protection {{is associated with a}} higher probability of <b>a</b> <b>diversifying</b> acquisition. Secondly, I assess whether creditor protection is associated with a less risky mode of operation. Thirdly, I analyze factors, which could increase the probability of <b>a</b> <b>diversifying</b> acquisition. The main focus will be given to creditor rights’ effect on the probability to do <b>a</b> <b>diversifying</b> acquisition. Other analyses cover creditor rights’ effect on the post-merger performance of diversifying acquisitions, leverage, cash flow risk and the probability of companies operating in a low-recovery asset value industry to acquire a target from a high-recovery value industry. DATA My sample consists of 11785 completed mergers and acquisitions during a period of 1990 – 2010, which is gathered from SDC Platinium. The transactions are from in total of 37 countries. The financial data regarding the sample companies is retrieved from Thomson ONE banker and SDC Platinium. The creditor rights index used as the main explanatory variable is from Djankov et al (2007) and the shareholder rights index is constructed by Spamann (2010). The data of country level data is derived from various sources, mostly from the World bank databases. RESULTS I find an association between the level of creditor protection and probability to do <b>a</b> <b>diversifying</b> acquisition. Also the performance of diversifying acquisitions deteriorates in the strength of creditor rights. Additionally, I find a negative association between the level of creditor protection and leverage. I do not find strong empirical results on the potential association between creditor rights and cash flow risk and the probability of companies operating in a low-recovery asset value industry to acquire a target from a high-recovery value industry. The results are mostly in line with Acharya, Amihud and Litov (2009). KEYWORDS Investor protection, creditor rights, mergers & acquisitions, risk-takin...|$|R
