While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> to herself {{about the prospect of}} having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child at her age, as nothing is too hard for God. Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.|$|E
500|$|According to Jean-Claude Déquéant, Farmer showed limited enthusiasm {{during the}} demo {{recordings}} and declared: [...] "The voice was surprisingly present <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> after each take when listening". Dahan was satisfied, because Farmer {{had a clear}} and deep voice and could easily reach high notes. Initial rehearsals were held at Dahan's home. Dahan has said of these rehearsals: [...] "There was a large room with a piano and there we repeated the staging of the song. Mylène {{had a hard time}} understanding all this, we had to teach her everything, starting with the choreography [...] This probably did not look very professional." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] when Abram was ninety-nine years old, God {{declared}} his new name: [...] "Abraham"– [...] "a father of many nations", {{and gave him}} the covenant of circumcision. God gave Sarai the new name [...] "Sarah", and blessed her. Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child [...] "Isaac" [...] (Hebrew yitschaq, [...] "laughter") and circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, [...] "God hath made me to laugh, [...] all that hear will laugh with me." [...] Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company. Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked.|$|E

60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> {{in spite}} of herself. It sounded so like an echo of Miss Cornelia.|$|R
60|$|El-Soo {{thought for}} a moment, and saw the error she had made. <b>She</b> smiled, <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>laughed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then he laughed, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> also, but as yet she did {{not take}} the ring.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped for}} a moment, her arms {{tightened}} over her bosom, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> to herself--a hard, harsh, angry laugh.|$|E
60|$|Miss Fonblanque {{went into}} fits of laughter. ‘Excellent,’ said she, ‘it {{will be the}} most humorous scene.’ <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> again.|$|E

6000|$|... “Then {{my husband}} will lose his order,” Mrs. Jaques replied, <b>and</b> though <b>she</b> <b>laughed,</b> Jimmy thought her answer had some significance.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with her {{brilliant}} eyes that seemed to have undergone some transfiguration, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>laughed,</b> with a terrible merriment.|$|E

60|$|She {{looked at}} him for a moment <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>laughed.</b> Tavernake felt a sense of relief; at least she was not angry.|$|R

5000|$|The {{neurosurgeon}} Wilder Penfield met {{the couple}} in 1928 and recalled Vogt-Mugnier with distinction: [...] "Oskar Vogt's wife listens while she looks at something remote with her widely separated eyes <b>and</b> <b>laughs.</b> <b>She</b> is tall <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>laughs</b> almost continuously. <b>She</b> seems unaware that her glasses are about to fall off her nose, that the maid makes noises with things at the table so her husband has to correct her. Her attention is eagerly on one thing - her husband's unstoppable flow of learned conversation." [...] Her intelligence often surprised people and certainly left those who encountered her with a lasting impression: ...|$|R
