40|$|More Greasy, More Selective: <b>Amine-capped</b> Pt 3 Co nanocatalysts were {{synthesized}} {{and used}} for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL). Capping the catalysts with amines that contain long carbon chains results in an ordered surface 'array' (see scheme), in which high selectivity towards Ci-O hydrogenation can be achieved because the Ci-C bond in CAL does not interact with the surface. The longer the carbon chains in the amine, the higher the selectivity. Copyright 漏 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a non-covalent method was {{employed}} to modify hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanoplatelets through pi-pi interaction of <b>amine-capped</b> aniline trimer (AT), {{which resulted in a}} stable dispersion of h-BN nanoplatelets in organic solvents. Meanwhile, epoxy coatings containing different content of h-BN nanoplatelets were fabricated, and corresponding corrosion protection performance and wear resistance were investigated. Results showed that the 1. 0 wt% h-BN/ epoxy coating has better corrosion protection performance than other coatings, which was due to the good barrier properties from stably dispersed h-BN nanoplatelets and the passivating effect from AT. Besides, the addition of h-BN nanoplatelets also contributed to the improvement in wear resistance of epoxy the coating...|$|E

The unlinked AlC 4 Pc molecules were separated from AuNRs@SiO 2 NPs after synthesis completion via centrifugation at 7, 500  rpm for 30  min three times. By measuring the fluorescence intensity of every supernatant solution, the amount of unlinked AlC 4 Pc was deduced via a calibration curve plotted with known concentrations.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the spectroscopic properties of CdSe and CdSe–ZnS nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) {{in the presence of}} the electron acceptor tetracyanoethene (TCNE) in organic solution. Our results indicate that TCNE reacts with the n-alkylamine capping ligands at the surfaces of nanocrystals to generate (cyanovinyl) amine products that remain bound to the surfaces of the QDs, substantially increasing their emission efficiency. Further addition of an excess of TCNE caused a decrease in the luminescence intensity, most likely because of an electron-transfer quenching process from the photoexcited nanocrystals to the electron-accepting TCNE molecules. TCNE-induced emission enhancement was also observed for the strongly luminescent CdSe–ZnS core–shell QDs. This approach enables a post-synthetic adjustment of the luminescence efficiency of <b>amine-capped</b> QDs. We have also shown that the threshold-dependent response of the QD emission on the TCNE concentration can be used to encode NAND and XOR Boolean logic operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrode}} {{reactions and}} pathways {{involved in the}} electrochemical fabrication of highly ordered ultrathin ZnO nanorod/nanobelt arrays in alkaline solutions of amine-alcohol mixtures are systematically studied and revealed. These include electrochemical surface oxidation of the Zn cathode to Zn(OH) (4) (2 -), simultaneous in situ nucleation of ZnO from the Zn(OH) (4) (2 -) ions on the cathode, and subsequent <b>amine-capped</b> growth into the ZnO nanobelt/nanorod arrays. It is shown that the growth step can also be supported by the Zn(OH) (4) (2 -) source from the anodic oxidation, and the growth from this source actually yields much more uniform and smooth nanobelt/nanorod arrays than those from only the cathodic source. Furthermore, the strategy has been successfully applied to the fabrication of a ZnO nanorod array on an ITO substrate covered with a Zn film, which promises exciting applications in solar cell and sensor devices...|$|E

In this study, we successfully prepared hBN nanosheets with a thickness of a few atoms by using <b>amine-capped</b> aniline trimer (AT) as dispersant. Epoxy/hBN nanocomposites were prepared by curing reaction of epoxy E 51, Jeffamine D 230 and AT-modified hBN nanosheets, where the hBN contents were 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 wt%. An increase in contact angle of the epoxy/hBN nanocomposites was evident in the presence of hBN nanosheets, implying an increase in the hydrophobic nature of the composites. The as-prepared composites exhibited enhanced mechanical and tribological performance compared to pure epoxy resin. This effectiveness in improving the mechanical, friction and wear behavior of the epoxy composites could be attributed to the complementary action of excellent mechanical properties, lubrication and thermal conductivity of hBN nanofillers.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{interfacial}} adhesion of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites (CFRP), carbon fiber usually {{has to be}} carried out surface treatment under harsh conditions. However, enhancing the interfacial property is usually accompanied by deteriorating tensile strength of carbon fiber, due to some defects on fiber surfaces after surface modification. In this paper, a layer of <b>amine-capped</b> poly (cyclotriphosphazene-co- 4, 4 '-oxydianiline) coating was introduced onto the carbon fiber surfaces by a facile in-situ polymerization under mild condition. The amines on polyphosphazene coating surface help to improve the surface wettability and activity of carbon fibers, significantly improving the interfacial shear strength of carbon fiber/epoxy composites by 70. 5 %. Besides the enhanced surface wettability, the chemical bonds also {{play a key role in}} such an interfacial enhancement. Moreover, the polyphosphazene sheath can heal the surface defects of fiber effectively, thus increasing the fiber tensile strength by more than 10. 0 %. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{single step}} {{process for the}} {{synthesis}} of size-controlled silver nanoparticles has been developed using a bifunctional molecule, octadecylamine (ODA). Octadecylamine complexes to Ag+ ions electrostatically, reduce them, and subsequently stabilizes the nanoparticles thus formed. Hence, octadecylamine simultaneously functions as both a reducing and a stabilizing agent. The <b>amine-capped</b> nanoparticles can be obtained {{in the form of}} dry powder, which is readily redispersible in aqueous and organic solvents. The particle size, and the nucleation and growth kinetics of silver nanoparticles could be tuned by varying the molar ratio of ODA to AgNO 3. The UV-vis spectra of nanoparticles prepared with different concentrations of ODA displayed the well-defined plasmon band with maximum absorption around 425 nm. The formation of silver metallic nanoparticles was confirmed by their XRD pattern. The binding of ODA molecule on the surface of silver has been studied by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. The formation of well-dispersed spherical Ag nanoparticles has been confirmed by TEM analysis. The particle size and distribution are found to be dependent on the molar concentration of the amine molecule.

40|$|Novel trianiline {{containing}} {{water soluble}} polyurethane (TAPU) was synthesized by polymerization of polyethylene glycol, toluene diisocyanate and <b>amine-capped</b> aniline trimer. The influence of TAPU on the corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 1 M HCl was investigated using weight loss measurements, potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The performance of TAPU on the corrosion inhibition of mild steel was also evidenced by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Results confirmed that the adsorption of TAPU on the mild steel surface and consequent inhibition of the corrosion process. The inhibition efficiency (IE%) increased with a rise in TAPU concentration, reaching a value up to 97 % at a concentration of 200 mg/l. Potentiodynamic polarization curves showed that the TAPU affected both cathodic and anodic protection and was a mixed type inhibitor in HCl corrosive medium. Adsorption isotherm studies confirmed that the adsorption of TAPU on the mild steel surface in 1 M HCl solution obeyed Langmuir adsorption isotherm. EDS analysis determined the adsorption of TAPU molecules on the steel surface, and the absorbed TAPU provided an effective corrosion inhibition in 1 M HCl solution from observation of surface morphology by SEM and AFM...|$|E

40|$|PtSn {{bimetallic}} nanoparticles {{with different}} particle sizes (1 - 9 nm), metal compositions (Sn content of 10 - 80 mol %), and organic capping agents (e. g., amine, thiol, carboxylic acid and polymer) were synthesized by colloidal chemistry methods. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements show that, {{depending on the}} particle size, the as-prepared bimetallic nanocrystals have quasi-spherical or faceted shapes. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses indicate that for all samples the signals of both Pt and Sn can be detected from single nanoparticles, confirming that the products are actually bimetallic but not only a physical mixture of pure Pt and Sn metal nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were also conducted on the bimetallic particle systems. When compared with the diffraction patterns of monometallic Pt nanoparticles, the bimetallic samples show distinct shifts of the Bragg reflections to lower degrees, which gives clear proof of the alloying o f Pt with Sn. However, a quantitative analysis of the lattice parameter shifts indicates that {{only part of the}} Sn atoms are incorporated into the alloy nanocrystals. This is consistent with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements that reveal the segregation of Sn at the surfaces of the nanocrystals. Moreover, short PtSn bimetallic nanowires were synthesized by a seed-mediated growth method with <b>amine-capped</b> bimetallic particles as precursors.

40|$|Alkylamine-capped gold nanocrystals {{have been}} used as {{chemically}} sensitive resistors for the detection of volatile organic mercaptan vapors. Thin (< 1 x 10 - 4 cm) films of Au nanocrystals in the ≈ 7 nm size regime capped with dodecylamines were used to produce dc electrical resistances of (10 kΩ – 10 MΩ) when deposited onto interdigitated Au/Cr electrodes. These chemiresistive vapor detectors displayed a reversible increase in dc electrical resistance when exposed to non-thiol-containing organic vapors such as water, acetone, or toluene delivered at a constant fraction of their vapor pressure (P/P o = 0. 050), with ∆R/Rb responses to these vapors of typically only ≈ 5 %. In contrast, the <b>amine-capped</b> Au nanocrystal films exhibited a much larger, irreversible, decrease in resistance upon exposure to vapors possessing the thiol (-SH) functionality, including H 2 S, CH 3 SH, and propanethiol. Optical spectroscopic data supports the hypothesis that the thiols displace the amine caps, allowing the gold cores to move closer and in some cases enter into contact, thereby lowering the film resistance. Consistently, the resistance of such films did not decrease upon exposure to octanethiol. At least for CH 3 SH, the rate of resistance change under repeated experimental conditions allows extraction of the concentration of the thiol species over the range of 0. 004 – 1. 5 ppm in air. 2 - 3 I...|$|E

Here we report the development of a simple and sensitive nucleic acid sequence-based and Ru(bpy) (3) (2 +) -doped silica nanoparticle-labeled lateral flow assay which achieves low limit of detection by using fluorescencent nanoparticles. The detection of the synthetic nucleic acid sequences representative of Trypanosoma mRNA, the causative agent for African sleeping sickness, was utilized to demonstrate this assay. The 30 nm spherical Ru(bpy) (3) (2 +) -doped silica nanoparticles were prepared in aqueous medium by a novel method recently reported. The nanoparticles were modified by 3 -glycidoxypropyl trimeth oxysilane in order to conjugate to <b>amine-capped</b> oligonucleotide reporter probes. The fluorescent intensities of the fluorescent assays were quantified on a mictrotiter plate reader using a custom holder. The experimental results showed that the lateral flow fluorescent assay developed was more sensitive compared with the traditional colloidal gold test strips.

40|$|The {{performance}} of carbon fiber reinforced composites is {{to a great}} extent dictated by the interfacial adhesion strength between the fibers and matrix. In order to improve the interfacial properties of carbon fiber/polypropylene (PP) composites, a new surface treatment has been developed to graft the <b>amine-capped</b> cross-linked polyphosphazenes (ACP) onto carbon fibers as a novel coupling agent through in situ polycondensation between hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) and 4, 4 '-diaminodiphenyl ether (DDE) under mild reaction conditions, and maleic anhydride grafted PP (M-PP) was used as the matrix. The chemical composition of the modified carbon fibers was verified by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The surface morphologies of the modified carbon fibers were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The interfacial shear strength (IFSS) between carbon fibers and the matrix was investigated by a microbond test. The grafted ACP with a quantity of amine groups uniformly covered the carbon fiber surfaces, which results in strong interfacial adhesion between the modified carbon fibers and M-PP. The results of the test reveal a significant improvement of IFSS in the ACP grafted carbon fiber composites with an increase of 223. 0 % compared to the unmodified carbon fiber composites.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{a simple and}} {{reproducible}} technique for the synthesis of a silver organosol is reported from a specific silver precursor, solid silver acetate. Molten hexadecylamine acts as a solvent for silver acetate and imparts stability to the evolved nanoparticles. The <b>amine-capped</b> organosol shows unique stability as neither agglomeration nor oxidation takes place over one year. The synthesised silver particles have been characterised by UV-visible, TEM, XRD, XPS, FTIR and thermogravimetric studies. The hexadecylamine-stabilised silver organosol {{was employed to examine}} the altered optical properties in different solvent systems and with different ligands by accounting for the changes in the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectrum. It was observed that the position of the surface plasmon band of silver nanoparticles is greatly affected by the solvents and ligands under consideration. The quantitative alteration of the LSPR spectrum involving encapsulated nanoparticles in a dielectric ligand shell has been rationalised from Mie theory. It has also been shown that cationic and anionic surfactants of different chain lengths induce changes in the optical properties of silver nanoparticles whereas, zwitterionic amino acid molecules reflect insignificant changes in the LSPR spectrum. The max of the LSPR gradually shifts to red with the increase in chain length of both the cationic and anionic surfactants, indicating specific binding of the surfactant molecules around silver nanoparticles. Finally the affinity of the synthesised silver nanoparticles for amine molecules has been accounted for by taking the HSAB principle into consideration...|$|E
40|$|Enhancement of {{photoluminescence}} (PL) {{is observed}} for light-shielded dodecylamine-capped colloidal CdTe quantum dots (CdTe/DDA QDs) dispersed in toluene after washing and recapping. The PL quantum yield (QY) increases from 19 % to 25 % in 25 hours, indicating gradual {{reconstruction of the}} surface. This enhancement is contrasted with PL quenching of light-shielded CdTe QDs recapped with octadecylamine (CdTe/ODA), for which the QY decreases from 17 % to 15 % in 26 hours. The differences in PL evolution are explained {{by the presence of}} ligand-imposed energy barriers on the order of kT and > kT for surface reconstruction of the DDA- and ODA-capped surfaces, respectively. This is supported by the observation of enhancement of the PL QY from 19 % to 27 % in 26 hours for CdTe/DDA and 17 % to 21 % for CdTe/ODA QDs that are exposed to short flashes of 400 nm light. The kinetics are related to interactions between amine alkyl chains by vibrational spectroscopy. The results demonstrate the active involvement of the amine capping layer in NC surface reconstruction. A model is proposed that explains this form of surface reconstruction as a transition from a state in which the rigid capping layer imposes disorder on the NC, to a state in which the NC dictates the configuration of the capping layer. It is suggested that illumination locally heats the capping layer of QDs in which the exciton decays non-radiatively, so that the effect is similar to earlier reports of luminescence temperature antiquenching in <b>amine-capped</b> CdSe QDs...|$|E
40|$|Trypanosoma such as Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative {{agents for}} African {{sleeping}} sickness and Chagas disease, respectively, have important influence on human health. The {{methods such as}} microscopic examination, immunological methods, and molecular methods are used for the identification and detection of Trypanosoma, {{but none of these}} methods are ideal to mass screening of samples such as onset of outbreak, epidemiological surveys, and blood unit screening. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} an assay which can rapidly, sensitively and specifically detect Trypanosoma. In this study, Ru(bpy) 32 +-doped silica nanoparticles (RuSNP) were used to target nucleic acid sequences in a lateral flow fluorescent assay. This assay was developed to improve the sensitivity and lower the limit of detection as compared to the traditional lateral flow assay. The assay targeted both the spliced leader sequence as well as the polyA tail of the mRNA. The surface of spherical RuSNP was modified by glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GOPTMS). Amine-terminated oligonucleotides as a bioreceptor were immobilized onto the RuSNP via the interaction between the NH 2 and the epoxy group of the GOPTMS. The conjugate complexes formed were immobilized on the conjugate pad, and the capture oligonucleotides used for test and control lines were immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane. The effects of the amount of RuSNP, GOPTMS, <b>amine-capped</b> oligonucleotides, and capture oligonucleotides on the test line on the performance of the test strips were investigated and optimized. The fluorescence intensity was evaluated by using a fluorescent microplate reader. The experimental results showed that the nucleic acid sequence-based and RuSNP-labeled lateral flow assay was very sensitive compared with the gold-labeled test strips and the chemiluminescent test strips we developed previously, and that the limit of detection (LOD) of the test strips developed is 0. 4 fmol.

40|$|International audienceInterest in {{colloidal}} {{zinc oxide}} (ZnO) quantum dots (QDs) is nourished by the {{wide spectrum of}} ZnO QDs applications in advanced technologies, in particular UV lasers, solar cells or biomedical labels. ZnO QDs are especially attractive for in vivo diagnostic applications due to their very low toxicity compared to cadmium chalcogenide based QDs like CdSe. However, {{due to the traditional}} concept that ZnO is non-toxic, the toxicology studies of ZnO QDs are farther behind the speed of their application developments. In recent years, with the rise and development of nanotoxicology, health risks of ZnO QDs are gradually of concern, especially when these nanoparticles are submitted to UV-light irradiation. An innovative study aimed at understanding the influence of the size and of the surface coating of ZnO QDs on their ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) was undertaken. ZnO QDs with diameters varying between 3. 5 and 5. 0 nm were prepared via the sol-gel method and dispersed in water using hydrophilic aminosilanes. Zwitterionic- or negatively-charged ZnO QDs were prepared from aminosilanes-capped dots by reaction with propane sultone and succinic anhydride, respectively. Aqueous dispersions of these QDs were found to produce ROS, namely hydroxyl (OH•) and superoxide (O 2 •-) radicals, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and singlet oxygen (1 O 2), upon light activation. Results obtained demonstrate that ROS-production is associated with the size and the surface functionalization of the nanocrystals. For example, a high level of OH• radicals was observed with <b>amine-capped</b> dots while zwitterionic or PEGylated ZnO QDs generate significantly less of these radicals (up to 10 -fold). Moreover, at equal zinc content, a remarkable decrease of ROS production is observed when decreasing the diameter of the dots from 5. 0 to 3. 5 nm. The role/importance of ZnO nanocrystals defects, of biological spectator ions (Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, NO 3 -, CO 32 -, …), of the temperature, of pH, of the biological medium, and of various biomolecules on ROS generation were also evaluated. Collectively, data obtained provide new insights of the toxicological impacts of ZnO QDs that can be exploited for engineering ZnO nanoparticles for intended applications (bio-imaging or therapy) ...|$|E

Otherwise quite reactive towards atmosphere, the desired Cu NPs were stabilized by incorporating the metal in inert matrix of Au to produce AuxCu 1 -xNPs (x= 0 to 1). For the purpose both single- and two-phase wet chemical routes having various combinations of stabilizers, reductants and reaction media were employed and the NPs {{were characterized by}} various pertinent techniques such as UV-visible and FTIR spectroscopy, TEM, HRTEM, STEM, elemental analysis, XPS and XRD. The NPs synthesized using alkyl amines, acting as both phase transfer agents and stabilizers, were {{not only in the}} desired size range but also exhibited adequate stability. However, the most interesting feature of <b>amine-capped</b> bimetallic NPs, confirmed using HRTEM, STEM and XPS measurements, was the surface segregation of Cu. From the temperature dependent XRD studies higher crystallinity in the cores of AuxCu 1 -x NPs has been established. As for the pure Cu nanostructures, they were produced on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) from acidified SO 42 − and Cl− media using chronoamperometry (CA), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry on rotating GCE (RDE); the techniques also provided useful information such as optimal conditions to be applied for the CO 2 reduction reaction (CRR) on in-situ produced Cu nanostructures. Regarding the Cu nucleation, CV study provided various relevant parameters and CA data fitted to the Scharifker-Hills models furnished information on kinetics and mechanism while RDE experiments were utilized to find out kinetic current density (jk) and rate constant (kf) of the process. FESEM coupled with EDX clearly demonstrated formation of Cu nano-dendrites. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) has been used to establish products of the CRR. From the above mentioned electrochemical techniques it has been demonstrated that instead of using bulk Cu, addition of just few mM Cu(II) in the reaction mixture produces more efficient and durable in-situ catalyst for the CRR. Compared to SO 4 2 − it is better to use Cl− medium which renders stability to Cu(I) centers that have additional role towards higher catalytic activity of the insitu Cu. An interesting phenomenon observed for the CO 2 -saturated solutions is the splitting of Cu anodic peak with the Cl− concentration; a mechanism has been proposed which could very well be substantiated by additional CV experiments carried out in the presence of Cu(I) and CO.
