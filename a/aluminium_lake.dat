50|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} that aluminium in antiperspirants causes skin irritation. Nonetheless, its occurrence in antiperspirants, dyes (such as <b>aluminium</b> <b>lake),</b> and food additives has caused concern. Although there {{is little evidence}} that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adults, some studies point to risks associated with increased exposure to the metal. Aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water. It is classified as a non-carcinogen by the US Department of Health and Human Services.|$|E
30|$|Mixing eosin (Pigment Red 90) and phloxine B (Acid Red 92) is {{mentioned}} in the historical treatise The Dyeing of Paper Pulp by Julius Erfurt, a practical manual, dated 1901, for use by papermakers, paper stainers, students and others, and phloxine B was detected by FT-Raman {{in one of the}} samples of actual dyed papers included in the book to illustrate each recipe [27]. In this case, it can be hypothesised that phloxine B was present in the powder as its <b>aluminium</b> <b>lake,</b> known as Pigment Red 174.|$|E
50|$|These stains are {{commonly}} employed for histological studies. The mordants used to demonstrate nuclear and cytoplasmic structures are alum and iron, forming lakes or coloured complexes (dye-mordant-tissue complexes), the colour {{of which will}} depend on the salt used. <b>Aluminium</b> salt <b>lakes</b> are usually coloured blue-white, whereas ferric salt lakes are coloured blue-black.|$|R
50|$|The sixty-third {{report was}} {{released}} as World Health Organization Technical Report Series No. 928 in 2005. The first part deals with food additives such as benzyol peroxide, cyclodextrin, hexose oxidase, lutein, hydroxy ethylidine-1, 1-diphosphonic acid, steviol glycosides, D-tagatose, xylanses from Bacillus subtilis, and zeaxanthin. The second part {{is dedicated to}} revision of specifications on aluminium powder, iron oxides and titanium oxides; <b>aluminium</b> <b>lakes</b> of coloring matters, hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium sulphate, polyvinyl alcohol and metal levels and arsenic specifications. The third part deals with eight groups of flavoring agents such as pyridine, pyrrole and quinoline derivatives; aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons; aliphatic, linear, unsaturated aldehydes, acids and related alcohols, acetals and related esters; monocyclic and bicyclic secondary alcohols, ketones and related esters; amino acid and related substances; tetrahydrofuran and furanone derivatives and Phenyl substituted aliphatic alcohols and related aldehydes and esters. The fourth part deals with safety aspects related to glycyrrhizinic acid, and its monoammonium salt as a natural constituent of liquorice and its use as a flavoring substance in various food products.|$|R
50|$|Carmine dyes, {{which give}} crimson and related red and purple colors, {{are based on}} an {{aluminium}} and calcium salt of carminic acid. Carmine <b>lake</b> is an <b>aluminium</b> or aluminium-tin <b>lake</b> of cochineal extract, and crimson lake is prepared by striking down an infusion of cochineal with a 5 percent solution of alum and cream of tartar. Purple lake is prepared like carmine lake {{with the addition of}} lime to produce the deep purple tone. Carmine dyes tend to fade quickly.|$|R
30|$|Finally, sample P. 11, {{labelled}} as “Laq. Brune d’Alizarine”, contained not only alizarin (most probably of synthetic origin), but also Mordant Yellow 1, an early synthetic dye {{available on the}} market since 1887, known also as alizarin yellow. This species was identified based on {{the interpretation of the}} DAD and tandem mass spectra, and by comparison with the data presented in [47]. Since the sodium salt of Mordant Yellow 1 water is soluble, it was most probably incorporated into sample P. 11 in an insoluble form, precipitated onto an inert substrate or most probably as its <b>aluminium</b> <b>lake</b> [48].|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{colorants}} based on renewable resources and food-grade colorants {{have been evaluated}} for use in polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylchloride (PVC). It {{has been found that}} most of these colorants can be processed in PP at 200 degreesC or even 260 degreesC while maintaining good color intensity and color brightness. The colorants evaluated cover {{a large part of the}} color spectrum. In PP, the light stability of alizarin (red), carmine (red), indigo (blue), purpurin (red), quinizarin (red), and the aluminium lakes of quinoline yellow (yellow) and indigo carmine (blue) is close to the requirements for indoor applications. The blue colorants indigo and the <b>aluminium</b> <b>lake</b> of indigo carmine are, in principle, sufficiently light stable in PP for indoor applications. A few colorants showed bleeding from PP. Bonding of migrating colorants to the reactive carrier maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene, however, reduced bleeding of the colorant to a large extent. Also after processing in PVC at 200 degreesC, good color intensity and saturation is maintained. Quinizarin, a structural analog of alizarin and purpurin, shows a light stability performance that is close to commercial lead chromate/molybdate orange based colorants. The best performing natural colorants are sufficiently heat and light stable for applications where moderate properties concerning heat resistance and (UV) light stability are required, such as underground PVC water drainage pipes and indoor PP applications.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{seasonal}} variation in aluminium toxicity in caged brown trout (Salmo trutta), during one year (October 1994 to September 1995) in a small acidic <b>aluminium</b> rich <b>lake,</b> Lake Nepptjern (ANC - 22. 6 μeq l- 1, pH 5. 2, total Al 400 μg l- 1). Trout from two and three different year classes were exposed each month to the lake water for 48 h. Fish were placed in keepnets located {{in the middle of}} the lake, at 2 m depth. Fish mortality and water physico-chemistry were monitored during the exposures. The concentration of inorganic monomeric aluminium in the water was approximately 300 μg l- 1 in average, and the water was acutely toxic to the fish. The observed mortality varied throughout the year, and was highest during spring and summer. During spring, the small fish were more sensitive to the toxic water than larger fish, while the opposite was the case during summer. Water temperature and fish length could explain most of the seasonal variation in mortality. Statistical analyses indicated that water acid neutralising capacity (ANC) and the amounts of total organic carbon (TOC) and silicon in the water also could explain some of the variation in mortality. Variation in other physico-chemical parameters, however, such as silicon, TOC and ANC could only explain the variation in mortality to a limited extent. The mechanism for the temperature dependent mortality is discussed, and we suggest that the dependence of water O 2 -solubility and fish metabolism upon temperature is of importance. The difference in mortality between small and large fish is discussed in terms of the gill area/body weight ratio, and it seems to be that small fish suffer more from diffusive ion loss having a larger relative gill area than larger fish. Large fish, on the other hand, have a lower relative maximum oxygen uptake than small fish and will suffer more under conditions where aluminium is accumulated on the gill surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project was to {{determine}} the potential effects on biota from aluminum addition to Östhammarsfjärden (Östhammar county) for reduction of internal phosphorus loading. Potential risks to biota in the water and sediment were summarized from reports and scientific publications as well modeling based on data from an enclosure experiment where aluminum was added to the sedi- ment in Löparöfjärden (Norrtälje county) during the summer 2011. Aluminium salts have been used to reduce phosphorus in water and limit internal phosphorus loading in lakes for over forty years. <b>Aluminium</b> toxicity in <b>lakes</b> is considered negligible under neutral pH conditions because reactivity and bioavailability are generally low when pH is between 6 and 9. The toxicology literature, however, largely supports the conclusion that there is some potential for alumi- nium toxicity from treatment using aluminium salts when pH is maintained in the neutral range in fresh waters. Continuous exposures to aluminium {{are more likely to have}} adverse effects on aquatic life than single dose applications of Al-salts. Hence, the potential for adverse effects with one-time aluminium treatments lie primarily with significant aluminium floc accumulation and subsequent dis- ruption of benthic invertebrate habitat. Other short-term effects are also possible, including reduced benthic invertebrate populations and stress to certain species of fish. Elevated concentrations of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) capable of binding aluminium in the water of Östhammarsfjärden are likely to limit toxicity during and after application. Previous studies have shown that the effects are short (invertebrates) to medium term (fish), and aquatic communities affected by treatment with Al- salts generally rebound and improve from pre-treatment conditions due to increased water and habitat quality. A direct injection of aluminium to the sediment will likely limit much of the potential treat- ment impacts to plankton and fish in the water column. Given the lack of total and dissolved alumi- nium data in marine and brackish systems, it is difficult to compare the results from freshwater sys- tems directly. Although some authors recommend less restrictive limits for aluminium in marine wa- ters due to differing water chemistry, others propose more restrictive limits due to the potential for a greater diversity of aquatic species and potential toxicity to these species. Benthic species diversity appears to be somewhat poor in Östhammarsfjärden, potentially limiting any impact from treatment with Al. In addition, the experiment conducted in Löparöfjärden (which has similar water chemistry to Östhammarsfjärden) showed no significant effects on plankton, epifauna or benthic invertebrates after addition of aluminium to the sediment. Enclosure experiments were conducted at Löparöfjärden in 2011 where aluminium was added directly to the sediment and chemical data were collected. Modelling shows that elevated concentrations can be expected during the early phase after aluminium addition and that aluminium levels (mostly in the form of Al(OH) 3 or soluble Al(OH) 4 -) may be higher than what is expected from theoretical solubility calculations and in studied reference systems. Without additional data, it is difficult to explain why this occurred but aluminium solubility may be slightly enhanced under the pH and ionic strength (salt content) conditions found in the brackish water of Östhammarsfjärden. Organisms that are present in the water column may be exposed to elevated aluminium concentrations during a prolonged time pe- riod lasting from several days to weeks depending on the physical mixing of the water column after the addition. Based on the information in this report, use of aluminium salts is likely to be an effective method for reducing internal phosphorus loading in Östhammarsfjärden. Short term effects on aquatic biota should be expected, but long term improvements in the abundance and diversity of species should 27 increase due to the improvement in water quality. Given the results from the Löparöfjärden experi- ment, the risk for negative effects on plankton, epifauna and benthic fauna present in Östham- marsfjärden should be low. Because there are very few data on full scale brackish water aluminium treatments, however, we recommend a complete chemical analysis including pH, alkalinity, total or- ganic carbon and major cations and anions during a full scale treatment for the sake of better under- standing of the on-going chemical processes during aluminium addition to brackish water. The data may also be useful for describing the process or process behind the slightly elevated aluminium con- centrations seen during the Löparöfjärden experiment. We also advise examination of sediment alumi- nium and phosphorus content as well monitoring of aquatic biota following treatment to assess the potential for long term impacts of treatment on sediment chemistry and the aquatic community...|$|R
