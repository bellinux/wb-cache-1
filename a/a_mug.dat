25|$|Man with a Pipe is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 93.7 × 65.4cm (36.5 by 25.75 inches), signed JMetzinger lower right.

One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe.|$|E

500|$|In 1797, Wollstonecraft fell in {{love with}} and married the philosopher William Godwin (she had become {{pregnant}} with his child).

Wollstonecraft died in September of the same year, from complications giving birth to Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, who survived. Three-year-old Fanny, who had been scarred from smallpox, was unofficially adopted by her stepfather and given the name of Godwin. [...] Her copy of Wollstonecraft's only completed children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), has the initials [...] "F. G." [...] written in large print in it. According to the dominant interpretation of Godwin's diary, it was not until Fanny turned twelve that she was informed in an important conversation with Godwin that he was not her natural father. In the only biography of Fanny, Janet Todd disputes this reading, arguing instead that the conversation was about Fanny's future. She finds it unlikely that Fanny would have been unaware of her origins in the open and liberal Godwin household.|$|E
500|$|Noriega {{used the}} moniker [...] "El Man" [...] {{to refer to}} himself, but was also known by the {{nickname}} [...] "Pineapple Face", a name which Noriega detested, and {{which would be the}} subject of a later lawsuit.

[...] His bravado during public speeches was remarked upon by commentators; for instance, after his indictment by the U.S., he made a public speech while brandishing a machete, and declaiming [...] "Not one step back!" [...] The attitude of machismo that Noriega adopted {{has been described as a}} reaction to the persecution his brother Luis faced as an openly homosexual man in Panama and Peru. This image contrasted sharply with the impact of <b>a</b> <b>mug</b> shot taken of him after his capture, and which became a symbol of his fall from power.
