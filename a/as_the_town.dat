As there is no tow path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under the bridge and then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> {{became more}} prominent, it was {{repeatedly}} {{attacked by the}} Hanseatic League. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding {{to the north of}} Slotsholmen. In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges. In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch's {{town centre}} {{encompasses}} {{a mixture of}} traditional public houses, restaurants, coffee shops, antiquated cottages and historic listed buildings. The older part of the town dates from Saxon times and retains its Saxon street layout. The Grade II listed Mayor's Parlour was built as the market hall in 1745 {{at the far end}} of the High Street but was moved to its present position in 1849. It was enclosed and extended, and used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> hall until the civic offices were built in the mid-1970s.

5|$|Contenders seeking {{designation}} {{as the new}} Capitol included Ann Arbor, Jackson, Grand Rapids, and Shiawassee Township in Shiawassee County. At {{one point}} during the debate, Marshall officials were so certain of its selection that they built a governor's mansion. After extensive debate, State Senator Joseph H. Kilbourne of Ingham County proposed that the nearly uninhabited Lansing Township be made the seat of government. The legislature agreed, with the location north of Ann Arbor, west of Detroit, and east of Grand Rapids being deemed a suitable compromise. The legislature renamed it <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> of Michigan, though by 1848 the original name of Lansing was restored.|$|E
5|$|During the post-Civil War {{construction}} of the extended Richmond and Danville Railroad System in 1865, railroad stockholders Thomas Garner and Larkin Smith purchased land around the railroad's right-of-way and began developing the city of Buford. The city was named after Algernon Sidney Buford, who {{was president of the}} Atlanta and Richmond Air-Line Railway during the railroad's construction. The town began rapidly expanding around the railway after its completion in 1871, and it was incorporated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> of Buford on August 24, 1872, and renamed the City of Buford in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Growth came rapidly {{over the}} next few years <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> saw the {{construction}} of a bank, a public school, a city hall, several sizable industries and a series of amusement parks at present-day Treaty Oak Park. In 1910 Atlantic Boulevard opened between South Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Beaches, further cementing South Jacksonville's place as a hub for car and ferry traffic. By 1917 the town's population was ten times what it had been when it was incorporated, so local leaders planned the original Acosta Bridge, connecting Jacksonville and South Jacksonville by road for the first time.|$|E

5|$|One of Favre's {{properties}} on the Pearl River {{was originally}} settled {{by his father}} in 1767, and was inherited by Favre upon his father's death in 1782. This plantation later became known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> of Napoleon, and Favre kept a store there that later {{became a part of}} the community's church. In 1961 all the residents of the town were moved when the property was declared within the buffer zone of the John C. Stennis Space Center. Another one of his Pearl River properties became the town of Pearlington, Mississippi, where many of his children, including those of his Choctaw mistress, lived.|$|E
5|$|Reconstruction {{projects}} in the later parts of the 20th century have caused local protests by entities such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> of Hempstead and the village of Westbury. The latter was concerned about construction affecting {{the way of life}} in Westbury, and the mayor and citizens wanted confirmation that the reconstruction of Northern State Parkway exit31—the Meadowbrook State Parkway's northern terminus—would not lead to environmental disruption. In August 1998, the Meadowbrook was dedicated as the Senator Norman J. Levy Memorial Parkway in honor of Norman J. Levy, a state senator who helped sponsor the first seat belt law in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Romford {{formed a}} chapelry {{in the large}} ancient parish of Hornchurch in the Becontree hundred of Essex; as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> it {{included}} the wards of Collier Row, Harold Wood, and Noak Hill. Through ancient custom the area enjoyed special status and a charter in 1465 removed the parish from the Becontree hundred and the county of Essex and it instead formed the independent liberty of Havering. Over time the vestry of Romford chapelry absorbed the local powers that would usually be held by the parish authorities and in 1849 Romford became a separate parish within the liberty. Improvement commissioners were set up in 1819 for paving, lighting, watching, and cleansing of the marketplace and main streets. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> grew this arrangement became ineffective at controlling sanitation and in 1851 a local board of health was {{set up for the}} parish; although its area was reduced in 1855 to cover only the town ward. The remainder of the parish became part of the Romford rural sanitary district in 1875. These changes and the introduction of the Romford Poor Law Union in 1836 eroded the powers of the liberty and it was finally abolished in 1892 and reincorporated into Essex.|$|E
5|$|Shankill Parish Church {{belongs to}} the Anglican Church of Ireland. The {{original}} church was established at Oxford Island {{on the shore of}} Lough Neagh in 1411, but a new church was built in Lurgan on the site of what is now Shankill Cemetery in 1609 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> became the main centre of settlement in the area. It was eventually found to be too small given the growth of the town, and the Irish Parliament granted permission to build a replacement in 1725 one mile away on the 'Green of Lurgan', now known as Church Place, where it stands to this day. It {{is believed to be the}} largest parish church in Ireland.|$|E
