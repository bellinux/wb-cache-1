Both ends are normally fitted with flat metal plates on the end, providing additional support area. Most jack posts are split in two near the middle, with the upper end carrying the jack designed to slide within the lower portion. Gross adjustment for length is first made by pulling a pin and sliding the two sections within each other until they almost fill the gap, inserting the pin to lock them, then using the screw to close any remaining gap. Other designs used two threaded pipes instead of sliding sections, clamping sections, or other similar concepts to lock the system at a specific length.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A new procedure, AXES, is {{introduced}} for fitting smallangle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data to macromolecular structures and ensembles of structures. By using explicit water models {{to account for}} the effect of solvent, and by restricting the <b>adjustable</b> <b>fitting</b> parameters to those that dominate experimental uncertainties, including sample/buffer rescaling, detector dark current, and, within a narrow range, hydration layer density, superior fits between experimental high resolution structures and SAXS data are obtained. AXES results are found to be more discriminating than standard Crysol fitting of SAXS data when evaluating poorly or incorrectly modeled protein structures. AXES results for ensembles of structures previously generated for ubiquitin show improved fits over fitting of the individual members of these ensembles, indicating these ensembles capture the dynamic behavior of proteins in solution...|$|E

Using the Voronoi {{diagram of}} the input point set, we deduce a tensor field whose principal axes and eccentricities locally represent respectively the most likely direction of the normal to the surface, and the confidence in this direction estimation. An implicit function is then computed by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem such that its gradient is most aligned with the principal axes of the tensor field, providing a best-fitting isosurface reconstruction. Our approach possesses a number of distinguishing features. In particular, the implicit function optimization provides resilience to noise, <b>adjustable</b> <b>fitting</b> to the data, and controllable smoothness of the reconstructed surface.

We suggest and {{investigate}} three possible displacive transformation paths between the ideal C 11 b, C 40 and C 54 structures in MoSi 2, VSi 2 and TiSi 2 by calculating ab initio total energies along these paths. An estimate of transition temperatures {{based on the}} calculated energy barriers leads to values comparable with the melting temperatures of the disilicides studied. This confirms their high temperature stability and indicates that if a phase transformation between C 11 b, C 40 and C 54 structures of the disilicides takes place, then its prevailing mechanism should be diffusional rather than martensitic like.

40|$|We derive the {{nonlinear}} fractional {{surface wave}} equation that governs compression waves at an interface that is coupled to a viscous bulk medium. The fractional {{character of the}} differential equation {{comes from the fact}} that the effective thickness of the bulk layer that is coupled to the interface is frequency dependent. The nonlinearity arises from the nonlinear dependence of the interface compressibility on the local compression, which is obtained from experimental measurements and reflects a phase transition at the interface. Numerical solutions of our nonlinear fractional theory reproduce several experimental key features of surface waves in phospholipid monolayers at the air-water interface without freely <b>adjustable</b> <b>fitting</b> parameters. In particular, the propagation length of the surface wave abruptly increases at a threshold excitation amplitude. The wave velocity is found to be of the order of 40 cm/s both in experiments and theory and slightly increases as a function of the excitation amplitude. Nonlinear acoustic switching effects in membranes are thus shown to arise purely based on intrinsic membrane properties, namely the presence of compressibility nonlinearities that accompany phase transitions at the interface.

40|$|Background: Recent {{advances}} in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} {{make it possible to}} visualize the presumed pathophysiologic correlate of Menière’s disease: endolymphatic hydrops. As traditional diagnostic tests can provide only indirect evidence, they are hardly competitive in this respect and need to be rethought. This is done here for the glycerol test. Methods: The data of a previous retrospective analysis of the glycerol test in patients with suspected Menière’s disease are reinterpreted using a simple model. The mean threshold reduction (MTR) in the frequency range from 125 to 1500 Hz (calculated from audiograms obtained immediately before and four hours after the glycerol intake) is used as the test statistic. The proposed model explains the frequency distribution of the observed MTR by the convolution of a Gaussian probability density function (representing measurement errors) with a template representing the frequency distribution of the true MTR. The latter is defined in terms of two <b>adjustable</b> parameters. After <b>fitting</b> the model to the data, the performance of the test is evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: The cumulative frequency distribution of the observed MTR can be explained almost perfectly by the model. According to the ROC analysis performed, the capability of the currently used audiometric procedure to detect a glycerol-induced threshold reduction corresponds to a diagnostic test of rather high accuracy (area under the ROC curve greater than 0. 9). Simulations show that methodological improvements could further enhance the performance. Conclusions: Owing to their ability to reveal functional aspects without an obvious morphological correlate, traditional test for Menière’s disease could be decisive for defining the stage of the disease. A distinctive feature of the glycerol test is that it is capable of determining, with high accuracy, whether the pathophysiologic condition of the inner ear is partially reversible. Prospectively, this could help to estimate the chances of specific therapies. <br...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study we {{combined}} a continuum approximation with a detailed mapping of the electrostatic potential inside an ionic channel to define the most probable trajectory for proton propagation through the channel (propagation along a structure-supported trajectory (PSST)). The conversion of the three-dimensional diffusion space into propagation along a one-dimensional pathway permits reconstruction of an ion motion by a short calculation (a few seconds on a state-of-the-art workstation) rather than a laborious, time-consuming random walk simulations. The experimental system selected for testing the accuracy of this concept was the reversible dissociation of a proton from a single pyranine molecule (8 -hydroxypyrene- 1, 2, 3 -trisulfonate) bound by electrostatic forces inside the PhoE ionic channel of the Escherichia coli outer membrane. The crystal structure coordinates were used for calculation of the intra-cavity electrostatic potential, and {{the reconstruction of the}} observed fluorescence decay curve was carried out using the dielectric constant of the intra-cavity space as an <b>adjustable</b> parameter. The <b>fitting</b> of past experimental observations (Shimoni, E., Y. Tsfadia, E. Nachliel, and M. Gutman. 1993. Biophys.

This idea affects all types of modelling of water (with the exception of ab-initio calculations) from coarse grained to non-polarizable and polarizable models.

The established theory of tunneling two state systems (TTLS) in its original form (i. e. without extra fitting functions and parameters) is unable to explain this universality.

We review the concept of pF from its origin in the papers of Schofield and discuss what Schofield meant by the 'free energy, F '. We deal with (historical) criticisms {{regarding the use of}} the log scale of the pressure head, which, unfortunately, led to the apparent demise of the pF. We espouse the advantages of using the log scale in a model for which the pF is the independent variable, and we present a method {{to deal with the problem}} of the saturated water content on the semi-log graph being located at a pF of minus infinity.

40|$|The {{surface tension}} of an {{interface}} separating two bulk phases {{is one of}} the most widely studied properties in surface science research. The importance of surface or interfacial tension is reflected in the diverse number of applications which are influenced by surface tension related effects. This thesis represents a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation on molecular adsorption and surface tension from a class of organic compounds in aqueous solutions. The research illustrates the effect of both liquid and vapor phase adsorption on the interfacial properties. Adsorption from both sides of the vapor/liquid interface is considered simultaneously rather than exclusive of one another, which has been the conventional practice. In the experimental study, the surface tension of a number of different volatile organic compounds is measured using the Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis-Profile (ADSA-P) method. The experiments were performed in a controlled environment under conditions where the surface tension can be affected by both vapor and liquid phase adsorption. The vapor phase was exerted by the presence of an environment solution containing the same organic component as in the drop solution. The results show that initially the surface tension is influenced by the organic concentration in both the liquid and the vapor phase. At the final steady-state the liquid phase becomes less important and the primary factor influencing the surface tension is the vapor phase concentration. The ADSA-P technique is verified by reproducing a select number of cases using the Wilhelmy plate method. A possible consequence of the surface tension phenomenon is illustrated through time-dependent contact angle experiments. The behavior of the interface at steady-state conditions is investigated by measuring the surface tension response to a change in drop volume. It is concluded that the organic compounds considered in the current study may represent a rather general group of molecules whose surface behavior is unique to that of many conventional surfactants. In the theoretical study an empirical model is proposed to describe the relation between the steady-state surface tension and the concentration of the environment and drop solutions. The results confirm the experimental observation that the final steady-state surface tension is determined primarily by the organic concentration in the vapor phase. In addition, a modified adsorption isotherm is developed to account for simultaneous adsorption from both sides of the vapor/liquid interface at steady-state conditions. The derivation is based upon the classic Langmuir analysis, and the new equation is consistent with the Langmuir isotherm under traditional conditions where adsorption occurs from one side of the interface. The modified isotherm is shown to be consistent with the experimental data and is used to generate the equilibrium parameters for three of the systems studied in this research. The adsorption isotherm is then extended to model the dynamic adsorption process through the creation of a new kinetic transfer equation. As with the adsorption isotherm, the transfer equation is based on Langmuir kinetics and is capable of simulating adsorption from both sides of the interface during surface equilibration. The kinetic transfer equation is validated against experimental data from two systems which exhibit a transfer-controlled adsorption mechanism. The theoretical predictions from the transfer equation fit well with the experimental data for both systems. However, significant variability is observed in the least squares estimates of the kinetic rate constants. The variability is attributed to the limitations of empirical models that utilize <b>adjustable</b> <b>fitting</b> parameters to optimize the model predictions, and the wide range of surfactant concentrations studied. Specific concentration regions are identified where the variability in the rate constants is minimal and thus, where the model is most appropriate...|$|E
