40|$|The thesis {{describes}} several potential solutions of an <b>adjustable</b> <b>timer,</b> such as monostable multivibrators, asynchronous (ripple) and synchronous {{counters and}} microcontrollers. It also deals with issue of switching three-phase asynchronous motors with limit a high starting current on starting - star-delta switch, softstarter, frequency inverter. Particular {{attention is focused}} on the conceptual design of the timer using micro- controller Atmel (timer control unit), LCD (display device) and control switches. The microcontroller will be complemented by external 32, 768 kHz watch crystal, necessary for real-time function - Real Time Counter (RTC). The cause for this choice is not only simplicity and clarity of control to the operator, but also reliability, low power consumption and also the price of the device itself...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{synthesis}} of Pulsed Para-Neural Networks (PPNN) in a 3 -D Cellular Automata space. In its essence, PPNN {{is a set of}} simple processing units that change their states only in certain discrete moments of time denoted t, t+ 1, t+ 2, [...] . The inlets to and outlets from the units are located {{in such a way that}} a given unit may (but does not have to) send a pulse to and only to its nearest neighbors. There are three kinds of processing units: red cells, yellow cells, and blue cells. A red cell emits a pulse at t+ 2 if and only if the value of its counter at t+ 1 gets equal to or greater than 2, where the state of the counter for t+ 1 is the state for t plus the weighted sum of pulses incoming in t. Each weight is associated with one and only one inlet to the cell and may be equal to 1, 0 or – 1. Every red cell zeroes its counter when emitting a pulse. Every yellow cell emits a pulse in t+ 1 if and only if one and only one pulse entered it in t. Every blue cell emits a pulse in t+ 1 if a pulse entered it in t through its only inlet. A red cell works in the way approximating the behavior of a neural soma which cumulates excitation/inhibition in both time and space. A yellow cell represents a formal neuron whose inputs provide a pre-synaptic inhibition to all other inputs. Since a blue cell is a 1 -clock delay, a string of adjacent blue cells may model an axon. Despite the simplicity of the paradigm of computation of PPNN, a number of useful devices has been created in its framework. We present (1) an associative memory to be filed via reinforcement learning (what is remembered is a set of phases of pulses circulating in closed loops made of cells), and (2) a spiking neuron that non-linearly cumulates excitation and responds with a changeable frequency of produced pulses, (3) an <b>adjustable</b> <b>timer</b> an...|$|E
50|$|Most air fryers {{come with}} <b>adjustable</b> {{temperature}} and <b>timer</b> knobs {{that allow for}} more precise cooking. Food is cooked in a cooking basket that sits atop a drip tray. The basket and its contents must be periodically shaken to ensure even oil coverage; some models accomplish this by incorporating a food agitator that continuously churns the food during the cooking process while others require the user to perform the task manually.|$|R
2500|$|Green Grass/Violet Club was {{the first}} UK-deployed weapon to {{dispense}} with the crude polonium and beryllium impact or crush type initiators used in Fat Man and other early US weapons together with the British Blue Danube and Red Beard. Instead it used an electronic neutron initiator (ENI) known as Blue Stone. This had the great advantage of being adjustable, allowing the neutron burst to be triggered at precisely the right moment. The burst heights of Green Grass were optimized for either maximum overpressure without allowing fireball contact with the ground, or to maximise the ground area subjected to a 6 psi overpressure; respectively [...] and [...] above ground level A barometric fuze was used, backed-up by an <b>adjustable</b> clockwork <b>timer</b> fuze with impact fuses as a final fail-safe. Most of these mechanisms originated from Blue Danube although the radar altimeter fuze was omitted. The electrical power for these fuzing mechanisms and the firing mechanisms of the 72-lens, [...] implosion device came from lead-acid accumulators located in {{the tail of the}} Blue Danube casing. These were commercially sourced six-volt motorcycle batteries.|$|R
40|$|An air fryer is {{a kitchen}} {{appliance}} that works by using high speed hot air circulation. When the fryer is working, {{it begins to}} produce hot air and a mechanical fan begins to circulate it very fast around the food, which fries the food and produces a crispy layer. Most hot air fryers come with <b>adjustable</b> temperature and <b>timer</b> knobs that allow for more precise cooking. Food is cooked in the cooking basket that sits on a drip tray. There are various brands of air fryers that claim to fry the food with 80 % less oil in general. Air fryer technology is based on "Rapid air technology " that uses the hot air to fry and cook the food which causes the use of less oil frying food. Which food needs what amount of cooking time. Time is a business {{which has not been}} dealt with properly. In most of the cases the user is compelled with a restricted amount of control. Most of the people wouldn’t have noticed (but can reason out very well) different type of food need different amount of cooking time which depends directly on the air temperature and fan speed etc...|$|R
40|$|GreenChip SMPS control IC 1. General {{description}} The TEA 1733 AT is a {{low cost}} Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) controller IC intended for flyback topologies. It operates in fixed frequency mode. Frequency jitter has been implemented to reduce ElectroMagnetic Interference (EMI). Slope compensation is integrated for Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) operation. The TEA 1733 AT IC includes OverPower Protection (OPP). This enables the controller to operate under overpower situations for {{a limited amount of}} time. Two pins, VINSENSE and PROTECT, are reserved for protection purposes. Input UnderVoltage Protection (UVP) and OverVoltage Protection (OVP), output OVP and OverTemperature Protection (OTP) can be implemented using a minimal number of external components. At low power levels the primary peak current is set to 25 % of the maximum peak current and the switching frequency is reduced to limit switching losses. The combination of fixed frequency operation at high output power and frequency reduction at low output power provides high-efficiency over the total load range. The TEA 1733 AT enables low cost, highly efficient and reliable supplies for power requirements up to 75 W to be designed easily and with a minimum number of external components. 2.
