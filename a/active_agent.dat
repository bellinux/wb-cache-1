5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal <b>active</b> <b>agent,</b> gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E

This has led to its small-scale commercial preparation and sale, in a powdered form known as cantharides (from the plural of Greek κανθαρίς, Kantharis, beetle), obtained from dried and ground beetles. The crushed powder is of yellow-brown to brown-olive color with iridescent reflections, is of disagreeable scent, and is bitter to taste.

40|$|Uncontrollable {{displacements}} that greatly {{affect the}} concentration of <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> at the target tissues are among a major limitation {{of the use of}} microparticulate drug delivery systems (DDS). Under this context a biphasic injectable DDS combining poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) microparticles (MPs) and a gellan gum (GG) injectable hydrogel is herein proposed for the localized delivery and long-term retention of MPs carrying hydrophilic and hydrophobic model <b>active</b> <b>agents.</b> A double emulsion-solvent evaporation method was adopted to develop the PHBV MPs, carrying bovine serum albumin (BSA) or dexamethasone (Dex) as hydrophilic and hydrophobic active agents' models, respectively. Moreover, this method was modified, together with the properties of the hydrogel to tailor the delivery profile of the <b>active</b> <b>agents.</b> Variations of the composition of the organic phase during the process allowed tuning surface topography, particle size distribution and core porosity of the PHBV MPs and, thus, the in vitro release profile of Dex but not of BSA.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial {{resistance}} {{is a growing}} problem in North American hospitals as well as hospitals worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To assess the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of commonly used agents against the 20 most common organisms isolated from Canadian hospitals. METHODS: In total, 7881 isolates were obtained between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2007, from 12 hospitals across Canada {{as part of the}} Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2007). Of these, 6685 isolates (20 most common organisms) obtained from bacteremic, urinary, respiratory and wound specimens underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Susceptibility testing was assessed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The most active (based upon minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] data only) agents against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were dalbavancin, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline and vancomycin, with MICs required to inhibit the growth of 90 % of organisms (MIC 90) of 0. 06 μg/mL and 0. 06 μg/mL, 0. 25 μg/mL and 0. 25 μg/mL, 4 μg/mL and 1 μg/mL, 0. 25 μg/mL and 0. 25 μg/mL, 0. 5 μg/mL and 0. 25 μg/mL, and 1 μg/mL and 2 μg/mL, respectively. The most <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> against vancomycin-resistant enterococci were daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline with MIC 90 s of 2 μg/mL, 4 μg/mL and 0. 12 μg/mL, respectively. The most <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> against Escherichia coli were amikacin, cefepime, ertapenem, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and tigecycline with MIC 90 s of 4 μg/mL, 2 μg/mL, 0. 06 μg/mL or less, 0. 12 μg/mL or less, 4 μg/mL and 1 μg/mL, respectively. The most <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> against extendedspectrum beta-lactamase-producing E coli were ertapenem, meropenem and tigecycline with MIC 90 s of 0. 12 μg/mL or less, 0. 12 μg/mL or less and 1 μg/mL, respectively. The most <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam with MIC 90 s of 32 μg/mL, 32 μg/mL, 8 μg/mL and 64 μg/mL, respectively. The most <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were tigecycline and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin with MIC 90 s of 8 μg/mL, 8 μg/mL and 8 μg/mL, respectively. The most <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> against Acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin, fluoroquinolones (eg, levofloxacin), meropenem, and tigecycline with MIC 90 s of 2 μg/mL or less, 1 μg/mL, 4 μg/mL and 2 μg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The most <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> versus Gram-positive cocci from Canadian hospitals were vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, dalbavancin and telavancin. The most <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> versus Gram-negative bacilli from Canadian hospitals were amikacin, cefepime, ertapenem (not P aeruginosa), meropenem, piperacillintazobactam and tigecycline (not P aeruginosa).

25|$|Wolf was an <b>active</b> <b>agent</b> in his father's {{financial}} transactions, {{and shared}} his dignity as court factor. He later experienced great reverses of fortune, however. Having invested {{a large part}} of his wealth in loans to the Bavarian government, the stipulated terms of repayment were not kept, and bankruptcy stared him in the face. For a time he was able to pay only half of the interest on the 150,000 florins which Samson Wertheimer had donated to charity, and of which Wolf was trustee. On his father's donation of 22,000 florins in favor of the German Jews in Palestine he did not pay any interest after 1733. His embarrassment was ended by Elector Maximilian, who liquidated his debts. In his will (1762) Wolf declared that, although entailing a great loss upon him, he accepted this liquidation in order to do justice to his creditors. Further, he enjoined his children to pay in full his father's donation of 22,000 florins, although in 1759 he (Wolf) had returned to the Frankfurt congregation 10,000 florins which it had contributed to this fund.|$|E
25|$|Avermectins {{belong to}} the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as in-feed {{treatments}} to kill sea lice. The first avermectin used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the <b>active</b> <b>agent</b> in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and flaccid paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E
