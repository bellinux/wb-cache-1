5|$|At age ten, {{with her}} father's fortune disappearing in London, Singh {{attempted}} {{to move to}} India with her father and sisters but they were turned back in Aden by arrest warrants. Although her father disowned her, in 1896 Victoria gave her the three-story Faraday House and a £200 <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> its <b>maintenance.</b> Singh, who styled herself the Queen of the Punjab, did not initially live in Faraday House; she stayed at the Manor House in Old Buckenham, near her brother Prince Frederick. After a period of ill health, her father died in a rundown Paris hotel on 22October 1895 at age 55.|$|R

60|$|Although the swords of the {{officers}} were thus restored to them, they were themselves still held as prisoners until arrangements could be made for exchanging them. In order, however, that they might all be properly provided for, he distributed them around among his own generals, giving to each Russian officer the charge of a Swedish officer of his own rank, granting, of course, to each one a proper <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the <b>maintenance</b> and support of his charge. The Russian generals were severally responsible for the safe-keeping of their prisoners; but the surveillance in such cases is never strict, for it is customary for the prisoners to give their parole of honor {{that they will not}} attempt to escape, and then they are allowed, within reasonable limits, their full personal liberty, so that they live more like the guests and companions of their keepers than as their captives.|$|R

60|$|It {{was now the}} end of March. Old Mr. Scarborough {{was dead}} and buried, and Mountjoy was living at Tretton. Nothing had been heard of his coming up to London. No rushing to the card-tables had been announced. That {{there were to be}} some terrible internecine law {{contests}} between him and Augustus had been declared in many circles, but of this nothing was known at the Buston Rectory. Harry had been one day at Cheltenham, and had been allowed to spend the best part of an hour with his sweetheart; but this permission had been given on the understanding that he was not to come again, and now for a month he had abstained. Then had come his uncle's offer, that generous offer under which Harry was to bring his wife to Buston Hall, and live there during half the year, and to receive an increased <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> his <b>maintenance</b> during the other half. As he thought of his ways and means he fancied that they would be almost rich. She would have four hundred a year, and he as much; and an established home would be provided for them. Of all these good things he had written to Florence, but had not yet seen her since the offer had been made. Her answer had not been as propitious as it might be, and it was absolutely necessary that he should go down to Cheltenham and settle things.|$|R
60|$|There {{was very}} much room for triumph in regard to Everett. It had already been ascertained that the Wharton who was now dead had had a child,--but {{that the child was}} a daughter. Oh,--what {{salvation}} or destruction there may be to an English gentleman in the sex of an infant! This poor baby was now little better than a beggar brat, unless the relatives who were utterly disregardful of its fate, should choose, in their charity, to make some small <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> its <b>maintenance.</b> Had it by chance been a boy, Everett Wharton would have been nobody; and the child, rescued from the iniquities of his parents, would have been nursed in the best bedroom of Wharton Hall, and cherished with the warmest kisses, and would have been the centre of all the hopes of all the Whartons. But the Wharton lawyer by use of reckless telegrams had certified himself that the infant was a girl, and Everett was the hero of the day. He found himself to be possessed of a thousand graces, even in his father's eyesight. It seemed to be taken as a mark of his special good fortune that he had not clung to any business. To have been a banker immersed in the making of money, or even a lawyer attached to his circuit and his court, would have lessened his fitness, or at any rate his readiness, for the duties which he would have to perform. He would never be a very rich man, but he would have a command of ready money, and of course he would go into Parliament.|$|R
25|$|Ordinary {{income is}} a net income concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance. There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> disability, special tax <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s allowance, fishermen’s <b>allowance,</b> special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> self-employed within agriculture, special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> high expenses linked to illness, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> payments to individual pension schemes, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> travel between home and work, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> donations to voluntary organisations, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> paid union fees, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|R

30|$|In {{the pilot}} ETSs in China, a {{majority}} of <b>allowances</b> are allocated <b>for</b> free, with a relatively small portion being auctioned in Shenzhen and Guangdong. Grandfathering is applied to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> cogeneration units in Guangdong, and benchmarking is adopted to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> coal-fired and gas-fired units in Shanghai. As China has a steadily growing economy, a benchmarking method based on actual output (rather than historical output) is planned to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> generation companies in the national level ETS, in order to balance emission reduction and economic growth.|$|R

5000|$|In 1939 Stiebeling {{worked with}} Esther Phipard to include USDA dietary <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> thiamin and riboflavin. Their {{proposal}} for recognizing some variance between individuals {{in a population}} also stimulated an [...] "allowance of a margin of 50% above the average minimum <b>for</b> normal <b>maintenance</b> ... an estimate intended to cover individual variations of minimal nutritional need among apparently normal people." [...] This technique has been the standard for developing dietary plans by international organizations like the FAO and the WHO.|$|R

50|$|The rate {{at which}} patent {{applications}} are allowed can vary significantly from one technology to another.

30|$|Third, auctions {{should be}} {{introduced}} into the <b>allowance</b> allocation <b>for</b> takers. In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the allowance allocation. After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the allowance on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively. In the Guangdong industrial sectors, the enterprises must acquire a 3  % allowance through auction, and they can then activate a 97  % <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> free; for large public buildings, 100  % are allocated for free by benchmarking before the compliance period. At present, the government-allocated <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the enterprises is free in Beijing. However, the CET will eventually be completely adjusted by the market, {{as is the case}} for CET in the EU (European Union). Specifically, a certain level of auction, such as 3  %, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers; and a lesser amount for auction, which should be smaller than the proportion of auction in the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the givers; alternatively, 100  % can be free <b>for</b> the <b>allowance</b> of the givers.|$|R

5000|$|Emissions allocation: Under the Clear Skies Act, {{emission}} allowances are to {{be allocated}} based on historical fuel consumption, what {{is often referred to}} as [...] "grandfathering". Under the Clean Air Planning Act, a grandfathering approach is used to allocate emission <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> SO2, but <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> NOx, mercury, and CO2, are allocated using an output-based scheme. Under this approach, referred to as a generation performance standard (GPS), generators are given <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> each unit of electricity they generate. The number of <b>allowances</b> allocated <b>for</b> each unit of generation changes each year as the total generation from covered sources changes. The use of a GPS dampens the electricity price impacts of the bill but raises overall compliance costs.|$|R
