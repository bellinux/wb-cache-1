Building codes and building records {{may be used to}} estimate the types of plumbing <b>and</b> <b>solders</b> at various buildings. Residential buildings are preferred over commercial, for sampling. Only taps from which water is consumed are tested. The age of plumbing is taken into account, as older piping may reach an equilibrium with the water.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the vast}} range of {{electronics}} in today's world, {{a printed circuit board}} is expected to perform in a huge range of environments. Circuit boards then are exposed to a vast array of different conditions such as moisture, salt, chemicals and temperature changes to name but a few, conformal coatings are designed to protect the electronic components from these varying conditions and prevent the board from corroding. More recently, conformal coatings are being used as a mitigation to reduce the potential of tin and zinc whisker short circuit risk on electronic assemblies using lead-free finishes <b>and</b> <b>solders.</b>|$|E
50|$|Protection of the {{surfaces}} against further oxidation is relatively simple, by using vacuum or inert atmosphere. Removal {{of the native}} oxide layer is more troublesome; physical or chemical cleaning methods have to be employed and {{the surfaces}} can be protected by e.g. gold plating. The gold layer has to be sufficiently thick and non-porous to provide protection for reasonable storage time. Thick gold metallization also limits choice of soldering alloys, as tin-based solders dissolve gold and form brittle intermetallics, embrittling the joint. Thicker gold coatings are usually limited to use with indium-based solders <b>and</b> <b>solders</b> with high gold content.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the term}} bench jeweler is a {{contemporary}} term with vague meaning, {{it often is}} used to describe a jeweler who has a larger set of skills {{than that of a}} production worker who merely files <b>and</b> <b>solders</b> rings. Thus they may have a fair knowledge of stonesetting, a bit of engraving, and perhaps other skills that widen their abilities. For a long time throughout history the model was as described above under [...] "Anatomy of a Jewelry Shop", with a fairly strict delineation of responsibilities. In the modern day, there are a great many jewelers who do it all, from design to stonesetting to finishing with fair ability. Whether it is used in one context or another, {{there is no doubt that}} the bench jeweler is the jewelry worker who does the major metal work and the brazing, and its meaning can also be taken more widely to mean one who is more versatile in the trade than merely an assembler of parts. The term can and has been used to describe any of the work described above - model making, special order, repair, assembly, and more, though it is probably becoming a term to describe an all-around jeweler more and more in recent years.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the {{primitive}} recycling operations in Guiyu are toxic and dangerous to workers' health with 80% of children suffering from lead poisoning. Above-average miscarriage rates are also {{reported in the}} region. Workers use their bare hands to crack open electronics to strip away any parts that can be reused—including chips and valuable metals, such as gold, silver, etc. Workers also [...] "cook" [...] circuit boards to remove chips <b>and</b> <b>solders,</b> burn wires and other plastics to liberate metals such as copper; use highly corrosive and dangerous acid baths along the riverbanks to extract gold from the microchips; and sweep printer toner out of cartridges. Children {{are exposed to the}} dioxin-laden ash as the smoke billows around Guiyu, and finally settles on the area. The soil has been saturated with lead, chromium, tin, and other heavy metals. Discarded electronics lie in pools of toxins that leach into the groundwater, making the water undrinkable to the extent that water must be trucked in from elsewhere. Lead levels in the river sediment are double European safety levels, according to the Basel Action Network. Lead in the blood of Guiyu's children is 54% higher on average than that of children in the nearby town of Chendian. Piles of ash and plastic waste sit on the ground beside rice paddies and dikes holding in the Lianjiang river.|$|E

50|$|One small flaw {{found in}} Autoreflex T is the battery compartment. It appears the wrong type of flux was used when {{soldering}} the wire connections.

50|$|Another {{difference}} between brazing <b>and</b> <b>soldering</b> {{is how the}} solder is applied. In brazing, one generally uses rods that are touched to the joint while being heated. With silver soldering, small pieces of solder wire are placed onto the metal prior to heating. A flux, often made of boric acid and denatured alcohol, is used to keep the metal <b>and</b> <b>solder</b> clean <b>and</b> to prevent the solder from moving before it melts.|$|R

Heat dissipation of the chip is generally achieved through the die attach material <b>and</b> <b>solders.</b> With the temperature gradients in these materials, high thermo-mechanical stress will be developed in them, and thus they must also be mechanically strong so as to provide a good mechanical support to the chip.

Feasibility of pure indium <b>and</b> <b>solders</b> {{containing}} {{high amount}} of indium as 70 In 30 Sn to wet {{the different types}} of metallic and ceramic materials at application of power ultrasound was studied. The shear strength of soldered joints fabricated on metallic (Cu, Ni, Al, Ti, AISI 316 steel) and ceramic substrates was assessed. The shear strength of In solders on Al 2 O 3 and SiC ceramic materials varied from 3. 5 to 7 MPa. The shear strength on metallic materials attained from 12. 5 to 71 MPa. Joint fracture in most cases occurred in the solder and was of ductile character. Failure took place by shear mechanism...|$|E

For all three solder alloys tested, bulk solders showed better fatigue performance than solder joints when subjected to higher strains.
