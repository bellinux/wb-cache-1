500|$|Though Bernard {{describes}} Hogg as a {{woman of}} [...] "unfailing politeness", the biographer suggests the philanthropist was not without adversaries. For instance, at a concert arranged by the Houston Symphony for her 90th birthday featuring the elderly pianist Arthur Rubinstein, he characterized her as a [...] "tiresome old woman". Hogg, in turn, regarded the musician as [...] "a pompous old man". By contrast, Hogg said of Vladimir Horowitz, whom she met backstage at a 1975 concert in Houston, [...] "Such <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>man.</b> Not at all like that Mr. Rubinstein." ...|$|E

500|$|After signing for Sheffield United, Evans {{moved to}} Millhouse Green, Penistone, {{in the nearby}} Barnsley area. After the death of former Wales boss and Sheffield United player, coach and manager Gary Speed, Evans {{revealed}} a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal in the FA Cup win over Torquay United, which read: [...] "Rest in peace Speedo." [...] Evans stated regarding the death of Gary Speed that [...] "I was {{a man on a}} mission. I had a message on my top for Gary Speed which I wanted to show. I'm thankful I got the goal... the crowd started singing – it gave me goose pimples... not one person has a bad word to say about him, he was a gentleman... even people who haven't met him know how much of <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>man</b> he was... it still hasn't hit home, it still feels surreal." ...|$|E
500|$|Marcus also {{involved}} himself in issues {{of civil rights}} and social justice. One unusual case involved three male students at W. W. Samuell High School who, in 1966, were stopped at the school's front door and ordered to cut their hair {{in order to be}} admitted to the school. The young men filed a lawsuit against the Dallas Independent School District, claiming the restriction interfered with their constitutional freedom of expression. Despite not knowing the boys involved, Marcus stepped forward to champion their case before the public, taking out a newspaper ad defending the choice as a simple fashion decision rather than rebellion against authority. Additionally, he offered legal support if needed, noting in a telegram to school board president Lee McShan, Jr., [...] "I don’t like long hair any more than the principal does, but I will fight for the rights of those students to wear hair any way they choose." [...] Though the case was lost and appealed {{all the way to the}} U.S. Supreme Court without success, decades letter the men still appreciated Marcus' support. Paul Jarvis, one of the plaintiffs, said of Marcus after his death in 2002: [...] "He was just <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>man</b> and a great contributor to Dallas and to the arts. He wanted to do what was right." ...|$|E
500|$|According to The Sunday People, [...] "though {{critics said}} it was an affectionate tribute about <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>man.</b> Van went on to urge fans not to buy it." [...] According to The Boston Globe, Van Morrison [...] "disdained the book". In an {{interview}} with The Boston Globe, Turner commented on this: [...] "He considers anything that reveals details of family background or anything like that an invasion of his privacy. He doesn't believe in biographies, and I do." [...] When the biography came out in hardcover, Van Morrison sent Turner 36 statements from the book that he called [...] "lies, gross exaggerations and innuendo". Van Morrison told Turner that none of the 40 individuals the author had interviewed for the biography were currently friends of his. The letter from Van Morrison to Turner concluded with: [...] "I am very sorry that you feel you are entitled to earn a living by peddling distortions and inaccuracies about me personally." [...] In his reply letter to Van Morrison, Turner wrote: [...] "You may not think you are 'difficult' or 'introvert' but other people do and have the right to express their opinions." [...] The Sunday Times reported that [...] "Allegedly, Van's management even considered buying up all 25,000 copies of the book to pulp them," [...] and this was also reported in The Independent. The Evening Times wrote that Van Morrison [...] "reportedly tried to buy all the copies of a biography by Steve Turner." [...] Representatives for Van Morrison did not confirm whether he attempted to purchase the 25,000 copies of the biography, and confirmed that [...] "representatives of the singer discussed various possibilities". Van Morrison's manager, Chris O'Donnell, said of the musician: [...] "He is not happy about books, period. He is an artist and stands up for himself – he doesn't want his private life raked over." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{working with}} Cameron on Titanic, Kate Winslet decided {{she would not}} work with Cameron again unless she earned [...] "a lot of money". She said that Cameron was <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>man,</b> but she found his temper {{difficult}} to deal with. In an editorial, the British newspaper The Independent said that Cameron [...] "is a nightmare to work with. Studios have come to fear his habit of straying way over schedule and over budget. He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, {{as well as his}} flaming temper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Malfoy {{grew into}} one of the series' most popular {{characters}} due to Felton's performances and Felton quickly became synonymous with the character to many female fans, much to Rowling's dismay. [...] "I'm trying to clearly distinguish between Tom Felton, who is a good looking young boy, and Draco, who, whatever he looks like, is not <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>man.</b> It’s a romantic, but unhealthy, and unfortunately all too common delusion of girls ... it actually worried me a little bit, to see young girls swearing undying devotion to this really imperfect character ... I mean, I understand the psychology of it, but it is pretty unhealthy." [...] Rowling has also noted that Malfoy [...] "is certainly stylish in the film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stringer characterised Morrissey as a {{man with}} various {{contradictory}} traits, being [...] "an ordinary, working-class 'anti-star' who nevertheless loves to hog the spotlight, <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>man</b> who says the nastiest things about other people, a shy man who is also an outrageous narcissist". He further suggested that part of Morrissey's appeal was that he conveyed {{the image of a}} [...] "cultivated English gentleman (and being every inch the typically English 'gent' he is perfectly representative of that type's loathing for cant and hypocrisy, and his fragile, quasi-gay sexuality)". Similarly, Morrissey biographer David Bret described the singer as being [...] "quintessentially English", while Simpson termed him a Little Englander. During the 1980s, interviewer Paul Morley stated that Morrissey [...] "sets out to be a decent man and he succeeds because that is what he is." [...] Eddie Sanderson, who interviewed Morrissey for the Mail on Sunday in 1992, said that [...] "underneath all the rock star flim-flam, Morrissey is actually a very nice chap, excellent company, perfectly willing and able to talk about any subject one cared to throw at him". Having photographed him in 2004, the photographer Mischa Richter described Morrissey as [...] "genuinely lovely".|$|E
