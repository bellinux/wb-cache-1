40|$|Early Cretaceous A-type granites in the Lower Yangtze River belt, central eastern China, {{with both}} A 1 and A 2 {{chemical}} subgroups, formed at 125 ± 2 Ma, after a Cretaceous ridge subduction. Remarkably, A 1 and <b>A</b> 2 group <b>granites</b> are distributed in three zones, roughly parallel {{to each other}} and to a slightly older adakite belt. In general, <b>A</b> 1 <b>granites</b> form in intraplate settings, whereas <b>A</b> 2 <b>granites</b> near paleo-convergent margins. The alternate distribution of these two subgroup A-type granites is compatible with a proposed Cretaceous ridge subduction in the region. The subduction of a dry and hot spreading ridge may have only released small amount of fluids, so that metasomatism on the overriding lithosphere was undetectable, correspondingly resulted in <b>A</b> 1 <b>granites</b> later on. In contrast, wetter and colder oceanic crust away from the spreading ridge was responsible for mantle metasomatism and consequently the formation of <b>A</b> 2 <b>granites.</b> Further away from the ridge, the subduction angle was much steeper, and dehydration of the slab had occurred earlier during the subduction, and thus dramatically reduced mantle metasomatism, corresponding to <b>A</b> 1 <b>granites</b> again. Both <b>A</b> 1 and <b>A</b> 2 <b>granites</b> formed within <b>a</b> short period of time due to slab window/rollback, after the ridge subduction. The distribution of the A 1 and <b>A</b> 2 <b>granites</b> together with the adakite belt may be taken as discrimination indice for ancient ridge subduction. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.
