5|$|As the {{libel suit}} against Marshall dragged on in Mercer County Circuit Court, Innes {{and his allies}} hired author William Littell to publish Innes' version of his {{interactions}} with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most popular history of Kentucky at the time. When Street returned to Kentucky to give <b>a</b> <b>deposition</b> in the case in 1814, Innes swore out a writ against him to collect the damages awarded in his case against Street. Unable to pay, Street was imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Around 877, Æthelred {{wrote to}} Pope John VIII to {{complain}} about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The exact nature of the dispute is not clear, but the reply from the pope to the archbishop still exists. The pope told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support and that the pope had written to the king urging the king to respect {{the rights of the}} archbishop. The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Æthelred. Other historians, however, do not agree that there was <b>a</b> <b>deposition</b> of the king supported by the archbishop at this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{reference to}} cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., a Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is <b>a</b> <b>deposition</b> in {{the records of}} a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re {{the use of a}} parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony makes clear that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.|$|E

Parameters such as the Si growth rate, <b>As</b> <b>deposition</b> rate and <b>As</b> incorporation rate, which in previous models were either not evaluated or assumed to be constant, were found here to depend on both the As surface coverage and the arsine partial pressure. Knowledge of these dependencies was employed in simultaneous <b>As</b> <b>deposition</b> and Si epi growth to obtain highlycontrollable doping profiles by appropriate variation of the arsine partial pressure.

Doctors diagnosed him with arterial blockages and scheduled him for arterial bypass surgery. Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the mass on June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on life support on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002. Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue life support after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw life support, and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002. He was originally buried at Blue Grass Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date of death for his marker.

30|$|To {{finalize}} the morphology evolution study, {{a sample}} with 40 -nm Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 <b>As</b> <b>deposition</b> is investigated (Fig.  1 d). The holes {{are about to}} be fully filled.

The asymmetric closing of the hole is illustrated with the AFM image of a single hole-mound structure depicted in the inset of Fig.  1 d. Whereas the extension of the hole in the [110] direction is with 220  nm comparable to the extension of the initial hole (see inset in Fig.  1 a), the hole has shrunken in the [1 – 10] direction and is after the 40 -nm Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 <b>As</b> <b>deposition</b> only ca. 100  nm wide.|$|R
