It is an object-oriented system, based on the <b>abstraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> objects and functionaries. A document object is a structured entity composed of sub-components called folios, which may be textual or hold document methods. A document's folios may be processed in parallel, through transactions that may produce document versions. DODA combines, in a novel yet coherent manner, well-known techniques from the fields of data protection, access and concurrency control. DODA offers a unified approach to providing mandatory access control, concurrency control, version control, semantic consistency, protection against tampering and an unforgeable audit trail, in a way which facilitates the replication and local processing <b>of</b> <b>document</b> folios by a number of users in parallel...|$|R

40|$|International audienceData trees {{provide a}} {{standard}} <b>abstraction</b> <b>of</b> XML <b>documents</b> with data values: they are trees whose nodes, {{in addition to}} the usual labels, can carry labels from an infinite alphabet (data). Therefore, one is interested in decidable formalisms for reasoning about data trees. While some are known - such as the two-variable logic - they tend to be of very high complexity, and most decidability proofs are highly nontrivial. We are therefore interested in reasonable complexity formalisms as well as better techniques for proving decidability. Here we show that many decidable formalisms for data trees are subsumed - fully or partially - by the power of tree automata together with set constraints and linear constraints on cardinalities of various sets of data values. All these constraints can be translated into instances of integer linear programming, giving us an NP bound on the complexity of the reasoning tasks. We prove that this bound, as well as the key encoding technique, remain very robust, and allow the addition of features such as counting of paths and patterns, and even a concise encoding of constraints, without increasing the complexity. We also relate our results to several reasoning tasks over XML documents, such as satisfiability of schemas and data dependencies and satisfiability of the two-variable logic...|$|R
40|$|Signature files {{seem to be}} a {{promising}} access method for text and attributes. According to this method, the documents (or records) are stored sequentially in one file (“text file”), while <b>abstractions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>documents</b> (“signatures”) are stored sequentially in another file (“signature file”). In order to resolve a query, the signature file is scanned first, and many nonqualifying documents are immediately rejected. We develop a framework that includes primary key hashing, multiattribute hashing, and signature files. Our effort is to find the optimal signature extraction method. The main contribution of this paper is that we present optimal and efficient suboptimal algorithms for assigning words to signatures in several environments. Another contribution is that we use information theory, and study the relationship of the false drop probability Fd and the information that is lost during signature extraction. We give tight lower bounds on the achievable Fd and show that a simple relationship holds between the two quantities in the case of optimal signature extraction with uniform occurrence and query frequencies. We examine hashing as a method to map words to signatures (instead of the optimal way), and show that the same relationship holds between Fd and loss, indicating that an invariant may exist between these two quantities for every signature extraction method...|$|R
40|$|Unranked trees, that is, {{trees with}} no {{restriction}} {{on the number}} of children of nodes, have recently attracted much attention, primarily as an <b>abstraction</b> <b>of</b> XML <b>documents.</b> In this paper, we study logical definability over unranked trees, as well as collections of unranked trees, that can be viewed as databases <b>of</b> XML <b>documents.</b> The traditional approach to definability is to view each tree as a structure of a fixed vocabulary, and study the expressive power of various logics on trees. A different approach, based on model theory, considers a structure whose universe is the set of all trees, and studies definable sets and relations; this approach extends smoothly to the setting of definability over collections of trees. We study the latter, model-theoretic approach. We find sets of operations on unranked trees that define regular tree languages, and show that some natural restrictions correspond to logics studied in the context of XML pattern languages. We then look at relational calculi over collections of unranked trees, and obtain quantifierrestriction results that give us bounds on the expressive power and complexity. As unrestricted relational calculi can express problems complete for each level of the polynomial hierarchy, we look at their restrictions, corresponding to the restricted logics over the family of all unranked trees, and find several calculi with low (NC 1) data complexity, that can express important XML properties like DTD validation and XPath evaluation. 1...|$|R

40|$|A common {{approach}} to storage and retrieval <b>of</b> XML <b>documents</b> is to {{store them in}} a database, together with materialized views on their content. The advantage over ”native” XML storage managers {{seems to be that}} transactions and concurrency are for free, next to other benefits. But a closer look and preliminary experiments reveal that this results in poor performance of concurrent queries and updates. The reason is that database lock contention hinders parallelism unnecessarily. We therefore investigate concurrency control at the semantic, i. e., XML level and describe a respective transaction manager XMLTM. It features a new locking protocol DGLOCK. It generalizes the protocol for locking on directed acyclic graphs by adding simple predicate locking on the content of elements, e. g., on their text. Instead of using the original XML documents, we propose to take advantage <b>of</b> an <b>abstraction</b> <b>of</b> the XML <b>document</b> collection known as DataGuides. XMLTM allows to run XML processing at the underlying database at low ANSI isolation degrees and to release database locks early without sacrificing correctness in this setting. We have built a complete prototype system that is implemented on top of the XML Extender for IBM DB 2. Our evaluation shows that our approach consistently yields performance improvements by an order of magnitude. We stress that our approach can also be implemented within a native XML storage manager, and we expect even better performance...|$|R
