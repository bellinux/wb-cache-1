500|$|Some, perhaps {{overwhelmed}} by it all, {{made no attempt}} to escape and stayed in their cabins or congregated in prayer in the third-class dining room. Leading Fireman Charles Hendrickson saw crowds of third-class passengers below decks with their trunks and possessions, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> someone to direct them. Psychologist Wynn Craig Wade attributes this to [...] "stoic passivity" [...] produced by generations of being told what to do by social superiors. August Wennerström, one of the male steerage passengers to survive, commented later that many of his companions had made no effort to save themselves. He wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Central Illinois Regional Airport near Bloomington has a {{whimsical}} statue of Stevenson, {{sitting on a}} bench with his feet propped on his briefcase and his head in one hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> his flight. He is depicted wearing shoes that had a hole in the sole, from having walked many miles during his election campaign. [...] The shoe had become a symbol of his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Life in the Resistance {{was highly}} {{dangerous}} {{and it was}} imperative for a good résistant to live quietly and never attract attention to themselves. Punctuality was key to meetings in public as the Germans would arrest anyone who was seen hanging around in public <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> someone. A major difficulty for the Resistance was the problem of denunciation. Contrary to popular belief, the Gestapo was not an omnipotent agency with its spies everywhere, but instead the Gestapo relied upon ordinary people to volunteer information. According to the Abwehr officer Hermann Bickler, the Germans needed 32 000 indicateurs (informers) to crush all resistance in France, but he reported {{in the fall of}} 1940 that the Abwehr had already exceeded that target. It was difficult for Germans to pass themselves off as French, so the Abwehr, the Gestapo and the SS could not have functioned without French informers. In September 1940, the poet Robert Desnos published an article titled [...] "J'irai le dire à la Kommandantur" [...] in the underground newspaper Aujourd'hui appealing to ordinary French people to stop denouncing each other to the Germans. Desnos's appeal failed, but the phrase [...] "J'irai le dire à la Kommandantur" [...] ("I'll go and tell the Germans about it") was a very popular one in occupied France as hundreds of thousands of ordinary French people denounced each other to the Germans. The problem of what the French called indics or mouches as informers were known was compounded by the corbeaux (poison pen letters). The writers of the corbeaux was inspired by a mixture of motivations such as envy, spite, greed, anti-Semitism, and sheer opportunism as many ordinary French people wanted to ingratiate themselves with what they believed to be the winning side. Ousby noted [...] "Yet perhaps the most striking testimony to the extent of denunciation came from the Germans themselves, surprised at how ready the French were to betray each other". The problem of denunciation was always the most serious handicap for the resistance as there were a seemingly endless number of ordinary French people who were desperate to denounce anyone they suspected of engaging in resistance. In occupied France, one had to carry at all times a huge cache of documents such as an ID card, a ration card, tobacco voucher (regardless if one was a smoker or not), travel permits, work permits, and so on. For these reasons, forgery become a key skill for the resistance as the Germans regularly required the French to produce their papers, and anyone whose papers seemed suspicious would be arrested.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not enough}} for Mr. Brand," [...] said Charlotte, simply. And she stood there a moment, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> conscientiously <b>for</b> {{anything}} more that Felix might have to say.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{a first-rate}} father, if I only knew where he'd gone to," [...] said Ben, {{looking down the}} path <b>as</b> eagerly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> one <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> him behind the locked gate.|$|R
60|$|They {{all stood}} looking at me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> something. I folded my arms--tight--and stared back at 'em.|$|R

60|$|Charlie coughed, {{feeling a}} bit orkard-like, and Emma stood there <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> 'im to go.|$|E

6000|$|For {{some little}} time {{after they had}} taken their seats there was a dead silence, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> each were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the other to begin. At last Mr. Petersfield said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{been like}} an angel beside my bed. You know {{they talk about the}} angel of death. It's the most {{beautiful}} of all. You've been like that; <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} young Hexam <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a scholar {{to go on}} with a lesson that he knew by heart and was deadly tired of. But he had said his last word to him.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not answer}} to this, and she moved towards the door slowly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> him to say {{something}} more.|$|E
6000|$|At the engine-house {{he found}} {{nearly all the}} company on the lower floor much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> his report, and 'Lish Davis greeted him by asking: ...|$|E
60|$|Eye met eye, and {{expectation}} was lively {{among those}} primitive and untaught savages. At length Crowsfeather arose to answer, the missionary standing the whole time, motionless, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a reply.|$|E
5000|$|Wild {{fish feed}} {{primarily}} on small fish, in particular Lethrinops spp. Aquarium specimens {{have been observed}} to lie on the substrate <b>as</b> <b>if</b> dead, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> small fish to come close {{in search of a}} meal. When a suitable target comes into range, the fish quickly lunges at the prey and usually swallows it whole. It is this unique hunting method that gives the fish its local name, kalingono, which means [...] "sleeper".|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me expectantly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> me to swoon, or yell, or something. I took a steady look at Clarence's effort. It was another Classical picture. It seemed to me {{very much like the}} other one.|$|R
60|$|The air was all hoary silver. She {{looked around}} her. Trees stood vaguely at their distance, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> like heralds, <b>for</b> {{the signal to}} approach. In this space of vague crystal her heart seemed like a bell ringing. She was afraid lest the sound should be heard.|$|R
60|$|They rode briskly on; the Doctor was {{standing}} at his gate. He saluted Lady Annabel and Venetia with his accustomed cordiality, and then stared at their companion <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> an introduction.|$|E
60|$|Her {{feelings}} {{made her}} speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> more.|$|E
60|$|Linda, disappointed, {{went out}} quietly; and Giselle sat on unbelieving, lost, dazed, patient, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the {{confirmation}} of the incredible. The hopeless blackness of the clouds seemed part of a dream, too. She waited.|$|E
50|$|Early in the investigation, Police {{focussed}} on witness {{statements from}} {{people who had been}} in the area at the time Naomi went missing. One witness, a motorist, reported seeing Naomi standing close to the post box <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> someone.|$|R
60|$|Nobody took any {{notice of}} them. In fact, every one seemed busy {{with his own}} concerns, except that {{in one part of}} the room there were several benches where a number of men and women were sitting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> something.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you know}} about it?" [...] James {{answered}} her with asperity. [...] "It's a pretty mess at this time of night, too!" [...] He lapsed into silence, and his wife and son, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> hypnotised, <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> him to say: 'I can't tell--I don't know; I knew how it would be!' But he did not. The grey eyes shifted, evidently seeing nothing in the room; then movement occurred under the bedclothes, and the knees were drawn up suddenly to a great height.|$|R
6000|$|His restless eyes peered with eager {{interrogation}} {{into those}} of the younger man. He paused <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a reply; then, as St. Just remained silent, he reiterated slowly, almost in the tones of a challenge: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Verver {{continued}} to gaze, but rather <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> more. Then, as everything {{appeared to have}} come, his expression had a drop. If this was all it was simple. [...] "Then {{why in the world}} not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Angel," [...] she said, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> this, [...] "do {{you know}} what I have been running after you for? To tell you that I have killed him!" [...] A pitiful white smile lit {{her face as she}} spoke.|$|E
6000|$|They went; {{and after}} the {{accustomed}} compliments had passed, sat down on mats upon the ground, while the old man stood, leaning against a slab of stone surmounted by a rude wooden cross, which evidently served him {{as a place of}} prayer. He seemed restless and anxious, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> them to begin the conversation; while they, in their turn, <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> him. At last, when courtesy would not allow him to be silent any longer, he began with a faltering voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Vivie, with a shudder, {{turns her}} chair to the table, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the work <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> her {{there were a}} support to her. Praed sits {{opposite}} to her. Frank places a chair near Vivie, and drops lazily and carelessly into it, talking at her over his shoulder.] ...|$|R
60|$|Bradley sat looking {{steadily}} {{before him}} at the vacant air. As often as young Hexam stopped, he turned his eyes towards him, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> him {{to go on with}} the lesson, and get it done. As often as the boy resumed, Bradley resumed his fixed face.|$|R
6000|$|Seeing, as {{she patted}} the pillow into its {{place on the}} bolster, {{that he was still}} looking at her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the rest of her reply, she gave it a great poke in the middle, and asked, 'How could I help myself?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cuffy, my friend," [...] exclaimed Jarwin at last, with an {{explosive}} sigh, [...] "all the baccy's gone, so we'll have to smoke sea-weed for the futur'." [...] The terrier said [...] "Bow-wow" [...] to this, cocked its ears, and looked earnest, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> more.|$|E
60|$|Cartwright {{entered the}} smoking-room {{and crossed the}} floor to a table, at which two or three men stood <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> somebody. One was young and tall. His thin face was finely molded, his eyes and hair were very black, and his figure was marked by an agile grace.|$|E
60|$|It seemed, in the meanwhile, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Edith were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the {{commands}} of the Queen, and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the other {{were reluctant to}} speak {{for fear of being}} unable to command her laughter and that of her companions; for Sir Kenneth could only distinguish a sound as of suppressed tittering and merriment.|$|R
60|$|Among {{the rest}} was a tall, {{straight}} old fellow, with a healthful complexion and silver hair, and a small round-crowned white hat. He had been about to shoulder a nod, but paused, and stood looking at Scott, with a slight sparkling of his blue eye, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> his turn; <b>for</b> the old fellow knew {{himself to be a}} favorite.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{believed}} that the name sangai (sa [...] "animal" [...] and ngai [...] "in awaiting") was coined from its peculiar posture and behaviour while running. By nature, the deer, particularly the males, even when running for its life stops occasionally and looks back <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> someone and hence the name.|$|R
