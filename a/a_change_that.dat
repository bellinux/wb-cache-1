5|$|GoldenEye was {{the second}} and final Bond film to be adapted to a novel by novelist John Gardner. The book closely follows the film's storyline, but Gardner added a violent {{sequence}} prior to the opening bungee jump in which Bond kills a group of Russian guards, <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> the video game GoldenEye 007 retained.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests {{and the animals}} that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E
5|$|By 1947, M-99 was {{completely}} paved. One segment between Litchfield and Homer was converted back to gravel surface in 1952; <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> was reverted two years later. By 1960, the former US12/M-99 concurrency through Albion was redesignated Business US12 {{through the city}} when the I-94/US12 freeway was completed. Within a year, that business loop was redesignated BL I-94 when the US12 designation {{was removed from the}} freeway and applied to the former US112; at the same time, the US112/M-99 concurrency in Jonesville became US12/M-99 as well.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a change}} in management, Coleman signed with Island Records, and Of Human Feelings was {{released}} in 1982 by its subsidiary label Antilles Records. Critics generally praised the album's expressive music and harmolodic approach, but it made little commercial impact and went out of print. Coleman enlisted his son Denardo as manager after a dispute with his former managers over the album's royalties, <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> inspired him to perform publicly again during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of these changes, {{publishers}} began introducing superhero stories again, <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> began {{with the introduction of}} a new version of DC Comics' The Flash in Showcase #4 (Oct. 1956). In response to strong demand, DC began publishing more superhero titles including Justice League of America, which prompted Marvel Comics to follow suit beginning with Fantastic Four #1.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1929, The Capitol Theatre, a major Jasper Avenue {{competitor}} to the Princess, {{closed for}} renovations promising <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> “will please every theatre-goer in Edmonton”. Almost {{three months later}} on March 27, the theatre reopened with dual Movietone and Vitaphone sound systems. The availability of electronically indexed articles from the Edmonton Journal has caused the proliferation of a research error in several local histories. These histories claim that the first talkie screened in Edmonton was The Canary Murder Case, {{and that it was}} screened at the Princess. In fact, the first talkie in Edmonton was Mother Knows Best, screened at the Capitol.|$|E

5|$|The VB series {{retained}} 96percent of {{the preceding}} HZ Kingswood's interior space, despite being 14percent smaller in overall dimensions, although fivepercent larger than the Torana. With the Commodore dropping a full class below the Kingswood and its Ford Falcon competitor, the smaller Commodore was predictably more fuel-efficient. This downsizing was first seen as a major disadvantage for Holden, as they had effectively relinquished the potential of selling Commodores to the fleet and taxi industries. These sales losses {{were thought to be}} unrecoverable; however, the 1979 energy crisis saw Australian oil prices rise by 140percent, putting substantial strain on the automotive industry to collectively downsize, <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> Holden had already done.|$|E

5|$|Venus {{may have}} formed from the solar nebula with a {{different}} rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> would have occurred {{over the course of}} billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 1999, the {{administration}} added crucifixes to many classroom walls, <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> attracted national attention. Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such. According to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure {{to remove the}} crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community, while he and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement. The Intercultural Center is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture symbols in the lobby. In 2009, Georgetown's religious symbols were brought back to national attention after the university administration concealed the name of Jesus in preparation for President Barack Obama's speech on campus.|$|E
5|$|Daydream is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, released on October 3, 1995, by Columbia Records. The follow-up to her internationally successful album Music Box (1993) and holiday album Merry Christmas (1994), Daydream differed from the two by leaning increasingly towards hip hop and urban music. Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote and produced most of her two previous albums. With Daydream, Carey took {{more control over the}} musical direction as well as the album's composition. Carey said she considered Daydream the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation, <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> became more apparent in her sixth album Butterfly (1997). During the album's production, Carey endured many creative differences with her label and husband Tommy Mottola.|$|E

5|$|In February 1858, Ives {{returned}} to the area in a paddle steamer named Explorer. He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them. The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river, and Cairook, Irataba, and a 16-year-old Mohave boy named Nahvahroopa joined them. Möllhausen again accompanied the expedition, and {{was impressed with the}} Mohave guides, later noting Irataba's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language. He also noted that Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition, and showed great interest in smoking tobacco. Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook, Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions, <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> he attributed to their contact with Mormons, who were in conflict with the US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave.|$|E
5|$|In {{his sophomore}} year, Fernández {{was moved to}} {{shooting}} guard in the Temple starting lineup, <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> felt strange for {{him as he was}} used to playing point guard. He was still in frequent playmaking positions, and led the team in assists with 3.6 per game. He increased his scoring average to 12.6 points per game, second on the team, and led the Atlantic 10 in three-point percentage (45.3%). Fernández scored in double figures in 23 games. On December 13, he netted a career best 33 points to upset local rival and third-ranked Villanova 75–65; he shot 7-for-10 from beyond the arc. This earned him Philadelphia Big Five Player of the Week honors for the week of December 7–14. As a result of his performance against Villanova and his 21 points versus Seton Hall, Fernández was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week on December 20. In the Fordham game on January 23, 2010, he took a blow to the head and was forced to leave in the second half. He missed the February 2 game against Richmond with post-concussive symptoms.|$|E

The rules were based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring (<b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>that</b> would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, {{as a result of}} the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, because of an early disagreement about the number of players per team.|$|E
