Aim: To prospectively evaluate the natural history of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> (severity and frequency) in a US population, and evaluate potential risk factors (including somatisation) for the onset and disappearance of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> with increasing age. Methods: Between 1988 and 2004, valid self-report questionnaires that recorded gastrointestinal symptoms including severity and frequency of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> were mailed to randomly selected cohorts of community residents followed over time. This study identified all respondents who answered <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> questions at an initial and follow-up survey. Results: One thousand nine hundred and thirteen subjects were included (mean age in years at first survey: 48 ± 12 (SD), mean age at second survey: 59 ± 13 (SD); 53 % female). The onset and disappearance rate of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> over the follow-up were 18 % (95 % CI, 16, 20) and 47 % (43, 50) respectively. The rates of increasing vs. decreasing <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> score were 18 % (16, 20) vs. 21 % (20, 23) respectively.

Because few data exist on its natural history, we wanted to investigate the prognosis of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> in children in general practice. In a prospective cohort study of children (aged 4 to 17 years) complaining of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> follow-up was at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using standardized questionnaires. The primary outcome measure was chronic <b>abdominal</b> pain: <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> at least 1 time a month during at least 3 consecutive months that {{had an impact on}} daily activities. Prevalence, incidence, and duration of chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> were assessed. Three hundred five children (116 boys, 189 girls), with a median age of 7. 8 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 5. 7 - 10. 5 years) were included. Chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> was present in 142 (46. 6 %) children at an initial visit to the primary care physician for this complaint. During follow-up, 78. 7 % fulfilled the criteria for chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> at 1 or more follow-up points. Among 163 children at risk for developing chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> the cumulative incidence of chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> was 60. 1 % (95 % CI, 52. 1 %- 67. 7 %) and was higher in girls than in boys (RR = 1. 23; 95 % CI, 0. 94 - 1. 61).

40|$|Introduction: <b>Abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> in {{children}} is a challenging complaint for general practitioners. After ruling out an acute organic reason for the pain he has to manage the non-specific or non-organic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> From research performed in secondary and tertiary care and from cross-sectional surveys, we know that non-specific <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> is a worrisome and highly prevalent problem which tends to re-occur. From general practice there are hardly any data about the clinical course of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> nor about the GP's management. Research questions: What is the occurrence of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> {{in children}} in Dutch general practice? How often do these children re-consult their GP {{and what is the}} GP's management? Methods: Data were analysed from the Second Dutch National Survey of general practice (2001). GPs coded all consultations using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC). We identified all children from 2 - 17 years with <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> We analyzed the consulting frequency for <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> the percentage of children who re-consulted the GP, their patient characteristics and the GP's workload and management. Results : A Dutch GP sees 45 children from 2 - 17 years with a complaint of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> per year per 1000 registered children. This accounts for 2. 5 % of all annual contacts of children. 25 % of children with a new complaint of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> reconsulted their GP within a year.

40|$|PURPOSE: Unexplained <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> {{accounts}} for over 50 % of patients attending Gastroenterology Clinics. Musculoskeletal causes of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> are {{noted in the}} literature, however this cause of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> is often neglected and patients can have persistent pain for many years. This study aimed to identify if the thoracic spine was implicated in unexplained <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> RELEVANCE Unexplained <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> can lead to repeated clinic appointments and investigations. Early identification of source of pain would reduce these costs. It would identify that the thoracic spine is implicated in <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> SUBJECTS: 120 subjects with unexplained <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> were recruited to study. All were screened for serious visceral pathology by Senior Medical Physicians. Subjects with inflammatory or neoplastic disease were excluded. METHODS AND MATERIALS. All subjects were assessed by a senior physiotherapist using validated and reliable examination procedures ascertained in previous research. This included a subjective and physical examination including assessment of range of movement and palpation of the thoracic and lumbar spines. Those who appeared to have a musculoskeletal cause to their symptoms all received treatment. All patients were followed up at 6 months to monitor reponse to treatment ANALYSES: The most frequent (mode) spinal levels that reproduced the subject <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> were noted RESULTS: In subjects who had a musculoskeletal cause to their symptoms (12. 5 % n = 15), thoracic levels 9, 10 and 11 at the side corresponding to the pain, were the most frequently noted levels.

In the United States in 2002, <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> was the chief complaint of over 7 million patients presenting to an emergency department (ED), accounting for 6. 5 % of all patient visits [1]. In primary care practices in 2002, <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> was a complaint of more than 13. 5 million patient visits, accounting for 1. 5 % of patient encounters [2]. In certain situations, <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> may be {{a symptom of a}} severe, life-threatening disease process, whereas in other situations, it may be a symptom of a more benign underlying condition. This review provides a framework for understanding <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> so that practitioners may determine those patients who need a more expedited evaluation, and reviews the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> A general approach to the patient is outlined, and several causes of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> are considered in detail, focusing on the most severe and commonly encountered.

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> is a {{frequent}} symptom among children but is rarely associated with organic disease. Although it may persist for years, no factors have been identified that predict its prognosis. Our aim {{was to determine whether}} patient characteristics at initial consultation can predict chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> severe enough to influence the child's well-being at 1 year of follow-up. METHODS: We conducted this prospective cohort study in primary care, including consecutive children aged 4 to 17 years seen for <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> by their family physician. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify prognostic factors that predicted chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> 1 year later. Discriminative ability of identified predictors was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and explained variance. RESULTS: The risk of having chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> at 1 year of follow-up was 37. 1 % in the cohort overall. Increasing age, waking up at night with pain, high levels of other somatic complaints, and chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> at baseline independently predicted chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> at 1 year. These predictors had a poor to moderate discriminative ability, however; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was only 0. 69, and the predictors collectively explained only 14. 3 % of variance in the development of chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> The absolute risk ranged from 19. 4 % among children having none of the predictors to 65. 5 % among children having 3 or 4 predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> sufficient to affect well-being is common among children initially seen for <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> by family physicians.

Conclusion A plain abdominal radiograph is still required as a diagnostic tool for children with <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> especially in the acute stage...|$|R
40|$|There {{are various}} origins for chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> About 10 − 30 % of {{patients}} with chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> have <b>abdominal</b> wall <b>pain.</b> Unfortunately, <b>abdominal</b> wall <b>pain</b> is not {{thought to be the}} first origin of chronic abdominal pain; therefore, patients usually undergo extensive examinations, including diagnostic laparoscopic surgery. Entrapment of abdominal cutaneous nerves at the muscular foramen of the rectus abdominis is a rare cause of <b>abdominal</b> wall <b>pain.</b> If <b>abdominal</b> wall <b>pain</b> is considered in earlier stage of chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> unnecessary invasive procedures are not required and patients will reach symptom free condition as soon as the diagnosis is made. Here, we report a case of successful treatment of a patient with abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome by ultrasound guided injection therapy. (Korean J Pain 2013; 26 : 291 - 294...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Calculation of the {{hospital}} costs of chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> in the Netherlands. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: We selected 'Diagnosis-Related Groups' (DRG) of disorders {{that are associated with}} chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> from a large teaching hospital and a tertiary referral centre. For each DRG we determined the percentage of patients that can present with <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> The total costs for both hospitals were calculated using the registered quantity of the DRGs. Each DRG was categorised by somatic and functional origin. The results were subsequently extrapolated to the entire Dutch population demanding hospital care for chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> Finally, the percentage and associated costs were calculated for patients who had two or more separate diagnoses for chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> in the field of gastroenterology, gynaecology, internal medicine and urology. Results: The yearly outpatient and (day) clinical health costs for patients with chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> in the Netherlands were approximately € 623 million (gastroenterology € 226 million; gynaecology € 303 million; internal medicine € 63 million; and urology € 31 million). Of these diagnoses, 53. 6 % were related to functional disorders, which accounts for approximately € 220 million per year. The yearly costs of patients who had at least two separate diagnoses within one year for chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> were estimated at € 23. 5 million per year. Conclusion: Chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> is a common problem that entails significant healthcare costs in the Netherlands of which functional diagnoses compromise a significant amoun...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Most spinal-cord-injured {{patients}} have constipation. One-third develop chronic <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> 10 {{years or more}} after injury. Nevertheless, very {{little is known about}} the nature of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> after spinal cord injury (SCI). It may be neuropathic or caused by constipation. Aim. To compare characteristics of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> in SCI with able-bodied with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Subjects and Methods. 21 SCI and 15 CIC patients were referred for treatment of bowel symptoms. Constipation-related symptoms were assessed with the Cleveland Constipation Scoring System and the International Spinal Cord Injury Basic Bowel Function Data Set. Characteristics of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> were described using the Brief Danish Pain Questionnaire. Total gastrointestinal transit times (GITT) were measured by radiopaque markers. Results. Seventeen (81 %) SCI and 14 (93 %) CIC patients reported <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> or discomfort within the last month (). Pain was considered more intense by CIC than by SCI patients (). Only minor differences were found in patient’s qualitative description of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> or in the location of pain. In neither SCI nor CIC was pain associated with GITT. Conclusion. Most characteristics of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> among SCI patients resemble those of CIC. This indicates that constipation is a major cause of pain after SCI...|$|R
40|$|Acute <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} complaints evaluated at emergency departments. Approximately 25 % of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> patients discharged from emergency departments are diagnosed with undifferentiated <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> One possible reason for acute <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> is renal infarction. Diagnosis is difficult and often late. CASE PRESENTATION: A white, 33 -year-old, previously healthy Finnish man came to our emergency department because of acute <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> After evaluation and follow-up he was discharged the next day with a diagnosis of undifferentiated <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> He returned a day later and was diagnosed with renal infarction. Appropriate therapy was initiated in the nephrology ward. Further tests confirmed a diagnosis of renal infarction as a result of fibromuscular dysplasia. He recovered well and was discharged on the tenth day of hospitalization. His renal function was normal. CONCLUSIONS: Renal infarction is rare and should be considered if a patient with intense flank pain has no sign of urolithiasis or pyelonephritis. Contrast-enhanced computer tomography and assay of lactate dehydrogenase are recommended. The optimal treatment is still uncertain. Every patient discharged with undifferentiated <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> should be given clear instructions as to when it is necessary to return to the emergency department.

40|$|The {{causes of}} <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> in {{patients}} with AIDS {{are different from those}} of the general population, and there are no guidelines as to which investigations are optimal. We reviewed our experience of 63 patients who presented with <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> as the main reason for admission to the AIDS unit at St Stephen's and Westminster Hospital between January 1988 and January 1990. All patients were assessed within the same structured diagnostic programme. Thirty-five had upper <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> predominantly in the right upper quadrant in 27; seven had lower <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain,</b> which was concentrated in the right iliac fossa in three; 21 had diffuse <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain.</b> The causes of pain were determined satisfactorily in the majority of patients using routine gastroenterological investigations. The predominant site of pain had considerable predictive value in the diagnosis. The commonest cause of right upper quadrant pain was sclerosing cholangitis (17 of 27); endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography was necessary for a confident diagnosis. Diarrhoea was frequently associated (15 of 21) with diffuse abdominal pain; the commonest cause (six of 21) was cytomegalovirus colitis. Neoplasia was the cause of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> in eight patients. The other causes of <b>abdominal</b> <b>pain</b> and the utility of various investigations are discussed. An investigatory route which may provide maximum information has been suggested...|$|R
