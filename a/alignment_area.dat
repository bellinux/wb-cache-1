This article presents a look at the overall architecture of the game and describes some results of our experiments in analysis and optimization of strategies using sequence extraction. We have extracted sequences of game situations from the log of a game played in our simulator, as they occurred during the game. Afterwards, these sequences were compared by methods LCS, LCSS and T-WLCS, which are usually used for sequence comparison in the sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>area.</b> Using these methods, we are able to visualize the relations between the sequences of game situations and clusters of similar game situations in a graph.

In three previously reported case studies, we extensively evaluated complex research projects commissioned by policymakers to investigate how alignment is achieved {{in a research}} process and to discover ways to enhance knowledge contributions to health policy. In the present study, we investigated how {{the findings of the}}se three research projects could be integrated into a practical tool for researchers to enhance their contribution to evidence-based policy. Methods: A cross-case analysis was conducted to integrate the findings of the evaluation of the three research projects and to identify important <b>alignment</b> <b>areas</b> in these projects. By means of an iterative process, we prepared a tool that includes reflection questions for researchers. The "Research for Policy" tool was tested with input from the project managers of three new research projects.

Results: By cross-case analysis of the three case studies, the following important <b>alignment</b> <b>areas</b> were identified: the goal, quality, relevance, timing, and presentation of research, the tasks and authorities of actors, the consultative structure and vertical alignment within organizations, and the organizational environment. The project managers regarded the Research for Policy tool as a useful checklist for addressing the important <b>alignment</b> <b>areas</b> in a research project.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} of gaps in an alignment of nucleotide or protein sequences {{is often an}} inconvenience for bioinformatical studies. In phylogenetic and other analyses, for instance, gapped columns are often discarded entirely from the alignment. Results MaxAlign is a program that optimizes the alignment prior to such analyses. Specifically, it maximizes the number of nucleotide (or amino acid) symbols that are present in gap-free columns – the <b>alignment</b> <b>area</b> – by selecting the optimal subset of sequences to exclude from the alignment. MaxAlign can be used prior to phylogenetic and bioinformatical analyses {{as well as in}} other situations where this form of alignment improvement is useful. In this work we test MaxAlign's performance in these tasks and compare the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates including and excluding gapped columns from the analysis, with and without processing with MaxAlign. In this paper we also introduce a new simple measure of tree similarity, Normalized Symmetric Similarity (NSS) that we consider useful for comparing tree topologies. Conclusion We demonstrate how MaxAlign is helpful in detecting misaligned or defective sequences without requiring manual inspection. We also show that it is not advisable to exclude gapped columns from phylogenetic analyses unless MaxAlign is used first. Finally, we find that the sequences removed by MaxAlign from an alignment tend to be those that would otherwise be associated with low phylogenetic accuracy, and that the {{presence of}} gaps in any given sequence does not seem to disturb the phylogenetic estimates of other sequences. The MaxAlign web-server is freely available online at [URL] where supplementary information can also be found. The program is also freely available as a Perl stand-alone package. </p...|$|E

40|$|Knowing {{the depth}} to bedrock is {{important}} in designing and constructing foundations for buildings and transportation infrastructure. Rock is typically a strong and competent foundation material, however if it {{is close to the}} ground surface it can be costly to remove. This is especially true if the presence of shallow rock is not known until construction. In many transportation projects where geotechnical borings are widely spaced along a road <b>alignment,</b> <b>areas</b> of shallow rock can be easily missed until construction of drainage structures beneath the road. More research is needed on the viability of cost eective tools to identify the presence of shallow rock before construction. Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques to characterize the stiness of soils may be a good tool for this problem. Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) is a wave propagation method in which vertical shear wave velocity proles and elastic moduli of subsurface layers of soil and rock can be estimated. The proles are obtained from the analysis of surface wave data, usually generated from a falling weight and measured by an array of two or more geophones. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the eciency of the SASW system for use in transportation projects in Rhode Island. It will focus on the identication of shallow rock for aid in construction of drainage structures. ...|$|R

40|$|Research for Policy: A {{study on}} {{improving}} {{the contribution of}} scientific knowledge to evidence-informed health The approach of evidence-informed health policy-making is generally considered as the best means of safeguarding public health: governments should {{take into account the}} best available research evidence in health policy-making. Most countries have established a National Public Health Institute (NPHI) to support their government in essential public health operations by activities such as health protection, population health assessment and research to produce evidence for policy-making. However, NPHI-researchers experience that achieving contributions to health policy-making appears to be more difficult than one would expect in view of the NPHI’s mission. In the body of scientific literature on knowledge utilization, alignment between researchers and policy-makers is recognized as an important key for enhancing contributions of scientific knowledge to policy-making. In this study, we focused on research projects, conducted by a NPHI in commission of governmental organizations. We investigated how alignment in such projects is achieved and how alignment can be improved. Our aim was to determine what a practical approach is to enhance knowledge contributions from NPHIs to evidence-informed health policy-making In three case studies, we analyzed in detail the process of a NPHI research project by using Contribution Mapping, a method developed by Kok and Schuit (2012). We identified eight key areas that require special attention during the alignment with policy-makers, the <b>alignment</b> <b>areas</b> 'goal'; 'tasks and authority'; 'quality'; 'consultative structure'; 'vertical alignment'; 'organizational environment'; 'presentation' and 'relevance and timing'. The case studies revealed that achieving alignment between researchers and policy-makers needs continuous efforts and often much more time than anticipated. Although alignment is important, scientific independence is also an important value to safeguard. Thus, researchers need insights on the role of scientific knowledge in policy-making and support of their organization in undertaking alignment efforts. Due to the ever-changing context of a research project, alignment can also be easily lost. Vertical alignment in the own organization is of major importance for achieving adequate horizontal alignment at every organizational level. Since every situation asks for specific alignment efforts, generic alignment efforts cannot be determined beforehand. Instead, researchers should regularly reflect on the <b>alignment</b> <b>areas</b> during the course of their research project. Based on our findings, we developed a reflection instrument to support researchers in reflection on alignment. The R 4 P tool consists of open reflection questions with examples from case studies and a possible solution to the outlined problem. This allows researchers (but also policy makers) to determine systematically which alignment efforts are required at the given moment. To conclude, NPHIs and also other knowledge institutes should acknowledge that reaching alignment needs much more effort, time and resources than often presumed. Research and knowledge production in commission of governmental organizations to serve evidence-informed health policy is in fact a delicate balancing act between alignment and independence. By organizing the institute in a way that facilitates and supports this balancing act, the NPHI may optimize its contributions to health policy.
