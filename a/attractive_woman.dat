5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an <b>attractive</b> <b>woman</b> with long black hair that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir.

25|$|Women {{have been}} found to find altruistic men to be {{attractive}} partners. When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children. It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts {{in the early stages of}} a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an <b>attractive</b> <b>woman.</b> While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.|$|E
25|$|Throughout this time, Elizabeth was a lady-in-waiting at {{the royal}} court; first to Elizabeth of York, and then to Catherine of Aragon. Based on later gossip, Elizabeth Boleyn {{must have been a}} highly <b>attractive</b> <b>woman.</b> Rumours {{circulated}} when Henry was involved with Anne Boleyn that Elizabeth had once been his mistress, with the suggestion even being made that Anne Boleyn might be the daughter of Henry VIII. However, despite recent attempts by one or two historians to rehabilitate this myth, it was denied by Henry and never mentioned in the dispensation he sought in order to make his union with Anne lawful. Most historians believe it is likely that this rumour began by confusing Elizabeth with Henry's more famous mistress Elizabeth Blount, or from the growing unpopularity of the Boleyn family after 1527.|$|E

The term agua (literally water in Spanish) is used in the song as a Puerto Rican jargon referring to the police.|$|E
40|$|Job {{applicants}} in Europe and in Israel increasingly imbed a headshot of them- selves {{in the top}} {{corner of}} their CVs. We sent 5312 CVs in pairs to 2656 advertised job open- ings. In each pair, one CV was without a picture while the second, otherwise almost identical CV contained a picture of either an attractive male/female or a plain-looking male/female. Employer callbacks to attractive men are significantly higher than to men with no picture and to plain-looking men, nearly doubling the latter group. Strikingly, <b>attractive</b> <b>women</b> do not enjoy the same beauty premium. In fact, women with no picture have a significantly higher rate of callbacks than <b>attractive</b> or plain-looking <b>women.</b> We explore a number of explanations and provide evidence that female jealousy of <b>attractive</b> <b>women</b> in the workplace is a primary reason for the punishment of <b>attractive</b> <b>women.</b> beauty, discrimination, experimental economics. ...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{show that}} <b>attractive</b> <b>women</b> {{demonstrate}} stronger preferences for masculine men than relatively unattractive women do. Such condition-dependent preferences may occur because <b>attractive</b> <b>women</b> {{can more easily}} offset {{the costs associated with}} choosing a masculine partner, such as lack of commitment and less interest in parenting. Alternatively, if masculine men display negative characteristics less to <b>attractive</b> <b>women</b> than to unattractive <b>women,</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>women</b> may perceive masculine men to have more positive personality traits than relatively unattractive women do. We examined how two indices of women’s attractiveness, body mass index (BMI) and waist–hip ratio (WHR), relate to perceptions of both the attractiveness and trustworthiness of masculinized versus feminized male faces. Consistent with previous studies, women with a low (attractive) WHR had stronger preferences for masculine male faces than did women with a relatively high (unattractive) WHR. This relationship remained significant when controlling for possible effects of BMI. Neither WHR nor BMI predicted perceptions of trustworthiness. These findings present converging evidence for condition-dependent mate preferences in women and suggest that such preferences do not reflect individual differences in the extent to which pro-social traits are ascribed to feminine versus masculine men...|$|R

40|$|Although {{research}} {{has begun to}} elucidate why women form close friendships with homosexual males, little {{research has}} investigated individual differences in women's tendency to befriend gay men. Because (1) gay men {{do not have the}} motive to mate with women or to compete with them for straight male partners and (2) <b>attractive</b> <b>women</b> {{are more likely to be}} sexually and competitively targeted by heterosexual individuals, we hypothesized that <b>attractive</b> <b>women</b> place greater value on gay's men mating advice and are more likely to befriend them. In Study 1, participants indicated their likelihood of deceiving female targets. Results revealed that more attractive targets were more likely to be both sexually deceived by straight men and competitively deceived by women. In Study 2, women created their ideal group of friends by allocating "friend dollars" to individuals of different genders and sexual orientations. More <b>attractive</b> <b>women</b> allocated more dollars to gay male friends, and this outcome was mediated by their perception that gay men would value them beyond sex and could offer them valuable mating advice. These findings suggest that befriending gay men may be an important feature of women's mating strategies, especially among <b>attractive</b> <b>women</b> who face greater mating threats from heterosexual individuals...|$|R
500|$|Academics and biographers {{reviewing}} the play have also expressed mixed opinions. Theater scholar Gerald Bordman declared it [...] "an unexceptional courtroom drama" [...] made popular by the jury element, although he noted {{praise for the}} acting of Breese and Pidgeon.

He said the play was [...] "great entertainment" [...] that is [...] "held together by an enormously <b>attractive</b> <b>woman</b> and a gimmick", but [...] "it is not philosophy" [...] and fails to convey the themes Rand had in mind. Jennifer Burns expressed a similar view, stating that the play's attempts to portray individualism had [...] "dubious results... Rand intended Bjorn Faulkner to embody heroic individualism, but in the play he comes off {{as little more than}} an unscrupulous businessman with a taste for rough sex". Literature scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein described the play as [...] "significant for dramatic ingenuity and thematic content". Rand biographer Anne Heller considered it [...] "engaging, if stilted", while Ronald Merrill described it as [...] "a skillfully constructed drama" [...] undercut by [...] "Rand's peculiar inability to write an effective mystery plot without leaving holes". Mystery critic Marvin Lachman noted the novelty of the use of a jury but called the play unrealistic with [...] "stilted dialogue" [...] and [...] "stereotypical characters".|$|E
