25|$|The quarrel of <b>the</b> Ancients <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moderns</b> was a {{literary}} and artistic quarrel that heated up in <b>the</b> early 1690s <b>and</b> shook <b>the</b> Académie française. The opposing two sides were, the Ancients (Anciens) who constrain choice of subjects to those {{drawn from the}} literature of Antiquity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moderns</b> (Modernes), who supported {{the merits of the}} authors of the century of Louis XIV. Fontenelle quickly followed with his Digression sur les anciens et les modernes (1688), in which he took <b>the</b> <b>Modern</b> side, pressing <b>the</b> argument that <b>modern</b> scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.|$|R
5|$|Batwoman is a superheroine {{appearing}} in American comic books published by DC Comics. In all incarnations, {{the character is}} a wealthy heiress who becomes inspired by the superhero Batman and chooses, like him, to put her wealth and resources towards a war on crime as a masked vigilante in her home of Gotham City. The identity of Batwoman is shared by two heroines in mainstream DC publications; both women are named Katherine Kane, with the original Batwoman commonly referred to by her nickname Kathy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> incarnation going by the name Kate.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{learning}} theories <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> dual-coding theory {{support the}} introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in the NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field. He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player strikes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} at Harvard, Whitehead {{produced}} his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote Science <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Modern</b> World, which was immediately hailed {{as an alternative to}} the Cartesian dualism that plagued popular science. Lectures from 1927–28, were published in 1929 as a book named Process and Reality, which has been compared (both in importance and difficulty) to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.|$|E
5|$|Field {{lacrosse}} is a {{full contact}} outdoor men's sport played with ten players on each team.

Field lacrosse {{is one of three}} major versions of lacrosse played internationally. The other versions, women's lacrosse (established in the 1890s) and box lacrosse (which originated in the 1930s), are played under significantly different rules.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of Europe, the Middle Ages or Medieval Period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century.

The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.|$|E
