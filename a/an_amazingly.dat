25|$|Thermotaxis is {{movement}} along a gradient of temperature. The slugs {{have been}} shown to migrate along extremely shallow gradients of only 0.05°C/cm, but the direction chosen is complicated; it seems to be away from a temperature about 2°C below the temperature to which they had been acclimated. This complicated behavior has been analyzed by computer modeling of the behavior and the periodic pattern of temperature changes in soil caused by daily changes in air temperature. The conclusion is that the behavior moves slugs a few centimeters below the soil surface up to the surface. This is <b>an</b> <b>amazingly</b> sophisticated behavior by a primitive organism with no apparent sense of gravity.|$|E

25|$|Another Pachyrhinosaurus bonebed, on the Wapiti River {{south of}} Beaverlodge in northwestern Alberta, was worked briefly by {{staff of the}} Royal Tyrrell Museum in the late 1980s but is now worked {{annually}} for a couple weeks each summer (since 2006) by the University of Alberta. Material from this site appears referable to Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis. In 1974, Grande Prairie, Alberta science teacher Al Lakusta found a large bonebed along Pipestone Creek in Alberta. When the area was finally excavated between 1986 and 1989 by staff and volunteers of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, paleontologists discovered <b>an</b> <b>amazingly</b> large and dense selection of bones—up to 100per square meter, {{with a total of}} 3500bones and 14skulls. This was apparently the site of a mass mortality, perhaps a failed attempt to cross a river during a flood. Found amongst the fossils were the skeletons of four distinct age groups ranging from juveniles to full grown dinosaurs, indicating that the Pachyrhinosaurus cared for their young. The adult skulls had both convex and concave bosses as well as unicorn-style horns on the parietal bone just behind their eyes. The concave boss types might be related to erosion only and not reflect male/female differences.|$|E

500|$|Readers of AfterElton.com voted Jack {{the tenth}} best gay or {{bisexual}} television character of all time, the poll itself ultimately being won by Brian Kinney, a character from the North American version of Queer as Folk which {{was developed by}} Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman from the British series created by Russell T Davies. The website praised Jack—one of only two bisexual characters {{on the list of}} 25—for being having both [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "tender" [...] sides to his personality, as seen in the Torchwood episode [...] "Captain Jack Harkness". Amongst science fiction characters, Jack also topped another AfterElton rundown of top characters, beating Hellblazers John Constantine for the top spot, commenting upon Jack's representation of a [...] "'post-gay' approach to sexual themes" [...] and awarding him a full 10/10 for cultural significance. For the AfterElton 2008 Visibility Awards, Jack won the award for Favourite TV Character. The website commented that [...] "unlike virtually every other TV sci-fi character, lead or supporting, Captain Jack is also openly bisexual. Ironically, this [...] "small" [...] change served to help make the science fiction genre, long the ultimate bastion of straight men, accessible not just to GLBT people, but also straight women, who also enjoy the show’s alternate take on sexuality." [...] The third award won for Torchwood, after Favourite TV Drama and Character, was won by Jack and Ianto for Best Couple, for which the editor commented [...] "Torchwood is revolutionary not just because the producers dare to put openly bisexual (or in Jack’s case [...] "omnisexual") characters in the formerly sacrosanct setting of sci-fi; it’s also that it presents these bisexual characters in such <b>an</b> <b>amazingly</b> matter-of-fact way.

[...] adding, [...] "I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, Grey’s Anatomy has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as [...] "McDreamy.", the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if Shonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got <b>an</b> <b>amazingly</b> high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run."
