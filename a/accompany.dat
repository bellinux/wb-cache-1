40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides the}} first comprehensive study ever undertaken of Handel's <b>accompanied</b> recitatives. It traces {{the evolution of the}} medium within his vocal works from 1704 up until the composer's final English language works in the 1750 s. Using music manuscripts, wordbooks, the early printed editions and documentary evidence a detailed picture of Handel' s musical and dramatic choices relating to his <b>accompanied</b> recitatives comes into view. The principle singers for whom Handel's <b>accompanied</b> recitatives were originally written and the differences between <b>accompanied</b> recitatives in acted and un-acted works are discussed in detail, and possible influences on the young Handel, with regard to <b>accompanied</b> recitative, are also considered. The connection between <b>accompanied</b> recitative and the supernatural in the composer's vocal works is also discussed, and his use of <b>accompanied</b> recitative to distort closed forms and his reasons for doing so are explored. The problems relating to the terminology of eighteenth-century <b>accompanied</b> recitative are discussed at length, and a history of the medium is provided.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} patients who are <b>accompanied</b> by another person (ie, partner, child, relative, friend) during visits to their doctors; to describe the demographic characteristics and role(s) assumed by the main <b>accompanying</b> person {{and the nature of}} the presenting dyads; and to describe the influence of the main <b>accompanying</b> person on the patient-doctor interaction. DESIGN: Prospective observational survey. SETTING: Family practices in London, Ont, and surrounding area. PARTICIPANTS: Eight family physicians completed surveys on 100 consecutive patients attending for both regularly scheduled and emergency visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Roles and influence of the main <b>accompanying</b> person. RESULTS: Approximately one third (30. 4 %) of patients were <b>accompanied</b> during visits to their doctors. Children and patients older than 75 years most frequently had another person with them. Most patients (74. 1 %) were <b>accompanied</b> by one person who most often was female (72. 6 %) and between the ages of 21 and 40 years (53. 6 %). The <b>accompanying</b> person's role was most frequently described by doctors as an advocate for the patient (n = 235, 68. 5 %). If the <b>accompanying</b> person was a child, however, the role was most often described as a silent observer (n = 36, 68. 6 %). The influence of the main <b>accompanying</b> person on the patient-doctor encounter was usually described as positive (95. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians report that people <b>accompanying</b> patients usually have a positive influence on medical encounters. Future studies need to include patients' and <b>accompanying</b> persons' perspectives...|$|R
