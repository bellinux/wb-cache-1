40|$|Kenwood House was {{currently}} undergoing a major phase of repairs, redecoration and re-appraisal. This provided the ideal {{opportunity to look}} at the interior decorative finishes of the house in selected main areas of the ground floor and to perhaps link through series of rooms to provide some rationale in the presentation of the spaces. The Entrance Hall, Great Stairs, Anteroom to Library and Library are generally presented as it is currently believed that they appeared when Adam completed the house in the 1770 ’s. This research exercise focuses on this suite of 4 interiors which potentially would offer a rational route through the most complete Adam spaces, commencing with the main Entrance Hall and culminating within the Library, which is {{considered by many to be}} Robert Adam’s masterpiece of interiors. At the time of this research commencing, the interiors did not present a cohesive, informed presentation. The Entrance Hall was redecorated at the end of last century based on the research of Helen Hughes and recoded within documentation dating from 1996. It was not know if the current schemes within the remaining interiors, were based on any research or archival investigations. It was felt that further research was required looking at all four of these interiors as a ‘suite’. The proposed redecoration and representation of the house and its interiors, presented an ideal opportunity to look closely at these spaces as a unified route through the house. It was also considered that an awareness of the previous decorative history might provide guidance on a more informed and suitable redecoration and perhaps unification of the spaces into a cohesive suite of interiors. This findings report records the evidence for each interior, primarily looking at the evidence for the original Adam schemes and compares that evidence to the current ‘Adamesque’ style decoration. Within this first document the Entrance Hall has not been included. The previous research defined extensive physical and archival evidence for the <b>Adam</b> <b>scheme.</b> The accuracy of the recreation at the end of last century is to be appraise...|$|E

Some of these methods are explicit, such as Euler <b>scheme,</b> <b>Adams</b> <b>scheme,</b> and Runge–Kutta scheme, we refer the reader to [9, 10] and the references therein.

50|$|<b>Adam's</b> <b>scheme</b> {{was unusual}} {{in that it}} avoided the {{standard}} form of 18th-century parish church design, which consisted typically of a rectangle with a western tower or portico (or both) and perhaps an eastern chancel. Instead, by adding towers at {{the east and west}} ends and semi-circular porticoes on the north and south sides, Adam created a design that was symmetrical along both the long and short axes. This unusual arrangement was possibly influenced by the design of Roman tombs and the result was most unconventional. Mistley would certainly have stood out from other 18th-century churches.|$|R
50|$|The front {{facade of}} Preston Hall has been {{compared}} to an illustration in the 1728 Essay in the Defence of Ancient Architecture by Robert Morris, and was considered somewhat dated {{at the time of its}} construction. The rear is more neoclassical in style, comprising a large central block flanked by pavilions. The pavilions may predate the main building, possibly being part of William <b>Adam's</b> <b>scheme,</b> albeit remodelled by Mitchell. Significant features of the interior include four life-size female figures in the stairway, which are made from Coade stone, a type of ceramic used as an artificial stone.|$|R
50|$|In 1758 {{the estate}} passed to James Murray of Broughton, who sold it 1764 to the {{merchant}} Richard Oswald, {{who built the}} present Auchincruive House. Robert Adam provided a design for a house to James Murray in 1764, although Oswald built the house, in modified form, in 1767. <b>Adam's</b> <b>scheme</b> for the interiors was carried out as planned. Adam also designed Oswald's Temple, a castellated temple or tea-house, which stands on a nearby hill and was completed in 1778. Oswald was appointed as the British peace commissioner who negotiated the Treaty of Paris in 1783 when the American War of Independence came to an end. After the negotiations, he retired to Auchincruive where he died the following year.|$|R
40|$|The buoyancy-induced {{thermal fluid}} {{instability}} between two parallel horizontal plates {{has been investigated}} numerically by solving the governing equations of base and perturbation fields using a fractional algorithm, in which the fourth-order <b>Adams</b> <b>scheme</b> and the Bi-CGSTAB scheme are embedded. An initial assumption of the perturbed temperature was made by a Gaussian random number generator. A primitive static fluid with Prandtl number 0. 73 was induced to flow in {{the gap between the}} two horizontal parallel plates for three different cases: top heating, bottom heating and heating from both plates. The kinetic energy of induced flow in each vertical section and in the whole domain was calculated. The results can demonstrate whether the thermal fluid flow is stable or unstable. A linear decaying behavior is found after the initial stage. The total fluid kinetic energy in the domain converges for the top heating case, but diverges for the other two heating cases.

40|$|When the {{internal}} waves break, {{they are one}} of the sources of small-scale turbulence. Small-scale turbulence causes the vertical exchange in the ocean. However, internal waves with regard to the Earth rotation in the presence of vertically inhomogeneous two-dimensional current are able to contribute to the vertical transport. Free inertial-gravity internal waves in a baroclinic current in a boundless basin of a constant depth are considered in the Bussinesq approximation. Boundary value problem of linear approximation for the vertical velocity amplitude of internal waves has complex coefficients when current velocity component, which is transversal to the wave propagation direction, depends on the vertical coordinate (taking into account the rotation of the Earth). Eigenfunction and wave frequency are complex, and it is shown that a weak wave damping takes place. Dispersive relation and wave damping decrement are calculated in the linear approximation. At a fixed wave number damping decrement of the second mode is larger (in the absolute value) than the one of the first mode. The equation for vertical velocity amplitude for real profiles of the Brunt – Vaisala frequency and current velocity are numerically solved according to implicit <b>Adams</b> <b>scheme</b> of the third order of accuracy. The dispersive curves of the first two modes do not reach inertial frequency in the low-frequency area due to the effect of critical layers in which wave frequency of the Doppler shift is equal to the inertial one. Termination of the second mode dispersive curves takes place at higher frequency than the one of the first mode. In the second order of the wave amplitude the Stokes drift speed is determined. It is shown that the Stokes drift speed, which is transversal to the wave propagation direction, differs from zero if the transversal component of current velocity depends on the vertical coordinate. In this case, the Stokes drift speed in the second mode is lower than in the first mode only in the pycnocline, outside the pycnocline their values are comparable in absolute value. The longitudinal component of the Stokes drift velocity of 15 -min second mode internal waves observed in the field experiment during the 44 th voyage of R/V “Mikhail Lomonosov” on the northwestern shelf of the Black Sea is by an order of magnitude greater than the transversal one. Vertical wave fluxes of the momentum also differ from zero and can be either comparable with the corresponding turbulent fluxes or exceed them...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} spectral-difference {{methods of}} a high-order of accuracy for solving the one-way wave equation using the Laguerre integral transform {{with respect to}} time as the base. In order to provide a high spatial accuracy and calculation stability, the Richardson method can be employed. However such an approach requires high computer costs, therefore we consider alternative algorithms based on the <b>Adams</b> multistep <b>schemes.</b> To reach the stability first for the 1 D one-way equation and then for the 2 D case, the stabilizing procedures using the spline interpolation were developed. This made possible to efficiently implement a predictor-corrector type method in terms of which a boundary value problem for high-order elliptic equations is substituted for a sequence of inversions of second order elliptic operators thus decreasing computer costs. To assess the accuracy and stability of difference approximations for the 1 D one-way wave equation, the analytical solution based on the double Laguerre transform was obtained. This solution can be efficiently calculated if for summation one makes use of fast algorithms of computing a discrete linear convolution. For the 2 D one-way wave equation the stability and accuracy of the procedures proposed have been studied on implementing the migration algorithm within a problem of seismic prospecting.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{simulate}} numerically the Fluid-Structure Interaction for flow through valves of a hermetic compressor using immersed boundary method. The paper is primarily concerned with the mathematical structure {{and implementation of the}} Immersed Boundary Method which includes both the Immersed Boundary form of the equations of motion and also the Immersed Boundary numerical Scheme. The flow pattern of the fluid in the compressor is intimately connected with the performance of the valves, and this paper presents a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in 2 D of a Newtonian fluid under laminar regime, in the presence of moving immersed boundaries, being the fluid treated as isothermal. The immersed boundary method has evolved into a generally useful method for problems of Fluid-structure interaction. In this approach, the mathematical formulation employs a mixture of Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, the fluid is represented in a Eulerian co-ordinate frame and the structures or the interacting surfaces are considered in a Lagrangian co-ordinate frame. The two types of variables are linked by interaction equations that involve a smoothed approximation to the Dirac delta function, constructed according to the principles established in [1], which plays a prominent role. In the numerical scheme motivated by the Immersed Boundary formulation, the Eulerian variables are defined on a fixed Cartesian frame, and the Lagrangian variables are defined on a curvilinear mesh that moves freely through the fixed Cartesian mesh without being constrained to adapt to it in any way at all. Eulerian/Lagrangian identities govern the transfer of data from one mesh to another.
