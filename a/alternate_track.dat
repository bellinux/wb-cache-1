500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Smith {{released}} his debut album, Boomin' Words from Hell, in 1989. Of the album, Smith stated, [...] "It was the crack era, [...] and that's where all that really came from. It was all an expression about [...] Young Boys Incorporated, Mayor Coleman Young, the city we lived in and just the turmoil that our city was going through at the time. We referred {{to the streets of}} Detroit as 'Hell' on that record. So that's where my ideas came from." [...] In 1990, Esham and James H. Smith founded the independent record label Reel Life Productions, which reissued his debut album with an <b>alternate</b> <b>track</b> listing and artwork. Esham found it difficult to develop a fanbase, because many wrote off the dark content of his lyrics and imagery as shock value, while hip hop fans did not connect to Esham's albums because of his heavy metal influences.|$|E

500|$|During 1995 Corgan {{wrote about}} fifty-six songs, {{following}} which the band {{went into the}} studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as [...] "The Wall for Generation X", and which became Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, a double album of twenty-eight songs, lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an <b>alternate</b> <b>track</b> listing). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually {{as a symbol of}} the cycle of life and death. Praised by Time as [...] "the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet", Mellon Collie debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in October 1995. Even more successful than Siamese Dream, it was certified ten times platinum in the United States and became the best-selling double album of the decade to date. It also garnered seven 1997 Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year. The band won only the Best Hard Rock Performance award, for the album's lead single [...] "Bullet with Butterfly Wings". The album spawned five singles—"Bullet with Butterfly Wings", [...] "1979", [...] "Zero", [...] "Tonight, Tonight" [...] which Corgan stated was inspired by the Cheap Trick song [...] "I'll Be with You Tonight", [...] and [...] "Thirty-Three"—of which the first three were certified gold and all but [...] "Zero" [...] entered the Top 40. Many of the remaining songs that did not make it onto Mellon Collie were released as B-sides to the singles, and were eventually compiled in The Aeroplane Flies High box set. As a testament to the band's popularity, Virgin Records originally intended to limit the set to 200,000 copies, but produced more after the original run sold out due to overwhelming demand.|$|E

2500|$|James H. Smith {{founded the}} label in 1988 with his younger brother, Esham, a rapper. According to Esham, {{by the time}} he had started to rap, Detroit did not have a {{prominent}} hip hop scene. Smith states that [...] "Everybody was just imitating what everybody else was doing". His older brother, James, encouraged him to seriously pursue a career as a rapper because of the city's limited hip hop scene. At the age of 13, Esham released his debut album, Boomin' Words from Hell, in 1989. In 1990, Reel Life Productions reissued his debut album with an <b>alternate</b> <b>track</b> listing and artwork.

2500|$|Orbit's {{production}} received {{positive feedback}} from critics. Simon Goddard of Q listed MDNA as Madonna's best album since Ray of Light (1998), as did Chicago Tribune reviewer Greg Kot, {{who felt that}} the singer outdid on the Orbit-produced tracks. Caryn Ganz from Spin had a similar thought, saying that [...] "if there's one producer {{who knows how to}} pluck Madonna's heartstrings, it's... Orbit". Ganz rated the album 7 out of 10. Writing for The New York Times, Jon Pareles theorized that it is Madonna's [...] "pop instinct" [...] and her ability to craft song hooks, is what [...] "gets her through MDNA". In his consumer guide review, critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A– rating. He preferred an <b>alternate</b> <b>track</b> list of the record, preferring the slow-tempo songs like [...] "Falling Free", [...] "Masterpiece", [...] "Love Spent" [...] and [...] "I Fucked Up". Although he was not that impressed by the lyrics, Christgau nevertheless listed [...] "Love Spent" [...] as a highlight.|$|E

In addition to this, 50 Cent was featured on the album's US lead single, {{a new version}} of the Jonsin-produced, [...] "Right There". American hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg was to appear on one of the new songs recorded for the US album. At the time of recording in August 2011, Scherzinger had over forty songs to choose from for the new release, but said that it would [...] "not be finished until the very last minute. I don't know if I will ever feel like I have finished the album." [...] After being part of the inaugural judging panel on the first season of reality TV show, The X Factor USA, the following year in 2012, Scherzinger crossed the Atlantic to judge (and win) the [...] ninth series of the British edition of The X Factor. Whilst deciding whether or not to return to tenth series, Scherzinger unveiled that she had been working on her second studio album due for a global release in November 2013. This officially signaled the end of the Killer Love era, and resulting in the cancellation of the album's US release.|$|E
