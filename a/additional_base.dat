5|$|One {{exception}} in this rule {{occurs when the}} defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete a double play or triple play. An error is not charged in that situation if a wild throw allows the runner to reach safely. If a wild throw allows the runner to advance an <b>additional</b> <b>base,</b> an error may then be charged for the additional advance. However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete a double play or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E

25|$|The Maine National High Adventure Area was {{established}} in 1970 due {{to the efforts of}} BSA Scout Executive Bud Jeffrey, Seven Island Lands Company President John Sinclair, and Bill Wadsworth and John Donnell of the BSA National Office. The first of three Maine National High Adventure bases {{was established}} {{at the site of the}} former Foster’s Matagamon Sporting Camp on the north side of Matagamon Lake, and was called Maine Matagamon National High Adventure Base. This base operated as a single unit in 1971 and 1972. An <b>additional</b> <b>base</b> was established at Pittston Farm on Seboomook Lake in 1973, and a third on Sysladobsis Lake, was operated in 1971 and 1979.|$|E

25|$|Londonderry {{became an}} {{important}} naval base supporting the Battle of the Atlantic and a large traffic in personnel and materiel developed. At its peak in April 1943 some 20 500 men travelled to Londonderry. The facilities at Londonderry were inconvenient and rapidly became inadequate {{to cope with the}} buildup in naval activity; in late 1941 the Royal Navy started work on an <b>additional</b> <b>base</b> with extensive jetties at Lisahally about four miles (6km) from Londonderry. The NCC already had a siding at this location and a new signal cabin and crossing loop were installed. Lisahally base was much used by allied navies during the Battle of the Atlantic {{and at the end of}} the war as a berth for captured German U-boats.|$|E
500|$|On 31 July 1942, Blamey {{informed}} Rowell that I Corps headquarters {{would be}} sent to Port Moresby to control operations in New Guinea. [...] Rowell arrived in Port Moresby on 13 August 1942 and assumed command of New Guinea Force from Major General Basil Morris. Rowell's I Corps headquarters took over operational control from Morris's, which became that of ANGAU. The only warning that Morris had of Rowell's arrival was a message from the DCGS, Vasey, which simply said: [...] "Syd is coming". The situation was dire. Japanese were steadily advancing on Port Moresby along the Kokoda Trail and were also threatening Milne Bay and Wau. Rowell and his staff were all seasoned officers with combat experience in the Middle East and the Battle of Malaya and [...] "brought to New Guinea skill and organisation that Morris and his staff had been unable to provide". However, the main body of Rowell's staff did not arrive until 17 August. Rowell turned down a suggestion from Blamey that he needed <b>additional</b> <b>base</b> staff to cope with his administrative problems, given that a corps headquarters was a tactical headquarters, intended to operate as part of an army, with the latter handling most of the administrative work. Rowell's staff gradually discovered how enormous the task before them was; they had few maps, the only transport aircraft were destroyed in a Japanese raid, and the supplies that had been forwarded by air to Kokoda could not be located.|$|E

5000|$|Often, runners {{will get}} into a rundown or [...] "hotbox," [...] for which the drill is named; the fielders must use {{teamwork}} and skill to put the runners out.

2500|$|In April 1944 the Army Air Forces {{developed}} a new, temporary organization {{known as the}} Army Air Forces Base Unit (AAFBU), usually referred to as [...] "AAF Base Units" [...] to standardize unit designations assigned to bases, one for each base in the United States, with separate <b>additional</b> <b>base</b> units to provide personnel overhead for wings, regions, and higher echelons. [...] All organizations on the base were designated as squadrons of the base unit, identified by letters from [...] "A" [...] to [...] "Z". [...] Personnel were reassigned to the new squadrons, and the previous squadron designations were inactivated.|$|E
2500|$|The FOXP2 gene showed {{indications}} of recent positive selection. Some researchers {{have speculated that}} positive selection is crucial {{for the evolution of}} language in humans. [...] Others, however, have been unable to find a clear association between species with learned vocalizations and similar mutations in FOXP2. Insertion of both human mutations into mice, whose version of FOXP2 otherwise differs from the human and chimpanzee versions in only one <b>additional</b> <b>base</b> pair, causes changes in vocalizations as well as other behavioral changes, such as a reduction in exploratory tendencies. A reduction in dopamine levels and changes in the morphology of certain nerve cells are also observed.|$|E
2500|$|A large update {{released}} in November 2016, {{known as the}} [...] "Foundation Update", added the ability for players to define a planet as a [...] "home planet", and construct a base on that planet from modular components created from collected resources. Once constructed, the player can then immediately return to their base via teleportation from a space station {{in the rest of}} the galaxy. The base supports adding special stations, such as research terminals, that can be manned by one of the sentient aliens, which can help to unlock <b>additional</b> <b>base</b> components and blueprints, tend to harvesting flora for resources, and other aspects. The player may opt to tear down the base and relocate to a different home planet at any time. The player also has abilities to construct devices such as automatic mineral drills in the field. Players are able to purchase starship freighters, which serve both as a space-bound base, with similar base-building and construction options as the planetary base, and as additional storage capacity that collected resources can be transferred.|$|E

2500|$|The {{text of the}} BSA was {{approved}} by the delegates at the Loya Jirga on 24 November 2013 and must now be signed by the Afghanistan president, who rejected the final recommendation of the Loya Jirga promptly to sign the BSA with the United States, and sent to the parliament for final ratification. If approved, the agreement would allow the U.S. to deploy military advisors to train and equip Afghan security forces, along with U.S. special-operations troops for anti-terrorism missions against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Obama will determine the size of the force. The jirga set a few conditions before expressing approval for the agreement among them a 10-year time limit on the post-2014 troop presence and reparations for damages caused by U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan. It also voted attach a letter by Obama; pledging that U.S. troops would enter Afghan homes only in [...] "extraordinary" [...] circumstances and only if American lives were at direct risk, to the BSA. The elder assembly also demanded the release of 19 Afghans from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay and a stronger U.S. pledge to defend Afghanistan from any incursion from it neighbors, particularly Pakistan. The loya jirga also voted to request that the U.S. military add a base to the nine bases that would be occupied by U.S. troops under the proposed security pact after combat forces depart Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The base is in Bamian Province in central Afghanistan, where the NATO-led military coalition has maintained a presence. Bamian is a population center for Hazaras, a Shiite minority whose members were massacred by the Taliban prior to the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the militant group. Afghan analysts said Hazara delegates proposed the <b>additional</b> <b>base.</b> At least five of the 50 jirga committees raised objections to the article addressing [...] "status of personnel" [...] which [...] "authorises the United States to hold [...] trial ... or take other disciplinary action, as appropriate, in the territory of Afghanistan" [...] when a US soldier is accused of criminal activity. Spokespeople from at least two committees directly stated that Afghanistan should have jurisdiction over any US soldiers accused of crimes on Afghan soil. Several committees also stated that if trials are held in the United States, families of victims should have access to and presence in US-held trials at the expense of Washington.|$|E
