5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to myself that I could do a storyboard, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E
500|$|Mikoyan {{received}} his {{education at the}} Nersisian School in Tiflis and the Gevorgian Seminary in Vagharshapat (Echmiadzin), both affiliated with the Armenian Apostolic Church. Religion, however, played an increasingly insignificant role in his life. He would later remark that his continued studies in theology drew him closer to atheism: [...] "I had a very clear feeling that I didn't believe in God <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> in fact received a certificate in materialist uncertainty; the more I studied religious subjects, the less I believed in God." [...] Before becoming active in politics Mikoyan had already dabbled {{in the study of}} liberalism and socialism.|$|E
500|$|Although Eugenides sought {{expert advice}} about intersex, sexology, and the {{formation}} of gender identity, he refrained from meeting with intersex people, saying, [...] " [...] decided not to work in that reportorial mode. Instead of trying to create a separate person, I tried to pretend that I had this [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lived through this as much as I could". Eugenides read books, sifted through many sheets of microfiche, and combed through videotapes and newsletters that dealt with the subject. He visited the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture to search for the sole copy of a book about an [...] "elusive historical figure". He discovered details of what he considered a vivid intersex condition while browsing Columbia University's medical library.|$|E

2500|$|Muhammad bin Uqbah {{said that}} when death {{approached}} Muawiyah he said: [...] "I wish I were an ordinary man from the Quraish living in Dhu Tuwa <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never been invested with authority as caliph" ...|$|E
2500|$|Arnold {{was soon}} shown the Rhodes photos {{when he met}} with two AAF {{intelligence}} officers. He commented, [...] "It was a disk almost {{identical to the one}} peculiar flying saucer that had been worrying me since my original observation — the one that looked different from the rest <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never mentioned to anyone." [...] As a result, Arnold felt that the Rhodes photos were genuine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, Panzram {{was arrested}} for {{burglary}} in Washington. During his interrogation, he voluntarily confessed to killing two boys. In light of his extensive criminal record, he received a 25-years-to-life sentence. Upon arriving at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, he warned the warden, [...] "I'll kill the first man that bothers me", and was given a solitary job in the prison laundry room. On June 20, 1929, he beat the laundry foreman to death with an iron bar, {{and was sentenced to}} death. He refused to allow any appeals of his sentence. In response to offers from death penalty opponents and human rights activists to intervene, he wrote, [...] "The only thanks you and your kind will ever get from me for your efforts on my behalf is that I wish you all had one neck <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my hands on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{talk to me}} of Captain Aylmer. <b>Have</b> <b>I</b> said {{anything}} against him? <b>Have</b> <b>I</b> ventured to make any objection? Of course, I know his superiority to myself. <b>I</b> know <b>that</b> {{he is a man}} of the world, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not; <b>that</b> he is educated, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am ignorant; <b>that</b> he <b>has</b> a position, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> none; <b>that</b> he has much to offer, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> nothing. Of course, I see the difference; but that does not make me comfortable." ...|$|R

2500|$|On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department {{released}} the full report, photographs from Cornell's hotel room, and the 911 {{call from the}} MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell's death. The call was made by an hotel employee at 12:56a.m., reporting [...] "a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136". According to the report, Martin Kirsten, Cornell's bodyguard, was at the singer's hotel room at 11:30p.m. {{to help him with}} his computer, [...] "which was not working at that time." [...] It also says that Cornell's wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35p.m., and alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband [...] "because he did not sound like he was OK." [...] A call from Cornell's wife at 12:15a.m. prompted his bodyguard to go to the singer's suite to check on him. Kirsten told police he was in his room watching TV when he {{received a phone call from}} Vicky. [...] "She sounded angry because he [...] wasn’t responding to his phone. She told me to go to the room and check on Chris. I came to the room and was unable to get (in) because of the interior latch. I went back to my room and called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn’t my room, although I told them that he was my employer <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a key." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} that I was {{much of the}} same opinion, but that Dogeetah insisted upon going <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no choice.|$|E

60|$|I now raised {{myself on}} my elbow, and putting {{my hand to}} my forehead, found {{that it had been}} cut pretty severely, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lost a good deal of blood.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, that {{is kind of}} you,' said Undy, 'considering {{that you}} are the girl's trustee, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no more to do with it than that fellow in the wig there.' ...|$|R
