25|$|Zeolites have a porous {{structure}} that can accommodate {{a wide variety}} of cations, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and others. These positive ions are rather loosely held and can readily be exchanged for others in a contact solution. Some of the more common mineral zeolites are analcime, chabazite, clinoptilolite, heulandite, natrolite, phillipsite, and stilbite. An example of the mineral formula of <b>a</b> <b>zeolite</b> is: Na2Al2Si3O10·2H2O, the formula for natrolite.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, a {{study of}} three small villages in central Cappadocia—Tuzköy, Karain and Sarıhıdır—found that {{mesothelioma}} was causing 50% of all deaths. Initially, this was attributed to erionite, <b>a</b> <b>zeolite</b> mineral with similar properties to asbestos, but detailed epidemiological investigation demonstrated that the substance causes the disease mostly in families with a genetic predisposition to mineral fiber carcinogenesis.

25|$|Alkenes are {{produced}} by hydrocarbon cracking. Raw materials are mostly natural gas condensate components (principally ethane and propane) in the US and Mideast and naphtha in Europe and Asia. Alkanes are broken apart at high temperatures, often {{in the presence of}} <b>a</b> <b>zeolite</b> catalyst, to produce a mixture of primarily aliphatic alkenes and lower molecular weight alkanes. The mixture is feedstock and temperature dependent, and separated by fractional distillation. This is mainly used for the manufacture of small alkenes (up to six carbons).|$|E
2500|$|It is also {{possible}} to separate oxygen from air by passing the air, under pressure, through <b>a</b> <b>zeolite</b> sieve that selectively adsorbs the nitrogen and lets the oxygen (and argon) pass. This gives a purity of oxygen of about 93%. This method works well for brazing, but higher-purity oxygen is necessary to produce a clean, slag-free [...] when cutting.|$|E
2500|$|A {{specialized}} industrial route {{entails the}} catalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol. [...] This method is more cost {{effective than the}} esterification but is applied with surplus ethanol in a chemical plant. Typically, dehydrogenation is conducted with copper at an elevated temperature but below 250°C. The copper may have its surface area increased by depositing it on zinc, promoting the growth of snowflake-like fractal structures (dendrites). Surface area can be again increased by deposition onto <b>a</b> <b>zeolite,</b> typically ZSM-5. Traces of rare-earth and alkali metals are beneficial to the process. Byproducts of the dehydrogenation include diethyl ether, which is thought to arise primarily due to aluminum sites in the catalyst, acetaldehyde and its aldol products, higher esters, and ketones. Separations of the byproducts are {{complicated by the fact}} that ethanol forms an azeotrope with water, as does ethyl acetate with ethanol and water, and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK, which forms from 2-butanol) with both ethanol and ethyl acetate. [...] These azeotropes are broken by pressure swing distillation or membrane distillation.|$|E

2500|$|Zeolites are the {{aluminosilicate}} {{members of}} the family of microporous solids known as [...] "molecular sieves" [...] mainly consisting of Si, Al, O, and metals including Ti, Sn, Zn, and so on. The term molecular sieve refers to a particular property of these materials, i.e., the ability to selectively sort molecules based primarily on a size exclusion process. This is due to a very regular pore structure of molecular dimensions. The maximum size of the molecular or ionic species that can enter the pores of <b>a</b> <b>zeolite</b> is controlled by the dimensions of the channels. These are conventionally defined by the ring size of the aperture, where, for example, the term [...] "8-ring" [...] refers to a closed loop that is built from eight tetrahedrally coordinated silicon (or aluminium) atoms and 8 oxygen atoms. These rings are not always perfectly symmetrical due to a variety of effects, including strain induced by the bonding between units that are needed to produce the overall structure, or coordination of some of the oxygen atoms of the rings to cations within the structure. Therefore, the pores in many zeolites are not cylindrical.|$|E
