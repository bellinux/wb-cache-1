Possible artefacts from thermal oxidation with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) on BC quantification of C-rich deposits were inferred by choosing three sites from a second peatland with no historical record of waste disposal as a reference ("Seebodenalp"). All sites were under grassland at time of sampling, but were partially cropped in the past at Witzwil. Mean BC contents in topsoils of Witzwil ranged from 10. 7 to 91. 5 (0 ? 30 cm) and from 0. 44 to 51. 3 (30 ? 140 cm) mg BC g ? 1 soil, corresponding to BC/OC ratios of 0. 04 to 0. 3 (topsoil) and 0. 02 to 0. 18 (deeper soil). At three sites of Seebodenalp, BC was below the detection limit of 0. 4 mg g ? 1 organic soil, indicating negligible formation of BC during thermal oxidation of peat. 13 C NMR spectra corroborated the high BC contents at Witzwil. The data support a considerable vertical transport of BC given that soils were ploughed not deeper than 30 cm since <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> application about 50 years ago. The total amount of BC in the Witzwil profiles ranged from 3. 2 to 7. 5 kg BC m ? 2, with 21 to 69 percent of it stemming from below the former ploughing depth. Under the premise of negligible rates of BC consumption since <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> application, minimum BC transport rates in these peats are 0. 6 to 1. 2 cm a ? 1. The high mobility of BC might be explained by high macro-pore volumes in combination with occasional water saturation. By means of DSC peak temperatures, different types of BC could be distinguished, with deeper horizons containing BC of higher thermal stability. Application of combustion residues likely involved a mixture of various BC types, of which thermally more stable ones, most likely soots, were preferentially transported downwards...|$|E
40|$|There {{are some}} {{definitions}} on {{the sphere of}} the region {{along the coast of}} Seto Inland Sea. Writer forms a good working definition of the range which includes Okayama, Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Ehime and Kagawa prefecture along the coast of Seto Inland Sea. Some isolated and dispersed industrial regions were formed around the ports or in the coastal cities before the World War II. The textile industry started as a modern industry in Okayama prefecture. The cotton spinning brought forth weaving and grew into rayon and synthetic industries later on. They spread and located on the Inland Sea area. Machine and shipbuilding industries developed chiefly for munitions on Hiroshima Bay and its outskirts. There were established cement and chemical industries of the dependance upon an abundant supply of limestone and coal in Yamaguchi prefecture. Those industrial regions formed the foundation of a remarkable industrial development on the Inland Sea area after the World War II. Regional developments have been carried out throughout the whole extent of Japan on the base of the multiple Purpose Land Development Law established in 1950. Industrial developments took the lead in the high-pitched growth period of Japanese economy after 1960. Many littoral industrial regions have been reclaimed from the Inland Sea and the oil chemical and the basic industries located there. Most of the oil chemical industries have built up the factory groups combined technically which deliver with oil refined material mutually through the pipeline or conveyer as an instance, what we call "Combinat". The industrial development in the Inland Sea area is typified by the new establishment and expansion of the processing industry with huge modern equipments. But it has brought about not only a serious nuisance of the pollution of the Inland Sea by mass <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> material and water, but a severe social problem of the excess agglomeration in the littoral cities and the excess sparsity in the mountain villages. Writer calculated an agglomeration degree, a gross added value to a square kilometer of the potential residential area from an industrial statistics and population decrease percentage from a national census by village, town and city. The industrial, subindustrial, excess sparse and exceptional regions are grouped on the Inland Sea area by a combination of them. Then the inhabitants' personal income was analyzed by the four groups in 1972, and following facts have been revealed. Though a local difference of the inhabitants' personal income has been revised in some degree through the expansion of the industrial regions in the Inland Sea area by prefecture, it is magnified among the four groups in each prefecture...|$|E

60|$|The antiquity of {{the port}} appeals to the {{imagination}} by the long chain of adventurous enterprises that had their inception in the town and floated {{out into the world}} on the waters of the river. Even the newest of the docks, the Tilbury Dock, shares in the glamour conferred by historical associations. Queen Elizabeth has made one of her progresses down there, not one of her journeys of pomp and ceremony, but an anxious business progress at a crisis of national history. The menace of that time has passed away, and now Tilbury is known by its docks. These are very modern, but their remoteness and isolation upon the Essex marsh, the days of failure attending their creation, invested them with a romantic air. Nothing in those days could have been more striking than the vast, empty basins, surrounded by miles of bare quays and the ranges of cargo-sheds, where two or three ships seemed lost like bewitched children in a forest of gaunt, hydraulic cranes. One received a wonderful impression <b>of</b> utter <b>abandonment,</b> <b>of</b> <b>wasted</b> efficiency. From the first the Tilbury Docks were very efficient and ready for their task, but they had come, perhaps, too soon into the field. A great future lies before Tilbury Docks. They shall never fill a long-felt want (in the sacramental phrase that is applied to railways, tunnels, newspapers, and new editions of books). They were too early in the field. The want shall never be felt because, free of the trammels of the tide, easy of access, magnificent and desolate, they are already there, prepared to take and keep the biggest ships that float upon the sea. They are worthy of the oldest river port in the world.|$|R
40|$|Soil {{pollution}} problems in Japan have mostly originated from the deveropment of mining after the Meiji era. Afterward, main mines are closed, and soil pollution by mining process have become caesed.

40|$|The {{closure of}} mercury mining areas is {{generally}} {{associated with a}} release of Hg and other metals into the environment due to the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> mining <b>wastes.</b> Because <b>of</b> their potential toxic properties, the mobilization of particulate and soluble metal species is of major concern. In the present study, the environmental risks posed by soils surrounding an abandoned mercury mining area in Valle del Azogue (Almeria, Spain) are assessed through the determination of physical-chemical parameters, the quantification of metal concentrations, {{and the application of}} aquatic and terrestrial ecotoxicity bioassays. Chemical analysis of soil samples revealed concentrations of Hg, As, Ba, Pb, Sb, and Zn above international intervention values. Results from terrestrial tests showed detrimental effects in all studied organisms (Eisenia foetida, Folsomia candida, and different plant species) and revealed the avoidance response of earthworms as the most sensitive endpoint. Surprisingly, the most toxic samples were not the ones with higher metal contents but the ones presenting higher electrical conductivity. Aquatic ecotoxicity tests with Vibrio fischeri, Raphidocelis subcapitata, Daphnia magna, and Danio rerio were in accordance with terrestrial tests, confirming the need to couple environmental chemistry with ecotoxicological tools for the proper assessment of metal-contaminated sites. In view of the results, a remediative intervention of the studied area is recommendedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{an attempt}} to {{construct}} a new agenda for waste management, this thesis explores {{the importance of the}} definition <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and its impact on waste management, and the role <b>of</b> ownership in <b>waste</b> management. It is recognised that present legal waste definitions are ambiguous and do not really give an insight into the concept <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> Moreover, despite its explicit wish <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> prevention, when according to present legislation a thing is assigned the label <b>of</b> a <b>waste,</b> {{it is going to be}} treated like waste, implicitly legislation thus amasses waste. The philosophical ramifications inherent in such definitions mean that they are not capable of constructing a system that, by its very nature, results in a sustainable waste management system. It is also a fact that, while there are numerous practices as to how to deal with a particular type <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> there is no theory <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management. In this thesis, waste as a concept is analysed from the point of view of why and when waste is created. Using the PSSP language, waste is classified based on the Purpose and Performance attributes. New, dynamic definitions for waste and waste management are offered, which explain why waste is created and intrinsically offer a solution to how the problem could be solved. Additional waste-related concepts are introduced, which are thought to have great potential for improvement on waste regulation. The concept of ownership is explained as rights and responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> creators/owners: it is thus crucial to raising awareness about waste. Ownership in itself often dictates which waste management options are preferentially adopted by a given community. The role of legislation in producing monitoring systems for the transfer of ownership as well as <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> ownership is analysed. To avoid obstacles to resource conservation due to materials being considered waste, a definition for non-waste is introduced. The new agenda for waste management thus focuses upon the development of more appropriate, sustainable definitions so that what is now commonly perceived as being waste will in fact be increasingly seen as resource-rich, 'non-waste'. The role <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management is explained as control of all waste-related activities, with the aim of preventing, minimising or utilising waste. The need for a theory <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management is explained, and the first building blocks of the theory are proposed. This thesis is offered as the first step toward scientification <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management...|$|R
