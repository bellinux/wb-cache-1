40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} alcohol prohibition on the consumption of alcohol and other addictive goods. Using a series of household expenditure surveys for India, it finds that alcohol prohibition had differential effects on alcohol consumption by <b>alcohol</b> <b>type</b> and sector. In particular prohibition reduced consumption of arrack, IMFL, and beer in both urban and rural sectors, although {{its impact on the}} rural sector was lower. In addition, prohibition reduced toddy consumption in urban households. The relationship between alcohol and other addictive goods is also examined using prohibition as an instrument for alcohol consumption. The results suggest significant associations between alcohol and these items with the direction of the relationship differing by <b>alcohol</b> <b>type.</b> Consequently prohibition also had spill-over effects on the consumption of these items and is associated with an increase in bidi and cigarette consumption and a decrease in leaf tobacco and pan consumption.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Past {{studies of}} {{relationships}} between alcohol and hip fracture have generally focused on total alcohol consumed and not <b>type</b> of <b>alcohol.</b> Different <b>types</b> of <b>alcohol</b> consist of varying components which may affect risk of hip fracture differentially. This study seeks {{to examine the relationship}} between alcohol consumption, with a focus on <b>type</b> of <b>alcohol</b> consumed (e. g. beer, wine, or hard liquor) and hip fracture risk in post-menopausal women. 				 				 					 						Methods 					The longitudinal cohort consisted of U. S. post-menopausal women aged 50 &# 8211; 79 years enrolled between 1993 &# 8211; 1998 in the Women&# 8217;s Health Initiative Clinical Trials and Observational Study (N= 115, 655). 				 				 					 						Results 					Women were categorized as non-drinkers, past drinkers, infrequent drinkers and drinkers by preference of <b>alcohol</b> <b>type</b> (i. e. those who preferred wine, beer, hard liquor, or who had no strong preference). Mean alcohol consumption among current drinkers was 3. 3 servings per week; this was similar among those who preferred wine, beer and liquor. After adjustment for potential confounders, alcohol preference was strongly correlated with hip fracture risk (p = 0. 0167); in particular, women who preferred wine were at lower risk than non-drinkers (OR= 0. 78; 95 % CI 0. 64 - 0. 95), past drinkers (OR= 0. 85; 95 % CI 0. 72 - 1. 00), infrequent drinkers (OR= 0. 73; 95 % CI 0. 61 - 0. 88), hard liquor drinkers (OR= 0. 87; 95 % CI 0. 71 - 1. 06), beer drinkers (OR= 0. 72; 95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 95) and those with no strong preference (OR= 0. 89; 95 % CI 0. 89; 95 % CI 0. 73 - 1. 10). 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Preference of <b>alcohol</b> <b>type</b> was associated with hip fracture; women who preferentially consumed wine had a lower risk of hip fracture compared to non-drinkers, past drinkers, and those with other alcohol preferences...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the associations between <b>alcohol</b> availability <b>types</b> and community characteristics in randomly selected census tracts in Southern California and Southeastern Louisiana. Outlet shelf space and price by beverage type was collected from all off-sale alcohol outlets in 189 census tracts by trained research personnel. Three aspects of alcohol availability at the census tract level were consideredâoutlets per roadway mile, shelf space, and least price by beverage type. Using multivariate analyses, we examined the associations between census tract socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and <b>alcohol</b> availability <b>types.</b> Fifteen measures of alcohol availability were calculatedâtotal shelf space and shelf space by beverage types (beer, malt liquor, and distilled spirits); outlets per roadway mile, per tract, and per capita; and least price by beverage type (including wine). In multivariate analyses controlling for state, male unemployment rate was inversely associated with total shelf space (p[*]=[*] 0. 03) and distilled spirit shelf space (p[*]=[*] 0. 05). Malt liquor shelf space was inversely associated with percent White (p[*]=[*] 0. 02). Outlets per roadway mile was positively associated with household poverty (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), whereas percent African American was inversely associated with outlets per roadway mile (p[*]=[*] 0. 03).
