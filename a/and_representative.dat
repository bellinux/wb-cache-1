5|$|Efforts were {{underway}} in 1997 to secure {{federal funding for}} the highway and other infrastructure near the Mexican border, largely supported by Senator Barbara Boxer <b>and</b> <b>Representative</b> Bob Filner, <b>and</b> <b>Representative</b> Bud Schuster, {{the chairman of the}} House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, visited the region before giving informal approval to the proposal. In 1999, Governor Gray Davis approved allocating $27million in federal funding to complete the freeway. Concerns were expressed by local residents and municipal officials regarding the apparent priority of SR125 over SR905 in terms of funding, especially since SR125 was to be constructed as a toll road, and SR905 would compete with the toll road enterprise. In May 1998, Congress approved $54million in funding for the completion of SR905.|$|E

The performances of Crowe and Mann were well received. The film earned $19 million at the box office.|$|E

5|$|After modern Romania {{was formed}} in 1859 through the union of Wallachia and the rump of Moldavia, the {{administrative}} division was modernized using the French administrative system as a model, with județ as the basic administrative unit. Aside from the 1950–1968 period, this system has remained in place until today. Since 1864, for each județ there exists a prefect, a subordinate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs <b>and</b> <b>representative</b> of the government inside the county; {{he is also the}} head of local administration for areas not delegated to local authorities. Until 1948, each județ was further divided into several plăși, each administered by a pretor.|$|E

In late September the Railway Labor Executives' Association, along with Senator John Melcher (D-Montana) <b>and</b> <b>Representative</b> Pat Williams (D-Montana), sued the U.S. Department of Transportation to prevent the discontinuance of the service, then scheduled for October 1. A federal judge temporarily restrained Amtrak from ending the service, but the last North Coast Hiawathas ran on October 6, 1979, arriving in Chicago on the 7th and Seattle on the 8th.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most members}} of Congress during the Era of Good Feelings, Senator Edwards sat {{as a member of}} the Democratic-Republican Party.

Innovations and movements within the wider-culture of Europe have also changed the United Kingdom; Humanism, Protestantism, <b>and</b> <b>representative</b> democracy have developed from broader Western culture.|$|E

Boddingtons become an official partner of the 2002 XVII Commonwealth Games held in Manchester in a deal worth at least £1million. To mark the occasion, a special Boddingtons 5% ABV Commonwealth Ale cask ale was produced for the North West of England, and subsequently launched nationwide. The last Boddingtons television advertising campaign in 2005 was criticised for capitalising on the beer's Manchester heritage with a Happy Mondays soundtrack, even though production had {{moved out of the}} city.
