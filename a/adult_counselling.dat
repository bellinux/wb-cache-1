50|$|In {{the late}} fifties, Schauder {{expanded}} {{his work to}} wider social problems, volunteering to counsel prisoners at Edinburgh’s Saughton Prison, advising Samaritans staff on problem case, counselling parents on their children’s problems and progressing to doing <b>adult</b> <b>counselling.</b> In doing so he developed his own unique approach to counselling - an attempt to build up as complete a picture as possible of the client so as to fully identify with them and together work towards a solution. After years of experience, he met a Dominican monk, Marcus Lefébure who also worked as a counsellor at the University. The two men analysed the structure of Schauder’s therapeutic approach, gradually pinpointing the archetypal elements in the interview process. These are described in their book, Conversation and Counselling, published in 1982. The book won high praise in the United Kingdom, was later translated into German. “These dialogues present counselling {{as a form of}} contemporary spirituality, arguing that counselling facilitates spiritual experience and that psychoanalytic and psychotherapeutic concepts can be understood in spiritual terms. However, the dialogues also present a critique of the authorisation of subjectivity within both counselling and spirituality; in so doing, they anticipate and elaborate later criticisms of Paul Heelas and Linda Woodhead's spiritual revolution thesis.” After the appearance of the book, people would visit Schauder from as far as the United States to discuss aspects of counselling. The Hans Schauder Institute was founded in Germany in the late Eighties.|$|E
40|$|Adults Helping Adults (AHA), {{as a form}} of {{cooperative}} counselling for adults, has been preceded by Harvey Jackins ' Re-evaluation Counselling, John Southgate's Karen Homey Counselling, and John Heron's Reciprocal Counselling. All of these counselling approaches have one thing in common: the principle of help-giver/help-seeker role exchange. AHA is an approach to <b>adult</b> <b>counselling</b> which is organized around the mutual aid orientation. The concept of orientation is very important. If we have a helpless orientation, then we are on a deteriorating path in life. On the other hand, if we have a helpful orientation, then we are on a reward-finding path which helps us become more able rather than less. The mutual aid orientation has five elements: the existential (focus is on the concrete problems people actually have); transformation (coping and learning to benefit from change); reciprocity ("I'll help you and you help me. "); helper principle (how can the help-seeker get the benefits of the helping process usually experienced only by the help-giver?); democratic ideal (every person, includin...|$|E

In fulfilling this mandate and {{in line with the}} Tusla Corporate Plan which sets out to design and deliver supportive, coordinated and evidence-informed services that strive to ensure positive outcomes for children, families and communities’, we need to ensure that the Agency and its partners, have a shared and well-developed understanding of service user needs. This Working Report is the first output from Tusla presenting data from Tusla-funded specialist services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence in Ireland. The report sets this data in the context of some of the messages emerging from other sources of information. Although the data here does not tell the full story of the adults, children and families who have experienced the trauma of violence in the home and sexual violence, the figures indicate the large number of victims and survivors who sought and received support in 2015 from specialist domestic, sexual and gender based violence services across the country. Thirty seven organisations provided data on {{the number of people who}} availed of these services in 2015. • Information provision, as a distinct service, was provided to over 10, 000 people. • Face-to-face support services were provided to over 7, 000.

40|$|This {{narrative}} inquiry {{study examines}} the stories told by seven adult students about learning cognitive therapy {{and how they}} experienced being both the subject and the writer of their own case study. At the time of being interviewed, some were completing a Bachelor of Counselling or Alcohol and Drug Studies, while others had completed their counsellor training and had employment in their profession. The students completing the Alcohol and Drug Studies are also trainee counsellors with a particular specialisation. All students completed a ten day, introductory course in Cognitive Therapy. There has been limited research exploring the learning experiences of students on cognitive therapy training. There {{does not appear to}} be any research on either the use of self case study in Cognitive Therapy education or the student experience of self case study. The purpose of this study was twofold: firstly, to explore the students’ perspectives on what it was like to learn cognitive therapy and secondly, to explore the students’ experiences of completing a case study on themselves. In this study, narrative interviews were used to invite participants to tell their story. The interviews were audio taped and transcribed. The participants’ in depth stories when analysed, produced clear thematic content as well as unique accounts of personal learning journeys. Analysis involved rewriting each interview as a core narrative, structured to show each participant’s position when they began learning, the essence of the story line, their unique voice, the plot direction, the story’s climax, including the impact on their identity and finally, their core message. These narratives are represented by six short pieces of prose and a poem. The narrators and cognitive therapy are central characters in all stories. Thematic content was depicted as steps in a learning process. All core narratives were sent to each participant for checking that it captured their original story and its meaning. The findings were that <b>adult</b> <b>counselling</b> students found brief introductory training courses in Cognitive Therapy to be very effective for enabling them to learn the cognitive therapy model, to refine their cognitive therapy skills and to enhance their own personal development. Self case study has the potential to provide a complex, multi-dimensional learning opportunity facilitating deep learning. Self case study can result in transformative learning and the development of new stories of identity for the writer (and subject) of the case study. Individual student accounts suggest that Cognitive Therapy can be usefully adapted for some Maori and self case study can be a means of strengthening cultural identity. In addition, for some counselling student trainees, the process of doing a self case study may provide a means of working through childhood trauma. The findings provide some preliminary support for including use of self case study within the counselling curriculum. Self case study can provide opportunities for deepening learning about theory and practice, which is all the more potent when related to students’ own selves. Given support, students might be encouraged to complete self case study as a means of gaining significant personal development. Such curriculum changes would require additional expertise on the part of counselling educators. The narratives analysed in this study suggest that particular support may be needed to enable the safe self development of students from ethnic minority groups and also to provide well for those who had experienced childhood trauma. This is recommended as an area for further research. Given that Counselling education has the task of developing and preparing students for the Counselling profession, students’ perspectives on this experience, are an important and relatively underdeveloped area of research. There is a need for further research specifically on students’ learning experiences in Cognitive Therapy. Ongoing research is needed about the use of self case study as a learning opportunity for student learning and personal development...|$|E
40|$|Adolescent peer {{counselling}} {{as a social}} support strategy to assist adolescents to cope with stress in their peer group provides the focus for the present thesis. The prosocial behaviour of providing emotional and psychological support {{through the use of}} helping conversations by young people is examined. Current programs for training adolescent peer counsellors have failed to discover what skills adolescents bring to the helping conversation. They ignore, actively discourage, and censor, some typical adolescent conversational helping behaviours and idiosyncratic communication processes. Current programs for training adolescent peer counsellors rely on teaching microcounselling skills from <b>adult</b> <b>counselling</b> models. When using this approach, the adolescent peer helper training literature reports skill implementation, role attribution and status differences as being problematic for trained adolescent peer counsellors (Carr, 1984; de Rosenroll, 1988; Morey & Miller, 1993). For example Carr (1984) recognised that once core counselling skills have been reasonably mastered that young people " may feel awkward, mechanical or phoney" (p. 11) when trying to implement the new skills. Problematic issues with regard to role attribution and status differences appear to relate to the term 'peer counsellor' and its professional expectations, including training and duties (Anderson, 1976; Jacobs, Masson & Vass, 1976; Myrick, 1976). A particular concern of Peavy (1977) was that for too many people counselling was an acceptable label for advice giving and that the role of counsellor could imply professional status. De Rosenroll (1988) cautioned against creating miniature mirror images of counselling and therapeutic professionals in young people. However, he described a process whereby status difference is implied when a group of adolescent peer counsellors is trained and invited to participate in activities that require appropriate ethical guidelines including competencies, training, confidentiality and supervision. While Carr and Saunders (1981) suggest, "student resentment of the peer counsellor is not a problem" they go on to say, "this {{is not to say that}} the problem does not exist" (p. 21). The authors suggest that as a concern the problem can be minimised by making sure the peer counsellors are not 'forced' on the student body and by providing opportunities for peer counsellors to develop ways of managing resentment. De Rosenroll (1988) acknowledges that the adolescent peer counsellor relationship may fall within a paraprofessional framework in that a difference in status may be inferred from the differing life experiences of the peer counsellor when compared with their student peers. The current project aimed to discover whether the issues of skill implementation, role attribution and status differences could be addressed so that adolescent {{peer counselling}}, a valuable social support resource, could be made more attractive to, and useful for adolescents. The researcher's goal was to discover what young people typically do when they help each other conversationally, what they want to learn that would enhance their conversational helping behaviour, and how they experience and respond to their role as peer counsellor, and then to use the information obtained in the development of an adolescent-friendly peer counsellor training program. By doing this, the expectation was that the problematic issues cited in the literature could be addressed. Guided by an ethnographic framework the project also examined the influence of an adolescent-friendly peer counsellor training program on the non-peer counsellor students in the wider adolescent community of the high school. Three sequential studies were undertaken. In Study 1, the typical adolescent conversational and communications skills that young people use when helping each other were identified. In addition, those microcounselling skills that young people found useful and compatible with their typical communication processes were identified. In Study 2, an intervention research process was used to develop, deliver, and evaluate an adolescent-friendly peer counsellor training program which combined typical adolescent helping behaviours with preferred counselling microskills selected by participants in Study 1. The intervention research paradigm was selected as the most appropriate methodology for this study because it is designed to provide an integrated perspective for understanding, developing, and examining the feasibility and effectiveness of innovative human services interventions (Bailey-Dempsey & Reid, 1996; Rothman & Thomas, 1994). Intervention research is typically conducted in a field setting in which researchers and practitioners work together to design and assess interventions. When applying intervention research methodology researchers and practitioners begin by selecting the problem they want to remedy, reviewing the literature, identifying criteria for appropriate and effective intervention, integrating the information into plans for the intervention and then testing the intervention to reveal the intervention's strengths and flaws. Researchers then suggest modifications to make the intervention more effective, and satisfying for participants. In the final stage of intervention research, researchers disseminate information about the intervention and make available manuals and other training materials developed along the way (Comer, Meier, & Galinsky, 2004). In Study 2 an adolescent-friendly peer counsellor training manual was developed. Study 3 evaluated the impact of the peer counsellor training longitudinally on the wider school community. In particular, the project was interested in whether exposure to trained peer counsellors influenced students who were not peer counsellors with regard to their perceptions of self-concept, the degree of use of specific coping strategies and on their perceptions of the school climate. Study three included the development of A School Climate Survey which focused on the psychosocial aspects of school climate from the student's perspective. Two factors which were significantly correlated (p<. 01) were identified. Factor 1 measured students' perceptions of student relationships, and Factor 2 measured students' perceptions of teachers' relationships with students. The present project provides confirmation of a number of findings that other studies have identified regarding the idiosyncratic nature of adolescent communication, and the conversational and relational behaviours of young people (Chan, 2001; Noller, Feeney, & Peterson, 2001; Papini & Farmer, 1990; Rafaelli & Duckett, 1989; Readdick & Mullis, 1997; Rotenberg, 1995; Turkstra, 2001; Worcel et al., 1999; Young et al., 1999). It extends this research by identifying the specific conversational characteristics that young people use in helping conversations. The project confirmed the researcher's expectation that some counselling microskills currently used in training adolescent peer counsellors are not easy to use by adolescents and are considered by adolescents to be unhelpful. It also confirmed that some typical adolescent conversational helping behaviours which have been proscribed for use in other adolescent peer counsellor training programs are useful in adolescent peer counselling. The project conclusively demonstrated that the adolescent-friendly peer counsellor training program developed in the project overcame the difficulties of skill implementation identified in the adolescent peer counselling literature (Carr, 1984). The project identified for the first time the process used by adolescent peer counsellors to deal with issues related to role attribution and status difference. The current project contributes new information to the peer counselling literature through the discovery of important differences between early adolescent and late adolescent peer counsellors with regard to acquiring and mastering counselling skills, and their response to role attribution and status difference issues among their peers following counsellor training. As a result of the substantive findings the current project makes a significant contribution to social support theory and prosocial theory and to the adolescent peer counselling literature. It extends the range of prosocial behaviours addressed in published research by specifically examining the conversational helping behaviour of adolescents from a relational perspective. The current project provides new information that contributes to knowledge of social support in the form of conversational behaviour among adolescents identifying the interactive, collaborative, reciprocal and idiosyncratic nature of helping conversations in adolescents. Tindall (1989) suggests that peer counsellor trainers explore a variety of ways to approach a single training model that can augment and supplement the training process to meet specific group needs. The current project responded to this suggestion by investigating which counselling skills and behaviours adolescent peer counsellor trainees preferred, were easy to use by them, and were familiar to them, and then by using an intervention research process, devised a training program which incorporated these skills and behaviours into a typical adolescent helping conversation. A mixed method longitudinal design was used in an ecologically valid setting. The longitudinal nature of the design enabled statements about the process of the peer counsellors' experience to be made. The project combined qualitative and quantitative methods of data gathering. Qualitative data reflects the phenomenological experience of the adolescent peer counsellor and the researcher and quantitative data provides an additional platform from which to view the findings. The intervention research paradigm provided a developmental research method that is appropriate for practice research. The intervention research model is more flexible than conventional experimental designs, capitalises on the availability of small samples, accommodates the dynamism and variation in practice conditions and diverse populations, and explicitly values the insights of the researcher as a practitioner. The project combines intervention research with involvement of the researcher in the project thus enabling the researcher to view and report the findings through her own professional and practice lens...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} the ‘Cultural Ego’ was first put forth by Sow (1977) and further {{developed}} by Terranova-Cecchini (1991) based on clinical work done in Italy and non-Western countries. It has its foundation in anthropology, neuroscience, psychiatry and psychology (Devereux, 1956), (Linton, 1956), (Sow, 1977), (Berry, 1992), (Kandel, 2006), (Kaes, 2007). Purpose of StudyThe {{purpose of this study}} is to show how the Cultural Ego can be adapted for use in secondary and <b>adult</b> education <b>counselling</b> situations. Sources of EvidenceThe Cultural Ego as an instrument of transcultural psychiatric therapy that has been used for more than 30 years in Italy by Fondazione Cecchini Pace, Milan (www. fondazionececchinipace. it). Main ArgumentThe Cultural Ego (universal) is composed of three axes: family, community and ancestral. Cultural Ego therapy helps the patient reconstruct the axes (Terranova-Cecchini, 1991). Counsellors, international program directors, social workers will find a working knowledge of the Cultural Ego useful in assisting their target populations. ConclusionDue its success in the transcultural therapy field, the authors have decided to share it with school counselling professionals. It is especially useful for youths who are torn between their family and school cultures. It may be useful in anti- bullying programs because often inner cultural conflicts create bullies.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if <b>adult</b> clients <b>counseled</b> by child-centered play therapists would demonstrate greater positive therapeutic outcomes than adult clients who were counseled by non-educated child-centered play therapists. This study also attempted to determine if the play therapists' clients would show greater, significant improvement in any particular areas of client distress (i. e., depression/anxiety, relationship issues), more so than the clients of the non-play therapists. Archival data from an assessment, The Adult Self-Report Inventory (ASR), was gathered to measure reported pre and post-test client symptomology. This study utilized a 2 X 2 repeated measure ANOVA design to analyze the impact of counselors who were educated in child-centered play therapy who saw adult clients, versus their non-play therapy counterparts who saw adult clients. Before treatment pre-test and after treatment post-test administration was collected for use in the analysis. The population consisted of 60 adult clients seeking counseling services at a major university in the southwest. All clients were seen by Master's practicum students for ten sessions. The clients were divided into two groups - 30 were seen by play therapists, 30 were seen by non-play therapists. Five scales on the ASR were measured using a 2 x 2 split-plot design and Eta squared. There were three independent variables: group, measurement occasion, and the interaction between group and measurement. The results of this study did not reveal any statistical significance. However, clinical significance was demonstrated as the play therapists' clients did report greater reductions in symptomology on all five scales, some more than others...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} was to compare the use of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) {{interventions}} and the conventional forms of guidance interventions in <b>adult</b> guidance <b>counselling</b> practice. To facilitate a response to the main research questions, it was essential to gain an understanding of the unique experiences and the effectiveness of such interventions for clients. A specific focus of the research was to examine the lasting effect of the outcomes and the benefits from engaging in a helping intervention. A tactical approach to helping which is reflective of new organisational work structures is fundamental to effective guidance (Bimrose, 2010). The research also considered the factors related to why people engage in adult education and the consequential benefits for the adult learner. An interpretivist paradigm was employed using a case study approach which concentrated on the subjective experiences of four clients of one Adult Educational Guidance Initiative (AEGI) service. Research data was collected through semi-structured interviews with each participant who had a guidance intervention between seven to eight months previously. The findings of the study demonstrate that adult learners benefit from helping interventions such as NLP and conventional guidance interventions. The research findings relate to both the process and outcomes of the intervention type. The experience was positive and unique for all participants. The NLP participants appeared to engage at a deeper level during their intervention, hence the outcomes resonated at a very personal level for these two participants. It is envisaged that this research can contribute to exploring new ways of eclectically working with the adult client. It is also hoped to provide a better understanding of the soft and tangible outcomes that are realised through participation in adult education. Consequently, the adult guidance service has a significant role to play in developing the clients coping strategies and career management skills to promote autonomous adult learners.

Of those who do suffer from mental health issues, a minority of these seek appropriate professional assistance. This paucity of help seeking behaviours among young people is a challenge for counsellors. Whereas adults who suffer mental health issues have increasingly turned to the internet for assistance, {{it is interesting that}} when young people whose social lives are increasingly dependent on the communication technologies, are not catered for as much as <b>adults</b> by online <b>counselling.</b> One small online counselling pilot program conducted at a Queensland secondary school for three years from 2005 - 2007 (Glasheen & Campbell, 2009) offered anonymous live-time counselling from the school counsellor (via a secure chat room) to students through the school’s website. Findings indicated that boys were more likely to use the service than girls. All participants transitioned to face-to-face counselling, and all reported it was beneficial. This pilot study attested to the potential of an online counselling. However, school counsellors as a professional group have been hesitant to utilise online counselling as part of their service delivery to young people in schools.

40|$|Abstract Background Overweight older <b>adults</b> {{are often}} <b>counseled</b> to lose weight, {{even though there}} is little {{evidence}} of excess mortality in that age group. Overweight and underweight may be more associated with health status than with mortality, but few clinical trials of any kind have been based on maximizing years of healthy life (YHL), as opposed to years of life (YOL). Objective This paper examines the relationship of body mass index (BMI) to both YHL and YOL. Results were used to determine whether clinical trials of weight-modification based on improving YHL would be more powerful than studies based on survival. Design We used data from a cohort of 4, 878 non-smoking men and women aged 65 – 100 at baseline (mean age 73) and followed 7 years. We estimated mean YHL and YOL in four categories of BMI: underweight, normal, overweight, and obese. Results Subjects averaged 6. 3 YOL and 4. 6 YHL of a possible 7 years. Both measures were higher for women and whites. For men, none of the BMI groups was significantly different from the normal group on either YOL or YHL. For women, the obese had significantly lower YHL (but not YOL) than the normals, and the underweight had significantly lower YOL and YHL. The overweight group was not significantly different from the normal group on either measure. Conclusions Clinical trials of weight loss interventions for obese older women would require fewer participants if YHL rather than YOL was the outcome measure. Interventions for obese men or for the merely overweight are not likely to achieve differences in either YOL or YHL. Evaluations of interventions for the underweight (which would presumably address the causes of their low weight) may be conducted efficiently using either outcome measure. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the nature and potential of an integrated strategy for non-formal education and development that will alleviate the problem of milieu-deprivation in Third World communities. This integrated strategy includes compensatory education, community development, and development communication strategies. Learning need structures were investigated {{and the most important}} categories of learning needs that exist in socially disadvantaged communities were identified. Community education is a relatively new concept, through which innovation, adaptation and extension of educational opportunities can be achieved, and thus suggests the most suitable infrastructure for the integration of educational and developmental strategies, namely compensatory education, community development and development communication. Community education can be defined as the educational process in which the provisions (services, programmes, resources) of all the educational agencies in a community are utilised in a co-operative and co-ordinated manner, to provide for all of the learning needs of all the people of a community, to develop the community and solve the problems of the community. The milieu-deprived Third World communities of the world are thus depend en t on community education. I n the present practice of community education, the community school serves as community learning centre, and becomes {{the focal point of the}} community whereby the school functions as a centre and delivery system for lifelong learning and community development. The operation of educational programmes is realized through a ten phase process. The appointment of a Director of Education, creating an educational milieu and the establishment of an organizational structure for participative planning, establish the necessary infrastructure for community education. The planning and bringing into operation of educational programmes takes place in the next six phases, namely: identification and analysis of problems and needs, formulation of programme objectives, identification and mobilization of community resources, operation of educational programmes, evaluation, and continuous research. The community education process can be implemented for the integration of all the programmes, practices, projects, and learning experiences of compensatory education, community development and development communicaton. The following categories of compensatory education can be realized in a community education set-up: pre-school educational programmes and parent education work-study programmes for youths higher education and <b>adult</b> education <b>counselling</b> reading and language education extracurricular innovations In dealing with community education, one is dealing with a community development strategy: a comprehensive community development strategy is actualised through some variation of the co-ordinating, co-operating process of community education. The following development communication strategies can be implemented and realised in a community education set-up: the open broadcasting strategy, the organised group strategy, multimedia strategy. Through the integration of the above-mentioned strategies within a community education set-up, with its network of educational agencies and social services, the problems of mi 1 ieu-deprived communities can be alleviated to a meaningful extent.

To describe the population {{of children and adolescents}} with tinnitus and/or hyperacusis found in Educational- Psychological Advisory services (EPAs) and Centres for special Education for Adults (CEAs) and to identify the referral patterns and interventions used for the children in each of these settings. MethodsA prospective study within 15 ENT clinics was conducted from June 2014 to February 2015. All children with a primary complaint of tinnitus and/or hyperacusis was reported. No changes in daily practice regarding diagnostics, treatment or referral were made. A retrospective case review was undertaken during a five-year period from 01 / 01 / 2009 to 31 / 12 / 2013 in each Danish municipality and region. ResultsIn the prospective ENT study, 12 children were identified and in the retrospective CEA/EPA study 69 children were identified. The 12 children seen by ENT (8 females and 4 male) had an age range from 5. 7 to 14 years. The majority of the 69 children seen by CEA/EPA (n =  50, 72. 5 %) had been diagnosed with tinnitus as a primary complaint. Hyperacusis was the primary complaint in 9 cases (12. 8 %), and both tinnitus and hyperacusis were reported in 11 cases (15. 7 %). The findings {{of this study indicate that}} a majority of children with tinnitus and/or hyperacusis are seen in settings designed for <b>adult</b> audiological rehabilitation. <b>Counselling,</b> including explanations and discussion of coping strategies was the most commonly reported intervention. Intervention methods corresponding with guidelines for tinnitus management in adults were used in 11 cases (15. 9 %). ConclusionOverall only a small number of children with tinnitus and/or hyperacusis were identified in this systems, suggesting that either the children are seen at general practitioner level or not being referred at all. It may also be the case that the incidence of troublesome tinnitus in childhood is lower than the epidemiological data proposes. Referral pathways indicate a general uncertainty about which services provide acquire sufficient intervention. This study indicates that clinicians working at tinnitus services for adults (CEAs) collectively have the skills to help older children, and that a service development focus should be on the younger children as this point...|$|R

Her primary degree is in Microbiology from the University of Benin in Nigeria. Her professional career started in the State of Lagos {{and she was the}} Administrative Secretary for the Nigerian Britain Association before she moved to Ireland back in 2002. Since her arrival in Ireland, Ebun Joseph Akpoveta has been engaged in various activities and has been a prolific and pro-active member of the Nigerian community in her new home country. While in Ireland she has also furthered her academic instruction and has been a student of various postgraduate programmes. She obtained a Master’s degree in Education, <b>Adult</b> Guidance and <b>Counselling</b> from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. She was recently awarded a Ph. D. by the UCD School of Social Justice in Equality Studies, one of her many passions apart from literature and writing. Ebun Joseph Akpoveta is also an equality activist, a career coach and a motivational speaker. She is an IACP-accredited counsellor and has great experience working with immigrants in Ireland. With this main cause in mind she founded The Unforgettable Women’s Network – TUWN which advocates for equality between men and women. She is {{a founding member of the}} African Women Writers Ireland, a Member of RTÉ Audience Council, and a columnist for the African Voice Newspaper. Ebun Joseph Akpoveta’s first book, Becoming Unforgettable. Uncovering the Essence of the Woman (2012), had the format of a counselling, self-help volume for women who need to articulate their experiences and cope with different plights. Her debut into fiction was with the harrowing novel Trapped: Prison without Walls (2013); here she embarks on the narration of difficult ordeals by immigrant African women in their new “host” country, Ireland. With this novel, Ebun Joseph Akpoveta interrogates the manner by which literary discourses in post Celtic Tiger Ireland challenge, elide or accommodate issues of globalization, immigration, and the notion of multiculturalism. With her fiction, Ebun Joseph Akpoveta questions much-used celebratory accounts of Irish multiculturalism, at least in media and political discourses, as integrationist and inclusive of the “Other”, and in particular, the female Other. Ebun Joseph Akpoveta lives in Dublin with her beloved family.

40|$|Recent {{increases}} in the volume and diversity of international labour migration, {{and in particular the}} feminisation of these movements, suggest that the number of families fractured by migration is also growing tremendously. Gender-differentiated transnational migration is no doubt an increasingly significant driver of contemporary social transformation of the ‘family/household’ in sending communities, as clearly seen in its impact on changing familial arrangements and relationships of care. Research has shown that labour migration is often a family livelihood project rather than an individual strategy and socio-economic outcomes of labour migration, therefore, affect not only the migrant but also the left-behind family as a whole. In this paper we set out to: (1) review the academic literature on the effects of international migration on left-behind families; (2) point out major implications and challenges for migration and development policy, and the practices concerning left-behind families of migrants; (3) provide recommendations to different social actors including the state, civil society and corporate entities; and (4) highlight questions for discussion during the forum. The review of selected academic literature on left-behind families is centred on the effects of international migration on: (a) the household structure and relationships within the transnational household; (b) remittances and the family’s well-being; (c) gender roles, identities and relations; (d) intergenerational relations; and (e) left-behind children’s health and well-being (including educational outcomes). Although findings from academic research are generally mixed, one salient observation that emerges from the literature review is that while international labour migration generates substantial economic resources that contribute to left-behind families’ improved access to healthcare and education, the social costs it brings about are equally significant. The literature shows that children and the elderly are most vulnerable to the adverse effects of international migration and hence, require special attention in development policies and practices. The major challenges for migration and development policy, and practice that arise from academic research findings include: (a) supporting the elderly grandparents who themselves need care and support but are often called to substitute for migrant parents in childcare and domestic work; (b) helping migrants and their families sustain their relationships across transnational spaces in order to minimise the negative impacts of migration on family relations; and (c) minimizing migrant families’ economic stress and debts caused by exorbitant broker fees. It is important for the government of labour-sending countries to acknowledge not only the benefits but also the costs of international labour migration so as to create an effective legal and institutional framework as well as suitable supporting mechanisms for left-behind families. In minimising the negative impacts on both migrants and left-behind kin, especially children, migration can then be a sustainable development strategy. In considering policy interventions relating to left-behind families, we emphasize that the impact of migration is highly variable and complex. Left-behind families can be, and are, affected not only by the migration process itself but also by circumstances and policies relating to broader processes including development and urbanization at different levels. Issues discussed in the paper cannot be handled singlehandedly by the state but require the involvement of different actors including civil society, businesses and local communities in labour-sending areas in supporting left-behind families. Therefore, different sets of recommendations are offered to the various groups involved. Recommendations to the state 2 include: (a) Sending nations should be united in applying pressure on receiving nations to sign and ratify the United Nations’ 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (ICMW); (b) More effective regulation and control of the ‘migration industry’; and (c) Establishment of support schemes directed at left-behind families including provision of medical benefits and counselling services for children and the elderly, and offering academic support to children. Recommendations to the civil society (and even businesses) include: (a) Offering left-behind families free or cheaper access to internet so that they can communicate with migrants easily and regularly; (b) Providing training on remittances management and consultation on investment strategies; (c) Giving both left-behind children and <b>adults</b> psychological <b>counselling</b> and any other necessary intervention; and (d) Engaging both migrants and families in pre-departure briefing to prepare them to cope with any problems relating to long-term separation. Recommendations to banks include: (a) Providing prospective migrants with low-interest loans, not requiring collaterals for small loans, simplifying procedures, and relaxing eligibility criteria to prevent families from taking highinterest loans from exploitative moneylenders; and (b) Reducing remittance charges and offering migrant families specialized investment products and services such as insurance, pension and real estate advice.

40|$|Background Sexual {{problems}} are common {{among people with}} cardiovascular disease. Although clinical guidelines recommend sexual counselling for patients and their partners, {{there is little evidence}} on its effectiveness. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of sexual counselling interventions (in comparison to usual care) on sexuality-related outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease and their partners. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and three other databases up to 2 March 2015 and two trials registers up to 3 February 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, including individual and cluster RCTs. We included studies that compared any intervention to <b>counsel</b> <b>adult</b> cardiac patients about sexual problems with usual care. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included three trials with 381 participants. We were unable to pool the data from the included studies due to the differences in interventions used; therefore we synthesised the trial findings narratively. Two trials were conducted in the USA and one was undertaken in Israel. All trials included participants who were admitted to hospital with myocardial infarction (MI), and one trial also included participants who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. All trials followed up participants for a minimum of three months post-intervention; the longest follow-up timepoint was five months. One trial (N = 92) tested an intensive (total five hours) psychotherapeutic sexual counselling intervention delivered by a sexual therapist. One trial (N = 115) used a 15 -minute educational video plus written material on resuming sexual activity following a MI. One trial (N = 174) tested the addition of a component that focused on resumption of sexual activity following a MI within a hospital cardiac rehabilitation programme. The quality of the evidence for all outcomes was very low. None of the included studies reported any outcomes from partners. Two trials reported sexual function. One trial compared intervention and control groups on 12 separate sexual function subscales and used a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. They reported statistically significant differences in favour of the intervention. One trial compared intervention and control groups using a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and concluded: "There {{were no significant differences between}} the two groups [for sexual function] at any of the time points". Two trials reported sexual satisfaction. In one trial, the authors compared sexual satisfaction between intervention and control and used a repeated measured ANOVA; they reported "differences were reported in favour of the intervention". One trial compared intervention and control with a repeated measures ANCOVA and reported: "There were no significant differences between the two groups [for sexual satisfaction] at any of the timepoints". All three included trials reported the number of patients returning to sexual activity following MI. One trial found some evidence of an effect of sexual counselling on reported rate of return to sexual activity (yes/no) at four months after completion of the intervention (relative risk (RR) 1. 71, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 26 to 2. 32; one trial, 92 participants, very low quality of evidence). Two trials found no evidence of an effect of sexual counselling on rate of return to sexual activity at 12 week (RR 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 94 to 1. 09; one trial, 127 participants, very low quality of evidence) and three month follow-up (RR 0. 98, 95 % CI 0. 88 to 1. 10; one trial, 115 participants, very low quality of evidence). Two trials reported psychological well-being. In one trial, no scores were reported, but the trial authors stated: "No treatment effects were observed on state anxiety as measured in three points in time". In the other trial no scores were reported but, based on results of a repeated measures ANCOVA to compare intervention and control groups, the trial authors stated: "The experimental group had significantly greater anxiety at one month postMI". They also reported: "There were no significant differences between the two groups [for anxiety] at any other time points". One trial reporting relationship satisfaction and one trial reporting quality of life found no differences between intervention and control. No trial reported on satisfaction in how sexual issues were addressed in cardiac rehabilitation services. Authors conclusions We found no high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of sexual counselling for sexual problems in patients with cardiovascular disease. There is a clear need for robust, methodologically rigorous, adequately powered RCTs to test the effectiveness of sexual counselling interventions for people with cardiovascular disease and their partners.
