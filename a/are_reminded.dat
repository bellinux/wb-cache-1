They <b>are</b> <b>reminded</b> that the service they provide is a secular alternative to religious services which are reserved for church marriages. It would be therefore be out of character for any religious significance to be given to the ceremony. For the same reasons, the conduct of a civil marriage in a church is not encouraged and, understandably, could be the subject of criticism by church authorities and the public generally.|$|E

25|$|Through most of Canada, {{a driver}} may turn right {{at a red}} light after coming to a {{complete}} stop unless a sign indicates otherwise. In the province of Quebec, turning right on a red was illegal until a pilot study carried out in 2003 showed that the right turn on red manoeuvre did not result in significantly more accidents. Subsequent to the study, the Province of Quebec now allows right turns on red except where prohibited by a sign. However, like in New York City, it remains illegal to turn right on a red anywhere on the Island of Montreal. Motorists <b>are</b> <b>reminded</b> of this by large signs posted at the entrance to all bridges.|$|E

500|$|Fantala was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to threaten the Farquhar Group since Cyclone Bondo in 2006. Most of the 34residents on Farquhar Atoll evacuated ahead of the storm, and those that remained behind were uninjured. While moving through the Seychelles near peak intensity, Fantala had estimated 10-minute sustained winds of 250km/h (155mph), and days later it moved through the region again with 10-minute sustained winds estimated at 130km/h (80mph). Based on satellite imagery, {{it was estimated that}} of the 50structures on Farquhar Atoll, 19 were destroyed and 27 sustained severe damage. Only four buildings, which were constructed to be cyclone-proof after Bondo, withstood the estimated 350km/h (220mph) gusts, even then suffering moderate damage. In addition, many of the island's trees were knocked down. Due to the storm's prolonged passage through the island group, the Seychelles government declared the Farquhar islands as a disaster area on 20 April. In a visit to the Seychelles, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that the country has become [...] "highly vulnerable to storm surges, as we <b>are</b> <b>reminded</b> by the recent devastating effects of Cyclone Fantala." [...] A World Bank survey team found $4.5 million in damage. The lodge on the island was not expected to be rebuilt until March 2017, about 11 months after the storm. In April 2017, the development of two new islands in the lagoon of Farquhar's lagoon was attributed to the cyclone.|$|E

500|$|In , {{the authors}} cite [...] "escaping from a cult commune in 'The Joy of Sect'" [...] as {{evidence}} of [...] "Aristotle's virtuous personality traits in Marge." [...] As the title suggests, the book [...] examines [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] from a psychological point of view. It discusses the psychology of decision-making in the episode, noting, [...] "Homer is becoming a full-blown member of the Movementarians not by a rational choice,... but {{through the process of}} escalating behavioral commitments." [...] The Psychology of the Simpsons explains the key recruitment techniques used by the Movementarians, including the charismatic leader, established authority based on a religious entity or alien being (in this case [...] "Blisstonia"), and the method of taking away free choice through acceptance of the Leader's greatness. The book also analyzes the techniques used during the six-hour Movementarian recruitment film. In that scene, those who rise to leave <b>are</b> <b>reminded</b> that they are allowed to leave whenever they wish. They are, however, questioned in front of the group as to specifically why they wish to leave, and these individuals end up staying to finish watching the film. The book describes this technique as [...] "subtle pressure", in contrast to the [...] "razor wire, landmines, angry dogs, crocodiles and evil mystery bubble Marge confronts to escape, while being reminded again that she is certainly free to leave". The Psychology of the Simpsons writes that [...] "the Leader" [...] is seen as an authority figure, because [...] "he has knowledge or abilities that others do not, but want". Instead of traditional mathematics textbooks, the children on the compound learn from Arithmetic the Leader's Way and Science for Leader Lovers.|$|E
