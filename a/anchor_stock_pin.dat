The literature on <b>stock</b> <b>pinning</b> makes the following conclusions. First, option trading impacts stock prices. Second, <b>stock</b> <b>pinning</b> is a real phenomenon, we see share prices cluster around particular strikes on option expiry days. Third, we see this phenomenon across a number of stocks. Fourth, non-optionable stocks {{are less likely to}} have their prices cluster around a predetermined price on any day. Finally, <b>stock</b> <b>pinning</b> is a product of delta-hedging by hedge traders...|$|R

25|$|For centuries {{large numbers}} of lead bars have been found on the Mediterranean seabed, and there was debate over whether they were <b>anchor</b> <b>stocks</b> or not. It was argued by some that iron tipped wooden anchors secured by ropes were not heavy enough to be {{effective}} {{so they had to}} have metal stocks and there was considerable academic controversy over the issue. The Nemi ships, constructed during the transition period when iron anchors were replacing wooden ones, were the first Roman wrecks found to have intact anchors, and confirmed that the lead bars were indeed <b>anchor</b> <b>stocks.</b> Two types of anchor were found, one of oak with iron-tipped flukes and a stock of lead while the other was of iron with a folding timber stock that closely matched the design of the Admiralty pattern anchor re-invented in 1841. In the 1960s, a similar anchor was found in Pompeii and in 1974 another was found buried near Aberdarewllyn in Gwynedd, Wales. These further discoveries confirmed that these technologically advanced anchors were a standard Roman design.|$|R

We are {{grateful}} to Anchada Charoenrook and Jennifer Conrad for providing us with Amihud factor. We thank Morgan Stanley for research support. The authors are solely responsible for the contents of this paper. Factoring Information into Returns We examine the potential profits of trading on a measure of private information (<b>pin)</b> in a <b>stock.</b> A zero-investment portfolio which is size neutral, but long in high <b>pin</b> <b>stocks</b> and short in low <b>pin</b> <b>stocks</b> earns a significant abnormal return. The Fama-French, momentum and liquidity factors do not explain this return. However, significant covariation in returns exists among high <b>pin</b> <b>stocks</b> and among low <b>pin</b> <b>stocks,</b> suggesting that <b>pin</b> might proxy for an underlying factor. We create a pin factor as the monthly return on the zero-investment portfolio above and show that it is successful in explaining returns to independent pin-size portfolios. We also show that it is robust to inclusion of the Pastor-Stambaugh liquidity factor and the Amihud illiquidity factor. We argue that information remains an important determinant of asset returns even {{in the presence of}} these additional factors. Factoring Information into Returns I...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} model to {{describe}} <b>stock</b> <b>pinning</b> on option expiration dates. We argue that if the open interest on a particular contract is unusually large, delta-hedging in aggregate by floor market-makers can impact the stock price and drive it to the strike price of the option. We derive a stochastic differential equation for the stock price which has a singular drift that accounts for the price-impact of delta-hedging. According to this model, the stock price has a finite probability of pinning at a strike. We calculate analytically and numerically this probability {{in terms of the}} volatility of the stock, the time-to-maturity, the open interest for the option under consideration and a `price elasticity' constant that models price impact...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of hedging {{strategies}} on the so-called pinning effect, i. e. the tendency of stock's prices to close near the strike price of heavily traded options as the expiration date nears. In the paper we extend the analysis of Avellaneda and Lipkin, who propose an explanation of <b>stock</b> <b>pinning</b> in terms of delta hedging strategies for long option positions. We adopt a model introduced by Frey and Stremme and show that, under the original assumptions of the model, pinning is driven by two effects: a hedging-dependent drift term that pushes the stock price toward the strike price and a hedging-dependent volatility term that constrains the stock price near the strike as it approaches it. Finally, we show that pinning can be generated by simulating trading in a double auction market. Pinning in the microstructure model {{is consistent with the}} Frey and Stremme model when both discrete hedging and stochastic impact are taken into account.

Clym at first laughs at such superstitions, but later embraces the majority opinion when he rejects his wife as a murderer and adulteress. In this view, Eustacia dies because she has internalised the community's values to the extent that, unable to escape Egdon without confirming her status as a fallen woman, she chooses suicide. She thereby ends her sorrows while at the same time—by drowning in the weir like any woman instead of floating, witchlike—she proves her essential innocence to the community.|$|R
50|$|The first archaeological {{materials}} studied {{from the}} area were recovered from the seabed. This happened in 1974, when the first scuba diving clubs were set on the island. A series of amphorae dating from the 1st to the 4th centuries AD started to be found and recovered from the seabed, thus proving the presence of Roman ruins in this place. Five years later, the first underwater survey was carried out. Some of the amphora rims which were found presented stamps. Two of them read LEPMI BSCD and TEP/LOP. Also, some Late Empire amphorae (Dressel 26) were found. During the following years some archaeologists and historians from the island published articles on amphorae and different types of ceramics recovered from different underwater sites in Menorca. Some of the amphorae types which were identified were PE 17, 25 y 26. Also J.C. de Nicolás wrote about the Roman anchors found in Menorca, where he mentioned an <b>anchor</b> <b>stock</b> from Sanitja which weighed 26 kilograms.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role played}} by the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic in the speculative bubbles dynamics. In order to link anchoring bias and price deviations from fundamental value, we develop a stock market equilibrium model with heterogeneous investors: fundamental investor <b>anchoring</b> to past <b>stock</b> market prices and noise traders. The equilibrium model we derive suggests that price is a function of fundamental value, past price, noise and anchoring level. Based on our model, we run a set of Monte Carlo experiments with various anchoring levels: no anchoring, low anchoring and high anchoring. We bring the evidence that large speculative bubbles can only occur when fundamental traders highly <b>anchor</b> to <b>stock</b> market prices. Noise cannot in itself cause such phenomenon. Our findings also suggest that a high anchoring level is consistent with slowly mean reverting bubbles lasting many years...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} FIRB 2001 Project, {{we started}} a {{computer}} research project on Roman merchants {{who worked in the}} Mediterranean area from the 3 rd century B.

At the same time he issued an order to Mark to get up tackles, and to clear away the launch, preparatory to getting that boat into the water. Hillson had bent the cable wrong, and much of the work had to be done over again. As soon as men get excited, as is apt to be the case when they find serious blunders made at {{critical}} moments, they are not always discreet. The precise manner in which Captain Crutchely met with the melancholy fate that befel him, was never known. It is certain that he jumped down on the anchor-stock, the anchor being a cock-bill, and that he ordered Mr. Hillson off of it. While thus employed, and at an instant when the cable was pronounced bent, and the men were in the act of getting inboard, the ship made a heavy roll, breakers again appeared all around her, the white foam rising nearly to the level of her rails.

40|$|Indian subcontinent plays host to {{a number}} of migratory birds in summers as well as winters. It is {{estimated}} that over hundred species of migratory birds fly to India, either in search of feeding grounds or to escape the severe winter of their native habitat. Sandi bird sanctuary was created in 1990 in order to protect and conserve the natural habitation and surroundings and also the marine vegetation for the migratory birds, {{as well as for the}} local people of the region. The term migration is used to describe movements of populations of birds or other animals. There are three types of migrants. One way to look at migration is to consider the distances traveled. The pattern of migration can vary within each category, but is most variable in short and medium distance migrants. The origin of migration is related to the distance traveled. The birds migrating through the area, take shelter on the river front before going to the Sandi Bird sanctuary. The birds generally migrate in the winter months of October-November-December. Bird sanctuary is a popular tourist location. Sandi particularly attracts ornithologists and bird watchers, as many rare migratory birds take refuge in the sanctuary. The bird watching camps arranged to observe the migratory birds at Sandi Bird Sanctuary in the month of October and November 2012. The migratory birds at Sandi Bird Sanctuary include great crested grebe, white storks, black lbis, glossy lbis, spoonbill, ruddy shelduck, pin tail, sholveller, spot bill duck, mallard, gadwall, wigeon, tufted pochard, gargancey teal, common teal, cotton teal, grey lag goose, coot, black tailed godwit, painted <b>stock</b> <b>pin</b> tail snipe, marsh sand piper, common tern, river tern, magpie robin, white wagtail, pied wagtail, common snipe, starlings, white lbis, red crested pochard, common pochard, painted stock, black lbis, curlew, Indian skimmer etc. The resident birds at Sandi Bird Sanctuary include little grebe, darter, purple heron, grey heron, pond heron, night heron, large, medium and little egrets, painted stork, open billed stork, cattle egret, black necked stork(endangered), combduck, lesser whistling teal, common pariah kite, brahminy kite, shikra, sparrow, hawk, tawny eagle, greater spotted eagle, crested hawk eagle, lagger falcon rain quail, jungle bush quail, painted bush quail, black partridge, grey partridge, common peafowl, water hens, purple moor hens, jacanas, black winged stilt, lap wing, blue rock pigeon, dove spp., parakeets, crow pheasants, owl, swifts, kingfishers, blue jay, hoopoe, mynas, crow, drongo, bulbul, babblers, cormorants, sarus cranes, etc. There are 38195 local birds and 11378 migratory birds (total 49572) observed during period of study.

Depending on the operating area, a number of different kinds of anchor could be carried to cope with different anchorages. Another means of direction control on the water was by application of the rudder and aileron flight controls. The ailerons would cause asymmetric lift from the airflow and, ultimately, drop a float into the water to cause drag on that wing. The pilots could vary engine power to control the direction and speed of the aircraft on the water. In adverse combinations of tide, wind, and destination, this could be very difficult.|$|R

As a result of the investigation conducted by the Study Group for Maritime and Limnic Archaeology (AMLA) based at the Institute of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Archaeology, University of Kiel, the wreck can presumably be identified as the historically known yacht „Catharina Maria“, the owner of which was the Danish merchant and smuggler Christian Pedersen Norsk from Langeland. He was well-known for trading gunpowder to Lübeck and smuggling coffee in the western Baltic Sea region. According to the accident report, the 15 metre vessel sank in June 1893 during good weather without any information about the possible causes. At the time of sinking, the ship carried Faxechalk from the Danish Island Zealand. Although yachts were typical coastal vessels in the 18 th and 19 th centuries, {{little is known about the}} structural development, the rigging and the spread of this type of vessel and its importance for shipping in the western Baltic Sea region.
