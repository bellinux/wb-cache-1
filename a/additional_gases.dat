However, {{many of these}} applications—and especially those that require beam transport—are hindered by the large divergence of laser-accelerated beams. Here we propose a collimating concept that relies on the strong radial electric field of the laser-wakefield to reduce this divergence. This concept utilizes an <b>additional</b> <b>gas</b> jet, placed after the laser-wakefield accelerator.

40|$|Blast furnace is {{the heart}} of every steel plant. Steel {{production}} is based on the blast furnace process, as it is where the iron is extracted from the iron ore and turned into liquid iron, which will subsequently be used to make liquid steel. Therefore, without hot iron, steel can not be produced. Blast furnaces in this process are supplied among others with pulverized coal. Raw coal should be prepared for the blast furnaces in the form of fine coal powder. This fine coal powder should then be injected into the blast furnaces in order to continue the production. This process is carried out by the Pulverized Coal Injection System, which changes raw coal into dry fine coal powder. The system consists of a hot gas generator, a coal mill, a bagfilter as well as various valves, fans and piping. The general idea is to burn specific gases with the help of equipments and to use them to dry the coal in the cycle. When the amount of the gases inserted into the system is changed, the dried coal amount is directly affected. Based on this background the following project is carried out, which aims at the investigation of bottlenecks and critical points in the process. The most important bottleneck is the limited possibility of fresh air usage, as the oxygen in fresh air can cause explosions if existent in exceeding amounts in the system and thus, is dangerous. In order to prevent this explosive condition in the system, <b>additional</b> <b>gases</b> need {{to be added to the}} system. The aim of this project is to introduce <b>additional</b> <b>gases</b> to the system in order to increase the upper limit of the fresh air amount. Increasing the amount of fresh air in the recirculation gas should provide more amount of dried coal,hence increasing the drying capacity of the coal grinding plant. To understand the situation better, tests about gas injection are carried out in the system. The results of the tests are analyzed and the performance changes in the system are calculated. For this, programs in Excel and also inLabVIEW are created to interpret the situations easily. As it is understood from the results of the tests, when the amount of the <b>additional</b> <b>gases</b> isincreased, approximately 10 % increase in the amount of dried coal is observed. Subsequently, Pulverized Coal Injection mill productivity isincreased. Additionally, oxygen percentage in the mill circuit will decrease and this is important for the safety conditions. To conclude, this project aims to show the usage and recycling of <b>additional</b> <b>gases</b> in “PulverizedCoal Injection” process by implying various programs and interpretations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Oxyfuel-process {{could be}} a {{solution}} to lower the high specific CO 2 emissions of coal-fired power plants. The carbon capture rate (CCR) in current research is usually set to 90 % due to the increasing specific energy demand of the capture process (GPU) and lower CO 2 purity of the product stream at higher CCR. The remaining CO 2 {{and most of the}} impurities escape to the environment with the ventgas downstream of the GPU. In current literature it is recommended to increase the CCR from 90 % to higher values of up to 98 - 99 %. This can be achieved by adding an <b>additional</b> <b>gas</b> treatment to capture the CO 2 contained in the ventgas downstream of the GPU. At high CCR like 99 % the necessary recycle of the captured CO 2 into the basic GPU process leads to an increase of the specific energy demand of the GPU and an efficiency decrease of the overall process. It is possible to lower this efficiency penalty by recycling the remaining impurities downstream of the <b>additional</b> <b>gas</b> treatment to the ASU to regain the contained oxygen. The feasibility of the recycle strongly depends on the capture rate of the <b>additional</b> <b>gas</b> treatment, because it influences the CO 2 concentration in the recycled exhaust gas. In this work an overall process of a coal-fired Oxyfuel power plant with cryogenic ASU and externally cooled GPU as a basic process is modelled. This process is adapted to higher CCR by adding an <b>additional</b> <b>gas</b> treatment by a polymeric membrane (PM) downstream of the GPU. The ASU is modelled as a triple column process. This process enables an exhaust gas recycle downstream of the PM. The GPU is a two stage partial condensation. Furthermore the influence of the <b>additional</b> <b>gas</b> treatment on the GPU process and the overall process for different CCR is examined and the resulting exhaust gas concentrations are calculated to evaluate the possibility for an exhaust gas recycle. This evaluation is necessary, because the remaining CO 2 in the exhaust gas that is recycled to the ASU has to be removed upstream of the ASU. This leads to an additional energy demand to regenerate the molecular sieves upstream of the ASU...|$|R

Different groups {{all over the world are}} working on FPF for spectral ranges from the visible up to the long wave infrared. In order to achieve a large tuning range, the filters are normally operated in the first interference order. At the same time the spectral resolution is limited due to a limited effective finesse.
