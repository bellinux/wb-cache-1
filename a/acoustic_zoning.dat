40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{environmental}} noise pollution {{in the city of}} Khoramabad, Iran. On the basis of the resultant <b>acoustic</b> <b>zoning</b> 30 sites were selected for an experimental study. The main indices for noise pollution (Leq, L 1, L 10, L 50 and L 90) were measured. Results indicated that main streets of Khoramabad are overloaded during day-time. In all the sites average daily sound levels was 14 dB higher than environmental standards due to street traffic and peculiar geo-morphological structure of the town...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft {{noise is}} often {{perceived}} by communities living close to airports {{as the most}} serious impact on the environment, thus affecting both working activities and night sleep; various EC directives have recently dealt with this important problem. The Italian Ministry for Environment has decided to start a serious project in this field, financing noise monitoring systems close the main airports and promoting actions aimed to reduce aircraft environmental noise. The Acoustic Laboratory of the University of Perugia has improved an expert system to record and evaluate aircraft noise; {{it is based on}} INM (Integrated Noise Model) simulation code and it is composed of various sheets concerning airport location and general data, runways characteristics, aicraft traffic data, <b>acoustic</b> <b>zoning</b> and mapping, climate and noise monitoring systems. The expert system contains a data-base which has satisfactorily been filled with data from the main italian airports and is therefore an useful tool both to verify the current situation and to simulate future scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study on the}} {{environmental}} noise pollution of the city of Arak, Iran are presented. A preliminary classification of the territory into the five acoustically homogeneous urban areas classes where noise standards have been provided by Iranian regulation was adopted for the investigation. On the basis of the resultant <b>acoustic</b> <b>zoning</b> 18 sites were selected for an experimental survey. This last has been carried out by extensive measurements of the main indices for noise pollution (Leq, L 1, L 10, L 50, L 90). Results indicate that: (a) main roads of Arak are overloaded by traffic flow during day-time period and that in all the examined sites daily average sound levels due to road traffic exceeded environmental standards by about 10 dBA; (b) environmental noise exhibits a certain degree of spatial variance resulting primarily from the peculiar geo-morphological structure of the town and from the transport infrastructure and (c) more than 30 % of residents should be highly disturbed by road traffic noise...|$|E
30|$|To {{construct}} {{the map of}} the critical zones the required data have been selected by planners with reference to the concept of risk, understood as a possible threat imposed on the population to be associated with any adverse impacts caused by pressure on the accident area. Based on this conceptual interpretation of zones that can be identified as critical are first of all the areas on which the forecasts of planning instruments affect natural or anthropogenic risks, secondarily the areas affected by factors such as land that can cause an impact that requires maintaining a certain distance from them. The criticality on the map is therefore the result of the structured representation of natural hazards (hydraulic hazards, areas at high risk to collapse, areas covered by fire); anthropic risks (which include the areas of potential damage derived from firms with a high level risk productions, areas with problems of contamination, critical areas of <b>acoustic</b> <b>zoning,</b> critical areas for air emissions, territories exposed to electromagnetic pollution); buffer zones (which identify surface water other than the river, rail and viability infrastructure, technological systems on time and linear).|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years the {{increasing}} public sensibility for the urban noise, {{the relevance of}} the transport noise sources and the complexity of their interaction have pushed on the research in this sector. The contribution of the railway traffic to the acoustic environment may be relevant in the urban areas where the railway infrastructure enters to increase its accessibility. Moreover on these infrastructures various traffic flows (passengers and freight) are often overlapped. The key operational procedure for an integrated preventing and resolving action is the overlapping of a noise cadaster, summarising the acoustic effects of the railway traffic, to the <b>acoustic</b> <b>zoning,</b> resulting from land use and regulations. The paper deals with the whole procedure of planning, building up and tuning on the basis of experimental measurements of an urban railway noise cadaster. The procedure includes: a) data collection on the urban area; b) data collection on the railway traffic; c) spatial sampling; d) temporal sampling; e) measurement of acoustic levels; f) analysis and elaboration of measurements results; g) synthesis of locally specific and general key findings. A pilot application of the procedure to an extended case study in Roma metropolitan area has been carried out...|$|E
40|$|Publicado em "Sustainable Planning and Development", ISBN 1 - 85312 - 985 - 2 Urban {{growth is}} {{continuously}} applying pressure over resources, infrastructures and facilities, affecting negatively {{the standard of}} living in cities. In this context, evaluating and monitoring the urban environmental quality has become a main issue particularly important when considered as a decision -support tool that contributes to more livable and sustainable cities. Viana do Castelo is a mid-sized city located on the northwest Portuguese seaside, which undertook the challenge of developing an environmental program leading to the integration in a Healthy Cities European Network. Within this program, the identification of urban noise levels and people exposure was considered a priority. The scientific toolbox adopted to develop the studies includes noise simulation models and a GIS platform. Based on traffic data and site physical characteristics, acoustical maps were created and overlaid together with the land-use-based <b>acoustic</b> <b>zoning</b> and population distribution layers. This combination was the basis for the identification of critical zones, both in terms of noise levels and people exposure to this kind of pollution. This paper aims to present the approach, including the theoretical framework, and to discuss the results of a summer scenario of noise exposure in the city center...|$|E
40|$|For some time, in the DICAAr(1), it was deepened a {{specific}} research theme {{on the different}} {{issues related to the}} impact of air and noise type on adjacent areas to major airports, due to air traffic overflying. In particular a INM 6 simulation model, able to produce, through the identification of the noise contours, an <b>acoustic</b> <b>zoning,</b> covering both airport surfaces and those adjacent thereto has been calibrated. A more recent deepening of the topic concerned, however, the identification of a neural network for the recognition of the noise produced by airplanes, always during the LTO cycle; its findings are reported in this paper. This procedure, however, is excessively complex on the implementation plan as linked to a continuous experimental comparison between the sound recording units positioned {{in the vicinity of the}} airport and the airport newspaper supplied to the air traffic control bodies. A neural network model to recognize the noise generated by airliners has been considered. A certain number of experimental measurements has been performed in order to implement the training and validation set of the neural model. The experimental measurements include the noise of several type of aircraft engines during the take off and the landing operating mode. The aim of the study is to develop a model able to predict the aircraft noise under different environment and climate conditions. The results in terms of ability to recognize the exact aircraft noise even if not belonging to the training set or under not standard enviroment and climate conditions will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Problems in {{the sphere}} of an adverse {{ecological}} effect assessment of aerodrome environs aviation noise are analyzed. It is noted, that there is no modern standard and methodical base for such assessment. It is shown that when planning the build- ing, and also when developing noise-protective actions for residential areas in the zones of aviation noise increased level im- pact it’s most effectively to carry out <b>acoustic</b> <b>zoning</b> of areas near airports borders and flight routes. The system of transport sources noise rationing in Russia doesn't consider the established practice of its application. The aircraft of noisy types were actively taken out of service and aviation noise impact near the airports decreased, but the problem of noise protection, de- mands control when planning land use. Noise measurements in residential areas, near houses and inside, showed the excess of maximum allowed level values to 25 - 35 dBA (on equivalent value) and to 25 - 40 dBA (on the maximum value). As a consequence of the European states policy {{in the sphere}} of aviation noise management and of aerodrome en- virons zoning noise levels at the airports of Europe and their surroundings were stabilized and the sizes of noise contours were reduced. For different countries there was made the analysis of legislative bases of the implementation of the re-striction requirement for residential areas and the possibility of using the territory under noise impact. For rationing theaerodrome environs noise of the airports it’s offered to take a sound equivalent level in which admissible values are ranged on three zones for the main standard criterion. The authors present acoustic measurements results in houses near the airport Vnukovo on condition of using standard two-chamber trimmable and folding windows with the ventilating valve. It is shown that the popular window designs can't provide inside noise reduction at night to the standard L Amax level = 45 dBA from the aviation source creating noise L Amax > 75 dBA; sound insulation efficiency of the used blocks is insufficient. Crite- ria of aviation noise assessment for zoning of the domestic airports aerodrome environs are offered...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{issues related}} to air and noise {{pollution}} in the areas surrounding airports are a great concern {{for the quality of}} life of their inhabitants. In particular, the noise resulting from aircraft take-off and landing operations is one of the major reasons for physical and psychological stress and is generally considered as one of the main causes of reduced quality of life for residents in these areas. As a result, in many countries around the world a number of regulations aimed at studying, testing and limiting the noise pollution have been developed. Among these, the Italian regulation, which transposes a European Parliament initiative, beginning with law 477 / 95, issued a series of decrees aimed at identifying a map of the noise climate around each airport. With the help of software for the measurement of the propagation of the airport related noise, it is possible to define an <b>acoustic</b> <b>zoning</b> of the affected territory in relation to the intended use and the associated standard exposure levels. In this research area, this report aims to: • Calibrate a forecast model designed to zone the airport surrounding areas using updated data input; • Isolate aircraft emissions during take-off and landing; • Verify aircraft compliance with current regulations. Therefore, it will be essential to develop a procedure for the recognition of the noise emitted by aircraft in the different phases of flight, through a method that allows noise emissions to be correlated with the type of aircraft in a reliable way. In this regard, we will use the sound measurements provided by the detection unit at Cagliari-Elmas airport, which is equipped with a receiver, a computer system and a data storage centre, and which detects the emissions spectrum, the duration of the event, the SEL, etc [...] However, the instruments available in the detection unit are not able to associate the registered sound to the type of aircraft that originates that sound. In order to correlate the noise to its source a mathematical and statistical tool will be required. Therefore, it has been decided to develop a statistical tool, based on empirical observations, which reproduces the overflying aircraft phenomenon. The research took place in two distinct phases: 1. Phase 1 : Statistical approach: Observation and modelling of the phenomenon; 2. Phase 2 : Implementation of the aircraft-emissions correlation...|$|E
