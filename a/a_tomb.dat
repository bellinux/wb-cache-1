5|$|Other {{countries}} considered similar memorials. The US constructed <b>a</b> <b>Tomb</b> of the Unknown Soldier in 1921; {{while the}} idea was clearly a foreign concept, it proved very popular with the American public and by 1936 was attracting over 1.5 m visitors a year and acting as an informal national monument to the war. Edwin Redslob, part of the German government, supported a similar scheme in 1925, but without success, and Mainz Cathedral and Ulm Minster were later proposed as options for <b>a</b> <b>tomb.</b> In Germany, <b>a</b> <b>tomb</b> was not finally built until 1935, when it {{was sponsored by the}} Nazi government; the final memorial contained 20 bodies of unknown German soldiers from the Eastern front. Other countries also constructed tombs, including Belgium and Portugal, and as in France and Britain these tombs were placed in capital cities; there was an abortive attempt to place the Romanian tomb at Mărăşeşti, but this proved impractical for both logistic and ceremonial reasons. Canada, Australia and New Zealand declined to build their own tombs, as they were considered to be represented by the burial in London.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{rebellion}} of Justo José de Urquiza against Rosas in 1851, Rosas' defeat {{at the battle}} of Caseros and the resulting chaos delayed the move of San Martín's remains to Buenos Aires. Still, both Rosas and Urquiza organized public homages to San Martín, despite the conflict. Buenos Aires seceded from Argentina as the state of Buenos Aires, dominated by Unitarians who despised San Martín. Thus, the move of his remains was postponed indefinitely. Aware that there were no favorable conditions for the project, Balcarce arranged a creation of <b>a</b> <b>tomb</b> in the Boulogne-sur-Mer cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, the addax {{occurred}} from Northern Africa through Arabia and the Levant.

These pictures show addax and some other antelopes tied with ropes to stakes. The number of addax captured by a person were considered an indicator of his high social and economic position in the society. But today excess poaching has resulted in the extinction of this species in Egypt since the 1960s.|$|E
