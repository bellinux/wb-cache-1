40|$|A {{tentative}} {{goal of the}} Frequen y Agile Solar Radioteles ope (FASR) is {{to measure}} the spatial, temporal, and frequen y stru ture of oronal mass eje tions (CME's) as they expand away from the surfa e of the sun. This memo estimates the required olle ting area of FASR below 300 MHz for a prototypi al CME based on observations by Bastian et al (2001) between 164 and 432 MHz with the radioheliograph at Nan ay, Fran e. Out to a distan e of about one solar radius from the photosphere the CME spe trum drops sharply below 150 MHz, presumably due to Razin-Tsytovi h suppression, but at greater distan es from the sun the CME loop should be dete table as low as 50 MHz at brightness temperatures greater than 10, 000 K or so. The Nan ay data show that the spe tral index of the CME loop de reases very rapidly with in reasing solar radius and the radiation model proposed infers that measurements below 150 MHz will yield onsiderable information about the CME emission me hanisms within a few solar radii. For the al ulations in this memo I will assume a 3 - surfa e brightness dete tion goal of 5000 Kelvins. Coronal s <b>attering</b> is likely to set a lower limit on sour e spatial s ale of about 3 ar minutes at 100 MHz, but this s <b>attering</b> size will de rease rapidly with solar radius and in rease roughly in proportion to observing wavelength.

Defesa: Curitiba, 24 / 02 / 2016 Inclui referências : f. 95 - 104 Resumo: Nesta dissertação apresentamos os resultados calculados para o espalhamento elástico de elétrons por moléculas de CCl 4, XF 4 (X=Si,Ge) e 1, 2 -butadieno. As moléculas alvo foram descritas na aproximação de núcleos fixos (Born-Oppenheimmer), através do método de Hartree-Fo k. Para os cálculos de espalhamento, utilizamos o método multicanal de Schwinger, implementado com pseudopotenciais de Bachelet, Hamann e Schlüter. Dentro desse método utilizamos duas aproximações para descrever o efeito de interação do elétron incidente com a molécula alvo, a saber, aproximação estático-troca, a qual não leva em onta a deformação da nuvem eletronica do alvo pelo elétron incidente, e a estático-troca mais polarização, na qual é permitida a deformação da nuvem eletronica. Para o CCl 4 mostramos a seção de hoque integral, seção de choque de transferência de momento e seções de choque diferenciais. Detectamos a presença de duas ressonâncias de forma na seção de choque em 0, 75 eV e 8 eV, e também um estado ligado. Para o SiF 4 e GeF 4, obtivemos as seções de choque integral, transferência de momento e diferenciais. No SiF 4 observamos a presença de uma ressonância de forma em 8, 5 eV e um mínimo de Ramsauer-Townsend em 0, 45 eV. No GeF 4 observamos uma ressonância de forma ao longo da seção de choque em 6 eV, e também a presença de um estado virtual. Para o 1, 2 -butadieno o procedimento Born- closure foi empregado para levar em conta o efeito do momento de dipolo e calculamos a seção de choque integral. Encontramos uma ressonância pronunciada nessa seção de choque em 2, 4 eV, valor muito próximo ao da posição da ressonância encontrada no aleno em 2, 5 eV. As ressonâncias identificadas nas seções de choque foram caracterizadas e suas posições comparadas com os resultados experimentais e de outros métodos teóricos disponíveis na literatura, com os quais obtivemos uma boa concordânciaAbstract: In {{this work}} we {{present the results}} for al ulations of the elasti ele tron s <b>attering</b> by CCl 4, XF 4 (X=Si,Ge) and 1, 2 -butadiene mole ules.
