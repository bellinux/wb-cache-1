5000|$|In {{this new}} growth {{period of the}} early 1990s the company led the way and {{did a lot of}} new {{innovative}} things in the map industry. They were the first map company to start a map education foundation that trained teachers on geography and interesting map lessons and donated map materials to area schools. They were also the first map publishing company to set up a computer map database that could have sections checked out by cartographers, updated, and them checked back in to a live digital map library with date stamps to keep track of what was edited. They also solved many software digital mapping problems that other companies still use today. And they were the first map company to set up a digital map page and grid look-up system for the whole world. Many old-time TBM map book users can still tell you what page and grid they live on, even though they stopped using the map books years ago. [...] After conversion and completion of all of their pen and ink map atlases to digital format in the mid-1990s, map data became a significant part of TBM company sales. The company had large data contracts in the 1990s with the California CHP, large utilities, and many area cities and counties. The Thomas Brothers map database had a monopoly in the 1990s, since they had the best street address indexes in them, making them very good for <b>address</b> <b>matching</b> for businesses. Because sales of its last produced guidebooks for Washington, D.C., and Virginia did not sell as expected and much money was lost on the Web site store design, the company was in major debt, and was purchased by and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Rand McNally in 1999. The company took a new radical direction in November 2003 and let go many of Thomas Brothers' most skilled cartographers and employees.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} term-weighted dissimilarity {{algorithm}} and {{its application to}} <b>address</b> <b>matching</b> in Location Based Services (LBS). It is composed of two parts: <b>address</b> <b>matching</b> and web application of location based services. We start with a brief introduction of location based services, the background of <b>address</b> <b>matching</b> and the main objectives and accomplishments of this study. In Part 1 we discuss various string similarity measures, e. g., the Levenshtein Distance, the Damerau-Levenshtein Distance, the Longest Common Subsequence, the Searching Minimum Errors and Hamming Distance as well as vector space model. Upon evaluating their strength and weakness, we introduce a term-weighted dissimilarity for effective <b>address</b> <b>matching.</b> This {{is a combination of}} edit distance similarity and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weighting. We implement this algorithm into a software and show its effectiveness via a real application for <b>address</b> <b>matching</b> and correction based on Canada Post's address standard. In Part 2 we are concerned with a mobile application of address extracting algorithms for location based services. We build an intelligent agent for online LBS via wireless Internet accessing. Such an agent, based on efficient and accurate address identification, can analyze the content of certain Web pages (ex. Yellow Pages) to search desired LBS information. We propose an ontology-based conceptual information retrieval approach combined with tree structure matching and the nearest neighbour methods to perform address extraction from texts and documents. A prototype, RouteInfo Mobile LBS for automobile drivers, is developed and tested successfully for LBS searching, mapping and route finding. Future application to target marketing through a combination with customer behavioural and transaction data will also be considered...|$|E
40|$|Abstract (3490 words) Geocoding {{refers to}} the process of {{assigning}} geographic identifiers and/or geographic coordinates to the description of a feature location. <b>Address</b> <b>matching</b> is the specific case of geocoding where the description of a feature location is an address, to which an address from a reference dataset is assigned. <b>Address</b> <b>matching</b> is complicated by an incomplete or inaccurate input address, or one that includes a misleading address element, such as an incorrect suburb or place name. The cause of such an input address is often due to the ambiguities originating from uncertainties regarding suburb and/or place name boundaries. Relaxing the requirement to match the suburb accurately, adds more addresses to the list of potential matches to choose from, but with the increased risk of geocoding the input address to a spatially removed suburb or place with the same street name and number as the input address. The Intiendo (Spanish for ‘I understand’) <b>address</b> <b>matching</b> tool is a software toolset that is used to structure and geocode addresses, i. e. to understand and interpret addresses. Intiendo employs multiple search algorithms during geocoding...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{studies of}} disease with {{potential}} environmental risk factors, residential location {{is often used}} as a surrogate for unknown environmental exposures or {{as a basis for}} assigning environmental exposures. These studies most typically use the residential location at the time of diagnosis due to ease of collection. However, previous residential locations may be more useful for risk analysis because of population mobility and disease latency. When residential histories have not been collected in a study, {{it may be possible to}} generate them through public-record databases. In this study, we evaluated the ability of a public-records database from LexisNexis to provide residential histories for subjects in a geographically diverse cohort study. We calculated 11 performance metrics comparing study-collected addresses and two address retrieval services from LexisNexis. We found 77 % and 90 % match rates for city and state and 72 % and 87 % detailed <b>address</b> <b>match</b> rates with the basic and enhanced services, respectively. The enhanced LexisNexis service covered 86 % of the time at residential addresses recorded in the study. The mean match rate for detailed <b>address</b> <b>matches</b> varied spatially over states. The results suggest that public record databases can be useful for reconstructing residential histories for subjects in epidemiologic studies...|$|R
40|$|Spatial data is {{increasingly}} important in emission inventories. Over the last 5 years, the Internet, public “right to know”, and environmental justice programs have greatly increased the visibility {{and use of}} emission inventory data. The increased visibility of inventory data in turn increases the need for accurate spatial inventory data. Geographic information systems (GIS) and global positioning system (GPS) technologies are invaluable tools {{that can be used}} by state and local government agencies to address spatial deficiencies of inventory data. This study addresses the spatial quality of large point source data. For the 1999 inventory year, large point sources accounted for 8. 5 % of NOx emissions and 9. 5 % of Reactive Organic Gas (ROG) emissions in California. One GIS technology, <b>address</b> <b>matching,</b> can be used to assess the accuracy of point source coordinate data. The spatial data quality of a subset of point sources in the California Air Resources Board’s tabular California Emission Inventory Data and Reporting System (CEIDARS) was analyzed using geographic information systems.

The accuracy of reported coordinates varied widely. The net emission impact of these point sources on neighborhoods can be significant...|$|E

Random-digit-dialing (RDD) surveys are typically conducted using only the telephone survey mode of data collection. However, because RDD survey response rates have been declining over the past ten years it is important to examine alternatives to the single-mode approach. This paper describes a test of one multi-mode alternative conducted as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a monthly state-based RDD survey that measures health conditions and risk factors. In six states, a list-assisted RDD sample was selected and matched with a database of residential telephone numbers and addresses. For the sampled telephone numbers with an <b>address</b> <b>match,</b> a mail survey with telephone survey follow-up of mail nonrespondents was employed. For sampled telephone numbers with no <b>address</b> <b>match,</b> the survey was conducted by telephone alone. After discussing the design and implementation of the six-state pilot survey, including procedures for the selection of the adult respondent(s) from the sample households, we focus on response rates and respondent characteristics by mode using the ongoing, single-mode BRFSS survey in each state as a comparison sample.
