The material of construction of the personal protective equipment is of critical importance as well.

40|$|Penicillin binding {{proteins}} (PBPs) and β-lactamases {{are involved}} in interactions with β-lactam antibiotics connected with both antibacterial activity and mediation of bacterial β-lactam resistance. Current methods for identifying inhibitors of PBPs and β-lactamases can be inefficient and are often not suitable for studying weakly and/or reversibly binding compounds. Therefore, improved ligand binding assays for PBPs and β-lactamases are needed. We report {{the development of a}} fluorescence polarization (FP) assay for PBPs and "serine" β-lactamases using a boronic-acid-based, reversibly binding "tracer. " The tracer was designed based on a crystal structure of a covalent complex between a boronic acid and PBP 1 b from Streptococcus pneumoniae. The tracer bound to three different PBPs with modest affinity (K(d) = 4 - 12 μM) and more tightly to the TEM 1 serine β-lactamase (K(d) = 109 nM). β-Lactams and other boronic acids were able to displace the tracer in competition assays.

After implantation of large 3 D cell-seeded structures, cells die rather than contribute to tissue regenerating. Here we’ve tested oxygen-releasing materials to improve cell survival and growth after implantation. Calcium peroxide (CaO 2) in a polymer matrix {{was used as}} source of oxygen. Two polymers were tested in order {{to slow down and}} extend the period of oxygen release, poly(D,L-lactic acid) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid). Compared to CaO 2 particles, both releasing systems showed an initially higher and shorter oxygen release.

40|$|At {{some time}} almost 4 billion years ago, nature likely {{was faced with}} a {{chemical}} dilemma. Nucleic acids had emerged as replicable information carriers and primitive catalysts (Joyce 2002), yet their functional potential was constrained by their structural homogeneity and lack of reactive groups. These properties rendered nucleic <b>acids</b> well <b>suited</b> for storing information, but flawed for mediating the diverse chemistries required to sustain and improve increasingly complex biological systems. It is tempting to speculate that translation emerged as the solution to this dilemma. Translation, defined here as the conversion of an informationcarrying molecule into a corresponding encoded structure, enabled the expanded functional potential of proteins to be explored using powerful evolutionary methods that depend on the unique ability of nucleic acids to replicate. A small but growing number of researchers have begun to tackle a modern version of this dilemma. While proteins and nucleic acids can be manipulated using powerful molecular biology techniques that enable their directed evolution, the size, fragility, and relatively limited functional group diversity of biological macromolecules make them poorly suited for solving many problems in the chemical sciences. Ideally, researchers would like to apply evolution-based approaches to the discovery of functional synthetic, rather than biological, molecules. A solution analogous to nature’s translation of mRNA into protein could, in principle, address this contemporary problem (Orgel 1995; Gartner and Liu 2001). If a laboratory system were developed that could translate amplifiable information carriers such as DNA into arbitrary synthetic molecules, the evolution of synthetic molecules using iterated cycles of translation, selection, amplification, and diversification would be possible. The translation of DNA into synthetic molecules is conceptually PLoS Biology...|$|R

Succinic and d- 3 -hydroxybutyric acid levels did not rise, but the former gave an indication of the hygienic quality of the eggs, and the latter revealed the presence of incubator egg rejects.

Several organic acids are well-established diagnostic biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction, making the analysis of the organic <b>acid</b> metabolome well <b>suited</b> to monitoring the progressive disruption of mitochondrial structure and function during HIV infection. Using a multifaceted analytical-bioinformatics procedure, at least 10 of these metabolites could be linked to (1) disrupted mitochondrial metabolism, (2) changes in lipid metabolism and (3) oxidative stress, all of which are aberrations caused by HIV infection. Because {{of the role of the}} mitochondria in apoptosis, higher levels of this type of cell death in infected (compared to uninfected) individuals was used to support GC–MS data.

40|$|Protein {{plays an}} {{important}} role in an athlete's regeneration, recovery and muscle growth. Unlike fat and carbohydrates, proteins are irreplaceable in our diet. The muscle tissue is composed primarily of proteins, so most athletes believe that higher protein intake will result in faster muscle growth. However, an excessive amount of protein is linked to fatigue, higher strain on kidneys and liver, loss of large amounts of water and potassium ions. Furthermore, high level of protein intake causes excretion of certain vitamins and minerals (e. g. calcium, zinc, B vitamins). The human body is unable to effectively process more then 2 to 2. 5 g of protein per kilogram of body weight. Recommended daily protein dietary allowance is 0. 8 to 1. 2 g/kg for a sedentary person, 1. 2 to 2 g/kg for athletes, approximately 1. 2 to 1. 4 g/kg for endurance athletes, and for heavy resistance training athletes increased protein intake of 1. 6 to 1. 7 g/kg is recommended. Meat and dairy products contain complete proteins that have an ideal ratio of essential amino <b>acids</b> well <b>suited</b> for human dietary needs. In contrast, proteins derived from plant food contain only incomplete proteins. One must combine multiple plant sources to achieve sufficient amounts of all essential amino acids. There is no need for protein supplements as long as we eat a well-balanced diet. Most athletes, however, use whey proteins to boost regeneration and muscle growth. It is particularly valued for its easy digestibility. Therefore, it is recommended to be taken right after training (at doses of 0. 3 g/kg body weight) when the digestive tract is not capable of processing complex food.

The low {{concentration of}} EPA was observed also in Great Salt Lake (3.5  mg/g DW), PR China (1.4  mg/g DW), and Urmia, Iran strain (2.7  mg/g DW), A. persimilis (0.0) (García-Ortega et al. (1998); Dhert et al. (1993); Triantaphyllidis et al. (1995) and Han et al. (2000) respectively). Fujita et al. (1980) reported that marine fish require EPA and DHA in its diet while freshwater fish require linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3). Therefore, the local strain (A. tunisiana) in its original state is not an ideal food for larvae of marine fish and crustaceans so it is urgent to enrich it to improve the levels of these fatty <b>acids</b> to <b>suit</b> the feeding of marine creatures. Studies in Japan and the multidisciplinary International Study on Artemia revealed that the concentration of the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic (EPA) in Artemia nauplii was determining its nutritional value for larvae of various marine fishes and crustaceans (Leger et al., 1986). Beneficially, EPA (20 : 5 ω 3) was increased by enrichment from 1.3  mg/g DW to six times its original concentration (7.6  mg/g DW) after 18  h, while {{no significant differences between}} 18 and 24  h. Comparable with A. franciscana, EPA (3.3 %) is significantly lower than the enriched tunisiana. EPA was measured in other strains of A. franciscana by many authors and scored 4.4, 5.5, and 4.1 % (Dhert et al., 1993 and Estevez et al., 1998) while others scored high EPA contents 29.6 – 53 % (Han et al., 2000). Before enrichment, the local Egyptian Artemia (tunisiana) was classified into freshwater type according to Watanabe et al. (1978), which contain low levels of 20 : 5 n 3, but after enrichment and the improvement of EPA ratio, it became suitable for the marine fish.|$|R

Differences in a 2, 3 - and a 2, 6 -sialoglycan patterns detected in clonal virulent Leishmania donovani promastigotes, correlated with the level of a 2, 3 - and a 2, 6 -sialyltransferase activity present in these parasites. The role of macrophage sialic acid-receptors in uptake and survival of L. donovani was studied in the murine macrophage cell line raw 264. 7. Macrophage invasion was dependent on the binding to Siglec- 1, while suppression of MAPK signaling was mediated through Siglec- 5. Sialic acid removal by neuraminidase treatment reduced parasite infectivity. The presence of trypsin resistant sialic acid residues in the neuraminidase treated parasites grown in a serum free medium in presence of sialoglycoconjugates indicated that the parasites could salvage sialic acid from exogenous sialoglycans and reutilize it for de novo glycoprotein sialylation in L. donovani parasites. Thus, our results demonstrate the involvement of sialoglycans in the invasion as well as the survival process of L. donovani parasites. </p...|$|R

The lipid characteristics of microalgae are known to differ between species and change with growth conditions. Increasing TAG production by microalgae through optimization of growth regimes is of great interest {{as it is a}} convenient feedstock for biofuel production. Microalgae have the ability to synthesize and accumulate high levels of TAGs in specialized lipid bodies located in the cytoplasm {{and to a lesser extent}} in the chloroplast. In this chapter we first summarize the key lipids in microalgae, that is, the saponifiable lipids including neutral glycerolipids (NL; which include mono-, di-, and triglycerides) and some membrane-associated lipids including glycerophospholipids (PL), sphingolipids, and glycolipids (GL) as well as fatty acyls (free fatty acids). Aspects on gravimetric measurements, the simplest form of lipid characterization of total lipids, are presented followed by step-by-step protocols for the extraction and separation of lipid classes (NL, PL, and GL) using solid-phase extraction. The final discussion presents the preparation of lipid extracts for total and free fatty acid analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-MS) to determine the detailed composition of lipids within classes, also known as lipidomics. Screening microalgae for lipid species, searching those with high proportions of NL lipids, and determining strains and growth conditions that produce fatty <b>acid</b> profiles most <b>suited</b> for obtaining high quality biodiesel are also discussed.

40|$|The retina is an {{internal}} photosensitive neural tunic which absorbs light and prevents it from reflecting back. The light receptors and neurons of the retina are initial processor of visual information. Various anomalies of the retina such as retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy to retinal degenerative diseases cause severe {{loss of vision}} since they affect photoreceptors directly or indirectly. Conventional therapies have never been fully successful in restoring vision in such diseases. However current research in stem cell therapies has shown remarkable potential. In this project, {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} from mouse were coxed into photoreceptor fate in presence and absence of Dorsomorphin using specific media in a stepwise differentiation process. Dorsomorphin is an inhibitor of Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) whose suppression may influence neural differentiation. Studies were done using conventional inverted microscopy and fluorescent microscopy on mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (miPS cells). Immunolabelling techniques involving Pax 6, Crx, RPE 65, Rhodopsin and Opsin were used to evaluate the advantage of these as markers for stem cells differentiation. Reverse Transcriptase PCR was done to confirm the gene expression on the differentiated cells. Human iPS derived Mesenchymal stem cells were cultured and the effect of different concentrations of Retinoic Acid such as 0 mM, 0. 1 mM and 0. 5 mM on cell proliferation was tested in both presence and absence of Dorsomorphin. The results revealed both control and Dorsomorphin treated miPS cells successfully differentiated into photoreceptors-like cells as detected by positive staining of Rhodopsin and Opsin. The cells were however negative for Pax 6, and very weak staining for RPE and Crx. The presence or absence of Dorsomorphin did not make any difference on miPS differentiation. The same observation was made on differentiating human iPS-MSC where Dorsomorphin did not reveal much effect. However highest cell count of proliferating cells was observed in the subgroups containing 0. 1 mM Retinoic Acid on Day 7 groups as control had an average of 590 ±± 317. 23 and treatment 1206. 33 ±± 114. 99 cells, with statistical significance of P< 0. 05. It appears that the presence of Retinoic Acid facilitated the proliferation of human iPS-MSC. In conclusion, the study reveals that iPS can be another potential stem cell source for therapies of retinal diseases involving photoreceptors where the question of ethical issue is not a problem unlike embryonic stem cells. Also it reveals the concentration of Retinoic <b>Acid</b> most <b>suited</b> for human iPS-MSC cell proliferation.

40|$|Pyrosequencing {{has emerged}} as an {{alternative}} method of nucleic <b>acid</b> sequencing, well <b>suited</b> for many applications which aim to characterize single nucleotide polymorphisms, mutations, microbial types and CpG methylation in the target DNA. The commercially available pyrosequencing systems can harbor {{two different types of}} software which allow analysis in AQ or CpG mode, respectively, both widely employed for DNA methylation analysis. Aim {{of the study was to}} assess the performance for DNA methylation analysis at CpG sites of the two pyrosequencing software which allow analysis in AQ or CpG mode, respectively. Despite CpG mode having been specifically generated for CpG methylation quantification, many investigations on this topic have been carried out with AQ mode. As proof of equivalent performance of the two software for this type of analysis is not available, the focus of this paper was to evaluate if the two modes currently used for CpG methylation assessment by pyrosequencing may give overlapping results. We compared the performance of the two software in quantifying DNA methylation in the promoter of selected genes (GSTP 1, MGMT, LINE- 1) by testing two case series which include DNA from paraffin embedded prostate cancer tissues (PC study, N = 36) and DNA from blood fractions of healthy people (DD study, N = 28), respectively. We found discrepancy in the two pyrosequencing software-based quality assignment of DNA methylation assays. Compared to the software for analysis in the AQ mode, less permissive criteria are supported by the Pyro Q-CpG software, which enables analysis in CpG mode. CpG mode warns the operators about potential unsatisfactory performance of the assay and ensures a more accurate quantitative evaluation of DNA methylation at CpG sites. The implementation of CpG mode is strongly advisable in order to improve the reliability of the methylation analysis results achievable by pyrosequencing...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{attacks of}} {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) are most commonly treated with glucocorticoids, which can provide life-saving albeit only temporary symptomatic relief. The {{mechanism of action}} (MOA) is now known to involve induction of indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), where IL- 10 requires subsequent heme oxygenase- 1 (HMOX- 1) induction. Ectopic expression studies reveal that even small changes in expression of IDO, HMOX- 1, or mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD 2) can prevent demyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal models of MS. An alternative to glucocorticoids is needed for a long-term treatment of MS. A distinctly short list of endogenous activators of both membrane G-protein-coupled receptors and nuclear peroxisome proliferating antigen receptors (PPARs) demonstrably ameliorate EAE pathogenesis by MOAs resembling that of glucocorticoids. These dual activators and potential MS therapeutics include endocannabinoids and the prostaglandin 15 -deoxy-Δ 12, 14 -PGJ 2. Nicotinamide profoundly ameliorates and prevents autoimmune-mediated demyelination in EAE via maintaining levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), without activating PPAR nor any G-protein-coupled receptor. By comparison, nicotinic acid provides even greater levels of NAD than nicotinamide in many tissues, while additionally activating the PPAR-dependent pathway already shown to provide relief in animal models of MS after activation of GPR 109 a/HM 74 a. Thus nicotinic <b>acid</b> is uniquely <b>suited</b> for providing therapeutic relief in MS. However nicotinic acid is unexamined in MS research. Nicotinic acid penetrates the blood brain barrier, cures pellagric dementia, {{has been used for}} over 50 years clinically without toxicity, and raises HDL concentrations to a greater degree than any pharmaceutical, thus providing unparalleled benefits against lipodystrophy. Summary analysis reveals that the expected therapeutic benefits of high-dose nicotinic acid administration far outweigh any known adverse risks in consideration for the treatment of multiple sclerosis...|$|R

Reaction chamber experiments with P-caryophyllene at two different ozone mixing ratios were performed and the carboxylic acid oxidation products in the particle phase were characterized by APCI-MS and HPLC-ESI-MS. All five synthesized acids were found as beta-caryophyllene oxidation products in the reaction chamber aerosol. The main oxidation products of the reaction chamber experiments were beta- 14 -hydroxynocaryophyllonic acid, beta-nocaryophyllonic acid (III) and beta CA 198 (II). Product yields of the acids were estimated based on the chamber experiments {{and the application of}} the atmospheric chemistry box model CAABA/MECCA. Finally, ambient aerosol samples taken during the HUMPPA campaign in Hyytiala, Finland in summer 2010 were analysed for the carboxylic acid beta-caryophyllene oxidation products. All five synthesized compounds were detected and were quantified in the ambient aerosol samples. The major beta-caryophyllene carboxylic acid oxidation products in the ambient air samples were beta-nocaryophyllonic acid (III) and beta CA 198 (II) with concentrations in the range of about 0. 2 - 14 ng m(- 3) and 0. 8 - 6. 8 ng m(- 3). The fact that the concentrations of these two acids in ambient aerosol are generally higher than the concentration of beta-caryophyllinic acid (IV) (often used in previous studies as oxidation tracer) with a concentration of about 0. 16 ng m(- 3) leads to the conclusion that these two <b>acids</b> are better <b>suited</b> as tracer compounds for beta-caryophyllene secondary organic aerosol formation.

40|$|Ponencia presentada en la 18 th International Sunflower Conference, celebrada en Mar de Plata y Balcarce (Argentina), del 27 de abril al 1 {{de marzo de}} 2012. Conventional {{sunflower}} oil {{is regarded as a}} healthy oil by consumers around the world. Its main characteristics are a fatty acid profile rich in polyunsaturated linoleic acid, a moderate to high content of alpha-tocopherol, with high vitamin E activity, and a moderate to high content of phytosterols, which {{play an important role in}} reducing blood cholesterol and subsequently the risk of coronary heart disease. Notwithstanding these properties, sunflower breeders have been extraordinarily successful in developing new traits that either confer improved nutritional and technological properties to the oil for conventional uses or have opened up new applications for {{sunflower oil}}. Most of the genetic modifications of sunflower oil quality have affected the fatty acid and tocopherols profiles. New traits such as mid and high oleic acid content, both low saturated and high saturated fatty acid content, and different combinations of increased levels of beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol have been developed. Some of them such as mid and high oleic acid content are playing an important role in the market, particularly in the US, where the industry has completely shifted to mid oleic acid sunflower oil. Others such as the combination of high stearic acid and high oleic <b>acid,</b> particularly well <b>suited</b> for the industry of margarines and spreads, and the combination of low saturate and mid or high oleic acid, with enhanced nutritional properties, are close to the commercial level. Germplasm with enhanced vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) content has recently being developed and breeding research on phytosterols, just started, will probably throw a new set of traits in coming years. Despite most of the novel oil quality traits are qualitatively inherited, the integration of several traits in a breeding program requires strong support of molecular tools. There have been important advances in recent years in mapping and tagging genes underlying modified oil quality traits as well as identifying their role in the biosynthetic pathway through candidate gene approaches. However, a deeper understanding of the genetic and molecular bases of these traits is required, particularly in relation to the generalized presence of modifying genes affecting their expression.

40|$|The use of {{membrane}} bioreactors (MBRs) for {{wastewater treatment}} {{has been increasing}} since the 1990 s and is gaining more importance due to rising demands for water in general. There is yet one main limitation in full-scale applications of MBRs: the membrane fouling, leading to a substantial loss of membrane performance and subsequently to high costs because of cleaning and replacing the membranes. Since no consensus on the exact fouling phenomenon or a single fouling parameter in MBRs has been reached yet {{the present study was}} aiming at characterizing membrane foulants in the full-scale MBR Nordkanal (Düsseldorf, Germany), in pilot-scale MBRs as well as in fermenter-/lab-scale studies. The focus {{of the present study was}} on two classes of substances that are known to cause fouling in membrane applications: extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and metals. The long-term observation of activated sludge, permeate and autopsied membranes from the MBR Nordkanal showed a significant contribution of EPS and iron to membrane fouling. The membrane fouling layers where shown to have the following composition (in weight %) : humic substances (39 %), carbohydrates (30 %), iron (22 %) and fatty acids (8 %). Contrary to other, mostly pilot-scale studies, biofilm development was not dominant in this full-scale MBR due to vigorous aeration and frequent backwashing of the fibres. Interestingly, precipitations of iron hydroxides were detected on the membranes, even on the permeate side, whereas Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + were not involved in fouling in this MBR. The retention by the ultrafiltration membranes in the full-scale MBR was shown to be 39 ± 27 % for humic acids and 79 ± 30 % for carbohydrates (average of 2. 5 years of monthly samples) although the molecular weight of the humics fraction was demonstrated to be below the molecular weight cut-off of the membrane. Fatty acids (FA) of microbial origin (C 16 : 0, C 18 : 0) were the dominating FA in EPS of activated sludge flocs, sludge supernatant, permeate and membrane fouling layers in the MBR Nordkanal. A remarkable finding was that a shorter FA of a probable synthetic origin (C 9 : 0) was preferentially deposited into the membranes where it accounted for 10 % of the FA in total EPS whereas in sludge floc EPS it was only 1 % of total FA concentration. The results from the full-scale study were used to propose a fouling mechanism that is based on complexation and adsorption processes. Iron from the coagulant FeCl 3 in form of Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + is playing a central role in this mechanism as it is able to form complexes with humic acids and with uronic acids that were detected in the microbial polysaccharides of samples of the MBR Nordkanal. For such complexes as well as for fatty acids, reduced electrostatic repulsion, narrowing of the membrane pores and hydrophobic interactions with the membrane material could explain the observed fouling phenomenon. In lab-scale surveys regarding membrane cleaning strategies, it was further verified that citric <b>acid</b> is especially <b>suited</b> to remove iron and EPS from fouled membranes. Moreover, it was demonstrated through lab-scale sludge digestion how soluble Fe 2 + can be formed and released together with EPS from the sludge floc matrix under anaerobic conditions. Such conditions also deteriorated sludge properties in terms of filterability and settling behaviour. Finally, in the pilot-scale study it was shown that low sludge retention time (SRT) leads to an excess production of EPS in correlation with deteriorating sludge properties. The formation of fouling layers on the membranes was also more distinct at low SRT, with 40 -fold higher amounts of deposited proteins and 5 -fold higher concentrations of carbohydrates compared with high SRT. However, membrane permeability was similar at both SRTs. The conclusion for operators of full-scale MBRs in general is that high SRT is beneficial for activated sludge properties. For the specific case of the MBR Nordkanal which is already operated at high SRT (28 d), it can be concluded that the presence of iron in conjunction with anaerobic conditions in the denitrification tank, prior to membrane filtration, is more decisive for the membrane fouling. As shown by results of the present study, the applied cleaning strategy with citric acid in Nordkanal is appropriate for removing the major membrane foulants. For future studies aiming at clarifying distinct fouling parameters and fouling mechanisms, a focus on metal complexation with specific EPS or with wastewater components, as well as the interaction of such complexes with different membrane materials looks promising...|$|R
