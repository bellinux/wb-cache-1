We prove that for all positive integers $c$, nilpotency of class at most $c$ is detectable in power subgroups, as is the $k$-Engel law for $k$ at most 4. In contrast, detectability in power subgroups fails for solvability of given derived length: we construct a finite group $W$ such that $W^ 2 $ and $W^ 3 $ are metabelian but $W$ has derived length $ 3 $. We analyse the complexity of the detectability of commutativity in power subgroups, in terms of finite presentations that encode a proof of the result.

Decision procedures and regularity results appropriate for the relativised forms are given. This suggests {{the definition of a}} sequence of code types: the join codes of level k (1 k). At level 1 we have precisely the familiar comma free codes. For a join code of level k, a procedure for segmenting messages into code words is observed that consists of k steps, with each step being carried out in the elementary comma free manner. An illustration of this segmentation process is given using an idealization of the Watson-Crick base pairing of complementary strands of DNA. In this process the code words appear as ssDNA molecules in k distinct test tubes with each test tube content being washed over each incoming ssDNA complemented message strand. After k washings the sequence of <b>attached</b> <b>code</b> words provides the required segmentation...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the most}} arduous and {{error-prone}} aspects of precision resummed calculations {{are related to the}} partonic hard process, having {{nothing to do with the}} resummation. In particular, interfacing to parton-distribution functions, combining various channels, and performing the phase space integration can be limiting factors in completing calculations. Conveniently, however, most of these tasks are already automated in many Monte Carlo programs, such as MadGraph, Alpgen or Sherpa. In this paper, we show how such programs can be used to produce distributions of partonic kinematics with associated color structures representing the hard factor in a resummed distribution. These distributions can then be used to weight convolutions of jet, soft and beam functions producing a complete resummed calculation. In fact, only around 1000 unweighted events are necessary to produce precise distributions. A number of examples and checks are provided, including $e^+e^-$ two- and four-jet event shapes, $n$-jettiness and jet-mass related observables at hadron colliders. <b>Attached</b> <b>code</b> can be used to modify MadGraph to export the relevant leading-order hard functions and color structures for arbitrary processes.

40|$|Abstract—The ever {{increasing}} complexity and heterogeneity of modern System-on-Chip designs demands {{validation of the}} system performance as early as possible. The on-chip bus architectures {{play an important role}} to meet the design performance. Today many heterogeneous on-chip bus architectures are defined to address the design exploration. In this paper we introduce an efficient modeling style of heterogeneous bus architectures at high levels of abstraction. We capture different bus architectures by using a generic, parameterizable bus model, which captures performance issues without significant loss of accuracy. Our modeling style is based on the SystemC language, a special channel library and <b>attached</b> <b>coding</b> style. The combination provides the ground layer for the efficient and fast simulation, which in turn enables the validation of the functionality and performance of the system at high abstraction levels.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel technique, termed <b>attached</b> shadow <b>coding,</b> for {{estimating}} surface normals from shadows when the reflectance and lighting conditions are unknown. Our key idea is encoding surface points via attached shadows observed under different light source directions and then estimating surface normals {{on the basis}} of the similarity of the <b>attached</b> shadow <b>codes.</b> Because shadows do not rely on reflectance properties, our method is applicable to sur-faces with various complex reflectances such as anisotropic and composite materials. Moreover, our method is robust against noise because it takes advantage of the combination of weak constraints imposed by a number of light sources. We theoretically show that the distance between the codes at two surface points is equal to the angle between the cor-responding surface normals under the assumption of uni-form lighting and a convex object. Our method embeds high-dimensional codes into a 3 D surface normal space so that the inter-code distances are preserved. Furthermore, we extend the method in order to alleviate the effects of nonuniform lighting and cast shadows. Experimental re-sults demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 1...|$|R

A number of techniques have been proposed to prevent or at least detect such attacks. The paper by Cowan et. al.

5000|$|Coding can {{be thought}} of as a means of {{reduction}} of data or data simplification. Using simple but broad analytic codes it is possible to reduce the data to a more manageable feat. In this stage of data analysis the analyst must focus on the identification of a more simple way of organizing data. using data reductionism researchers should include a process of indexing the data texts which could include: field notes, interview transcripts, or other documents. Data at this stage are reduced to classes or categories in which the researcher is able to identify segments of the data that share a common category or code. [...] Siedel and Kelle (1995) suggest three ways to aid with the process of data reduction and coding: (a) noticing relevant phenomena, (b) collecting examples of the phenomena, and (c) analyzing phenomena to find similarities, differences, patterns and overlying structures. This aspect of data collection is important because during this stage researchers should be <b>attaching</b> <b>codes</b> to the data to allow the researcher to think about the data in different ways.
