40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design of}} a {{variable}} width RAM (VaWiRAM) which will be extremely useful in building flexible memory systems. Principles of dynamic reconfigurability of programmable logic and programmable interconnect is incorporated into random access memories to achieve this flexibility. The chip can be reconfigured by setting a few configuration pins on the memory chip. A VaWiRAM reconfigurable between widths 1 and Wmax can be constructed with the extra cost of Wmax Î“ 1 pass gates, Wmax 2 2 to - 1 multiplexers, and dlog 2 [log 2 (k) + 1]e mode pins. The paper discusses the architecture of the proposed VaWiRAMs, and analyzes the trade-offs in their design.

40|$|A {{reconfigurable}} telemetry multiplexer {{is described}} {{which includes a}} monitor-terminal and a plurality of remote terminals. The remote terminals each include signal conditioning for a plurality of sensors for measuring parameters which are converted by an analog to digital converter. CPU's in the remote terminals store instructions for prompting system configuration and reconfiguration commands. The measurements, instructions, and the terminal's present configuration and status data are transmitted to the monitor-terminal and displayed. In response to menu-driven prompts generated and displayed at the monitor-terminal, data generation request commands, status and health commands, and the like are input at the monitor-terminal and transmitted to the remote terminals. The CPU in each remote terminal receives the various commands, stores them in electrically <b>alterable</b> <b>memory,</b> and reacts {{in accordance with the}} commands to reconfigure a plurality of aspects of the system. The CPU in each terminal also generates parameter measurements, status and health signals, and transmits these signals of the respective terminals to the monitor-terminal for low data rate operator viewing and to higher rate external transmission/monitor equipment. Reconfiguration may be in real time during the general period of parameter measurement acquisition, and may include alteration of the gain, automatic gain rescaling, bias, and or sampling rates associated with {{one or more of the}} parameter measurements made by the remote terminals...|$|E
5000|$|Electrically <b>alterable</b> {{read-only}} <b>memory</b> (EAROM) {{is a type}} of EEPROM {{that can}} be modified one bit at a time. Writing is a very slow process and again needs higher voltage (usually around 12 V) than is used for read access. EAROMs are intended for applications that require infrequent and only partial rewriting. EAROM may be used as non-volatile storage for critical system setup information; in many applications, EAROM has been supplanted by CMOS RAM supplied by mains power and backed-up with a lithium battery.|$|R
40|$|Electrically <b>alterable</b> {{read-only}} <b>memories</b> (EAROM's) or reprogrammable read-only memories (RPROM's) can be fabricated using a single-level metal-gate p-channel MOS {{technology with}} all conventional processing steps. Given the acronym DIFMOS for dual-injector floating-gate MOS, this technology utilizes the floating-gate technique for nonvolatile storage of data. Avalanche injection of hot electrons through gate oxide from a special injector diode in each bit {{is used to}} charge the floating gates. A second injector structure included in each bit permits discharge of the floating gate by avalanche injection of holes through gate oxide. The overall design of the DIFMOS bit is dictated by the physical considerations required {{for each of the}} avalanche injector types. The end result is a circuit technology which can provide fully decoded bit-erasable EAROM-type circuits using conventional manufacturing techniques...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A {{non-volatile}} electrically <b>alterable</b> read-only <b>memory</b> {{using an}} MOS {{field effect transistor}} with a threshold voltage which depended upon the position of ionic charges for its memory was fabricated. The conventional silicon dioxide layer {{was replaced by a}} composite layer consisting of thermal silicon dioxide, electron beam evaporated aluminum oxide, and pyrolytically deposited silicon dioxide which substantially reduced the migration rate of the ions. The rate of drift of the ions was found to be dependent upon the polarity of the electric field. The ions had greater mobility under a negative applied bias. It was also shown that for the same electric fields the activation energy was higher for negative electric fields, and that the activation energy decreases with increasing electric fields. The migration rate was also found to be an exponential function of applied electric field...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a technology for building electrically <b>alterable</b> read only <b>memories</b> (EAROMs) or reprogrammable read only memories (RPROMs) using a single level metal gate p channel MOS process with all conventional processing steps is outlined. Nonvolatile storage of data is achieved {{by the use of}} charged floating gate electrodes. The floating gates are charged by avalanche injection of hot electrodes through gate oxide, and discharged by avalanche injection of hot holes through gate oxide. Three extra diffusion and patterning steps are all that is required to convert a standard p channel MOS process into a nonvolatile memory process. For identification, this nonvolatile memory technology was given the descriptive acronym DIFMOS which stands for Dual Injector, Floating gate MOS...|$|R
