40|$|Shadows are {{of great}} {{importance}} to computer graphics, especially for interactive animation due to the visual cues which they provide. Most {{research in the field}} of dynamic shadowing has focussed on shadows from point <b>light</b> <b>sources,</b> since they are much easier to compute than those from <b>area</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> This means that such shadows have sharp boundaries, and so often appear to be unrealistic.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{computing}} soft shadows with area light sources has received considerable attention in computer graphics. In part, {{this is a}} difficult problem because the integral that defines the radiance at a point must take into account the visibility function. Most of the solutions proposed have been limited to polygonal environments, and require a full visibility determination preprocessing step. The result is typically a partitioning of the environment into regions that have a similar view of the light source. We propose a new approach that can be successfully applied to arbitrary environments. The approach is based on the observation that, in the presence of occluders, the primary difficulty in computing the integral that defines the contribution of an <b>area</b> <b>light</b> <b>source,</b> is that of determining the visible domain of the integrand. We extend a recent shadow algorithm for linear light sources in order to calculate a polygonal approximation to this visible domain. We demonstrate for an important class of shadowing problems, and in particular, for convex occluders, that the shape of the visible domain only needs to be roughly approximated by a polygonal boundary. We then use this boundary to subdivide an <b>area</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> into a small number of triangles that can be integrated efficiently using either a deterministic solution, or a low degree numerical cubature...|$|E
