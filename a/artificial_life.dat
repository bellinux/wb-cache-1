5|$|In {{computer}} science, {{simulations of}} evolution using evolutionary algorithms and <b>artificial</b> <b>life</b> {{started in the}} 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection. Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method {{as a result of}} the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s. He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland. Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.|$|E
5|$|The poet, {{of whose}} works I have {{undertaken}} the revision, may now begin {{to assume the}} dignity of an ancient, and claim the privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration. He has long outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many years been lost; and every topic of merriment, or motive of sorrow, which the modes of <b>artificial</b> <b>life</b> afforded him, now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity; but are read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or passion, they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners, and, as they devolved {{from one generation to}} another, have received new honours at every transmission.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{organize}} a reflection about the recent developing field of synthetic biology. It is structured into three main parts. The first one tries {{to point out the}} features of this emerging field (the analogies and the differences with the genetic engineering); the second one analyzes the terms and the concepts we can find in the fundamental article by Venter et al. (and in the recent article published by La Jolla Institute’s researchers); the third one delineates the principal outcomes of synthetic biology’s applications, in particular, for the formulation of the concept of life. Therefore it is proposed a connection between <b>artificial</b> <b>life’s</b> science and human enhancement. In fact I think it is possible to clarify human enhancement problem by a specific investigation of synthetic biology’s main characteristics...|$|R

25|$|If {{this were}} {{generally}} true, evolution would possess an active trend towards complexity.

40|$|Synthetic {{methods in}} science can aim at either instantiating a target {{phenomenon}} or simulating key mechanisms underlying that phenomenon; `strong¿ and `weak¿ approaches, respectively. While the former assumes a mature theory, the latter find its value in helping specify such theories. Here, {{we argue that}} artificial consciousness is best pursued as a (weak) means of theory development in consciousness science, {{and not as a}} (strong) axiom-driven project to build a conscious artefact. As with the other sciences of the <b>artificial</b> (intelligence, <b>life),</b> <b>artificial</b> consciousness can contribute by elaborating the possibilities and limitations of candidate mechanisms, transforming properties into mechanism-based criteria, and as a result potentially unifying apparently distinct properties via new mechanism-based concepts. We illustrate our arguments by discussing both axiom-driven and neurobiologically grounded approaches to artificial consciousness...|$|R
40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>Life’s</b> (AL) {{vocation}} is {{to contribute}} to a better scientific theory of life and of living organisms. I take AL to be guided by two principal motivations. 1. Building artificial living beings/objects as a proof for competing claims about different aspects of life and different levels of the living organization. This is the same motivation of artificial intelligence in regards to cognitive science. It is indeed an innovation in science, since physics relied principally on prediction for proof and validation. In these cases we also have validation by construction, quite a different matter. 2. Using the results of AL for practical and technological concerns. I think that the circulation between research and technological innovation is to a large extent what made this new wave of AL attractive. There is, again, a parallel to the AI of the early 60 s, where the technological loop was first established with expert systems and such. In the case of AL, applications to nanotechnology and robotics play a similar role, at least in the public an...|$|R

25|$|Though {{currently}} {{only known}} on Earth, life {{need not be}} restricted to it, and many scientists speculate {{in the existence of}} extraterrestrial life. <b>Artificial</b> <b>life</b> is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life. Death is the permanent termination of all biological functions which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life. Extinction is the process by which an entire group or taxon, normally a species, dies out. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, {{pioneering}} work {{on what is}} today known as <b>artificial</b> <b>life</b> {{was carried out by}} Nils Aall Barricelli using the very early computers. In the 1960s and early 1970s, evolutionary algorithms became widely recognized as optimization methods. Ingo Rechenberg and his group were able to solve complex engineering problems through evolution strategies as documented in his 1971 PhD thesis and the resulting 1973 book. John Holland was highly influential during the 1970s. The establishment of evolutionary algorithms in the scientific community allowed, by then, the first concrete steps to study the GP idea.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{breakthroughs}} in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated {{a cornucopia of}} data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were problematic. For example, the decision to append cognitive to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the computational and constructivist approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of simulated v. embodied cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of <b>artificial</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
25|$|As a {{means of}} {{understanding}} the world through speculation and storytelling, science fiction has antecedents which go back to an era when the dividing line separating the mythological from the historical tended to become somewhat blurred.
