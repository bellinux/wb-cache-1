5|$|In February 1953, Lympne {{was again}} {{waterlogged}} and Silver City Airways operated out of Southend and Blackbushe. The company {{stated that they}} were willing to purchase Lympne, but the decision of Folkestone Town Council was still awaited for. By May, Folkestone Town Council had decided not to purchase Lympne and Silver City Airways again expressed an interest in purchasing the airport <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> In November, it was announced that Air Kruise had been given permission to operate a scheduled service from Lympne and/or Ramsgate to Birmingham. The service was to be seasonal between April and September, with permission to run the service lasting until 1960. Air Kruise moved its operations to Ramsgate Airport in 1953.|$|E
25|$|It {{was from}} around 1770 that Arnold {{developed}} the portable precision timekeeper, {{almost from the}} point where John Harrison ended his work in this field. But, compared to Harrison's complicated and expensive watch, Arnold's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable. Importantly, the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Next {{came the}} 1984 Fiero. This {{was a major}} {{departure}} from anything Pontiac had produced in the past. A two-seat, mid-engined coupe, the Fiero was targeted straight at the same market that Semon Knudsen had been aiming for in the late 1950s: the young, affluent buyer who wanted sporting performance <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> The Fiero was also an instant success and was partially responsible for Pontiac seeing its first increase in sales in four years.|$|E

Mrs. Pendyce, cherishing {{a secret}} {{preference}} for champagne, drank sparingly of a Spanish burgundy, procured for her by Mr. Pendyce <b>at</b> <b>a</b> very <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> and corked between meals {{with a special}} cork.

25|$|The Macintosh {{initially}} sold well, but follow-up {{sales were}} not strong {{due to its}} high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed {{with the introduction of}} the LaserWriter, the first PostScript laser printer to be sold <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> and PageMaker, an early desktop publishing package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market. The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.|$|E
25|$|These first {{loudspeakers}} used electromagnets, because large, powerful {{permanent magnets}} were generally not available <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of {{connections to the}} driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a choke coil, filtering the power supply of the amplifier that the loudspeaker was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated {{by the action of}} passing through the choke coil. However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 Jensen introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight Alnico magnets after World War II.|$|E
25|$|The first {{production}} Short 360 had its {{maiden flight}} on 19 August 1982 and entered service with Suburban Airlines (later merged with Allegheny Airlines/US Airways) in November 1982. Building on {{the strengths and}} reputation of its 330 antecedent, the 360s found a niche in regional airline use worldwide, being able to operate comfortably from 4,500ft (1,400 m) runways â€“ opening up hundreds of airfields {{that would otherwise be}} inaccessible to airliners. With a cruise speed about 215mph (370km/h), at an altitude of 10,000ft (3,048 m), the unpressurized 360 was not the fastest turboprop in its market but it offered acceptable performance <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> combined with ease of service and maintainability. The PT6A turboprops are fully ICAO Stage 3 noise-compliant, making the 360 one of the quietest turboprop aircraft operating today. Production of the 360 ceased in 1991 after 165 deliveries. In 1998, approximately 110 360s were in service. In 2009 a retired Emerald Airlines 360 was bought by Kingsland Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent, for use as a mobile classroom.|$|E
50|$|One of the firm's {{policies}} was {{to acquire}} locations whenever property {{could be found}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> purchase <b>price.</b> In November 1925 approximately 2/3of its stores were leased, with the remainder owned by a subsidiary, the McCrory Realty Corporation. The retailer's gross sales approached $30,000,000 by the mid-1920s, when it operated 187 stores.|$|R

25|$|In 2010, the Frontier Nerds of NYU's ITP program {{published}} a thorough tutorial titled How To Hack Toy EEGs. The tutorial, which stirred {{the minds of}} many budding DIY BCI enthusiasts, demonstrated how to create a single channel at-home EEG with an Arduino and <b>a</b> Mattel Mindflex <b>at</b> <b>a</b> very <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> This tutorial amplified the DIY BCI movement.|$|R
25|$|A start {{was made}} in April on {{building}} the new depot at Carter Gate (Parliament Street), with accommodation for buses, trams and trolleybuses. Trams were given eight roads, all with pits, the capacity being 80 cars. A most complicated layout of track leading to the depot was put in at same time, the intention being to build a single line for one-way traffic inward to the Market Place along Lower Parliament Street and Hockley, via Victoria Street and South Parade, the outward route, also single line and one-way traffic via Long Row and Pelham Street to Hockley. Hockley was a narrow thoroughfare that had been widened towards its junction with Lower Parliament Street, but, owing to the Corporation being unable to obtain a property higher up the street <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> the whole scheme was later abandoned, although not before much track and pointwork had been laid. The double turnout {{at the bottom of}} Hockley had been in position for approximately six months when it was removed together with the short length of track leading to it, no car ever having run over it. Lines built in connection with the depot were along Southwell Road, with a three-way junction at Manvers Street, another three-way junction at Lower Parliament Street, and then along Lower Parliament Street to within 30 yards of Pennyfoot Street. There were trailing points from both lines into Stanhope Street, where the depot entrances were. A single line ran along Stanhope Street, with trailing junctions both ways into Manvers Street.|$|E
500|$|In December 1999, Next Generation {{rated the}} Dreamcast 4 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "If {{you want the}} most {{powerful}} system available now, showcasing the best graphics <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> this system is for you." [...] However, Next Generation rated the Dreamcast's future prognosis as 3 stars out of 5 in the same article, noting that Sony would ship a superior hardware product in the PlayStation 2 in the next year, and that Nintendo had said it {{would do the same}} with the GameCube. [...] At the beginning of 2000, Electronic Gaming Monthly had five reviewers score the Dreamcast 8.5, 8.5, 8.5, 8.0, and 9.0 out of 10 points. [...] By 2001, the reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Dreamcast scores of 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, and 9.5 out of 10. [...] BusinessWeek recognized the Dreamcast {{as one of the best}} products of 1999.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture and land tenancy, Beverley received additional revenue from land sales in western Virginia. The easing of restrictive land laws by the Virginia colonial government {{allowed him to}} establish his own terms with settlers on his lands, and he initially sold parcels in the Shenandoah Valley. On September 6, 1736, Beverley, John and Richard Randolph and John Robinson were deeded a land patent by Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet {{on behalf of the}} crown for a [...] tract at the headwaters of the South Fork Shenandoah River in present-day Augusta County. On September 16 the Randolphs and Robinson transferred sole ownership of the tract to Beverley, who planned to survey and sell it; the tract, which became known as Beverley Manor, encouraged further settlement west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. He commissioned James Patton, a ship captain from Ulster, to recruit Irish and Scotch-Irish immigrants to purchase and settle his Augusta County land. On August 8, 1737, Beverley wrote to Patton, [...] "I should be very glad if you could import families enough to take the whole off from our hands <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> and tho' the order mentions families from Pensilvania , yet families from Ireland will do as well". In 1738 he authorized John Lewis of northern Ireland, the father of Thomas Lewis, to show and sell his land in Augusta County and donated a lot in Staunton for the construction of the Augusta County Courthouse ten years later.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of the release of the MS2000, Korg was {{competing}} directly with synthesizers such as the Clavia Nord Lead and Roland's JP-8000 and JP-8080. While both of these VA machines were powerful in their own right, they were expensive. Korg had to make some sacrifices to be able to offer the much simpler MS2000 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> more <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> The most prominent limitation was the synthesizer's polyphony of only 4 voices.|$|R
60|$|When Mr. Petter became {{impressed}} {{with the belief that}} it would be a good thing for him to be an innkeeper, he also became {{impressed with}} the belief that the situation which the rich man had chosen for his country-home would be an admirable one for his purposes. He accordingly bought the property <b>at</b> <b>a</b> very <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> and on the stone foundations of the house which had been burned he built his inn.|$|R

2500|$|Epic Games {{initially}} {{said that}} four new maps {{would be released}} {{in conjunction with the}} third patch. However, due to disagreements between Microsoft and Epic Games, Epic decided instead to [...] "put these maps on sale <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> then make them free a few months later," [...] according to Mark Rein of Epic Games. The map pack, titled [...] "Hidden Fronts", was released on Xbox Live Marketplace on May 3, 2007, and included the maps Bullet Marsh, Garden, Process, and Subway. Free downloads of these maps were made available on September 3, 2007, four months after their initial release.|$|E

The pictures were all produced in due time, and were sent to a fixed address, where a gentleman in a hansom used to call for them at regular intervals. Arthur Berkeley kept those poor little water-colours long afterwards locked up in a certain drawer all by themselves: they were sacred mementoes to him of that old hopeless love for the little Miss Butterfly of his Oxford days.|$|E
