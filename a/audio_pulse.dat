Selcal (selective calling) controller, as {{intermediate}} equipment between selcal and radio station, {{is designed to}} achieve the software automation and remote control in aviation. The whole system adopts msp- 430 microcontroller as hardware core and C language as the method of software realization. This paper focuses on hardware connection and design to introduce the electrical design and software flow of selcal controller.. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE Selcal, also know as ground-air selective calling device, {{has been used by}} land station for selective calling of aircraft. Each aircraft has a unique selective calling code, when the selective calling device calls an aircraft, the selective call code, which consists of two connected <b>audio</b> <b>pulse,</b> shall be entered firstly. Two single tones that transmitted simultaneously are contained in each pulse. Selcal code will be transmitted by the shortwave radio station when the CALL push-button is pressed. When this code is received by the appropriate aircraft, the communication between radio station and aircraft is established. Therefore voice transmission connection between the ground and the aircraft can be achieved by using a handle. Fig. 1 Conventional model of selective calling syste...|$|E

Depending on its design, it will either passively listen to its environment, depending only on the noise that is made by passing ships or actively send out <b>audio</b> <b>pulses,</b> not unlike a sonar, listening to the lapse in time in which the echo returns to it.|$|R
5000|$|A sudden {{total failure}} in the {{generation}} of the <b>audio</b> <b>pulses</b> that constitute the pips was experienced on 31 May 2011 and silence was unexpectedly broadcast {{in place of the}} 17:00 signal. The problem was traced to the power supply of the equipment which converts the signal from the atomic clocks into an audible signal. Whilst repairs were underway the BBC elected to broadcast a [...] "dignified silence" [...] in place of the pips at 19:00. By 19:45 the same day the power supply was repaired and the 20:00 pips were broadcast as normal.|$|R
5000|$|The Bose Companion 5 {{speaker system}} is a 2.1 system that {{contains}} an inbuilt sound card, therefore connection is via USB connector {{and it does not}} require the computer to have a sound card. Virtual surround sound emulation is included (termed [...] "TrueSpace Surround" [...] by Bose). The Companion 5 system also works with Linux kernels that support USB <b>audio</b> including <b>Pulse</b> <b>Audio.</b> The control pod features a minijack (3.5mm) input, so that the speakers can play sound from the computer and an external device simultaneously, however the relative levels of the sources cannot be adjusted. The only tone control is adjustment of the subwoofer level (labelled [...] "bass compensation").|$|R

500|$|Townshend {{had been}} reading Universal Sufism founder Inayat Khan's The Mysticism of Sound and Music, which {{referred}} to spiritual harmony and the universal chord, which would restore harmony to humanity when sounded. Townshend realised that the newly emerging synthesizers {{would allow him to}} communicate these ideas to a mass audience. He had met the BBC Radiophonic Workshop which gave him ideas for capturing human personality within music. Townshend interviewed several people with general practitioner-style questions, and captured their heartbeat, brainwaves and astrological charts, converting the result into a series of <b>audio</b> <b>pulses.</b> For the demo of [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", he linked a Lowrey organ into an EMS VCS 3 filter that played back the pulse-coded modulations from his experiments. He subsequently upgraded to an ARP 2500. The synthesizer did not play any sounds directly as it was monophonic; instead it modified the block chords on the organ as an input signal. The demo was completed by Townshend overdubbing drums, bass, electric guitar, vocals and handclaps. Overall, the song ran at a slower pace to the version later recorded by the Who.|$|R
50|$|A mercury {{delay line}} {{consisted}} of a long tube filled with mercury, a mechanical transducer on one end, and a microphone on the other end, much like a spring reverb unit later used in <b>audio</b> processing. <b>Pulses</b> were sent into the mercury delay line at one end, and took {{a certain amount of}} time to reach the other end. They were detected by the microphone, amplified, reshaped into the correct pulse shape, and sent back into the delay line. Thus, the memory was said to recirculate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the {{automatic}} identification of bird species from their audio recorded song. Bird monitoring is important to perform several tasks, such as to evaluate the quality of their living environment or to monitor dangerous situations to planes caused by birds near airports. We deal with the bird species identification problem using signal processing and machine learning techniques. First, features are extracted from the bird recorded songs using specific audio treatment; next the problem is performed according to a classical machine learning scenario, where a labeled database of previously known bird songs are employed to create a decision procedure that is used to predict the species of a new bird song. Experiments are conducted in a dataset of recorded songs of bird species which appear in a specific region. The experimental results compare the performance obtained in different situations, encompassing the complete audio signals, as recorded in the field, and short <b>audio</b> segments (<b>pulses)</b> obtained from the signals by a split procedure. The influence of the number of classes (bird species) in the identification accuracy is also evaluated.

40|$|Semi-autonomous {{vehicles}} occasionally require {{control to}} be handed over to the driver in situations where the vehicle is unable to operate safely. Currently, such handover requests require the driver to take control almost instantaneously. We investigate how auditory pre-alerts that occur well before the handover request impact the success of the handover in a dual task scenario. In a study with a driving simulator, drivers perform tasks on their phone while the car is in an autonomous mode. They receive a repeated burst audio pre-alert or an increasing <b>pulse</b> <b>audio</b> pre-alert preceding the standard warning for immediate handover. Results show that pre-alerts caused people to look more at the road before the handover occurred, and to disengage from the secondary task earlier, compared to when there was no pre-alert. This resulted in safer handover situations. Increasing pulse pre-alerts show particular promise due to their communication of urgency. Our detailed analysis informs the design and evaluation of alerts in safety-critical systems with automation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 In recent years, studies {{indicate}} that the second formant of normal speech contains {{the majority of the}} information necessary for speech intelligibility. This thesis presents a system to translate the second formant frequencies to within a more adequate hearing range of the partially deaf. The digital speech translator, DISTRAN, utilizes pulse amplitude modulation of an input <b>audio</b> signal. The <b>pulse</b> amplitude modulated signal is gated into a series of storage circuits in synchronism with a first digital signal whose frequency constitutes the desired sample rate. The contents of the storage circuits are then sequentially read out at a second, altered frequency so as to construct a second pulse amplitude modulated signal whose basic frequency is altered from that of the first. Redundant segments of speech are discarded or added so that the time interval of the processed speech is that of the original. The second pulse amplitude modulated signal is then demodulated, which converts the second pulse amplitude modulated signal into an output audio signal, altered in frequency from the input...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that metallic vacuum chambers might be suitable for pulsed magnets operating at <b>audio</b> frequencies, with <b>pulse</b> widths nominally 1 / 360 sec. In the present note calculations are given for a simple model of such a system, in order to estimate the effects of field attenuation and eddy current losses. The results of the calculation may be summarized briefly as follows, where the results apply to a cylindrical chamber of non-maeyletic stainless steel, 3. 0 cm in inside diameter and 0. 15 an wall thickness: (1) With steady-state harmonic excitation, the field in the interior Is reduced by a factor of {approximately} 1. 03 at 2, 000 cps compared to dc; (2) With transient operation, the exponential decay time is about 0. 021 millisecond; (3) With square-wave excitation, at 200 gauss and 180 pps, the power dissipation in the stainless steel is about 24 watts/foot, or about a factor of 20 less if half-sine-wave pulses are used instead of square pulses. These results seem encouraging enough to warrant experimental investigation of this type of vacuum chamber for pulsed steering...|$|R
