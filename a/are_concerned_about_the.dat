5|$|They soon {{learn that}} the king of Pedda and Roget's {{childhood}} friend, Inath, has been driven mad and is launching Operation Psi {{with the aim of}} taking over the world. Roget and Yerchael journey to the other nations in order to help stop the Peddan army. They join forces with the rulers and warriors of several countries, including the defeated Amazons of Laurent, the rebels of Nevarla, which has allied itself with Pedda, and the warriors of Valsena and Altena. As they fight the Peddan army, they discover that Inath is installing Black Mirrors in the conquered kingdoms, which are corrupting those around them. Roget and Yurchael are joined in their quest by the elemental spirits, which <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mirrors. After confronting Roget's twin brother, the Mirage Bishop, they discover that Inath and the Mirage Bishop have been corrupted by the ancient witch Anise, who is planting the mirrors in order to summon a dark energy for her own power.|$|E

25|$|The {{sculpture}} will {{be located}} on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail at {{the northeast corner of}} Delaware and Washington streets, near the City-County Building.

25|$|Ultimately, the {{cultural}} gap matters {{only if it}} endangers civilian {{control of the military}} or if it reduces the ability of the country to maintain an effective military force. Those who concentrate {{on the nature of the}} gap tend not to be concerned about dangerous trends. However, those who <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lack of understanding between the civilian and military worlds are uniformly convinced that the civil-military relationship in the United States is unhealthy. Specifically, they have voiced concerns about a military that may become openly contemptuous of civilian norms and values and may then feel free to openly question the value of defending such a society. Others worry whether an inexperienced civilian government will undermine the military by ineffective or inappropriate policies, thus threatening U.S. national security.|$|E
500|$|One demonstrator, immuno-oncologist and filmmaker Tyler Hulett, {{documented}} the march {{and created the}} 8-mintute film, A Scientist Documents the March for Science. The film features people [...] "whose lives and careers intersect with science and research", including a woman who believes funding for her cancer research work is being threatened, a couple who is worried about reduced Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funding, and a woman concerned about Portland's unfluoridated water. Hulett wanted to raise awareness about {{the people involved in}} scientific research, and said his goal was to [...] "show that many of Portland's doctors and scientists <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lack of critical thinking coming {{from both sides of the}} political aisle".|$|E
500|$|While Sam and Bruno <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{loyalty of}} a {{powerful}} California union official (Sandoval), Toby and Josh are preparing {{for a meeting with}} the congressional opposition to re-negotiate the estate tax—or the [...] "death tax" [...] as the Republicans have labeled it—but are then surprised by a last-minute cancellation. It soon becomes clear that the Republicans are planning to repeal the estate tax altogether, and might have the votes to do so. An attempt to win over the black caucus, led by Congressman Mark Richardson (Barry), fails. At a loss over what to do, an initiative comes from unexpected quarters. The previously over-cautious political strategist, Doug Wegland, suggests the president responds by doing something he has never done before: veto the bill.|$|E

500|$|While the U.S. Department of Energy {{continues}} {{to monitor and}} collect samples from the Central Operable Unit, a some groups and citizens remain concerned about the extent and long-term public health consequences of the contamination.

Activist groups <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> potential risks posed by residual contamination, which exists on-Site. However, the Comprehensive Risk Assessment for the site found the post-cleanup risks posed by the site to be very low and within EPA guidelines. A 1998 independent study by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on cancer rates in communities surrounding Rocky Flats also found no pattern of increased cancers tied to Rocky Flats. In 2016, this study was updated with 25 years of additional cancer data; the data supported the same conclusion.|$|E
500|$|... "Public Relations" [...] is {{the season}} premiere of the fourth season of the American {{television}} drama series Mad Men, and the 40th overall episode of the series. It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner, and directed by Phil Abraham. It originally aired on AMC in the United States on July 25, 2010. The episode takes place in November 1964, as the advertisement agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce has just started up, and Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is struggling with his divorce. The agency partners <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> narrow breadth of their client base, which is not helped by Don coming across as less than sympathetic {{in an interview with}} a trade magazine. Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) attempts a viral marketing stunt to bring back a disgruntled client, with unexpected repercussions. Meanwhile, Don's ex-wife Betty (January Jones) is struggling to fit in with her new family, and Don encounters problems in his romantic life.|$|E
500|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act in 2001, a 300ft strip on {{the eastern edge of the}} refuge was allocated to Jefferson County for construction of the Jefferson County Parkway. [...] In May 2008, the Jefferson Parkway Public Highway Authority was established to complete this last portion of the Denver metro beltway. [...] Opponents of the parkway <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> disruption of plutonium laden soil from excavation of the area to build the parkway. [...] In April 2015, the WestConnect Corridor Coalition was formed with the hopes of bringing about the end of a decades long dispute to the completion of the Jefferson County Parkway. [...] However, by October 2015, the WestConnect Corridor had withdrawn its support from the parkway, determining that the decision to build the parkway should be made outside of the coalition's process. [...] As of 2015, the Jefferson Parkway Public Authority was still searching for private and public funding to complete the beltway.|$|E
