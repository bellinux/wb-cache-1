5000|$|On 23 November, {{during a}} coffee meeting with {{reporters at the}} sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, President Aquino said that the {{statistics}} presented to him do not necessarily add up {{to the possibility that}} an extortion racket exists inside NAIA. He said that the controversy on the supposed [...] "laglag bala" [...] extortion racket in airports had been [...] "sensationalized" [...] and used by certain groups to put his administration in a bad light. He expressed sympathy toward [...] "innocent airport employees" [...] who have been affected by the controversy. However, in another GMA News Online report posted the following day and culled from an exclusive report by Jun Veneracion on GMA News' early evening newscast 24 Oras, a memo from the Office for Transportation Security (OTS) dated show of 3 June 2015 that the OTS has a cash reward policy for finding contraband items such as weapons and explosives at security checkpoints, providing for rewards of up to ₱1,000 for explosives, weapons, [...] "stunning devices" [...] and dangerous drugs found by OTS personnel or Security Screening Officers (SSOs). Transport Security Risk Management Bureau <b>assistant</b> <b>administrative</b> director Roberto Almadin confirmed the existence of the memo, but he said only two to three people have been given rewards. He also asked the public to disassociate the memo from the [...] "laglag-bala" [...] extortion scheme. The memo, signed by OTS administrator Roland Recomono, also stated that the rewards were instituted [...] "to boost the welfare and morale of OTS personnel". A later memo dated 8 July had a revision of the category list, indicating that OTS personnel could claim rewards for a single piece of explosive and for every five pieces of ammunition found per month. Spocky Farolan, the legal counsel of an overseas Filipino worker who almost lost her job due to the alleged scheme, said the memo's lack of publicity could make the public more suspicious of the agency.|$|E
