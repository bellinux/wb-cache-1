In this sequel paper, {{the effects of}} annealing the same cold-drawn wire on microstructure and mechanical properties are examined. Specifically, segments of the <b>wire</b> were <b>annealed</b> for 1 h at 973 K, 1023 K, 1073 K, 1123 K and 1173 K in a vacuum furnace. The resulting microstructure was characterized by SEM, EBSD and TEM and compared to the asdrawn microstructure. In-situ heating in the TEM of MP 35 N ribbon in a similarly cold worked condition enabled corroboration of microstructure evolution during <b>annealing.</b> <b>Annealed</b> <b>wires</b> were tested monotonically and cyclically in uniaxial tension at room temperature, the latter using a stress ratio (R) of 0. 3. In addition, the <b>annealed</b> <b>wires</b> were tested cyclically at R= - 1 using the rotating beam bending fatigue test. Post-deformation structures and fracture surfaces were characterized using TEM and SEM respectively. Annealing the cold drawn wire results in recrystallization and grain growth; the extent {{is dependent on the}} annealing temperature. Deformation twin boundaries in the as-drawn structure illustrate faceted bulging and eventually complete elimination, the microstructure evolving into fine equiaxed grains containing coarser annealing twins with no significant change in texture. Yield strength decreases rapidly with recrystallization to almost half the value of the as-drawn condition, but is accompanied by an increase in modulus (by similar to 25 %) and tensile elongation reaching 30 %. Cyclic response by the way of S-N curves is not enhanced by annealing on an absolute stress scale (due to the loss in yield strength) although the <b>annealed</b> <b>wires</b> are cyclically superior when the stress data are normalized by yield stress.

Experimental results indicate that both as-cast and SPCJA-ed wires exhibit typical amorphous feature.

Instead of the isotropic von Mises yield criterion, a texture-based anisotropic yield locus was incorporated into the model to simulate the wire drawing process and calculate residual stresses. Next, X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out at the surface of the wire to obtain the distribution of the lattice spacing versus sin(2) psi, from which the macroscopic residual stresses at the wire surface were calculated.

The quality of spheroidizing <b>annealed</b> <b>wire</b> affects the forming quality of screws. In the fastener industry, most companies use a subcritical process for spheroidized annealing.

The effects of the spheroidized annealing parameters affect the quality characteristics of steel wire, such as the tensile strength and hardness.

Experimental {{results show that the}} ambient temperature has a significant influence on the thermal {{stability of}} GMI effect, it is caused by external conditions: driving frequency, magnetic field and sample states. The thermal stability and GMI fluctuating variation at different temperature of three-type wires could be quantificationally characterized by GMImax ratio variation difference Δ[ΔZ/Zmax]Tmax of three-type wires, and drastically improved with the driving frequency increasing to 10 MHz, and the working range of magnetic field for possible sensor applications should be below 10 Oe.
