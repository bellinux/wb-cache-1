The PCG began an alternative radio program and magazine, and {{over the next several years}} a few thousand WCG members left to join the PCG. Despite this, Tkach continued to implement additional changes in thinking including: the shift in emphasis away from observing world events primarily through the lens of prophetic interpretation; the removal of the prohibition of interracial marriage; the allowance of work on the Sabbath; the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trinitarian doctrine; and the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> validity of other Christian denominations, among many other changes.
