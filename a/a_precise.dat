5|$|<b>A</b> <b>precise</b> {{value for}} the {{rotation}} period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, Cassini found that the radio rotation period of Saturn had increased appreciably, to approximately 10hr 45min 45sec (±36sec). The latest estimate of Saturn's rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the Cassini, Voyager and Pioneer probes was reported in September 2007 is 10hr 32min 35sec.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} to construct all the circles that intersect three given circles at <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a special {{case in which the}} crossing angle is zero for all three given circles. Another generalization is the dual of the first extension, namely, to construct circles with three specified tangential distances from the three given circles.|$|E

5|$|As of May 2008, a {{film version}} of the comic is in the {{scripting}} stage, with Brian K. Vaughan writing and Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios President of Production, producing.

5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are {{the centerpiece}} of general relativity. They provide <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> formulation {{of the relationship between}} spacetime geometry and the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using the concepts of Riemannian geometry, in which the geometric properties of a space (or a spacetime) are described by a quantity called a metric. The metric encodes the information needed to compute the fundamental geometric notions of distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).|$|E
5|$|Major land runs, {{including}} the Land Run of 1889, were held for settlers where certain territories were opened to settlement starting at <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> time. Usually land {{was open to}} settlers on a first come first served basis. Those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the territory before the official opening time {{were said to have}} been crossing the border sooner, leading to the term sooners, which eventually became the state's official nickname.|$|E

5|$|Placement of the implant: The implant screw {{is placed}} {{and can be}} self-tapping, {{otherwise}} the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog. It is then screwed into place with a torque controlled wrench at <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> torque {{so as not to}} overload the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can die, a condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of the implant to fully integrate or bond with the jawbone).|$|E
5|$|Team World and Team North America {{began the}} event with women's team play. Mirjam Ott and Allison Pottinger played a high-scoring game which {{resulted}} in a win for Ott, and Eve Muirhead scored an early lead over Heather Nedohin and held it to win another point for Team World. Jennifer Jones made <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> draw to tie her game with Margaretha Sigfridsson and secured a half-point for Team North America, averting a sweep by Team World.|$|E

5|$|The {{first step}} was <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> {{characterization}} of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the conic constant of the mirror as built was , instead of the intended −1.00230. The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, {{as well as by}} analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is filled}} {{with a variety of}} puzzles that must be solved to advance the story. These include memory games and mazes. Others involve {{competing}} against a computer-controlled opponent, completing a sequence in a limited number of moves, operating mechanisms, or using an inventory item. Puzzles do not all have to be completed in <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> order; there is some flexibility in terms of being able to move through game areas and work on different challenges.|$|E
5|$|The homological mirror {{symmetry}} conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich {{states that}} the derived category of coherent sheaves on one Calabi–Yau manifold is equivalent {{in a certain sense}} to the Fukaya category of its mirror. This equivalence provides <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry in topological string theory. In addition, it provides an unexpected bridge between two branches of geometry, namely complex and symplectic geometry.|$|E

5|$|The key {{difference}} between QA technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns {{a list of}} documents, ranked in order of relevance to the query (often based on popularity and page ranking), while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language, seeks to understand it in much greater detail, and returns <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> answer to the question.|$|E
5|$|The monochord {{served as}} <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> {{measure of the}} notes of a musical scale, {{allowing}} more accurate musical arrangements. Mechanical hurdy-gurdies allowed single musicians to play more complicated arrangements than a fiddle would; both were prominent folk instruments in the Middle Ages. Southern Europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended to the sides, unlike the rear-facing pegs of Central and Northern European instruments. Idiophones such as bells and clappers served various practical purposes, such as warning of the approach of a leper.|$|E
5|$|The {{puzzle of}} how {{embryonic}} development was controlled {{began to be}} solved using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. The step-by-step control of its embryogenesis was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green fluorescent protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>precise</b> {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>precise</b> search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|Adherents of Heathenry can {{be found}} in Europe, North America, and Australasia. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic {{cultural}} inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated {{that it was impossible to}} develop <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self-selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally. She noted that, while there were some exceptions, most Heathen groups were 60–70% male in their composition.|$|E
