50|$|The last 351 Super Olympians (3ASV142-492), {{including}} 21 {{which were}} fitted with Australian Volgren CR223LD bodywork, entered service in 2001/02. All of these buses had their chassis built in Poland. Their D10A285 engines were built to meet Euro III emission standards and had aluminium <b>alloy</b> <b>front</b> wheels supplied by Alcoa. 3ASV297 was coated with special metallic paint, which shows different colours (mainly green and purple), {{depending on the}} angle of light reflection.|$|E

50|$|By 1962 {{there were}} eleven {{models in the}} Greeves range. The offroad {{motorcycles}} were also developed through an association with Queen's University Belfast producing the later Greeves QUB model. The last of the Challenger models was produced in 1968, replaced by the 250 and 380 cc Griffon motocrossers in 1969. The original leading link fork was no longer fitted, having been replaced by standard telescopic forks as the leading link design could not match the travel of forks. Also abandoned was the original cast <b>alloy</b> <b>front</b> down beam, replaced with a new frame of Reynolds 531 chrome molybdenum with a conventional down tube.|$|E
5000|$|Six {{months into}} its release a [...] {{turbocharged}} RB30ET {{version of the}} Nissan engine was released. The Garrett turbo unit was fitted inside a water-cooled housing to ensure longevity. The engine received new pistons which lowered the compression ratio, while an updated camshaft was used to reduce overlap. The allure of the Commodore was quickly established particularly when the top speed was 200 km/h and then extended to 220 km/h {{with the addition of}} the Garrett turbocharger. In addition stopping power for the turbo models was upgraded to larger brakes and Girlock finned <b>alloy</b> <b>front</b> calipers. The Australian Police commissioned the turbocharged models as their [...] "interceptor" [...] Highway Pursuit cars of choice. These interceptors were denoted by [...] "BT1" [...] in the model code on the Body & Option plate attached to the firewall.|$|E
5000|$|The bicycle {{shown in}} three of the photos was one of 5, 22” frames made for the Burlington Police Department, with the Sachs 7-speed <b>alloy</b> <b>front</b> and rear hubs with dual drum brakes. Only one of these {{bicycles}} was known to have made it to the BPD for testing, the rest were lost, or unaccounted for after the company went out of business. The additional Purple bicycle is a three-speed in its original Commuter Cruiser guise with White Wall tires and sprung seat. The Chicago bicycle was unfortunately ahead of its time,as many people were unwilling to spend more than $200 for what was perceived as a beach cruiser. The Chicago bicycle was much more than that, intended to become a tool to be used to get someone to work, or go for a nice ride on weekends on a trouble-free bicycle.|$|E
50|$|Cosmetically, all Series II VT models {{received}} slightly revised wheel {{covers and}} <b>alloys,</b> <b>front</b> grilles (silver accents {{on the base}} models and thicker horizontal chrome bars on Berlina and Calais) as well as clear side and rear indicator lenses (as fitted on the 1997-1999 VT Calais) instead of the previous amber. The updated Calais now also featured a chrome strip across the boot garnish above the number plate, to distinguish it from the lower model variants.|$|R

Internationals are appointed with launch VE Calais V <b>alloy</b> wheels, <b>front</b> foglamps, a six-disc CD changer, leather upholstered trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist. Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in sedan and Sportwagon body styles, the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission option {{was available for}} the sedan only. Extra features include 18-inch <b>alloy</b> wheels, Berlina <b>front</b> grille, leather seat trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the sedan (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|R
50|$|The overall {{profile and}} {{architecture}} of the CA changed little during the vehicle's seventeen-year life. There were, however, three distinctly different versions sold. The first CAs featured a two-piece windscreen, comprising two separate flat sheets of glass separated with a central vertical metal divide. As curved screen glass became available in the UK at an acceptable price, the two piece windscreen was replaced with a single slightly curved windscreen in approximately 1958. At {{the same time the}} painted front grille of the original, which had featured a central split reflecting the split windscreen, was replaced by a smaller unsplit front grille, still painted in the van's body colour. The third version of the Bedford CA, sold from late 1964, featured a much deeper windscreen and side windows, and a corresponding reduction in the height of the painted metal scuttle panel directly below the windscreen. The 1964 vans also reflected general trends in car design of the time in featuring, for the first time, a pressed aluminium <b>alloy</b> <b>front</b> grille. The longer wheelbase version had the body lengthened by an additional short roof panel, with wider doors.|$|E
50|$|The three {{cylinder}} {{two-stroke engine}} used a Drehschieber ("rotary valve", a turning disk, with intake holes for exact {{timing of the}} fuel-air mixture intake). The fuel-air mixture was sucked in by the vacuum in the three crankshaft housings as usual. The Drehschieber does the intake timing for all three cylinders. The engine was not a radial engine associated with aircraft {{and there was no}} need for a flywheel. All three cranks worked on one common gear. This arrangement and the recoil of the pistons in the turning direction secured a perfect balance of the moving parts. The cylinders were made of KS (Kolbenschmidt) iron cylinder walls and were embedded in the Silumin alloy engine housing. The only things that could be visibly identified as engine parts were the alloy cylinder heads with multiple cooling fins and the exhaust pipes located between the spokes of the cast <b>alloy</b> <b>front</b> wheel. These flat spokes were designed to serve as a functional cooling fan. The two-speed transmission was built as a differential transmission and used slope-meshed gears. The clutch was made of conventional clutch disks. The clutch (with the springs at the outer circle) was located in front of the transmission. The transmission was actuated by foot-operated steel cables. All parts of the engine allowed easy access for service work. After the removal of the engine - only two bolts and some wiring had to be removed - all important parts were within reach.|$|E
40|$|Lead-free {{piezoelectric}} ceramic rings (Na 0. 475 K 0. 475 Li 0. 05) (Nb 0. 92 Ta 0. 05 Sb 0. 03) O 3 added with 0. 4 wt% CeO 2 and 0. 4 wt% MnO 2 {{have been successfully}} prepared and used as the driving elements of the ultrasonic wirebonding transducers with titanium <b>alloy</b> <b>front</b> and back plates. The transducer operates at similar frequency of the commercial lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers (∼ 65 kHz). Because of the better matching of the acoustic impedances between the ceramic and titanium alloy, an effective transfer of vibration energy is achieved in the transducer, leading to a large axial vibration (1. 73 μm at 0. 1 W). Moreover, the transducer exhibits a small lateral vibration (0. 05 μm at 0. 1 W), which is essential for producing a small or narrow bond. The transducer has successfully bonded the aluminum wire on the standard die and gold-plated PCB. The bonds are of good quality, having a smaller deformation ratio (as compared to the commercial PZT transducer) and high bond strength (exceeding the industrial requirement). These clearly show that the lead-free {{piezoelectric ceramic}} is a promising candidate for replacing the lead-based ceramics as a driving element in the future generation of wire bonders.
