25|$|Footage of Atkins and Jones in {{the vehicle}} with Nesbitt were {{captured}} on the ATM's CCTV camera, which was {{of the two men}} with Nesbitt in the middle and leaning across Jones to withdraw money, and further forensic evidence implicating the two were found in Nesbitt's <b>abandoned</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The two suspects were quickly tracked down and arrested. In custody, each man claimed that the other had pulled the trigger. Atkins's version of the events, however, was found to contain a number of inconsistencies. Doubts concerning Atkins's testimony were strengthened when a cell-mate claimed that Atkins had confessed to him that he had shot Nesbitt. A deal of life imprisonment was negotiated with Jones in return for his full testimony against Atkins. The jury decided that Jones's version of events was the more coherent and credible, and convicted Atkins of capital murder.|$|E
25|$|Around noon on July 23, 1968, a {{call was}} made to the Cleveland Police {{reporting}} an <b>abandoned</b> <b>vehicle</b> on Beulah Avenue between E. 123rd Street and Lakeview Road. The location was just a block north of Evans' home (at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview). The vehicle was ticketed at 1:25 PM, but a tow truck did not arrive until dusk. It parked {{on the north side}} of Beulah Avenue near the intersection with Lakeview Road. According to tow truck worker William McMillan, the truck backed up to the abandoned car, and then McMillan got out. He was checking the license plate of the automobile a few moments later when a man with a shotgun standing at the corner of Beulah and Auburndale shot him in the back. An official chronology later placed the attack on McMillan at 8:25 PM. Another man hiding in the bushes near the front of the truck fired, and shot McMillan in the side. McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help at 8:28 PM. According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded to know if he was stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons. He ran toward and then north up E. 123rd Street, and Evans shot him in the right side. An African American woman on E. 123rd Street gave refuge to McMillan.|$|E

500|$|Given the {{high-profile}} of the case, the police received several tips from citizens. Police theorized that Fischer {{was killed by}} a drug gang that had mistaken him for someone else. They questioned a man alleged to be the intended victim, but the rumors turned out to be false. They also investigated an <b>abandoned</b> <b>vehicle</b> near the U.S.-Mexico border they suspected was used in the shooting. The car was reported stolen in South Padre Island, but detectives determined that it was not the vehicle the murderers used. The police continued to pursue the lead from the bail office in McKinney. They called the office and asked for recent bail applications from South Texas locations. The office gave them Cuellar's full name, his Dallas address, and faxed a copy of the application. Investigators noticed that the man's handwriting, specifically how the [...] "4" [...] was written, matched the handwriting on the yellow business card found at the murder scene.|$|E
