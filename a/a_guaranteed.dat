In 1888, frustrated by the regular cancellation of Villa's matches, McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England's leading clubs, which {{led to the formation of}} the Football League, giving member clubs <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> fixture list each season.

This distinction between indemnity and guarantee was discussed as early as the eighteenth century in Birkmya v Darnell. In that case, concerned with <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of payment for goods rather than payment of rent, the presiding judge explained that <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> effectively says [...] "Let him have the goods; if he does not pay you, I will." ...|$|R

The team proceeded with the project with the backing of Paramount. Roddenberry began putting together a production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on the original series, including Robert H. Justman, David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis. Justman proposed three ideas to the others on October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. One idea discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected.|$|E

Cain earned a $5 million signing bonus, and earned $20 million each season from 2013–17. His $21 million option for 2018 would vest automatically {{if he was not}} on the disabled list to an elbow or shoulder injury in 2017 and if he reached 400 innings in 2016 and 2017 combined. If the option failed to vest, the Giants could either pick up the $21 million option or pay a $7.5 million buyout. Cain was scheduled to become a free agent after the 2012 season.|$|E

Taylor was hired away from the International Professional Hockey League (IHL) for the 1908 season for a $1000 salary and <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> federal civil service job. He was an immediate sensation and earned a new nickname of 'Cyclone' for his fast skating and end-to-end rushes, the nickname attributed to the Canadian governor-general Earl Grey.

In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition.

Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men were impressed with each other, but each felt the other should make the next move.

Mayberry {{entered the}} season {{a member of}} the Phillies bench who some writers thought was not worth his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was {{successful}} early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would have value in a potential trade, as the Phillies were not expected to make the playoffs, and thus might prefer to get a prospect for future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that the}} Phillies used him in an appropriate role, rather than trying to utilize him every day.|$|E

History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than the asking price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> source of income to the artist.

5|$|In the {{opinions}} then current at the Royal Academy and among critics, {{the most prestigious}} form of painting was considered history painting, in which an artwork illustrated a story. It was thought that such works enabled British artists to show themselves as equal or even superior to those European artists active at the time, {{as well as to}} the Old Masters. Other forms of painting such as portraiture and landscapes were considered lesser styles, as they did not give the artist as much opportunity to illustrate a story but instead were simply depictions of reality. Nonetheless, even the most eminent artists would often devote time to portrait painting, as portraits were generally commissioned by the subjects or their families, providing <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> source of income to the artist; two of the first three presidents of the Royal Academy (Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence) had made their names as portrait painters. Owing to a lack of patrons willing to commission history paintings, by the early 19th century history painting in England was in serious decline.|$|E

40|$|The {{provisions}} of Art. 50 point 2 and Art. 52 para. 1 of the Act of 2 July 2004 on {{the freedom of}} economic activity refer to the “guarantee of proper performance of activity under concession” without determining, however, what such guarantee should really contain. This paper {{is an attempt to}} establish the meaning of the above term and this will be made based on other acts regulating activities under concession. It will also determine whether the provision of <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of proper performance of an activity under concession is identical with the satisfaction of the requirements needed to be fulfi lled in order to obtain a concession. Consequently, an analysis of the {{provisions of}} different acts regulating specifi c matters determining the conditions necessary to be met in order to conduct an economic activity has been made, including the provisions of other acts in which a concept of a “guarantee of proper performance of economic activity” has been used. The above analysis allows to draw a conclusion that the granting of <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of proper performance of activity under concession cannot be treated as satisfying the requirements of conducting economic activity, otherwise each entrepreneur satisfying the requirements of needed to conduct economic activity would be regarded as also giving <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of proper performance. What is more, giving <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of proper performance does not apply to activities under concession only. However, guarantees of proper performance in other types of economic activity are rare. Giving <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of proper performance of activity under concession means guaranteeing that the activity will also be properly performed in the future. A characteristic feature of an activity conducted under concession is that the future is predicted based on the actual state of affairs ascertaining satisfaction of the requirements of proper performance of an economic activity. Deliberations on <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of proper performance of economic activity may be carried out in the context of <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of proper performance of a given profession. This is done {{in the second part of}} the paper. However, it must be noted that not all elements identifi ed in judicial decisions as those constituting <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of proper performance of a profession, may be directly referred to when it comes to the performance of an economic activity. Professional ethic or the moral qualities of an entrepreneur may not constitute a premise indicating the absence of <b>a</b> <b>guarantee</b> of proper performance of a concession activity...|$|R
