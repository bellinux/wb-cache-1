"With the {{recession}} squeezing ad budgets, cable companies are redoubling {{their efforts to}} mimic internet advertising, in part by offering a way to target ads at selected groups of consumers. But the industry is divided on the best approach for delivering such ads." [...] "The industry has struggled so far to establish efficient ways to buy <b>Advanced</b> <b>TV</b> on a meaningful scale. <b>Advanced</b> <b>TV</b> is challenged by the fragmented nature of the cable and satellite industry's advertising infrastructure. This produces a chicken-and-egg problem of limited media investment without better infrastructure and content, but limited infrastructure and content without more media investment," [...] according to Brian Wieser. Industry participants are hopeful that Canoe Ventures, a consortium funded and organized by the industry's largest cable operators to aggregate inventory/infrastructure, can catalyze the sector. Canoe faces meaningful challenges in coordinating technical, sales and operational staff across thousands of varying units of infrastructure. Armed with {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars from the six largest cable operators (Comcast, Time Warner, Cox, Cablevision, Charter and Brighthouse), Canoe is in the process of rolling outa scaled down version of its first ad-targeting product, called community addressable messaging. The technology will allow advertisers to select cable households within particular areas that have demographic factors, such as income, in common.|$|E

5000|$|Typical movie {{material}} is shot on 24 frames/s film; when converting film to interlaced video using telecine, each film frame can be presented by two progressive segmented frames (PsF). This format {{does not require}} complex deinterlacing algorithm because each field contains {{a part of the}} very same progressive frame. However to match 50 field interlaced PAL/SECAM or 59.94/60 field interlaced NTSC signal, frame rate conversion should be performed using various [...] "pulldown" [...] techniques; most <b>advanced</b> <b>TV</b> sets can restore the original 24 frame/s signal using an inverse telecine process. Another option is to speed up 24-frame film by 4% (to 25 frames/s) for PAL/SECAM conversion; this method is still vastly used for DVDs, as well as television broadcasts (SD & HD) in the PAL markets.|$|E
