5|$|Bramshill {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} most haunted houses in England. According to one UK police officer who worked at the college, 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified, {{although}} another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously. They include a Grey Lady (one story suggests that her husband, a religious dissenter, was beheaded in the 17th century) and a Green Man (<b>a</b> <b>Cope</b> family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806, according to the journalist P. Lal, or threw himself off a cliff near Brighton, according to the author Penny Legg). The Green Man, dressed as his name suggests, reportedly manifests near the lake, as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there. The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace, the library, and the chapel. Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance, with a sad, tear-stained face and golden hair, and smelling of the lilies of the valley; Lal argues that she has reddish-brown hair and wears a grey, sleeveless robe. The Grey Lady's husband has been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room. The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room; the child has supposedly been heard crying, and attempts to hold visitors' hands. Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child's mother. A lady dressed in the style of Queen Anne, and a knight in armour, are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room. The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th-century dress, and by that of a nun. A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb, reputed to be <b>a</b> <b>Cope</b> family member who fell from a train, has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house. A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century.|$|E

2500|$|On Good Friday, {{elements}} that suggested the usual {{practices of the}} Mass were removed: the sacred ministers began the liturgy in alb and (for celebrant and deacon) black stoles, rather than respectively in black chasuble, dalmatic, and tunicle, as per a typical Mass; the sacred ministers donned their vestments (without maniples) only for the Solemn Intercessions, in which the celebrant wore <b>a</b> <b>cope</b> instead of a chasuble, and removed them for the adoration of the Cross; the sacred ministers changed to violet vestments (again, without maniples) for the distribution of Holy Communion; [...] "Let us pray. Let us kneel. Arise" [...] was added at the prayer for the Jews, and the adjective perfidis was removed (see Good Friday Prayer for the Jews); an afternoon Communion Service replaced the morning Mass of the Presanctified, at which the priest alone received the earlier-consecrated host, and drank unconsecrated wine into which {{a small portion of}} the consecrated host had been put.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1911 {{the diocese}} has {{prohibited}} {{the wearing of}} the chasuble, a vestment now generally worn elsewhere in Australia for {{the celebration of the}} Eucharist. Traditionally in Sydney most clergy have worn the choir habit for all services but a few have also worn <b>a</b> <b>cope</b> and stole when celebrating the Eucharist and at certain other services. This prohibition against chasubles was originated by Archbishop Wright, an English Evangelical, who did so on the basis that the vestment was deemed illegal, relying on decisions of the English ecclesiastical courts as finally upheld in the Privy Council in Read v Bishop of Lincoln [...] AC 664 (see also Ritualist movement). The main objection to this vestment in the mind of Sydney Anglicans is that it is associated with the high church idea of a [...] "sacrificing" [...] priesthood. That idea is contrary to Sydney's low church views of both Holy Communion and of the role and function of the ordained ministry. The archbishop's practice has since been codified by a synod ordinance, making Sydney the only diocese in the whole Anglican Communion that continues to ban the wearing of chasubles, reinforcing the perceived ongoing disapproval of Anglo-Catholics in the diocese.|$|E

After that, the priest, vested in <b>a</b> <b>cope</b> of the color of the day, while the choir sings an antiphon and a verse of Psalm 50/51 or 117/118, sprinkles with the holy water the altar three times, and then the clergy and the congregation.

2500|$|Choir {{dress in}} Anglicanism {{traditionally}} consists of cassock, surplice and scarf (or tippet). An academic hood {{may also be}} worn and, since 1964 in the Church of England <b>a</b> <b>cope</b> may be worn {{at the discretion of}} the minister. [...] However, the basic garment was, and is, the surplice which by the fourteenth century had become the essential choir-vestment everywhere. The surplice was the only vesture permitted to the clergy in the 1552 Prayer Book, except for bishops who should use a rochet (both wore cassocks as the standard undergarment). The Elizabethan Prayer Book of 1559 included the so-called Ornaments Rubric. [...] Its legal interpretation was disputed in the nineteenth century it was claimed that its inclusion in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer commanded the pre-Reformation Eucharistic vestments (chasuble, dalmatic, tunicle, alb, amice, and maniple) that had been in use during the reign of Edward VI. [...] However, the Elizabethan bishops struggled to enforce the use of the surplice, and the use of Eucharistic vestments was discontinued until after the Oxford Movement, {{in the middle of the}} nineteenth century, when it was restored in many cathedrals and parish churches. In many low-church dioceses and parishes the choir dress continued to be the norm, even at the Eucharist. The cope nevertheless continued in use for coronations and in certain cathedrals, but this may be considered an extension of [...] "choir dress" [...] and was sanctioned by the canons of 1603/4.|$|E
2500|$|In the sacristy, before vesting, {{all three}} sacred ministers (priest celebrant, deacon, and subdeacon) wash their hands. The sacred ministers recite certain prayers while they place on each vestment. First, the amice (a {{rectangular}} cloth of linen with long strings for tying) is kissed (if it is embroidered with a cross) and then placed {{on top of}} the head briefly while reciting one of the prayers during vesting. Then it is tied around the shoulders {{on top of the}} cassock (or on top of the habit, if the sacred ministers belongs to a religious order with one). Next the alb (a long linen tunic with sleeves) is put on. The cincture (in Latin, cinctura), a long cloth cord also called a girdle, is then tied around the waist. The subdeacon then completes his vesting by placing the maniple (an embroidered piece of fabric, folded in half, with a cross in the middle) on his left arm (provided there is no Asperges or other liturgical ceremony before Mass begins), securing it either with pins or with the ribbons or elastic inside, and then the tunicle (an embroidered tunic with short sleeves) over all. The deacon places his stole (a long narrow embroidered piece of cloth, similar to the maniple but of greater length) over his left shoulder and binds it in place, at his right hip, with the cincture or girdle. He then puts on the maniple and his dalmatic (similar to the tunicle). The priest celebrant does the same except that he crosses his stole in front of him at the waist, binding it with the girdle or cincture. After the maniple he puts on <b>a</b> <b>cope</b> (a long, heavy embroidered cape) if the Mass is preceded by the Asperges (sprinkling the congregation with holy water). [...] Following the Asperges, the celebrant, assisted by the acolytes, removes the cope and puts on the chasuble (similar to the tunicle, but without sleeves and usually with an embroidered cross or image on the back).|$|E
2500|$|By 1898, Creighton was {{increasingly}} occupied with {{a debate over}} ritual practice in the Diocese of London, and, more generally, in the Church of England. [...] On his arrival in London, he had discovered that low church clergy in his diocese were taking exception to the ritual practices of some high churchmen, practices which indicated Roman Catholic influence. [...] The controversy had begun {{in the wake of}} the Oxford Movement, which had created a Catholic revival within the Anglican church, prominent among which were the Anglo-Catholics. [...] One of the radical low churchmen, the evangelical cleric John Kensit, had protested that Creighton himself had on occasion worn <b>a</b> <b>cope</b> and carried a mitre. [...] Kensit requested that Creighton take a more definite public stance against high church rituals, such as the use of candles and incense. [...] Creighton, who preferred to work behind the scenes, did engage many high church clergy. [...] Although he seemed to subscribe to a broad branch theory, that the real Catholic Church was a collection of national churches which included the Church of England, the Church of Rome, and the Eastern Orthodox Church, he was firm about asserting Anglican doctrine—that liturgical practice, beyond that involving what he termed [...] "permissible liberty," [...] conform to that in the Book of Common Prayer. [...] In a circular letter to his clergy, he wrote:It is absolutely necessary that nothing should be done which affects the due performance of the Church as laid down in the Book of Common Prayer, and that any additional services which are used should conform entirely to the spirit and intention of the Prayer Book. [...] However, this still did not seem to satisfy Kensit and his more vocal evangelical supporters, who threatened to create more public disruption. [...] Eventually, the Church of England's two archbishops, of Canterbury and York, held a hearing in Lambeth Palace, and, in August 1899, ruled against the use of candles and incense, a seeming victory for the low church forces. [...] The wider doctrinal conflict, though, was to continue beyond both the Victorian and Edwardian eras.|$|E
