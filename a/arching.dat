5|$|As {{part of the}} coaster's major refurbishment, a new, {{original}} storyline {{was added}} with a completely redesigned queue experience that places guests inside a perilous scientific experiment led by General Thaddeus Ross. The entrance features a statue of Hulk holding one of the ride's vehicles over his head, and <b>arching</b> tracks passing over him. These <b>arching</b> coaster tracks came from the original Hulk Roller Coaster. The televisions now show CGI animations of test subjects being exposed to gamma radiation and being transformed into Hulk-like creatures. As of April 2015, riders must pass through metal detectors and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from their pockets.|$|E
5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by <b>arching</b> their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E

5|$|Her {{first solo}} album My Winter Storm (2007) {{contains}} rock and metal songs {{as well as}} songs that resemble classical songs. Turunen uses both her classical singing voice and a rock-sounding voice. In many songs she starts with a rock voice, and then switches for widely <b>arching</b> melodies into a distinctly classical singing voice.|$|E
5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as {{the primary source of}} power for the wingstroke. Contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe <b>arching</b> of the notum which depresses the wing while contraction of the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles that are responsible for developing the needed power for the up and down strokes.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire lies {{on three}} {{arterial}} roads: Illinois Route 22, {{which is known}} as Half Day Road in this area; Milwaukee Avenue, which appears as Illinois Route 21/U.S. Route 45; and Aptakisic Road, which meets Milwaukee in the southern region of Lincolnshire. Lincolnshire shares its eastern border with the village of Bannockburn at Interstate 94 (where it is {{a portion of the}} Tri-State Tollway). Route 22 crosses the Des Plaines River before bridging Bannockburn and Lincolnshire by <b>arching</b> over Interstate Highway 94.|$|E
50|$|The through <b>arch</b> bridge usually {{consists}} of two ribs, although there are examples like the Hulme <b>Arch</b> Bridge of through <b>arches</b> with a single rib. When the two <b>arches</b> are built in parallel planes, the structure is a parallel rib <b>arch</b> bridge. When the two <b>arch</b> ribs lean together and shorten {{the distance between the}} <b>arches</b> near the top, the span is a basket handle <b>arch</b> bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} true <b>arch</b> {{configurations}} are the fixed <b>arch,</b> the two-hinged <b>arch,</b> and the three-hinged <b>arch.</b>|$|R
25|$|This type of bridge {{comprises}} an <b>arch</b> {{where the}} deck is completely above the <b>arch.</b> The {{area between the}} <b>arch</b> and the deck {{is known as the}} spandrel. If the spandrel is solid, usually the case in a masonry or stone <b>arch</b> bridge, the bridge is called a closed-spandrel deck <b>arch</b> bridge. If the deck is supported by a number of vertical columns rising from the <b>arch,</b> the bridge is known as an open-spandrel deck <b>arch</b> bridge. The Alexander Hamilton Bridge is an example of an open-spandrel <b>arch</b> bridge. Finally, if the <b>arch</b> supports the deck only {{at the top of the}} <b>arch,</b> the bridge is called a cathedral <b>arch</b> bridge.|$|R
5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, <b>arching</b> their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without <b>arching</b> the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} been slow to turn, {{possibly}} taking one to two seconds to turn only 45° — an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tailless, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by <b>arching</b> its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, <b>arching</b> their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The term “bovine <b>arch</b> ” {{is widely}} used to {{describe}} a common anatomic variant of the human aortic <b>arch</b> branching. This so-called bovine aortic <b>arch</b> has no resemblance to the bovine aortic <b>arch.</b> We describe the most common human aortic <b>arch</b> branching patterns and compare these with the bovine aortic <b>arch.</b> One {{of the most widely}} used misnomers in the medical lit-erature is that of the “bovine aortic <b>arch</b> ” in humans. 1, 2 This term refers to a common anatomic configuration of the aortic <b>arch.</b> By its name, the bovine aortic <b>arch</b> in humans would presumably resemble the aortic <b>arch</b> branching pattern found in the family of ruminant animals, including cattle and buffalo. However, the bovine aortic <b>arch</b> configuration as-cribed to the most common human aortic <b>arch</b> variants bears no resemblance to the aortic <b>arch</b> branching pattern found in cattle. We describe the specific anatomic appearance of hu-man and bovine aortic <b>arch</b> branching patterns and propose a simple nomenclature scheme that should supplant {{the use of the term}} “bovine aortic <b>arch</b> ” in humans...|$|R
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and <b>arching.</b> At the same time there were increasing influences from English and continental European designs. These {{can be seen in the}} Romanesque chevron pattern on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral. St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons that had worked at Durham. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, Jedburgh and St Andrews.|$|E
5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently <b>arching</b> canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|E
5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while <b>arching</b> its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its head from side to side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|E
50|$|The {{horseshoe}} <b>arch</b> (Spanish: arco de herradura /ˈarko de eraˈduɾa/), {{also called}} the Moorish <b>arch</b> and the Keyhole <b>arch,</b> is the emblematic <b>arch</b> of Moorish architecture. Horseshoe <b>arches</b> can take rounded, pointed or lobed form.|$|R
30|$|The greater <b>arch</b> width {{that was}} seen for the {{swimmers}} represents {{the most significant}} of the results in the present study, and particularly for the upper <b>arch.</b> Only 10 swimmers had an upper <b>arch</b> reduction, with 54 with maxillary <b>arch</b> increases. Indeed, the significant correlation of the within-subject comparisons of {{the dimensions of the}} upper and lower <b>arches</b> showed more swimmers than non-swimmers with harmonious development of both dentoalveolar <b>arches.</b> Thus, significantly more of the non-swimmers showed differential development between one <b>arch</b> and the antagonist <b>arch,</b> indicating that the swimmers show significantly improved within-subject development of the upper and the lower dentoalveolar <b>arches.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, <b>arching</b> backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce {{magnetic field}}s, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, {{and the amount of}} magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are <b>arching</b> magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.|$|E
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in more stable walls that could incorporate refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and <b>arching.</b> At the same time there was increasing influence from English and continental European designs, known as Romanesque. The Romanesque style had its origins in Roman building techniques and early churches in the Byzantine Empire and Italy and was characterised by massive reinforced walls and round arches that could bear the weight of rounded barrel vault roofs. The introduction of this style to Scotland is associated with the ecclesiastical reforms that began in the reign of Máel Coluim III (r. 1058–93), bringing continental ideas of monasticism and church organisation to the country. The oldest Romanesque church in Scotland is probably the small chapel built for Máel Coluim's wife Margaret on Castle Rock, Edinburgh, with a vaulted semi-circular apse. In the twelfth century a number of new parish churches were built by lords on their land. They were often small aisless buildings with two or three connected cells, each of diminishing size, ending in a rounded apse. One of the best preserved is at Dalmeny in Lothian.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Arch</b> {{bridge is}} one of the main bridge types in China. More than 150 {{concrete}} <b>arch</b> bridges and more than 130 CFST <b>arch</b> bridges with a span over 100 m have been built.

5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the bottom and <b>arching</b> her tail; this may reflect mate choice on her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads pressed against the bottom and their bodies at an upward angle.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for the severe weather outbreak came as a positively-tilted shortwave trough progressed across the central High Plains into the Great Plains and eventually through the western Great Lakes region. A weaker disturbance pushed from the Ozarks into the Northeastern United States, acting to strengthen southwesterly winds aloft across the risk area. At the surface, a weak {{area of low pressure}} initially centered over northeastern Kansas early on April9 progressed steadily northeast while intensifying, reaching the trisection of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois by late that evening. A cold front stemming from the low progressed eastward across the Mid-South, whereas an <b>arching</b> warm front slowly pushed northward across eastern Iowa and northern Illinois. Modest surface heating ahead of the cold front allowed mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values to reach 1,000–1,500 J/kg, and a mass of rich moisture transported northward from the Gulf of Mexico pushed dewpoints into the lower 60s °F across the Enhanced risk area. Winds at 850 mb (4,781ft) strengthened at or above 45mph (75km/h) below winds of 70mph (110km/h) at 700 mb (9,882ft), creating a favorable setup for sustained supercells. Although the overall directional component of low-level winds was expected to be less than ideal as a whole, a small area of southeasterly surface winds developed near the surface low in northern Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Scutes {{from the}} postcranial {{region of the}} {{skeleton}} are also known from struthiosaurines. Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus, as well as S. sp.. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups {{of two or three}} osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the medial edge, and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks. The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape. One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side-to-side and was as long as the whole band itself. The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point, and the upper side of the scute has a smooth, lightly <b>arching</b> shape. Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms with flat tops and rounded bottoms. The exact placement of cervical bands is not known. In 1995, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement, the bands would have been horizontal along the body, with the neural spine {{in the middle of the}} back. That positioning would mean that the medial scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size, and together they would either fuse, like in Edmontonia, or touch, as in Sauropelta. Another possibility, suggested by Ford, was that the bands were along the side of the neck, pointing dorsally. If oriented along the side, the primary scutes would have pointed up and down, like in polacanthids, and the medial scutes would, by definition, become secondary osteoderms. The set of medial scutes (or secondary) would be possibly oval in shape.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveOpen total <b>arch</b> {{procedures}} {{have been associated}} with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple comorbidities. Aortic <b>arch</b> debranching with endovascular graft placement, the hybrid <b>arch</b> procedure, has emerged as a surgical option in this patient population. This study evaluates the outcomes of a contemporary comparative series from one institution of open total <b>arch</b> and hybrid <b>arch</b> procedures for extensive aortic <b>arch</b> pathology. MethodsFrom July 2000 to March 2009, 1196 open <b>arch</b> procedures were performed, including 45 elective and 7 emergency open total <b>arch</b> procedures. From 2005 to 2009, 64 hybrid <b>arch</b> procedures were performed: 37 emergency type A dissections and 27 elective open <b>arch</b> debranchings. Hemiarch procedures were excluded. ResultsThe hybrid <b>arch</b> cohort was significantly older (P = . 008) and had greater predominance of atherosclerotic pathophysiology (P < . 001). The incidence of permanent cerebral neurologic deficit was similar at 4 % (1 / 27) for the hybrid <b>arch</b> cohort and 9 % (4 / 45) for the open aortic <b>arch</b> cohort. In-hospital mortality was similar at 11 % (3 / 27) for the hybrid <b>arch</b> cohort and 16 % (7 / 45) for the open aortic <b>arch</b> cohort. However, in the open <b>arch</b> group, {{there was a significant difference}} in mortality between patients aged less than 75 years at 9 % (3 / 34) and patients aged more than 75 years at 36 % (4 / 11) (P = . 05). ConclusionsHybrid <b>arch</b> procedures provide a safe alternative to open repair. This study suggests the hybrid <b>arch</b> approach has a lower mortality for high-risk patients aged more than 75 years. This extends the indication for the hybrid <b>arch</b> approach in patients with complex aortic <b>arch</b> pathology previously considered prohibitively high risk for conventional open total <b>arch</b> repair...|$|R
