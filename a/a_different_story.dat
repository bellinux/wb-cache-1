5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their first season, going 8–4, their financial status was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story.</b> Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. They were in dire financial straits until the eleventh game of the season, when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans. This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered {{the history of the}} franchise.|$|E

5|$|The {{margin of}} the Empress Eudocia's copy of the Iliad has a note {{summarizing}} a Hellenistic poet who tells <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> of Orion's birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they offer him a favor, he asks {{for the birth of}} sons. The gods take the bull's hide and ejaculate or urinate into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E
5|$|Matsya Purana tells <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> of Chamunda's origins. She {{with other}} matrikas {{was created by}} Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabija - to {{generate}} from his dripping blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks {{the blood of the}} demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.|$|E

Andy, however, gets angry when he hears that his college friend Broccoli Rob (Colbert) is telling <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> about the group. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), {{with the help of}} Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) tries to track down a person who is using prescription anxiety pills.

5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story.</b> These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether the English pursuit was ordered by Harold {{or if it was}} spontaneous. Wace relates that Harold ordered his men to stay in their {{formations}} but no other account gives this detail. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the death of Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine occurring just before the fight around the hillock. This may mean that the two brothers led the pursuit. The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio relates <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> for the death of Gyrth, stating that the duke slew Harold's brother in combat, perhaps thinking that Gyrth was Harold. William of Poitiers states that the bodies of Gyrth and Leofwine were found near Harold's, implying that they died late in the battle. It is possible that if the two brothers died early in the fighting their bodies were taken to Harold, thus accounting for their being found near his body after the battle. The military historian Peter Marren speculates that if Gyrth and Leofwine died early in the battle, that may have influenced Harold to stand and fight to the end.|$|E
5|$|The {{next season}} saw the AL further {{reduce the amount}} of games played to just 30. In the {{pre-season}} Halla won the Anyang Cup, which is a pre-season tournament held in Anyang. The team's record in the regular season remained relatively the same and they finished again in 5th place. Lee Yu-Won was the top offensive player with 16 goals and was tied for 4th place with 3 other players. Martinec continued to contribute many assists to the team and finished in second place with 29, one point off first. He finished in 4th place in the overall point totals. Halla did not have another player in the top 10. The team once again led the league in short-handed goals and gave up the fewest short-handed goals against along with the Oji Eagles. In the playoffs the Halla faced the Nippon Paper Cranes in the first round. During the regular season the two teams split their series, each winning 2 games. The playoffs told <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story,</b> and Nippon swept Halla in 3 games. Halla lost each game by a single goal. Vejvoda praised Nippon's goalie for his excellent play and commended his players for their effort.|$|E

5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the last}} {{campaign}} associated with Nikephoros Phokas, and Symeon Logothetes reports that he died in 895/6. His death reportedly encouraged Tsar Simeon to reopen hostilities, with devastating success against Nikephoros' successor as Domestic, Leo Katakalon. The later chronicle of Theophanes Continuatus, however, reports <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story,</b> according to which Nikephoros was disgraced and dismissed from his post after refusing proposals for a marriage alliance with Leo's powerful chief minister, Stylianos Zaoutzes. After a period out of office, Nikephoros was then appointed strategos either of Charsianon or of the Thracesian Theme, spending his remaining years, until his death around 900, fighting against the Arabs. Leo VI's Tactica and the later De velitatione further mention a successful raid into the Arab lands of Cilicia led by Nikephoros, in retaliation of an Arab attack on the fortress of Mistheia in the Anatolic Theme. While directing the strategoi of the Anatolics and of the Opsician Theme {{to deal with the}} Arab invasion, Nikephoros led his forces to raid the vicinity of Adana, making many prisoners, and confounded the Arabs by following a different course on his return, thereby avoiding the Arab army sent to block his retreat. This undated raid probably took place either in the years before or directly after the Bulgarian war.|$|E
5|$|While Ike Clanton {{later said}} he was {{planning}} to leave town, Frank McLaury reported that he had decided to remain behind to take care of some business. Will McLaury, Tom and Frank's brother and a judge in Fort Worth, Texas, claimed in a letter he wrote during the preliminary hearing after the shootout that Tom and Frank were still armed because they were planning to conduct business before leaving town to visit him in Texas. He wrote that Billy Clanton, who had arrived on horseback with Frank, intended to go with the McLaurys to Fort Worth. Will McLaury came to Tombstone after the gun fight and joined the prosecution team in an attempt to convict the Earps and Holliday for his brothers' murder. Paul Johnson told <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story,</b> that the McLaurys were about to leave for Iowa to attend the wedding of their sister, Sarah Caroline, in Iowa. Tom and Frank were especially close to Sarah, one of their 14 siblings and half-siblings. Caroline married James Reed in Richland, Iowa at the end of November that year.|$|E
