5|$|Although {{encompassing}} diverse mainstream and underground styles, {{the music}} of the NWOBHM is best remembered for drawing on the heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of independent record labels. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology, fantasy, horror and the rock lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{wholesale}} destruction of plants at the K–Pg boundary, there was <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of saprotrophic organisms, such as fungi, {{that do not}} require photosynthesis and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, such as ferns and other plants, returned.|$|E

In this thesis, we apply a computational Bayesian technique to calibrate stochastic discrete mathematical models of cell migration and cell proliferation {{in the context of}} <b>a</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> assay. Initially, we use a lattice-based model to explore the optimal duration of <b>a</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> assay. Next, we estimate the parameters in a lattice-free model using three independent experimental data sets. Our model is able to both describe and predict the evolution of the population and spatial structure in <b>a</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> assay...|$|R

5|$|Several {{periods of}} Protestant Christian revival nurtured <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of new {{religious}} {{movements in the}} United States. In {{the latter half of}} the 19th century these included what came to be known as the metaphysical family: groups such as Christian Science, Divine Science, the Unity School of Christianity and (later) the United Church of Religious Science. From the 1890s the liberal section of the movement became known as New Thought, in part to distinguish it from the more authoritarian Christian Science.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It could result in a decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of species that are opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains will probably be shortened.|$|E
5|$|The {{last three}} decades have seen <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of {{subfamily}} names, {{as a result of}} three factors: (1) the realization that some subfamilies were assemblages of unrelated taxa; (2) abandonment of paraphyletic taxa, and (3) the discovery of novel fossil taxa. Seventeen extant subfamilies of ants are currently recognized, along with four extinct subfamilies. One of the fossil taxa, Armaniinae, is often given family rank within the superfamily Formicoidea. About 13 genera are incertae sedis (of uncertain placement), and are not assigned to any subfamily.|$|E

5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E
5|$|Boston's harbor {{activity}} was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital {{investments in the}} interim. Manufacturing became {{an important component of}} the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E

40|$|Background: Sialadenoma papilliferum (SP) is a rare, benign {{neoplasm}} of salivary gland origin which manifests as an exo-phytic papillary excrescence of the mucosa. Indeed, SP is both <b>an</b> exophytic <b>proliferation</b> of papillary stratified squamous epithelium above the mucosal surface and an endophytic salivary ductal proliferation beneath the mucosa. It arises predominantly in minor salivary glands and usually affects {{patients in the}} age range of 32 – 87 years, with reports in young patients being exceedingly rare. Case Report: We report {{the case of a}} previously healthy 20 -year-old man diagnosed with a nodular mass in the upper lip buccal mucosa. The tumor was excised and submitted for microscopic examination. Histologic examination revealed <b>a</b> biphasic <b>proliferation</b> of papillary stratified squamous and salivary ductal epithelia, both underneath the mucosal surface. Conclusions: In this unique case, as the classical SP, the tumor had <b>a</b> biphasic <b>proliferation</b> of squamous and ductal epithe-lia. However, unlike the classical SP, both epithelia grew under the mucosal surface. As a result, it did not man-ifest as <b>an</b> exophytic <b>proliferation,</b> but as <b>a</b> nodule. We excluded squamous papilloma, inverted ductal papillo-ma, intraductal papilloma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma, the principal entities in the differential diagnosi...|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Scottish people, {{like most of}} Catholic Europe, were {{increasingly}} concerned with prayers for the dead, necessary to speed passage from Purgatory to Heaven. The upper nobility began to turn from patronage for monasteries to the establishing collegiate churches to pray for them, such as Lord Dummond's foundation at Innerpeffray in 1508 and Lord Fleming's re-establishment at Biggar in 1546. Those lower down in society paid for shrines, priests and masses, leading to <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of altars, clergy and services within existing churches. In the burghs the primary function of craft guilds was {{to pay for the}} funerals and masses of their members. By the early sixteenth century St. Mary's in Dundee had perhaps 48 altars and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s and 1980s saw <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of recordings, many of live performances. Plácido Domingo first {{recorded}} Cavaradossi in 1973, {{and continued to}} do so at regular intervals until 1994. In 1976 he was joined by his son, Plácido Domingo Jr., who sang the shepherd boy's song in a British recording with the New Philharmonia Orchestra. More recent commended recordings have included Antonio Pappano's 2000 Royal Opera House version with Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna and Ruggero Raimondi. Recordings of Tosca in languages other than Italian are rare but not unknown; over the years versions in French, German, Spanish, Hungarian and Russian have been issued. An admired English language version was released in 1995 in which David Parry led the Philharmonia Orchestra and a largely British cast. Since the late 1990s numerous video recordings of the opera have been issued on DVD and Blu-ray disc (BD). These include recent productions and remastered versions of historic performances.|$|E
5|$|The Postclassic Period {{was marked}} by changes from the {{preceding}} Classic Period. The once-great city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after continuous occupation of almost 2,000 years. Across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast, long-occupied cities in exposed locations were relocated, apparently due to <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of warfare. Cities came to occupy more-easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines, with ditch-and-wall defences sometimes supplementing the protection provided by the natural terrain. One {{of the most important}} cities in the Guatemalan Highlands at this time was Q'umarkaj, the capital of the aggressive K'iche' kingdom. The government of Maya states, from the Yucatán to the Guatemalan highlands, was often organized as joint rule by a council. However, in practice one member of the council could act as a supreme ruler, while the other members served him as advisors.|$|E

5|$|The {{blurring}} or {{diffusion of}} the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility under the Empire, both upward and downward, {{to an extent}} that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life in the Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of voluntary associations and confraternities (collegia and sodalitates) formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing arts troupes, and burial societies.|$|E
5|$|The {{early success}} of Dungeons & Dragons led to <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of similar game systems. Despite the competition, D has {{remained}} {{as the market}} leader in the role-playing game industry. In 1977, the game was split into two branches: the relatively rules-light game system of basic Dungeons & Dragons and the more structured, rules-heavy game system of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (abbreviated as AD). AD 2nd Edition was published in 1989. In 2000, a new system was released as Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition. These rules {{formed the basis of}} the d20 System which is available under the Open Game License (OGL) for use by other publishers. Dungeons & Dragons version 3.5 was released in June 2003, with a (non-OGL) 4th edition in June 2008. A 5th edition was released {{during the second half of}} 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of Wells Cathedral presents a relatively tidy and harmonious appearance since {{the greater part}} of the building was executed in a single style, Early English Gothic. This is uncommon among English cathedrals where the exterior usually exhibits a plethora of styles. At Wells, later changes in the Perpendicular style were universally applied, such as filling the Early English lancet windows with simple tracery, the construction of a parapet that encircles the roof, and the addition of pinnacles framing each gable, similar to those around the chapter house and on the west front. At the eastern end there is <b>a</b> <b>proliferation</b> of tracery with repeated motifs in the Reticulated style, a stage between Geometric and Flowing Decorated tracery.|$|E
