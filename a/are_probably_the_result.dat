5|$|Grand Canyon {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on the Richter Scale occurred in the Grand Canyon region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 on the Richter Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the Grand Canyon area.|$|E
5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones {{to the floor of}} the cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E
25|$|Apis florea and Apis andreniformis {{are small}} honey bees of {{southern}} and southeastern Asia. They make very small, exposed nests in trees and shrubs. Their stings are often incapable of penetrating human skin, so the hive and swarms {{can be handled}} with minimal protection. They occur largely sympatrically, though they are very distinct evolutionarily and <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of allopatric speciation, their distribution later converging.|$|E
30|$|The {{increase}} in BMD <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of increased mobility and {{load on the}} extremity after implantation of a well-functioning rTKA.|$|R
25|$|Redness of {{the elbows}} is {{frequently}} present. It <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of <b>the</b> combination of increased activity, an exposed part, and a hyperirritable vasomotor system.|$|R
50|$|The overall {{discrepancy}} of 2 {{days to the}} astronomically accurate value <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of {{a slight}} imprecision in the Bronze Age observation of synodic and solar month.|$|R
25|$|As first {{noted by}} Gault and others, the {{continuous}} ejecta blankets and secondary crater fields surrounding mercurian craters {{are smaller than}} their lunar counterparts, and {{the boundary between the}} two features is much less distinct. As a consequence, continuous and discontinuous ejecta are mapped together in the Bach region as “radial facies.” With this exception, the morphological elements of mercurian craters are virtually identical with those on the Moon. Therefore, all of the craters within the Bach region <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of impact by meteorites, small planetesimals, and possibly comets.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1970s, {{numerous}} geoglyphs {{have been}} discovered on deforested land dating between AD 1–1250, furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations. Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre. The BBC's Unnatural Histories presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta. Terra preta is found over large areas in the Amazon forest; and is now widely accepted {{as a product of}} indigenous soil management. The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed. In the region of the Xingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements {{in the middle of the}} Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.|$|E
2500|$|Partially molten basalt in {{the mantle}} wedge moves upwards {{until it reaches}} {{the base of the}} {{overriding}} crust. Once there, the basaltic melt can either underplate the crust, creating a layer of molten material at its base, or it can move into the overriding plate in the form of dykes. If it underplates the crust, the basalt can (in theory) cause partial melting of the lower crust due to the transfer of heat and volatiles. Models of heat transfer, however, show that arc basalts emplaced at temperatures 1100–1240°C cannot provide enough heat to melt lower crustal amphibolite. [...] Basalt can, however, melt pelitic upper crustal material. [...] Andesitic magmas generated in island arcs, therefore, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of partial melting of the crust.|$|E
50|$|In 2017, using Dark Energy Survey plus MagLiteS data, {{a stellar}} over-density {{associated}} with the Small Magellanic Cloud was discovered, which <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of interactions between SMC and LMC.|$|R

50|$|Recently {{there has}} been a decline in {{incidence}} which <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a decline in rheumatic fever (RF), which was a major cause of chorea gravidarum before the use of antibiotics for streptococcal pharyngitis.|$|R
2500|$|... "hen in {{a certain}} village he had {{demolished}} a very ancient temple, and had set about cutting down a pine-tree, which stood close to the temple, the chief priest of that place, and a crowd of other heathens began to oppose him; and these people, though, {{under the influence of}} the Lord, they had been quiet while the temple was being overthrown, could not patiently allow the tree to be cut down". Sulpicius affirms that Martin withdrew from the city to live in Marmoutier (Majus Monasterium), the monastery he founded, which faces Tours from the opposite shore of the Loire. Recent excavations under the abbey church have revealed the traces of a Roman posting station, beside the main Roman road along the north bank of the Loire, which seems to have been the original dwelling for the community; the 'caves' on the site are post-Roman and <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of quarrying the coteau for the Romanesque abbey buildings.|$|E

The Trinity {{of that day}} was burned in the great fire of 1776. The edifice that succeeded it, at the peace of 1783, has already given place to a successor, that has more claim {{to be placed on}} a level with modern, English, town church-architecture, than any other building in the Union. When another shall succeed this, which shall be as much larger and more elaborated than this is compared to its predecessor, and still another shall succeed, which shall bear the same relation to that, then the country will possess an edifice that is on a level with the first-rate Gothic cathedral-architecture of Europe. It would be idle to pretend that the new Trinity is without faults; some of which <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of circumstances and necessity; but, if the respectable architect who has built it, had no other merit, he would deserve the gratitude of every man of taste in the country, by placing church-towers of a proper comparative breadth, dignity and proportions, before the eyes of its population. The diminutive meanness of American church-towers, has been an eye-sore to every intelligent, travelled American, since the country was settled.--EDITOR.] ...|$|E

50|$|Scoria {{differs from}} pumice, another {{vesicular}} volcanic rock, in having larger vesicles and thicker vesicle walls, and hence is denser. <b>The</b> difference <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of lower magma viscosity, allowing rapid volatile diffusion, bubble growth, coalescence, and bursting.|$|R
60|$|I may here {{allude to}} a class of facts closely allied to, but {{somewhat}} different from, ordinary cases of inheritance. Sir H. Holland (12/34. 'Medical Notes and Reflections' 1839 pages 24, 34. See also Dr. P. Lucas 'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 2 page 33.) states that brothers and sisters of the same family are frequently affected, often {{at about the same}} age, by the same peculiar disease, not known to have previously occurred in the family. He specifies the occurrence of diabetes in three brothers under ten years old; he also remarks that children of the same family often exhibit in common infantile diseases, the same peculiar symptoms. My father mentioned to me the case of four brothers who died between the ages of sixty and seventy, in the same highly peculiar comatose state. An instance has already been given of supernumerary digits appearing in four children out of six in a previously unaffected family. Dr. Devay states (12/35. 'Du Danger des Mariages Consanguins' 2nd edition 1862 page 103.) that two brothers married two sisters, their first-cousins, none of the four nor any relation being an albino; but the seven children produced from this double marriage were all perfect albinoes. Some of these cases, as Mr. Sedgwick (12/36. 'British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg. Review' July 1863 pages 183, 189.) has shown, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of reversion to a remote ancestor, of whom no record had been preserved; and all these cases are so far directly connected with inheritance that no doubt the children inherited a similar constitution from their parents, and, from being exposed to nearly similar conditions of life, {{it is not surprising that}} they should be affected in the same manner and at the same period of life.|$|E
60|$|There {{are many}} birds both sexes {{of which are}} conspicuously, though not brilliantly coloured, such as the {{numerous}} black, white, or piebald species; and these colours, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of sexual selection. With the common blackbird, capercailzie, black-cock, black Scoter-duck (Oidemia), and even {{with one of the}} Birds of Paradise (Lophorina atra), the males alone are black, whilst the females are brown or mottled; and there can hardly be a doubt that blackness in these cases has been a sexually selected character. Therefore it is in some degree probable that the complete or partial blackness of both sexes in such birds as crows, certain cockatoos, storks, and swans, and many marine birds, is likewise the result of sexual selection, accompanied by equal transmission to both sexes; for blackness can hardly serve in any case as a protection. With several birds, in which the male alone is black, and in others in which both sexes are black, the beak or skin about the head is brightly coloured, and the contrast thus afforded adds greatly to their beauty; we see this in the bright yellow beak of the male blackbird, in the crimson skin over the eyes of the black-cock and capercailzie, in the variously and brightly-coloured beak of the Scoter-drake (Oidemia), in the red beak of the chough (Corvus graculus, Linn.), of the black swan, and black stork. This leads me to remark that {{it is not at all}} incredible that toucans may owe the enormous size of their beaks to sexual selection, for the sake of displaying the diversified and vivid stripes of colour, with which these organs are ornamented.[280] The naked skin at the base of the beak and round the eyes is likewise often brilliantly coloured; and Mr. Gould, in speaking of one species,[281] says that the colours of the beak “are doubtless in the finest and most brilliant state during the time of pairing.” There is no greater improbability in toucans being encumbered with immense beaks, though rendered as light as possible by their cancellated structure, for an object falsely appearing to us unimportant, namely, the display of fine colours, than that the male Argus pheasant and some other birds should be encumbered with plumes so long as to impede their flight.|$|E

60|$|The Jardines were a clan of hardy west-border men. Their {{chief was}} Jardine of Applegirth. Their refusal {{to ride with}} Douglas <b>was,</b> <b>probably,</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> {{of one of those}} {{perpetual}} feuds, which usually rent to pieces a Scottish army.|$|R
60|$|Lastly, {{the fact}} of the intercrossed plants in Table 7/A not {{exceeding}} in height the self-fertilised plants in a greater and greater degree in <b>the</b> later generations, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of their having become more and more closely inter-related.|$|R
5000|$|Sir Thomas is {{reported}} to have won 500 guineas and a [...] "compromise" [...] at Newmarket. The first of these <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a match race against Aurelius which took place at the Houghton meeting in late October or early November.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{observed}} the changes in surface of nanoparticles of two different nanomaterials, cobalt-substituted hydroxyapatite (CoHAp) and calcium phosphate/poly-(DLlactide-co-glycolide) (CP/PLGA) that occurred under simulated physiological conditions in vitro. Both nanomaterials were incubated in an appropriate volume of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for 3 days at 37 0 C and then the medium was removed and materials were dried. Surface changes of nanoparticles were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results of SEM analysis show that changes in {{the size and shape}} of the nanoparticles took place. These changes can be explained by interactions of nanomaterials with DMEM.

5000|$|While {{a number}} of the Psalms bear {{headings}} which seem to identify their authors, these <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of the need to find a significant identification in tradition.

50|$|The Ganges shark {{is widely}} feared as a ferocious man-eater.
