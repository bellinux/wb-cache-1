5|$|Prominent anatomists and geologists such as Georges Cuvier, Richard Owen, Adam Sedgwick, and Charles Lyell {{attacked}} it vigorously. It {{has been}} suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.|$|E
5|$|However, Peckham {{worked hard}} to reorganise the estates of the diocese, and held an inquiry in 1283 through 1285 into the {{revenues}} of the see. He set up administrative structures in the manors that divided them into seven administrative groups. Peckham, though, was almost continually in debt, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Franciscan, he had no personal property to help with his living expenses. He had inherited the diocesan debts that his predecessor had allowed to accumulate, and never managed to clear them.|$|E
5|$|Through {{his actions}} and speeches, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able {{to symbolize the}} popular Arab will, Nasser {{inspired}} several nationalist revolutions in the Arab world. He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the Arab world, bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other Arab leaders. The extent of Nasser's centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, {{in order to gain}} popular legitimacy from their own citizens.|$|E

He hired regular collaborators Bernard Herrmann as music composer, George Tomasini as editor, and Saul Bass for the title design and storyboarding of the shower scene. In all, his crew cost $62,000.|$|E
5|$|When he had {{resigned}} as governor in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a {{delegate to the}} Continental Congress, known as the Confederation Congress after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Congress had declined in importance after the Revolutionary War, and was frequently ignored by the states. Congress elected Hancock to serve as its president, but he never attended because of his poor health <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not interested. He sent Congress a letter of resignation in 1786.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Minnesota, Grant was {{selected}} {{in both the}} NFL and NBA Draft. He was selected {{in the first round}} (fourteenth overall) of the 1950 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles and fourth round (forty-second overall) selection of the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1950 NBA draft. He played thirty-five games during the 1949–50 NBA season and signed with the Lakers for the 1950–51 NBA season. He chose to continue his basketball career with the Lakers because they were local <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> offered a raise to stay for the season. Grant's close personal friend, Sid Hartman, was the Lakers' general manager, which may have influenced his decision to remain with the team. He averaged 2.6 points per game in his two seasons as a reserve with the Lakers and {{was a member of the}} 1950 championship team.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United later {{accepted}} a £1.5 million offer for Whiteside from A.C. Milan, and offered him £100,000 in cash {{to accept the}} transfer. He refused the move as he felt {{he still had a}} good future with Manchester United <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> given only a brief time to consider whether or not to relocate to a club and location he knew little about. He continued to impress, despite on-loan striker Garth Crooks being tipped to take his first team place and sign a permanent contract (which never happened). United were trophyless however in 1983–84, exiting both domestic cup competitions to Third Division sides. He did though play a part in the memorable 3–0 win over Barcelona at Old Trafford in the Third Round of the European Cup Winners' Cup. He lost his starting place to Mark Hughes for the semi-final clash with Juventus at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino, which ended in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Hitler's {{attention}} became {{focused on}} foreign affairs and {{the conduct of the}} war, to the exclusion of all else. Hess, not directly engaged in either of these endeavours, became increasingly sidelined from the affairs of the nation and from Hitler's attention; Bormann had successfully supplanted Hess in many of his duties and usurped his position at Hitler's side. Also concerned that Germany would face a war on two fronts as plans progressed for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union scheduled to take place in 1941, Hess boldly decided to attempt to bring Britain to the negotiating table by travelling there himself to seek meetings with the British government. He asked the advice of Albrecht Haushofer, who suggested several potential contacts in Britain. Hess settled on fellow aviator Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton, whom he had never met. On Hess's instructions, Haushofer wrote to Hamilton in September 1940, but the letter was intercepted by MI5 and Hamilton did not see it until March 1941. Hamilton was chosen in the mistaken belief {{that he was one of}} the leaders of an opposition party opposed to war with Germany, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a friend of Haushofer.|$|E

25|$|Bishop Merwyn Castle was consecrated Bishop of False Bay (a suffragan of {{the diocese}} of Cape Town) in 1994, but because most Anglicans outside South Africa were unaware of his homosexuality, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> celibate, no {{comparable}} controversy took place.

25|$|Hugh {{became an}} {{important}} councillor of William, Duke of Normandy. His father contributed sixty ships to William's invasion of England, {{and he may have}} been present on Senlac Hill in 1066, although {{there is no evidence of}} this.

25|$|Henry {{probably}} {{could not wait}} long to replace Richard, as the Welsh were resurgent under the charismatic leadership of Gruffudd ap Cynan. According to the Historia Regum, Richard's death prompted the Welsh to raid Cheshire, looting, killing, and burning two castles. Perhaps because of his recognised military ability and social strength, because he was loyal <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the closest male relation to Earl Richard, Henry recognized Ranulf as Richard's successor to the county of Chester.|$|E
25|$|On a {{business}} trip to his hometown, Tetsuji reminisces on a childhood incident involving Kazuya Ikeuchi, an effeminate boy who liked to cross-dress. Ikeuchi lived in a household with four sisters, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the only male after his father's death, his family would pressure him to succeed. After Ikeuchi didn't go to school for three days, Tetsuji visited him and found him dressed as a woman. Later that day a fire erupted in Ikeuchi's house and killed his mother. While waiting for the bus, Tetsuji spots Ikeuchi with a wife and child.|$|E

25|$|Ervin gained lasting fame {{through his}} {{stewardship}} of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices, {{also known as the}} Senate Watergate Committee, from the 1972 presidential election. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield chose Ervin because it was unlikely Ervin was going to run for re-election in 1974 (and in fact did not), because he had no aspirations beyond his office, because of his knowledge of the law and the Constitution, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an even-keeled, conservative, independent-minded Democrat. President Nixon thought at first that Ervin might potentially be partial to him, but that turned out to not be the case.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after her}} marriage, she fled to France and, {{according}} to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, she proceeded to have many adventures, disguised as a man. These included paying court to a young nun whom she almost persuaded to elope with her. In 1740, her husband placed an advertisement in the Newcastle Journal announcing that she had left him and asking for her to return. Jane Gomeldon undertook an unusual response by placing her own advertisement in the rival Newcastle Courant, explaining that she had left {{him because of his}} cruelty to her <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> intermeddling with the fortune that her mother had left her, secured for her sole and separate use. In 1742, she brought a separation suit to court, against her husband, on the grounds of cruelty.|$|E
