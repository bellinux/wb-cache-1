5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. These findings indicate that S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> related species. It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (Hâˆ’) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E

5|$|Given its {{formidable}} {{size and}} dentition, the silky shark {{is regarded as}} potentially dangerous to humans. However, it only rarely comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited {{in the presence of}} food. The silky shark tends to be more aggressive if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists six attacks attributable to the silky shark, three of them unprovoked and none fatal.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{was known}} for his extravagant tastes and opulent lifestyle, as well as his {{possession}} of a large library. He had a son, Henry, {{who was one of the}} hostages demanded by Longchamp in 1190. Another son was Hugh, who became chancellor for King Philip II of France. Both Henry and Hugh were the sons of the bishop's long term mistress, Alice de Percy. Alice may have been the mother of two more of the bishop's sons, William, archdeacon of Northumberland, and Burchard, archdeacon of Durham and treasurer of York. He had a number of other mistresses but Alice was the most public, so much so that it caused a scandal, <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> resembled a marriage.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to Edmontosaurus <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> related genera. The tumors may {{have been caused by}} environmental factors or genetic propensity.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, the {{earliest}} {{examples of the}} use of Taylor series <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> related methods were given by Madhava of Sangamagrama. Though no record of his work survives, writings of later Indian mathematicians suggest that he found a number of special cases of the Taylor series, including those for the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics further expanded his works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Jessica {{was born}} in Falmouth, Massachusetts to Lisa Blair Hathaway and Lloyd Dubroff {{and moved to the}} San Francisco Bay Area in California when she was four. Although billed by the media as a pilot, Dubroff did not possess a medical {{certificate}} or a student pilot certificate, since they require a minimum age of 16, or a pilot certificate that requires a minimum age of 17, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. There was also no record-keeping body {{at the time of her}} trip recognizing any feats by underage pilots. Nevertheless, local, national, and international news media picked up and publicized her story, <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> followed her attempt until its tragic ending.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{views the}} brachiopods <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> related phoronids as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs because their lophophores are driven by one cilium per cell, while those of bryozoans, which he regards as protosomes, have multiple cilia per cell. However, pterobranchs are hemichordates and probably closely related to echinoderms, {{and there is no}} evidence that the latest common ancestor of pterobranchs and other hemichordates or the latest common ancestor of hemichordates and echinoderms was sessile and fed by means of tentacles.|$|E

5|$|Russulaceae {{are also}} an {{important}} group of orchid mycorrhizal fungi. This symbiosis is mutualistic {{in the case of}} green orchids, but a partly or fully epiparasitic relationship in the case of myco-heterotrophic and mixotrophic orchids, respectively. In some cases, the association with Russulaceae is, as in monotropoid mycorrhiza, very specific: the Mediterranean orchid Limodorum abortivum predominantly associates with Russula delica <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> related species; in Corallorhiza maculata, different genotypes of the same species have distinct Russula partners.|$|E

5|$|The Wallachian Revolution of 1848 was a Romanian {{liberal and}} {{nationalist}} uprising in the Principality of Wallachia. Part of the Revolutions of 1848, <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> {{connected with the}} unsuccessful revolt in the Principality of Moldavia, it sought to overturn the administration imposed by Imperial Russian authorities under the Regulamentul Organic regime, and, through many of its leaders, demanded the abolition of boyar privilege. Led {{by a group of}} young intellectuals and officers in the Wallachian Militia, the movement succeeded in toppling the ruling Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government and a Regency, and in passing a series of major progressive reforms, first announced in the Proclamation of Islaz.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} to meat was unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred {{for the quality}} of the meat and the Ardennais <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> related Auxois were considered to have some of the lowest quality meat. In addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French slaughterhouses were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse in prices then forced the National Stud to redirect its draft horse-related activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} for the Legislative Assembly held on 2 April 1955 was a lively <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> fought affair, with several new political parties joining the fray. Unlike previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly {{defeated in the}} election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning Labour Front was the biggest winner with ten seats and it formed a coalition government with the UMNO-MCA Alliance, which won three seats. Another new party, the leftist People's Action Party (PAP), won three seats.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Ernst Mayr {{was influenced}} by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch showing the influence of local environmental factors on the geographic distribution of sub-species <b>and</b> <b>closely</b> related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book Systematics and the Origin of Species, which emphasized the importance of allopatric speciation in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when the geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of mechanisms for reproductive isolation. Mayr also formulated the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.|$|E
