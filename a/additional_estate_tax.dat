50|$|The sponge tax was a US state-level {{estate tax}} {{linked to the}} {{calculation}} of the federal estate tax. States with this tax collected the amount allowable as a tax credit to the federal estate tax if paid in state estate taxes.

[...] On June 13, 2013, Inslee signed an <b>additional</b> <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> into law. The estate tax had bipartisan support and passed the Senate in a 30-19 vote.|$|E

P.L. 107-16 amended Code Section 2001 to change the rate to 49% in 2003, going down by 1% each year through 2009.

50|$|To {{provide the}} needed subsidy, the urban renewal district, or TIF district, is {{essentially}} always drawn around {{hundreds or thousands}} of acres of <b>additional</b> real <b>estate</b> (beyond the project site) to provide the needed borrowing capacity for the project or projects. The borrowing capacity is established by committing all normal yearly future real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> increases from every parcel in the TIF district (for 20-25 years, or more) along with the anticipated new tax revenue eventually coming from the project or projects themselves. If the projects are public improvements paying no real <b>estate</b> <b>taxes,</b> all of the repayment will come from the adjacent properties within the TIF district.|$|R

5000|$|The {{gift tax}} is a {{backstop}} to the United States <b>estate</b> <b>tax.</b> Without the gift <b>tax,</b> large <b>estates</b> {{could be reduced}} by simply giving the money away prior to death, and thus escape any potential <b>estate</b> <b>tax.</b> Gifts above the annual exemption amount act to reduce the lifetime gift tax exclusion.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to reform the current real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> system and establish the real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> system suitable for China’s national conditions. Design/methodology: Based on the necessity of the real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> reform, the paper studies the system optimization and its effects analysis of the real <b>estate</b> <b>tax.</b> At last, the paper uses the system dynamics to demonstrate the feasibility of the real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> from an empirical point. Findings: With the system dynamics, we can establish the causal relationship of the influence factors and forecast the impact on the future real estate prices. It can also provide some suggestions for China’s real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> reform. Research limitations/implications: The establishment of the model might not be very mature, so we need the further study and improvement. Originality/value: This study was the first to use system dynamics to analyze the impact of real <b>estate</b> <b>taxes</b> on real <b>estate</b> prices, and we hope to provide some suggestions for China’s real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> reform. </p...|$|R

40|$|One {{criticism}} of the <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> is that it prevents the owners of family businesses from passing their enterprises onto their children. The {{problem is that it}} may be difficult to pay <b>estate</b> <b>taxes</b> without liquidating the business. A natural question is why individuals with such concerns do not purchase enough life insurance to meet their <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities. This paper examines whether and how people use life insurance to deal with the <b>estate</b> <b>tax.</b> We find that, other things being the same, business owners purchase more life insurance than other individuals. However, on the margin, their insurance purchases are less responsive to <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> considerations and they are less likely to have the wherewithal to meet <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities out of liquid assets plus insurance. ...|$|R

40|$|Everyone {{is aware}} of the federal income tax. What many do not realize is that federal <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> may have a bigger impact than the income tax. While the income tax {{decreases}} take-home pay, the <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> threatens job creation, business growth, and family harmony. This article examines the impact of the federal <b>estate</b> <b>taxes</b> and reviews several studies which indicate that the <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> has a deleterious impact on capital accumulation, business growth, job creation, and federal tax revenues. The Perception Many assume that the <b>estate</b> <b>tax,</b> unlike the income tax, will affect them only if they have large estates. In a way, they are right. The <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> does not exact a tax unless there is a taxable estate of $ 600, 000 or more (including any taxable gifts made during the estate owner’s lifetime). But these days, owning a home, a modest investment portfolio, life insurance, retirement benefits, and per-haps business property can easily give someone an estate in the taxable range. In fact, the majority of federal <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> returns filed are filed by estates with a gross value of $ 600, 000 to $ 1, 000, 000. Many people believe the <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> will not apply to them regardless of the value of their estates because they are leaving all their property to their spouses. This is true under current <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> law, which provides an unlimited marital deduction. However, many people die without a surviving spouse. What will happen when the surviving spouse dies? The use of the marital deduction does not eliminate <b>estate</b> <b>tax,</b> it simply defers it until the surviving spouse dies. The Reality Even if an estate is not subject to it, the <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> can dramatically affect the owner’s family. Owners of closely held businesses are among those people hard-est hit: the lowest <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> rate is nearly as high as the highest income tax rate. To illustrate, consider a business owner whose business and personal as-sets produce a taxable estate of $ 2 million. The <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> due on the busines...|$|R

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of real estate-urbanization relationship, real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> is closely link to urbanization. As {{an important component of}} land urbanization, the number of real estates is positively correlated to the rate of urbanization. As urbanization progresses, real estate prices increases, and hence, increases the amount of real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> revenue; this increment can be used to provide better public services, construct urban infrastructures, and promote the development of real estate industry. In addition, the scarcity of land does not affect real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> as greatly as it affects land finance; real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> allows for a more sustainable tax revenue as compared with land finance, and using real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> to replace land finance helps the modernization of China’s tax system. In addition, real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> may help regulate and control the real estate market, curbing speculative demand and transforming the speculation-oriented market to a consumption-oriented one. Real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> is helpful in pushing forward a healthy development of real estate industry, and it is also helpful in improving the urban housing guarantee system, another important part of urbanization system.|$|R
