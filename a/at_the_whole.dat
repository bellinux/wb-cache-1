25|$|Unlike Montreal, Toronto was a {{homogeneous}} {{town at the}} linguistic level; English was the common language of all main ethnic and religious groups inhabiting it. By comparison, the Montreal {{of the time of}} governor Metcalfe (1843–45) counted 27,908 Canadians, the majority French-speaking, and 15,668 immigrants from the British Isles. The statistics were similar when looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> county of Montreal. In 1857 Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the new capital.|$|E
25|$|Multi-level {{selection}} {{theory suggests}} that selection operates {{on more than one}} level: for example, it may operate at an atomic and molecular level in cells, at the level of cells in the body, and then again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> organism level, and the community level, and the species level. Any level which is not competitive with others of the same level will be eliminated, even if the level below is highly competitive. A classic example is that of genes which prevent cancer. Cancer cells divide uncontrollably, and at the cellular level, they are very successful, because they are (in the short term) reproducing very well and out competing other cells in the body. However, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> organism level, cancer is often fatal, and so may prevent reproduction. Therefore, changes to the genome which prevent cancer (for example, by causing damaged cells to act co-operatively by destroying themselves) are favoured. Multi-level selection theory contends that similar effects can occur, for example, to cause individuals to co-operate to avoid behaviours which favour themselves short-term, but destroy the community (and their descendants) long term.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{it can be}} {{more useful}} {{to look at a}} {{specific}} region of the ROC Curve rather than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> curve. It is possible to compute partial AUC. For example, one could focus on the region of the curve with low false positive rate, which is often of prime interest for population screening tests. Another common approach for classification problems in which P ≪ N (common in bioinformatics applications) is to use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the BBC {{broadcast}} The Blue Planet, {{a series}} on {{the natural history of}} the world's oceans. It received critical acclaim, high viewing figures, audience appreciation ratings, and many awards. It also became a hugely profitable global brand, eventually being sold to 150 countries worldwide. Feedback showed that audiences particularly liked the epic scale, the scenes of new and unusual species and the cinematic quality of the series. Programme commissioners were keen for a follow-up, so Alastair Fothergill decided that the Natural History Unit should repeat the formula with a series looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> planet. The idea for Planet Earth was born, and the series was commissioned by Lorraine Heggessey, then Controller of BBC One, in January 2002.|$|E
25|$|If the Roman {{is based}} upon a {{historical}} figure, it is probably Fergus of Galloway. The Roman has been upheld by many modern critics for its highly sophisticated use of parody, parody directed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> genre of Arthurian romance. It had been suggested by earlier scholars such as Dominicia Legge that the work was produced under the patronage of Alan, Lord of Galloway, but this idea is now rejected by most scholars, {{for a variety of}} reasons, including the Roman's satirisation of Fergus (Alan's great-grandfather). Recently, it has been proposed by D.D.R. Owen that it was written for the entertainment of the Scottish court of William I, and that the author was none other than William Malveisin, a royal clerk who rose to hold both the Bishopric of Glasgow and St Andrews. Also noted by scholars is the Roman's extensive knowledge of the geography of southern Scotland, which is in general depicted in an exceedingly accurate manner. This is in contrast to most other works of the genre, in which geography is vague and unrealistic.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the images}} connect back to his earlier works. The images of life as boat adrift with a leak {{is similar to the}} [...] "Death by Water" [...] section of The Waste Land. Like images about old age and {{experience}} found in East Coker, this image reinforces the need to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of life and try to see things beyond the limitations of time. Men are supposed to progress, but they aren't supposed to focus on what they can gain in the future. The prayer to the Virgin Mary is intended to help guide the journey which would end with understanding eternity and the Annunciation. It is Mary who will guide the metaphorical sailors to their proper harbour. While connecting back to his earlier works, Eliot also connects back to his family's past; the [...] "Dry Salvages" [...] was part of the landscape his ancestor Andrew Eliott travelled to in 1669.|$|E
500|$|Smith gave varying {{types of}} revelations. Some were temporal, {{while others were}} spiritual or doctrinal.

An 1831 revelation called [...] "The Law" [...] contained: directions for missionary work; rules for organizing society in Zion; a reiteration of the Ten Commandments; an injunction to [...] "administer {{to the poor and}} needy"; and an outline for the law of consecration. An 1832 revelation called [...] "The Vision" [...] added to the fundamentals of sin and atonement, and introduced doctrines of life after salvation,exaltation, and a heaven with degrees of glory. Another 1832 revelation [...] "on Priesthood" [...] was the first to explain priesthood doctrine. Three months later, Smith gave a lengthy revelation called the [...] "Olive Leaf" [...] containing themes of cosmology and eschatology, and discussing subjects such as light, truth, intelligence, and sanctification; a related revelation given in 1833 put Christ at the center of salvation.|$|E

500|$|Between 1965 and 1972, almost 300 Americans – mostly {{civil rights}} activists, {{teachers}} and pastors – traveled to North Vietnam to see firsthand the war {{situation with the}} Vietnamese. [...] News media in the United States would only provide the official view from Washington, and American travelers to Vietnam were routinely harassed upon their return to the States. [...] Fonda also visited Vietnam, traveling to Hanoi in July 1972 to witness firsthand the bombing damage to the dikes. After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam, she said the United States had been intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River. Columnist Joseph Kraft, who was also touring North Vietnam, said he believed {{the damage to the}} dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that, if the U.S. Air Force were [...] "truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way". Sweden's ambassador to Vietnam, however, observed the bomb damage to the dikes and described it as [...] "methodic". Other journalists reported that the attacks were [...] "aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> system of dikes".|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived.

But it built a huge hurdle {{for me to get}} over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E
500|$|Several reporters {{reviewed}} Slipknot's headlining slot at England's Download Festival on June 13, 2009. Greg Cochrane, {{writing for}} the BBC, championed Slipknot as [...] "spectacular headliners", explaining: [...] "Flame throwers, pneumatic drum kits and mass screaming, it has it all." [...] NME said Slipknot's performance [...] "saw the Main Stage become a scene of chaos", noting how the band members [...] "roamed the stage randomly smashing the set up with baseball bats, throwing barrels around and hanging off [...] revolving drumkit." [...] Ian Strachan of The Sun rated their performance an 8 out of 10, reporting that [...] "the tunes were tight and delivered with venom." [...] He also cited a moment during [...] "Spit It Out" [...] in which Taylor got the crowd to crouch down and jump up all at once as [...] "one of the stand out moments of the festival." [...] Christa Ktorides of Clickmusic said, [...] "The sight of 70,000people sitting down on command is something we won't long forget." [...] She also described their performance as [...] "simply ferocious." [...] Metal Hammer reviewer Ted Bezer called it [...] "arguably the greatest headline performance of the Download era", adding, [...] "Slipknot absolutely destroyed 70,000people {{in a way that}} it didn’t seem was possible." [...] He declared the performance of [...] "Duality" [...] the best moment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> festival.|$|E

500|$|Others saw no {{intentional}} snub of Colbert by the press. Responding to {{a question}} about why The Washington Posts article about the dinner did not go into any detail about Colbert's speech, Media Backtalk writer Howard Kurtz responded, [...] "The problem in part is one of deadline. The presses were already rolling by the time Colbert came on at 10:30, so the story had to be largely written by then." [...] Asked why television news favored Bush's performance over Colbert's, Elizabeth Fishman, an assistant dean at the Columbia School of Journalism and a former 60 Minutes producer, told MTV that the [...] "quick hit" [...] for television news shows would have been to use footage of Bush standing beside his impersonator. [...] "It's an easier set up for visual effect", she noted. Steve Scully, president of the White House Correspondents' Association (which hosted the dinner) and political editor of C-SPAN (which broadcast the dinner), scoffed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> idea of the press intentionally ignoring Colbert: [...] "Bush hit such a home run with Steve Bridges that he got all of the coverage. I think that exceeded expectations. There was no right-wing conspiracy or left-wing conspiracy." [...] Time columnist Ana Marie Cox dismissed allegations of a deliberate media blackout, because Colbert's performance received coverage in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the major wire services. Fellow commentator Kurtz concurred, noting that the video was carried on C-SPAN and was freely available online; he also played two clips on his own show. [...] "Apparently I didn't get the memo," [...] he said.|$|E
