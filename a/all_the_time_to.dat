5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In {{the case of an}} electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E

25|$|Habitats and biota do {{frequently}} change. Therefore, {{it follows}} that the process of adaptation is never finally complete. Over time, it may happen that the environment changes little, and the species comes to fit its surroundings better and better. On the other hand, it may happen that changes in the environment occur relatively rapidly, and then the species becomes less and less well adapted. Seen like this, adaptation is a genetic tracking process, which goes on <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> some extent, but especially when the population cannot or does not move to another, less hostile area. Given enough genetic change, as well as specific demographic conditions, an adaptation may be enough to bring a population back from the brink of extinction in a process called evolutionary rescue. It should be noted that adaptation does affect, to some extent, every species in a particular ecosystem.|$|E

30|$|The {{asymmetry}} {{in buildings}} {{may be due}} to the uneven distribution of mass and/or stiffness of the structural members. In the past, many such asymmetric buildings have got severe damage during the seismic events. To prevent such damage, the eccentricity which is produced due to irregular distribution of mass and/or stiffness should be avoided. However, it may not be possible <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> eccentricity due to stringent architectural and functional requirements, hence in such cases, the use of energy dissipation devices shall be beneficial to minimize the lateral–torsional responses.|$|R

According to Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal, the narrator describes her attempts {{to overcome a}} failed relationship through binge eating and alcohol, as indicated in the lyrics about having the munchies, eating Twinkies, and throwing up during the first verse. In the chorus, she sings about drug abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> keep you off my mind". According to Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, in the bridge, Lo approaches the theme of [...] "knowing—at some level—just how empty and self-obliterating her choices really are", as she talks about needing to take someone home in order to relieve her suffering. The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her {{favorite part of the}} track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D. Larson considered the song's message untrue because [...] "staying high does not keep anyone off your mind".|$|E
500|$|The sibling aliens Kang and Kodos first {{appeared}} on the show on this episode. Every Treehouse of Horror episode since this one must have Kang and Kodos as characters, states an unofficial Simpsons rule. Despite this rule, the writers say the duo will often be forgotten and then added at the last second, leading to brief appearances. The idea of Kang and Kodos came from Kogen and Wolodarsky. In the script, Kang and Kodos were shown as [...] "an octopus in a space helmet with a trail of goo". The finished design {{was based on the}} cover of an EC Comics issue. Although originally designed to constantly drool, Groening suggested that they not drool <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make the animation process easier. However, the animators did not mind the work, leading to the drooling staying in the script. Kang and Kodos's names are derived from two [...] characters. Kang was a Klingon captain portrayed by actor Michael Ansara in the episode [...] "Day of the Dove", whereas Kodos the Executioner was a human villain from [...] "The Conscience of the King". Harry Shearer voices Kang, and Dan Castellaneta voices Kodos.|$|E

30|$|Security: Businesses that handle excess cash {{at their}} {{premises}} cited {{the use of}} ICTs to aid security of their operations {{through the use of}} point of sale machines that provided customers with an option to swipe for their payments using bank credit or debit cards. This was a major driver to the use of ICTs by these type of SMEs as they did not require frequent visits to banks to make deposits and the security needed to escort them. Another use of ICTs for security was the implementation of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) which used cameras connected to a network that were placed strategically and were able to provide live pictures of the area under surveillance whilst recording it. In this manner, business premises were able <b>to</b> be monitored <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> avoid thefts and for accountability purposes.|$|R

NBC responded by creating an initial run of 4,000bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately. The creator of the show, Greg Daniels, joked about the bobbleheads, saying [...] "Yes, they are fun, but they also serve a business purpose.

2500|$|Joan Quigley {{first met}} Nancy Reagan in the 1970s on The Merv Griffin Show. After Ronald Reagan became president, {{and after the}} attempt on his life on March 30, 1981, Nancy asked Quigley {{if she could have}} foreseen, and {{possibly}} prevented, the assassination attempt. Quigley answered affirmatively, saying that she could have done so had she been looking at the time. At that point, Nancy Reagan enlisted Quigley's astrological advice on a regular basis, and held frequent telephone conversations with Quigley. Explaining why she turned to Quigley, Nancy later wrote, [...] "Very few people can understand what it's like to have your husband shot at and almost die, and then have him exposed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> enormous crowds, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom might be a lunatic with a gun....

In England you lot don't know where she came from. She was on TV every week from 7 years old. It makes it harder for her when she gets Louis Walsh's rather pathetic jibes – one of which is she hasn't had a hit record and that's just not true."

30|$|WSN are energy limited so {{typically}} the nodes cannot keep radios active <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> having <b>to</b> sleep and {{to wake up}} periodically [21]. Addressing this issue, there have been proposed several MAC protocols which were categorized as synchronous or asynchronous MAC protocols. Although asynchronous protocols are simpler, they tend to consume more energy. But in WSN, where energy must be saved, a different approach may be used. One possibility is to use synchronous methods. Using these protocols, some techniques are adopted to increase the nodes lifetime: (i) duty cycling and (ii) scheduled rendezvous.|$|R
