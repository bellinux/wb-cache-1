5000|$|In 1947, it was {{subsequently}} designated {{as part of}} a proposed <b>Arab</b> <b>state</b> by the United Nations (UN) partition plan for Palestine. The resolution recommended partition of the British Mandate into a Jewish <b>State,</b> an <b>Arab</b> <b>State,</b> and an internationally administered enclave of Jerusalem; a broader region of the modern-day West Bank was assigned to the <b>Arab</b> <b>State.</b> The resolution designated the territory described as [...] "the hill country of Samaria and Judea" [...] (including what is now also known as the [...] "West Bank") as part of the proposed <b>Arab</b> <b>state,</b> but following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War this area was captured by Transjordan (renamed Jordan two years after independence in 1946).|$|R

5|$|When the QIZ program {{came into}} being in 1996, {{observers}} regarded it {{as a vehicle to}} support the development of peaceful relations and normalization of commercial ties between Israel and the two <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> (Jordan and Egypt) with which it had signed peace treaties. In both cases, however, a tenuous peace continues to prevail between Israel and the two <b>Arab</b> <b>states.</b> Since the conclusion of the JordanIsrael peace treaty in October 1994, large numbers of Jordanians, particularly fundamentalists, those of Palestinian origin, and members of the professional unions continue to oppose normalization with Israel and resist the expansion of commercial relations. With the establishment of 13 QIZs in Jordan, there has been an increase in the volume of bilateral trade, though the overall totals remain modest.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of a {{coalition}} of <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> in the 1967 Six-Day War, major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored {{by any of the}} involved <b>Arab</b> <b>states,</b> such as the Arab Nationalist Movement led by George Habash and the Palestine Liberation Army of Ahmad Shukeiri, lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the Palestinian National Council (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any guerrilla group), thus strengthening al-Wazir's position. During the Battle of Karameh, in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist. This eventually led to him staking command of al-Assifa, holding major positions in the PNC, and the Supreme Military Council of the PLO. He was also put in charge of guerrilla warfare operations in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel proper.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, since Willy Brandt {{had become}} {{chancellor}} in 1969, {{there had been}} a change of the West German attitude towards the Arab–Israeli conflict. The earlier conservative governments had been considered pointedly pro-Israel (especially during the mid-1960s with the Six-Day War), which had resulted in a number of <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> breaking off diplomatic relations to West Germany. With Egypt and Tunisia, these had only been restored shortly before the 1972 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Gulf War in 1990–91, {{when the}} Intifada's {{intensity}} began to wear down, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. He made this decision {{without the consent}} of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO. Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the Abu Nidal Organization. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO and began providing financial support for the organization's rival Hamas and other Islamist groups. Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992, when an Air Bissau aircraft he was a passenger on crash-landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm. Two pilots and an engineer were killed; Arafat was bruised and shaken.|$|E

5|$|The evicted {{residents}} were mostly Jewish immigrants from <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> whose weak financial status left them vulnerable to Kollek's plan. The following steep increase in real-estate values of formerly depressed areas like Mamilla near the former armistice {{line and the}} Old City was perceived by evicted Mizrahi Jews as an injustice. This became a key issue in 1970s Israeli social upheaval and {{the founding of the}} Black Panthers movement in Israel.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the 1948 War, {{referred}} to as the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, started following the ratification of UN Resolution 181 on November 29, 1947, which granted Israel the mandate to declare independence. This was declared on May 14, 1948 and the next night, the armies of a number of <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> invaded Israel and attacked Israeli positions.|$|E
5|$|Although early {{assertions of}} a {{distinct}} Mangalorean Catholic identity {{date from the}} migration period, a developed Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity only emerged following the captivity.

After migration, they adopted some aspects of the local Mangalorean culture, but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions, and like their Goan ancestors, modern Mangalorean Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture. The Mangalorean Catholic diaspora is mostly concentrated in the <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> of the Persian Gulf and the English-speaking world.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with his ideology, Arafat generally {{refused to accept}} donations to his organization from major Arab governments, in order to act independently of them. He {{did not want to}} alienate them, and sought their undivided support by avoiding ideological alliances. However, to establish the groundwork for Fatah's future financial support, he enlisted contributions from the many wealthy Palestinians working in Kuwait and other <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> of the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar (where he met Mahmoud Abbas in 1961). These businessmen and oil workers contributed generously to the Fatah organization. Arafat continued this process in other Arab countries, such as Libya and Syria.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the terms of the}} Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas. However, <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt.|$|E

5|$|Israel retaliated against Egyptian {{shelling}} with commando raids, artillery shelling and air strikes.

Nasser ceased all military activities and began a program to build a network of internal defenses, while receiving the financial backing of various <b>Arab</b> <b>states.</b> The war resumed in March 1969. In November, Nasser brokered an agreement between the PLO and the Lebanese military that granted Palestinian guerrillas {{the right to use}} Lebanese territory to attack Israel.|$|E
5|$|Nasser died {{unexpectedly}} in November 1970, with Gaddafi {{playing a}} prominent role at his funeral. Nasser was succeeded by Anwar Sadat, who suggested that rather than creating a unified state, the <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> should create a political federation, implemented in April 1971; in doing so, Egypt, Syria and Sudan received large grants of Libyan oil money. In February 1972, Gaddafi and Sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger, {{but it was never}} implemented because relations broke down the following year. Sadat became increasingly wary of Libya's radical direction, and the September 1973 deadline for implementing the Federation passed by with no action taken.|$|E
