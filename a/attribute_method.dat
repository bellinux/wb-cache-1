So, a relational database schema or a data warehouse prototype cannot be easily mapped and reused in multiple DSS projects. In this paper we propose an object-oriented (OO) approach and an OO database schema to accomplish the DSS implementation which require a multidimensional modeling at the conceptual level using fundamental concepts of OO (class, <b>attribute,</b> <b>method,</b> object, polymorphism, inheritance, hierarchy) to represent all multidimensional properties of a data warehouse, at both the structural and dynamic levels.

40|$|Most {{research}} on attribute identification in database integration {{has focused on}} integrating attributes using schema and summary information derived from the attribute values. No research has attempted to fully explore the use of attribute values to perform attribute identification. We propose an <b>attribute</b> identification <b>method</b> that employs schema and summary instance information as well as properties of attributes derived from their instances. Unlike other <b>attribute</b> identification <b>methods</b> that match only single <b>attributes,</b> our <b>method</b> matches <b>attribute</b> groups for integration.

Retrieval and classification experiments are performed on a database of 1320 images taken from 44 Brodatz classes.

The study area is located around Miyakejima volcanic island, where an intensive earthquake swarm was observed associated with 2000 Miyakejima eruption. Seismic reflection {{survey was conducted}} {{five months after the}} swarm initiation in order to clarify crustal structure around the hypocenters of the swarm activity. However, the resulting seismic reflection profiles were unable to provide significant information of deep structures around the hypocenters. The authors newly applied a seismic <b>attribute</b> <b>method</b> that focused seismic attenuation instead of reflectivity to the volcanic area, and designed this paper to assess the applicability of this method to subsurface structural studies in poorly reflective volcanic areas. Resulting seismic attenuation profiles successfully figured out attenuation structures around the Miyakejima volcanic island. Interestingly, a remarkable high-attenuation zone was detected between Miyakejima and Kozushima islands, being well correlated with the hypocenter distribution of the earthquake swarm in 2000. The high-attenuation zone is interpreted as a fractured area that was developed by magma activity responsible for the earthquake swarms that have been repeatedly occurring there. The present study can be one example showing the applicability of seismic attenuation profiling in a volcanic area.|$|E

Over the past few years, several methods and frameworks {{have been developed for}} cloud service discovery but they are mostly designed for all cloud computing models in general which are not optimal. The three cloud computing models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), each computing model has its own set of resources. Having one single discovery framework for all three is not very efficient and the implementation of such a framework is complex with lots of overhead.

This research proposes a cloud service discovery framework focusing on IaaS and PaaS cloud computing models. Our framework is using a syntax-based query engine at its core and uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) for storing cloud service information.

The study uses Factorial Randomized Block Design (FRBD). The first factor is the method of drying the fiber, i. e. sun drying and wind drying. The second factor is the type of fixation materials that is alum, quicklime (calcium oxide), and iron or tunjung. The best treatment result using Multiple <b>Attribute</b> <b>method</b> is sun drying with quicklime (CaO) fixator on the concentration of 15 % (w/v). Color intensity value that is brightness L* 46. 8, a* value (red color intensity) 24. 13 and b* value (yellow color intensity) 16. 93; the color difference is 13. 6 which means a big influence exists. The dryness and wetness test shows SS (Staining Scale) value of 4 (good) and 4 (good). The color durability test for shows SS value of 4 - 5 (good) and GS (Gray Scale) value of 4 (good). The result of color intensity test of L* indicates that the alum fixator can bind L* (brightness level) more strongly. Quicklime fixator is capable of binding the value of a* (red color) and b* (yellow color) more strongly. The fixation material of iron produces weaker L*, a* and b* values. The sun dried coir of Kelapa Gading binds more red (a*) and yellow (b*) color.

40|$|The biomass employ {{for energy}} {{purposes}} {{is the subject}} of debate and controversy, especially as regards the use of plant species of interest to food and agricultural land. Indeed, the cultivation of plant species for energy enables diversification of agricultural activities, the recovery of wild areas or the exploitation of land not suitable to food production, but requires the use of resources and energy, which must then assess the environmental impacts. The use of biomass in the energy production is a complex issue that involves many aspects such as the knowledge of the actual extractability in a given territory, the chemical and physical properties, the availability of efficient technologies for energy conversion and last, but not least, the management of the supply chain. This aspect is very important when using residual biomass. This doctoral thesis has been carried out to evaluate the biomass energy production in Sardinia, considering the availability and the distribution of these resources in the region, the economic and environmental context. Specifically, it has been taken into account the potential of plant, residual and algal biomass. In this work are examined the main technologies used for biomass energy conversion, with a special reference to thermochemical and biochemical processes. In the thermochemical, combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, pyro gasification, hydrogen production are described. In the biochemical, anaerobic digestion and energy production from microalgae are illustrated. The biorefinery concept is highlighted and the major hurdles to the production of energy from biomass are considered. The amount and distribution of biomass in the whole region in terms of dedicated crops, both agricultural residues and agro-industrial are subjected to a detailed analysis. It is also evaluated the potential energy of each resource and the thermochemical and biochemical energy conversion technologies are identified as the most practicable {{with a high degree of}} effectiveness in Sardinia. Regional planning of the biomass energy production requires the exact calculation of the energy needs, the mapping of all the resources available and finally, the definition and implementation of specific strategies. The Biomass Regional Plan is viewed in the overall Regional Action Plan for Renewable Energy and the detailed strategy for this sector is illustrated. Particular emphasis has been given to the segment of the residual biomass because these represent available low cost raw materials for energy production, but are also very important from an environmental point of view. The results of many tests carried out on a pilot plant for anaerobic digestion, are showed in detail. Several tests were carried out by the treatment of the residue of the vegetable market of Sardinia, the waste of the processing of potatoes and the by-products of the oil and dairy industry in the co-digestion with energy crops. To identify the specific relations between the most significant variables for the process, even when subjected to a wide range of variation, the multivariate statistical analysis was employed. The forest biomass have a wide use in the thermal energy production in large areas of the planet. The largest share of biomass fuel comes from the woods and is represented from the direct combustion of the trees or the forestry residues. The construction of a forest biomass-energy chain, however, must take into account many technical, economic and environmental aspects. A study in Ogliastra, for the assessment of availability and distribution of forest biomass, targeted planning of a specific energy supply chain is presented. The study required a methodology of recognition and assessment of forest resources based on GIS method with the use of soil paper integrated with the vegetation chart. The forest biomass have been subjected to a chemical-physical analysis for the evaluation of the energy potential of the territory. The choice of the best energy conversion technology was performed by applying a multi <b>attribute</b> <b>method</b> (MADM). The ability of algal biomass to grow rapidly and to store high amounts of oil has long been known and a lot of studies have been undertaken to make possible its use in replacing fossil fuels. To achieve this goal is necessary to maximize the microalgae yield and know the influence of different variables on their growth. The results of the growth conditions study of the Nannochloropsis oculata, species suitable for the oil production and aquaculture, using two sizes of reactors (6 l and 120 l) of the type "bubble column" is presented. The main parameters influencing microalgal growth and their interactions are studied through the approach of the design of experiment (DoE). The growth of microalgae is modelled using the modified Gompertz equation. This model allowed calculating the specific speed of growth and to determinate the biomass and oil productivity. The evaluation of the influence of nitrates concentration has made to assess the use of the Nannochloropsis oculata, contextually in the treatment of waste water and in the oil production. The energy characterization of the algal biomass, obtained in the different operating conditions, complete the study. In summary, the plant, residual and algal biomass, may be relevant not only for the energy sector, but also for the whole agro-industrial economy of the island. The biomasses are totally renewable raw materials and can allow to completely rethinking the agro-industrial production. A new approach is the application of the biorefinery concept that allows designing integrated production systems with the production of foods, animal feeds, chemicals and energy, achieving great benefits from an economical and environmental point of view. A plant biomass, widely available in Sardinia, is represented by the artichoke that residues at the end of the culture. Sardinia is, in fact, the third largest producer of this Italian Ortiva with about 12, 000 ha divided into four basins in different parts of the region. The crop wastes amount, is estimated prudentially, to about 180, 000 t a- 1 and is theoretically possible to exploit these to obtain energy, chemicals such as inulin and phenolic substances for food and pharmaceutical industry, fresh and processed vegetable fibres for packaging use. This will require in the future a specific research to assess the real feasibility, but the sector seems to be certainly promising...|$|E
