5|$|A $70 million {{renovation}} of <b>airport</b> <b>facilities,</b> designed by Brubaker, Brandt Inc., was initiated in 1979 for the airport's 50th anniversary and completed in 1981. This upgraded the airport's capacity to 250 flights per day by adding {{what is known}} today as Concourse B and added fully enclosed jetways at every gate. Ten years later in 1989, a second, $15.5 million, seven-gate south concourse (now Concourse A) was dedicated. The concourse was used exclusively by US Airways at the time, and later housed hubs for both America West Airlines until 2003, and Skybus Airlines until they shut it down in 2008 due to their bankruptcy. A north concourse was completed in 1996, which is now Concourse C, and was expanded in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{surge of}} air travellers, catalyzed by {{low-cost}} carriers {{and the rise}} of air-transport demands among Indonesia's rising middle class, has put intense stress on Indonesia's aging airports. Nevertheless, there has been some efforts to improve and upgrade <b>airport</b> <b>facilities,</b> such as the construction of Medan's brand-new Kuala Namu Airport to replace the overwhelmed, aging, and accident-prone Polonia Airport. Other newly built airports include Lombok Airport, replacing the old Selaparang Airport in Lombok; and Minangkabau Airport, replacing the old Tabing Airport in Padang. Existing airports that have undergone massive expansion and upgrades include Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Juanda Airport in Surabaya, and Sultan Hasanuddin Airport in Makassar. There are plans to build a second Bali airport in Kubu Tambahan near Singaraja, northern Bali, a new larger airport in Kulon Progo near Yogyakarta to replace the crowded and overwhelmed Adisutjipto Airport, and Kertajati Airport in Kertajati, Majalengka, to replace Bandung's Husein Sastranegara Airport and also to serve the vicinity of Cirebon. To improve transportation interconnectivity, the government plans to build railways connecting airports all over Indonesia with nearby city centers. Currently, only Kuala Namu and Adisutjipto airports have a railway connection to the city center, while airport railways are currently under construction in Soekarno–Hatta and Minangkabau airports.|$|E

25|$|A fast-growing {{population}} and rapidly expanding {{economy in the}} Minot region has been a boon to Minot International Airport, with annual passengers increasing from 66,000 in 2009 to 222,000 in 2013.

Accordingly, taxiway and runway improvements are being made and ground will soon be broken on a new terminal that can house three times as many gates as well as additional airlines, car rental facilities, and offer more amenities.|$|E

25|$|During the pre-war era, flying boats {{had been}} {{preferred}} for conducting long distance flights as, unlike their land-based counterparts, {{they were not}} limited by available runway length – the majority of which were still grass-surfaced at this point – and as a long range aeroplane {{would be required to}} carry a large load of fuel, a larger size of the aircraft could be permitted without needing to cater for factors such as limited runway and airfield sizes. In addition, for services to far-flung parts of the British Empire, the ability to land and take-off from any available area of water was a distinct advantage for services to such places, many of which at the time had no <b>airport</b> <b>facilities</b> at all. With the end of the Second World War, flying boats services were resumed with other types being operated, such as the Short Hythe, Short Sandringham, and Short Solent. However, the war had also produced a legacy of large runways and sizable airports formerly used for military purposes that could now meet the needs of a larger generation of land aircraft.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, SpiceJet {{announced}} up to 50 {{percent discount}} in air fares due to competition.

In December 2014, financial losses and unpaid dues led to cancellation of many domestic flights. Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued a warning to the airline over non-payment of salaries and dues and the carrier was put on cash-and-carry mode by airport operators, meaning the airline can use the <b>airport</b> <b>facilities</b> only upon prior payment of money. On 17 December 2014, all flights were grounded after oil companies refused to refuel its planes due to non-payment of dues with flights resuming the next day. [...] Flights resumed the next day.
