25|$|Bairro Alto is {{characterized}} by orthogonal blocks, sometimes rectangular, with a proportion of two lots wide by six or eight lots in length, {{with many of the}} length dimensions accompanying the roads, while the shorter dimensions following the lanes. This spatial configuration is not fixed completely within the district. For example, north of the Travessa da Queimada, the blocks, although maintaining a rectangular form, are of different dimensions, with the laneway-side representing those of longer length. This new orientation reflects the more open area of São Roque, associated with the Casa Professa dos Jesuítas, and marks the transition into {{the second phase of the}} Bairro's urbanization. The medium base for these lots is based on the medieval blocks known as chão (literally, ground), an agricultural measure representing <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>with</b> 60 palms length by 30 palms wide, equivalent to. It is this model that guides the blocks where the majority of the 16th and 17th century buildings are located.

Further, there are rare instances in the district where one lot may encompass an entire block, such as the Palace of Andrade and the Palace Ludovice.|$|E

500|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} the song began in the recording studio one morning at around 4:00a.m., when Timbaland recommended that Furtado should go home because she was tired. Furtado, who had heard that the band U2 (a band she says she deeply admires) wrote many of their songs in the studio control room, said [...] "Really? I'll show you", put on her hoodie and began to [...] "jam". Nate Hills and Timbaland soon joined her, writing and producing as they went, and according to Furtado, this process intensified as she sang. The team used four microphones in the live room and moved them around during recording, about which Furtado said, [...] "...when you listen to it—there's a lot of dimension. It kind of sounds like [...] in another country". Afterwards, they picked the best vocals and [...] "perfected" [...] them, before inserting [...] "reverbs and weird alien sounds" [...] onto them.

500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South.

I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came {{up with a way to}} tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>with</b> fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'" ...|$|E

500|$|Rather Ripped {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 34 reviews. In a review for the Toronto Star, Ben Rayner {{wrote that the}} band managed to condense all their expansive musical style into tighter songs [...] "without sacrificing the mercurial structures, subversive lyrical bent and reverence for noise that identify Sonic Youth as Sonic Youth". PopMatters editor Dave Heaton believed the album was a graceful and elegant way to end Sonic Youth's unique relationship with Geffen, describing it as a [...] "cohesive story about a band seeking {{the best way to}} take the reckless, brave spirits of free jazz, punk, and experimental music, and generate them within the confines of traditional rock song structure". He also praised Moore's lyrics, stating that [...] "his Beat-style poetry is especially evocative, and especially terse—a quality that fits well with an album that musically seems to be doing much the same, communicating <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>with</b> a little". Similarly, Dave Simpson of The Guardian felt that the band reinvented themselves with poppier songs, calling Rather Ripped [...] "an extraordinary state of affairs in Sonic Youth's 25th year".|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>with</b> Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to Manson's growing {{confidence}} and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals {{did not require}} much treatment; [...] "Shirley was singing so much better, and she was coming up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn't any point in doing <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>with</b> it. On something like 'Nobody Loves You' she sings really low on the verse, almost {{at the bottom of}} her range, and then and the end she's singing three and a half octaves higher, almost in falsetto, as the song turns into a big wall of sound", Vig remarked. Manson's original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on [...] "So Like a Rose" [...] was recorded on the first take. On some songs, however, Manson's vocal was subject to Pro Tools plug-ins and post effects. [...] "Til the Day Die" [...] featured a digital [...] "scratch"-effect, created by printing her vocal to DAT and using whatever edited passes sounded good. On [...] "Can't Cry These Tears", the four vocal parts were triple-tracked using different mikes, while a guitar riff was matched to her voice for a section of [...] "Breaking Up the Girl". On [...] "Cherry Lips", her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ'd. On slower songs such as [...] "Drive You Home", Garbage were not overly concerned with phrasing and pitch, giving it [...] "a rawer quality". Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.|$|E
