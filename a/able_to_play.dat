Orr returned to the lineup on November 8, 1975, {{the day after the}} Bruins traded Esposito to the New York Rangers.

The company originally explained that Australia and New Zealand servers would be located in Southeast Asia, pitting them against combatants from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. However, starting from patch 1.1.0, {{it was announced that}} the Southeast Asia/Australia/New Zealand version of the game would not be strictly region-locked, with gamers <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> on both the SEA/ANZ servers and the North American ones.|$|E
