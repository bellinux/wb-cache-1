5|$|Other natural {{patterns}} {{occur in}} foams; these are packed according to Plateau's laws, which require minimal surfaces. Such foams present {{a problem in}} how to pack cells <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> possible: in 1887, Lord Kelvin proposed a packing using only one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure, which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E

Depending on the paper used, plant pastes can dry in 10 to 15 minutes. The more {{absorbent}} the paper is, the faster it dries as the paper absorbs most of the oil. Also, plant pastes tend to smudge more easily than silk pastes due to the loose binding agent.|$|E

25|$|Safe sex {{commonly}} {{involves the}} use of condoms (also known as male condoms), but female condoms, which give women more control during the safe sex practice, may also be used; both condoms keep semen from coming in contact with the vagina, which can also help prevent unwanted pregnancy. There is, however, little research on whether female condoms are as effective as male condoms at preventing STIs, and they are slightly less effective than male condoms at preventing pregnancy, which {{may be due to the}} female condom not fitting <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> the male condom or because it can slip into the vagina and spill semen.|$|E
25|$|Unlike show hunter classes, which reward calmness and style, jumper classes require boldness, scope, power, accuracy, and control; speed {{also is a}} factor, {{especially}} in jump-off courses and speed classes (when time counts even in the first round). A jumper must jump big, bravely, and fast but also must be careful and accurate to avoid knockdowns and must be balanced and rideable in order to rate and turn accurately. The rider must choose the best line to each fence, saving ground with well-planned turns, and lines and must adjust the horse's stride for each fence and distance. In a jump-off, a rider must balance the need to go {{as fast as possible}} and turn <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> possible against the horse's ability to jump cleanly with good scope.|$|E

St. Louis Post-Dispatch writer Gail Pennington praised Williams' [...] "controlled performance" [...] as well as several [...] "terrific scenes". Among them, she said, were Gee's explanation of how police use humor as a buffer from the horrors of their jobs, and the scene where detectives simultaneously interrogate two suspects in different rooms, which she said was [...] "choreographed <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> the Bolshoi Ballet".|$|E

John Keegan of Critical Myth gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode puts Gibson’s genre credibility {{to good use}} by taking standard concepts of cyberpunk and applying them to the series." [...] He did note that there are [...] "a few minor characterization issues", and that [...] "not all of the concepts are pulled together <b>as</b> <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> they could be", but other than those points, he concluded that it was [...] "solid and [...] enjoyable". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. [...] The two wrote that its themes were [...] "fresh and new" [...] and that the plot had [...] "real heart to it"." [...] Shearman and Pearson wrote positively of Mulder's virtual experiencing, praising [...] "kickboxing Scully" [...] and calling her [...] "supercool". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote that, while [...] "William Gibson’s cyberpunk milieu wouldn’t necessarily {{seem to be the}} best fit for The X-Files", the episode [...] "weirdly benefits from the lack of staff oversight." [...] He noted that it featured many elements to its plot, but was [...] "a rare example of an X-Files episode that works, even though it tries to do too much." [...] VanDerWerff was complimentary towards the story and called it [...] "propulsive"; he was particularly praise-worthy of the fact that Scully was featured heavily in the episode. He cited the scene wherein a virtual Scully roundhouse kicks a group of nurses {{as one of the best}} shots in the episode, and called it a [...] "hysterical moment". Brett Love of TV Squad stated that it is his favorite episode of The X-Files, considering it a [...] "great story" [...] and describing it as a [...] "tough one to beat". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's directing and noted that the entry was [...] "a great improvement over The X-Files earlier A.I. episode, first season's [...] "Ghost in the Machine". Vitaris cited [...] "Mulder's virtual experience" [...] as the [...] "highlight of the episode".|$|E
