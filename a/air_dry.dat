5|$|The {{simplest}} classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is {{the most}} widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for Arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior <b>air</b> (<b>dry</b> air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate {{the stability of the}} atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w. While air mass identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.|$|E

The nose drill bits are used for creating and perfecting the nostrils of the doll. Acetone or a paint thinner medium is needed for removing the factory paint from the doll. Hair is an optional choice to add to a doll. Fine mohair, human hair, or wigs are usually used, but it is found in a variety of types. Rooting tools are utilized for this process and are available in numerous sizes 20,36,38, 40, and 42. The smaller the number the thicker the needle which will grab more hair and leave a bigger hole in the head of the doll. Eyes for a reborn doll are offered in a variety of brands and sizes.|$|E
500|$|The {{technique}} of reborning a play doll typically involves {{a number of}} steps. To begin the doll is taken apart and factory paint is removed. Then a blue color wash may be applied to {{give the appearance of}} realistic baby skin undertones. For dolls with an awake appearance eyes must be replaced. The outer layer of the vinyl doll is given its skin tone by adding dozens of layers of flesh colored paint. If heat set paints are used, the doll parts must be heat set by baking them inside an oven or by using a heatgun after each layer of paint is applied. Lighter skin tone dolls can take 15 to 30 layers. The effects of the blue color wash combined with the outside layers of paint creates the appearance of veins, and gives the doll its newborn mottled look. Manicured nails and opening of the nose holes are other details that are added during this process. [...] There are <b>air</b> <b>dry</b> paints now available to reborn artists, sold under several brand names. [...] Many feel that repeated baking of vinyl can cause it to break down over time. [...] In addition, there are fumes and chemicals released during the heating process.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} a simple, cost-effective, reliable fixation method for fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) yielding a specimen suitable for mail transport. STUDY DESIGN: Smears prepared from 59 FNABs of surgical specimens were fixed by continuous fixation in 95 % ethanol, spray fixation, <b>air</b> <b>drying,</b> ethanol fixation for either 5 minutes or 4 hours followed by spray fixation, or fixation in 95 % ethanol for either 30 minutes or 4 hours followed by <b>air</b> <b>drying.</b> Fixation was graded as unsatisfactory, suboptimal, average, good or excellent. RESULTS: Of smears continuously fixed in ethanol, 96. 6 % were graded as excellent. Of smears fixed in ethanol followed by spray fixation, 93. 2 % were excellent irrespective of fixation time; 64. 4 % of spray-fixed smears were excellent and 27. 1 % good. Of <b>air</b> <b>dried</b> smears, 93. 2 % were unsatisfactory or suboptimal; 83. 0 % of smears fixed in ethanol for 30 minutes and 74. 6 % of smears fixed for 4 hours prior to <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> were unsatisfactory or suboptimal. CONCLUSION: Fixation of smears in 95 % ethanol followed by spray fixation produces excellent results, {{comparable to those}} with continuous fixation in ethanol.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> temperature and different silane coupling agents on the bond strength between glass fiber posts and composite resin core. The post surface was cleaned with alcohol and treated with different silane coupling agents, being three prehydrolyzed silanes [Silano (Angelus), Prosil (FGM), RelyX Ceramic Primer (3 M ESPE) ] and one two-component silane [Silane Coupling Agent (Dentsply) ]. Two post-silanization <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> temperatures, 23 °C and 60 °C, were applied. A cylindrical plastic matrix was placed around the silanized post and filled with composite resin. Each bonded post provided 7 slices for push-out testing. Each slice was loaded to failure under compression at a cross-head speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Scott-Knott tests (α= 0. 05). Dunnett's {{test was used to}} compare the mean of the control group with that of each experimental group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the interface of the fractured slices. For the 23 °C <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> temperature, the use of RelyX Ceramic Primer resulted in significantly lower bond strength than the other silane coupling agents, while the bond strength with Silane Coupling Agent was the highest of all groups. Only with Silane Coupling Agent, the bond strength for the 23 °C <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> temperature was significantly higher than that for 60 °C <b>air</b> <b>drying.</b> In conclusion, the use of warm <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> after silane application produced no increase in the bond strength between the fiber-reinforced composite post and the composite core.

Except {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the river, the northern division is stony and scantily covered with vegetation, except in spring. Over the southern division, on the contrary, spreads a deep alluvial soil, in which even a pebble is rare; and which, though, under the existing misrule, mainly a waste of marsh and wilderness, needs only intelligent attention to become, as it was of old, the granary of western Asia. Except in the extreme south, the rainfall is small and the <b>air</b> <b>dry.</b> The heat in summer is intense, while bitterly cold northern blasts sweep the plain in winter. Whirlwinds are not uncommon; and, in the intervals of the periodical inundations, the fine, dry, powdery soil is swept, even by moderate breezes, into stifling clouds, or rather fogs, of dust. Low inequalities, elevations here and depressions there, diversify the surface of the alluvial region. The latter are occupied by enormous marshes, while the former support the permanent dwellings of the present scanty and miserable population.|$|E

That such would also be the case at Calcutta and throughout the Himalaya of Sikkim, is theoretically self-evident, and proved by my horary observations taken during the rainy months of 1848. An inspection of these {{at the end of this}} section (where a column contains the pressure of dry air) shows but one maximum of pressure, which occurs at the coldest time of the twenty-four hours (early in the morning), and one minimum in the afternoon. In the table of mean temperatures of the months, also appended to this section, will also be found a column allowing the pressure of dry air, whence it will be seen that there is but one maximum of the pressure of dry air, occurring at the coldest season in December, and one minimum, in July. The effect of the vapour is the same on the annual as upon the diurnal march of the pressure, producing a double maximum and minimum in the year in one case, and in the twenty-four hours in the other.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} thorough <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> on the static and dynamic bonding effectiveness of a HEMA-free all-in-one adhesive bonded to Class- 1 cavity-bottom dentin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: G-Bond (GC, Japan) was applied to standard occlusal Class I cavities following either a gentle (1 bar) or strong (4 bar) air-drying technique. After restoring the cavity using a composite resin (Gradia Anterior, GC), microspecimens were prepared that were loaded until failure or inserted in a microrotary fatigue testing device. RESULTS: Strong <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> had no effect on the static (39. 1 vs. 38. 4 MPa) or the dynamic (19. 0 vs. 18. 6 MPa) strength of the interface complex. CONCLUSION: Strong <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> did not improve the static or the dynamic bonding effectiveness, although a very thorough (4 bar) and long air-drying procedure was employed. SEM analysis revealed that even when the adhesive was strongly <b>air</b> <b>dried,</b> droplets originating from phase separations could still be observed, albeit to a reduced extent. Ineffective drying and pooling of the adhesive in a narrow cavity diminished the effect of strong <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> of the all-in-one adhesive. status: publishe...|$|R
