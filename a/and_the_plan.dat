5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, the staff was forced by the Fox network into doing clip shows to save money. There was {{originally}} intense pressure on the producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. Writers and producers, however, felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price.|$|E
5|$|Hansell {{played a}} key and largely unsung role in the {{strategic}} planning of air operations by the United States. This included drafting both the strategic air war plans (AWPD-1 and AWPD-42) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> for the Combined Bomber Offensive in Europe; obtaining a base {{of operations for the}} B-29 Superfortress in the Mariana Islands; and devising the command structure of the Twentieth Air Force, the first global strategic air force and forerunner of the Strategic Air Command. He made precision air attack, as both the most humane and effective means of achieving military success, a lifelong personal crusade that eventually became the key tenet of American airpower employment.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Radford {{proposed}} protecting several military {{programs from}} funding cuts by reducing numbers of conventional forces, but {{the proposal was}} leaked to the press, causing an uproar in Congress and among U.S. military allies, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was dropped. In 1957, after the other Joint Chiefs of Staff again disagreed on how to downsize force levels amid more budget restrictions, Radford submitted ideas for less dramatic force downsizing directly to Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, who agreed to pass them along to Eisenhower.|$|E

5|$|Jones himself {{came under}} threat of {{transfer}} or subordination in April 1943 when the Federal government began moves to unite the Air Force's command by creating an overarching Air Officer Commanding RAAF position that would have effectively replaced Jones as CAS and also been senior to Bostock.

5|$|Some of {{the first}} {{plans for a new}} Interstate Highway freeway, {{bypassing}} I-405, surfaced in 1968.

Residents {{on the east side of}} the lake voiced similar concerns <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was later dropped.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, {{the ship}} was {{canceled}} on 11 August 1945, {{when she was about}} 22% complete. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 August 1945.

However, the some $30million it would cost to complete the ship enough to be able to launch her proved too great <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was abandoned.

5|$|After Desert Storm, {{the army}} {{struggled}} with military operations other than war, such as peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. The school and its graduates examined the situations in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. Graduates {{also participated in}} Defense Support of Civil authorities missions. The course continued {{to change in the}} 1990s. Under Colonel Gregory Fontenot, the school moved from Fort Leavenworth's Flint Hall to Eisenhower Hall in October 1994. In later years, the school's leadership expanded the number of seminars and the civilian faculty. The military continues to draw heavily on SAMS in the twenty-first century. SAMS planners have {{played a significant role in}} the Global War on Terror. Beginning in 2002, the United States Central Command requested planners from SAMS and its sister schools, the United States Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), which was designed to be similar to SAMS, and the United States Marine Corps's School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW).

5|$|Also in 1900, a {{proposal}} {{was presented to}} parliament by the Islington and Euston Railway (I) for {{an extension of the}} City and South London Railway (C) from Angel to Euston. At the time, the C {{was in the process of}} constructing an extension to Angel from its recently opened terminus at Moorgate Street. The extension plan was initially permitted in 1901, but delays in the parliamentary process meant that it had to be re-submitted the following year. The second submission was opposed by the Metropolitan Railway, which saw the extension as competition to its service between King's Cross and Moorgate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was rejected. A third attempt, presented to parliament in November 1902 by the C itself, was successful and approved in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Although the Offaly revolt was {{followed}} by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir Antony St Leger, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, who would remain into the post past Henry's death. Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere fiefdom to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the Kingdom of Ireland free from the Papal overlordship. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's. The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to be a critical factor in determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim on direction of the festival's future.|$|E

5|$|Entering the 1987 Cleveland Browns season, Junkin was {{projected}} to be the starting outside linebacker opposite Clay Matthews, Jr. despite playing inside linebacker in college, which generated criticism around the league as a transition that {{would be difficult for}} him to make. After a 16-day , the Browns and Junkin agreed to a four-year deal worth nearly two million dollars. After missing the first preseason game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he made his debut against the New York Giants. In that game, he played the second half and failed to record a tackle. By the end of training camp, due to struggles learning the outside linebacker position, he made the roster, but lost the starting job to Anthony Griggs. After the Browns moved to a 4-3 defense for the second game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Junkin made his debut, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was for him to gradually see more playing time each week. In early November, due to a combination of a players' strike and an injured wrist, Junkin was placed on the injured reserve list and replaced on the active roster by David Grayson.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{takeover}} of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007 the redesigned layout {{was approved by the}} council, and construction was due to start in early 2008. The new stadium, provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium, was to be built by HKS, Inc.. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000. If the new stadium is built, Anfield would be demolished. The land would become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which would include a hotel, restaurants, and offices. However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money, not the owners' capital, and interest rates were higher than expected. Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated £500million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as their preference was to re-develop Anfield.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, a canal had been {{proposed}} {{to connect the}} Peak Forest Canal, which terminated at Whaley Bridge, with the Cromford Canal, providing a direct route between markets in Lancashire and Derbyshire. However, costs were prohibitive <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was abandoned. Josias Jessop, the son of William Jessop, believed that a wagonway would be much cheaper than a canal. On 2 May 1825 an Act of Parliament {{for the construction of}} a railway from Cromford to Whaley Bridge was passed. The proposal– backed by William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, Richard Arkwright junior, and several Manchester bankers– was ambitious; it was expected that steam locomotives would be used on the line, even though the technology was in its infancy and George Stephenson did not build his revolutionary Rocket until 1829. The south part of the railway, from Cromford Wharf to Hurdlow, south east of Buxton, opened on 29 May 1830, and on 6July 1831 the rest of the line opened to Whaley Bridge. The first steam locomotive on the line was introduced in 1841; before that, the traffic had been made up entirely of wagons.|$|E

5|$|Polish king John III Sobieski {{planned to}} restore Polish {{suzerainty}} over the Duchy of Prussia, {{and for this}} purpose concluded an alliance with France on 11 June 1675. France promised assistance and subsidies, while Sobieski in turn allowed French recruitment in Poland-Lithuania and promised to aid Hungarian rebel forces who were to distract the Habsburgs from their war against France. For this plan to work out, Poland-Lithuania had to first conclude her war against the Ottoman Empire, which French diplomacy despite great efforts failed to achieve. Furthermore, Sobieski was opposed by the Papacy, by Polish gentry who saw the Ottomans as the greater threat, and by Polish magnates bribed by Berlin and Vienna. Inner-Polish Catholic opposition to an intervention on the Protestant Hungarian rebels' side added to the resentments. Thus, while Treaty of Żurawno ended the Polish-Ottoman war in 1676, Sobieski sided with the emperor instead, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> for a Prussian campaign was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Siting of the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård {{started in}} 1920.

The construction was organized by Just Broch and led by Olaf Bakke. Between 200 and 250 people worked on the line during construction. Because of the recession, the railway works were seen as way to create jobs. Most of the workers came from Stavanger and nearly all had families to support. The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, with the official opening by Minister of Labour Lars Oftedal taking place when it reached Ålgård. The line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge.|$|E
