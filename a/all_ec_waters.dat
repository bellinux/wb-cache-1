40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The Grants Pass Batholith of Cretaceous age has intruded the Triassic Applegate Group and {{metasedimentary}} {{rocks of}} the Jurassic Galice Formation in the Murphy area of Josephine County, southwest Oregon. The Applegate Group, mafic volcanic and sedimentary rock, has been partially (nonequilibrium) metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions. The batholith, a hornblende-biotite granodiorite, {{has produced a}} contact aureole (hornblende-hornfels facies) in the country rocks. Electrical conductance (EC), pH, temperature, and HC 0 ₃ were measured on 43 samples of well water and Applegate River water in the field. Analyses for Na⁺, K⁺, Mg⁺⁺, Ca⁺⁺, Cl⁻, F⁻, S 0 ₄⁻⁻, total Fe, and SiO₂ (aq) were performed in the laboratory. Two water types based on EC are apparent. A low EC type (< 500 μmho/cm @ 25 °C) is characteristic of HC 0 ₃⁻ waters; high EC is associated with Cl⁻ waters. Grus from the weathered pluton forms satisfactory aquifers with low EC. Applegate Group rocks form a clay-rich aquifer containing both high and low <b>EC</b> <b>water.</b> Wells located within the contact aureole in the Galice Formation yield high <b>EC</b> <b>waters.</b> Low <b>EC</b> <b>waters</b> are associated with areas of high recharge equiva lent to the "Local" zone, the shallowest zone of Toth's (1963) model. Water quality enigmatically is characterized also by a molar Mg/Ca ratio of unity. High <b>EC</b> <b>waters</b> {{are associated with the}} emergence of deeper water along hydrogeologic boundaries. Except for localized areas producing nonpotable water, aquifers can generally be described as suitable for domestic purposes.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} European Community (<b>EC)</b> <b>water</b> policy in three distinct phases. It suggests that EC environmental action on water entailed a period of intense activity {{in the years following}} the First Action Programme on the Environment in 1973 when the “flow” of secondary legislation was at its peak; a period of review and consolidation from 1988 and 1996 when an “ebb” in successive waves of new secondary legislation appears to have occurred; and, most recently, a period of policy innovation with the Commission’s proposals for a new approach to <b>EC</b> <b>water</b> policy in 1997. This new approach has been incorporated in the Commission proposal for a Council Directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy. The Commission proposal, on which the Environment Council reached political agreement on 11 th March 1999, suggests repealing much of the earlier legislation on water quality to take account of advancements in techniques for controlling pollution and managing water as an environmental resource. This paper reviews the main arguments for a new approach to <b>EC</b> <b>water</b> policy and seeks out evidence of regulatory failure and the need for re-regulation in this area of EC environmental policy...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{emerging}} contaminants (ECs) are known to persist in surface waters, and create pressure on wastewater treatment works (WWTW) for their effective removal. Although a large database for the levels of these pollutants in water systems exist globally, {{there is still a}} lack in the correlation of the levels of these pollutants with possible long-term adverse health effects in wildlife and humans, such as endocrine disruption. The current study detected a total of 55 ECs in WWTW influent surface <b>water,</b> 41 <b>ECs</b> in effluent, and 40 <b>ECs</b> in environmental <b>waters</b> located upstream and downstream of the plant. A list of ECs persisted through the WWTW process, with 28 % of <b>all</b> detected <b>ECs</b> removed by less than 50 %, and 18 % of <b>all</b> <b>ECs</b> were removed by less than 25 %. Negative mass balances of some pharmaceuticals and metabolites were observed within the WWTW, suggesting possible back-transformation of ECs during wastewater treatment.

Multivariate and univariate models strongly indicated that almost <b>all</b> soil variables (<b>EC,</b> W, TOC and TN) were important environmental correlates of pigment distribution. However, a significant amount of variation is independent of these soil variables and may be ascribed to local variability such as changes in microclimate at varying spatial and temporal scales.
