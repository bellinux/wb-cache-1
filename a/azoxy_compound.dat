Precursor incorporation experiments showed that valanimycin {{is derived from}} l-valine and l-serine via the intermediacy of isobutylamine and isobutylhydroxylamine. Enzymatic and genetic investigations led to the cloning and sequencing of the valanimycin biosynthetic gene cluster, which was found to contain 14 genes.

Previous studies suggested that the role of this enzyme is to provide seryl-tRNA for the valanimycin biosynthetic pathway. Here, we report the results of investigations to elucidate the role of seryl-tRNA in valanimycin biosynthesis. A combination of enzymatic and chemical studies has revealed that the VlmA protein encoded by the valanimycin biosynthetic gene cluster catalyzes the transfer of the seryl residue from seryl-tRNA to the hydroxyl group of isobutylhydroxylamine to produce the ester O-seryl-isobutylhydroxylamine.

During the anaerobic/aerobic incubation the amount of radioactivity detected in the fulvic and humic acid fractions did not change significantly (11 - 16 per cent), whereas the radioactivity bound to humin increased to 71 per cent. The 15 N NMR spectra of the fulvic acid samples were dominated by a large peak that corresponded to aliphatic amines or ammonia.

40|$|The {{flavoprotein}} isobutylamine N-hydroxylase (IBAH) catalyzes the oxidation of isobutylamine to isobutyl-hydroxylamine, a key {{step in the}} biosynthesis of the azoxy antibiotic valanimycin. By using {{oligonucleotide primers}} designed from peptide sequence information derived from native IBAH, a fragment of the gene (vlmH) encoding IBAH was amplified by PCR from a genomic library of the valanimycin-producing organism, Streptomyces viridifaciens MG 456 -hF 10. The gene fragment was then employed as a probe to clone the entire vlmH gene from an S. viridifaciens genomic library. Overexpression of the vlmH gene in Escherichia coli gave a soluble protein that was purified to homogeneity. The purified protein exhibited the catalytic activity expected for IBAH. The deduced amino acid sequence of IBAH exhibited the greatest similarity to the Sox/DszC protein from Rhodococcus sp. strain IGT 38, a flavoprotein involved in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene to the corresponding sulfone.

40|$|The {{antibiotic}} valanimycin is an <b>azoxy</b> <b>compound</b> {{produced by}} Streptomyces viridifaciens MG 456 -hF 10. Precursor incorporation experiments with (4 - 13 C) -N-(isobutylamino) serine and 15 N 2 -N-(isobutylamino) serine suggest that N-(isobutylamino) serine {{is a specific}} precursor of valanimycin. Searching for enzymes related to the biosynthetic pathway of valanimycin led to the identification of valine decarboxylase and isobutylamine N-hydroxylase in crude extracts of S. viridifaciens MG 456 -hF 10 cells. Isobutylamine N-hydroxylase requires FAD and NADH for activity. The enzyme was found to consist of two protein components. The A component of isobutylamine N-hydroxylase was partially purified and the B component was purified to homogeneity. The properties of isobutylamine N-hydroxylase were studied.

40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{literature}} showed that nitrobenzene and related radical-anions could be obtained {{from a variety of}} electron transfer reactions. The possibility of using hydroxylarnine and N-substituted hydroxylamines as electron donors to aromatic mono nitro compounds, in oxygen free, aqueous, alkaline ethanol, was investigated. Five of the seven hydroxylamine compounds investigated, hydroxylarnine, N-methylhydroxylamine, N-phenylhydroxylamine, N-benzylhydroxylamine and N-benzhydrylhydroxylamine, were effective in transferring an electron {{to a wide range of}} nitro compounds, the radical-anions produced being detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The spectra of these radicals were recorded, and hyperfine splitting constants measured and compared with values in the literature. g-Values of the radicals were also measured and it was found for the nitro radical-anions containing halogen substituents that this increased - Br > Cl > F > H. The limit of the reducing power of the hydroxylamine compounds was reached with para-nitroanisole, E 1 / 4 = 0. 957 v, para-nitrophenol not being reduced by this method. An investigation into the mechanism of this reaction and its products then followed. The build-up and decay of the nitro radical-anions were followed using stopped flow techniques. The general pattern which emerged was that of a very rapid build-up of the radical, reaching the maximum intensity within a minute of mixing the reactants, followed by a very slow decay. This is characteristic of consecutive reactions in which a stationary state intermediate is being destroyed much more rapidly than it is being produced. It was found that: Initial rate ∝ [OH -] [ArNO 2] [RNHOH] and that [Radical] max ∝ [OH -] &frac 12; [ArNO 2] &frac 12; [RNHOH] &frac 12; and the following scheme was proposed: RNHOH + OH - &#x 21 CC; k RNHO - + H 2 O RHHO - + ArNO 2 → k 1 RNHO • + ArNO •&#x 0305; 2 2 ArNO •&#x 0305; 2 → k 2 products. 2 RNHO • → fast products. This was verified by the evaluation of k 2 as a rate constant for the bimolecular disappearance of the nitro radical-anion, in a series of experiments with para-nitrobenzoic acid and a range of hydroxylamine compounds. k 2 = 6. 5 × 10 2 l. mol. - 1 sec. - 1 This value for k 2 is higher than literature values of rate constants for the disproportionation of nitro radical-anions. This may be due to traces of oxygen, present in the current work, or to the fact that k 2 may not be the rate constant for a direct disproportionation reaction. The relative rates at which the various hydroxylamines will transfer an electron was found to be: MeNHOH > PhCH 2 NHOH > Ph 2 CHNHOH > NH 2 OH the sequence that would be expected from the electron releasing powers of the substituents on the nitrogen atom of the hydroxylamine group. Using a single hydroxylamine in reaction with a range of nitro compounds an approximate value of p = + 3. 3 was obtained for the electron transfer reaction. This indicated that a low electron density at the site of reaction in the nitro compound would be favourable i. e. the rates with the following substituents would vary: p -CN > p -COO - > p -OCH 3 With hydroxylamine itself, kinetic measurements were much less accurate, owing to a pseudo unimolecular gas evolution which appeared to come from the reactions: 2 NH 2 O • → (H 2 NO) 2 → N 2 + 2 H 2 O From the mechanism that has been proposed for the general reaction, it would be expected that nitroso compounds would be among the products. However these compounds were not isolated. With hydroxylamine, itself, the reaction proceeded further via a diazotate and a diazonium salt to yield an azide. From N-alkylhydroxylamines, R 2 CH. NHOH, the intermediate aliphatic nitroso compounds in part tautomerized to the oximes, R 2 C=NOH, which have been isolated. The subsequent reactions of the aromatic nitroso compounds fall into two categories. In the reactions involving N-benzhydryl and N-phenylhydroxyl-amines, the intermediate nitroso compounds derived from the original nitro compound underwent a further one electron reduction, followed by dimerisation to give an <b>azoxy</b> <b>compound.</b> In the case of N-phenyl-hydroxylamine this was also the fate of the PhNO •&#x 0305; radicals, derived from the hydroxylamine. In the reactions involving N-alkylhydroxylamines, R-CH 2 -NHOH, deep red products were isolated and, with difficulty, purified. These were ultimately identified as formazans (I), by comparison of a range of their physical properties with those of synthesized materials. [For the diagram omitted here, please consult the PDF. ] The mechanism proposed to account for their formation from the intermediate nitroso compounds had to satisfy the following: In the reaction, variations in the nitro compound alters the Ar-group in I, In the reaction, variation in the hydroxylamine compound alters the R- group in I, The lack of formation of formazans with other hydroxylamines indicates that an active methylene group adjacent to the nitrogen atom in the hydroxylamine is essential. The mechanism proposed depended upon the cross combination of nitroso radical-anions derived from both reactants to give an unsymmetrical <b>azoxy</b> <b>compound,</b> R. CH 2 N=N(O) Ar. Attack by base at the active methylene group resulted in the formation of formazan (I). Evidence to support this mechanism has been gained by synthesizing the intermediate unsymmetrical <b>azoxy</b> <b>compound</b> and allowing it to react with base, with the result that traces of the predicted formazan were detected. </p...|$|E

Ag–Cu alloy NPs can absorb visible light, causing excited hot-electrons due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, and the excited electrons can activate the reactant molecule adsorbed on the NP surface to induce a reaction. The photocatalytic performance was affected by the Ag–Cu ratio, and the catalyst with an Ag–Cu molar ratio of 4 – 1 exhibited the optimal performance.

50|$|Oxidations of alkynes, allenes, arenes, {{and other}} unique {{unsaturated}} functionality may yield epoxides or other oxidized products. Oxidation of allenes affords allene dioxides or products of intramolecular participation. Minor amounts of side products derived from additional oxidation or rearrangement were also observed.(6)In oxidations of heteroaromatic compounds, the products obtained depend on reaction conditions. Thus, at low temperatures, acetylated indoles are simply epoxidized in high yield (unprotected indoles undergo N-oxidation). However, {{when the temperature}} is raised to 0 °C, rearranged products are obtained.(7)DMD may oxidize heteroatoms to the corresponding oxides (or products of oxide decomposition). Often, {{the results of these}} oxidations depend on reaction conditions. Tertiary amines cleanly give the corresponding N-oxides. Primary amines give nitroalkanes upon treatment with 4 equivalents of DMD, but <b>azoxy</b> <b>compounds</b> upon treatment with only 2 equivalents. Secondary amines afford either hydroxylamines or nitrones.(8)Oxidation of nitronate anions, generated in situ from nitroalkanes, leads to carbonyl compounds in an example of an oxidative Nef reaction.(9)Sulfide oxidation {{in the presence of a}} single equivalent of DMD leads to sulfoxides. Increasing the amount of DMD used (2 or more equivalents) leads to sulfones. Both nitrogen and sulfur are more susceptible to oxidation than carbon-carbon multiple bonds.(10)Although alkanes are typically difficult to functionalize directly, C-H insertion with TFD is an efficient process in many cases. The order of reactivity of C-H bonds is: allylic > benzylic > tertiary > secondary > primary. Often, the intermediate alcohols produced are oxidized further to carbonyl compounds, although this can be prevented by trapping in situ with an anhydride. Chiral alkanes are functionalized with retention of configuration.(11)Dioxiranes oxidize primary alcohols to either the aldehyde or carboxylic acid; however, DMD selectively oxidizes secondary over primary alcohols. Thus, vicinal diols may be transformed into α-hydroxy ketones with dioxirane oxidation.(12)Epoxidation is usually more facile than C-H oxidation, although sterically hindered allyl groups may undergo selective C-H oxidation instead of epoxidation of the allylic double bond.|$|R

We have recently reported the regiospecific reductive ring opening of epoxides and glycidic esters under transfer hydrogenation using ammonium formate. 5 In this paper, we wish to report that Pd/C catalyses the reductive cleavage of various azobenzenes as well as the reduction of various oximes to the corresponding amines in moderate yields, using ammonium formate as H 2 source. Table 1 summarizes the results of the reductive cleavage of the N 1 N of azobenzenes to give the corresponding amines, using 4 equiv. of ammonium formate at ambient temperature. It is to be noted that reducible groups such as Cl and NO 2 also underwent facile reduction under the reaction conditions employed. However, it is remarkable that selective reduction of a C–Cl bond over a C–F or a C–N (debenzylation) bond 6 has been achieved with the present system (Scheme 1). The reduction of various carbon–nitrogen systems to saturated derivatives with various reducing agents provides highly useful processes for the preparation of amines and related functionalities. 7 The reduction of oximes and sub-sequent cleavage of the N–O bond to aord primary amines occurs with a variety of potent hydride reagents, includin...|$|R
40|$|Copper is a {{low-cost}} plasmonic metal. Efficient photocatalysts of copper nanoparticles on graphene support are successfully developed for controllably catalyzing the coupling reactions of aromatic nitro compounds to the corresponding <b>azoxy</b> or azo <b>compounds</b> under visible-light irradiation. The coupling of nitrobenzene produces azoxybenzene with a yield of 90 [*]% at 60 [*]°C, but azobenzene with a yield of 96 [*]% at 90 [*]°C. When irradiated with natural sunlight (mean light intensity of 0. 044  W[*]cm− 2) at about 35 [*]°C, 70 [*]% of the nitrobenzene is converted and 57 [*]% {{of the product}} is azobenzene. The electrons of the copper nanoparticles gain {{the energy of the}} incident light through a localized surface plasmon resonance effect and photoexcitation of the bound electrons. The excited energetic electrons at the surface of the copper nanoparticles facilitate the cleavage of the NO bonds in the aromatic nitro compounds. Hence, the catalyzed coupling reaction can proceed under light irradiation and moderate conditions. This study provides a green photocatalytic route for the production of azo compounds and highlights a potential application for graphene...|$|R
