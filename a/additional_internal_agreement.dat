40|$|Cross-border {{cooperation}} can {{be challenging}} due to different factors. This research investigates the opportunities and threats for cross-border cooperation and divides these into the model of <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> which suggest that successful cross-border cooperation can only be attained when the four factors ‘vision/strategy, organisation, finances and culture’ are balanced. Additionally two case studies are analysed using the model of <b>internal</b> <b>agreement.</b> One case study represented a successful cross-border cooperation and one case study represented an unsuccessful case of cross-border cooperation. Information from the literature search and the case studies together are then translated into recommendations for developing a potentially cross-border National Park {{on the border of}} Germany and the Netherlands...|$|R

50|$|In all Finnic dialects, {{original}} *pt and *kt {{have the}} same reflex.

50|$|Females {{use their}} urethra only for urinating, but males use their urethra for both {{urination}} and ejaculation. The external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination. Only {{in the male}} is there an <b>additional</b> <b>internal</b> urethral sphincter muscle.|$|R
50|$|The fixed arch is {{most often}} used in {{reinforced}} concrete bridge and tunnel construction, where the spans are short. Because it is subject to <b>additional</b> <b>internal</b> stress caused by thermal expansion and contraction, this type of arch {{is considered to be}} statically indeterminate.|$|R
5000|$|From October, 1942, {{modified}} Spitfire Mk VCs with <b>additional</b> <b>internal</b> {{and external}} fuel tanks and most armament removed {{were capable of}} flying the 1100 mi from Gibraltar to Malta.

50|$|The {{relationship}} between CILIP and CILIPS {{is defined by}} an <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> signed in 1995 which gives the basis for CILIPS to operate under a devolved model.
