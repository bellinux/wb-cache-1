While knowing that traditional beliefs, customs, and practices needed to be examined in order to find out what worked and what needed improved upon, it was never done in a systematic way. “Dewey became increasingly aware of the obstacles presented by entrenched power and alert to the intricacy of the problems facing modern cultures”. With the complex of society at the time, Dewey was criticized for his lack of effort in fixing the problems.|$|E

There are certain games that are made for just competitive multiplayer purposes. With those type of games, players focus entirely one choosing the right character or obtaining the right equipment in the game to help them when facing other players. Tournaments are held so {{that people in the}} area or from different regions can play against other players of the same game and see who is the best. Major League Gaming (MLG) is a company that reports tournaments that are held across the country. The players that compete in these tournaments are given a rank depending on their skill level in the game that they choose to play in and face other players that play that game. The players that also compete are mostly called professional players for {{the fact that they have}} played the game they are competing in for many, long hours. Those players have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> different strategies for facing different characters. The professional players are able to pick a character to their liking and be able to master how to use that character very effectively. With strategy games, players tend to know how to get resources quick and are able to make quick decisions about where their troops are to be deployed and what kind of troops to create.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers have {{compared}} [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] {{to the work}} of The Beatles.

He felt that the song would have fit better on The Beatles' 1969 soundtrack album, Yellow Submarine. The Beatles influence was also noted by Stephen Holden from The New York Times, who labeled [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] a [...] "stylish swatch of late Beatles-style psychedelia". Joey Levy from Spin characterized [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] as [...] "amazing", describing his reaction to the song as [...] "Wow! This is neat!" [...] He added that the song sounded like Prince singing for The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Kevin Phinney from the Austin American-Statesman compared the song to the solo work that Beatles' member John Lennon did later in his career. Phinney wondered how Madonna was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the song, since most of the tracks from Like a Prayer are full of innuendo and double meanings.|$|E
