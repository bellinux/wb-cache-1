25|$|The {{character}} code produced by any key press {{is determined by}} the keyboard driver software. A key press generates a scancode which is interpreted as an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character</b> or control function. Depending on operating systems, various application programs are available to create, add and switch among keyboard layouts. Many programs are available, some of which are language specific.|$|E
25|$|In certain circumstances, {{a target}} process will filter any byte from the {{injected}} shellcode {{that is not}} a printable or <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character.</b> Under such circumstances, the range of instructions {{that can be used to}} write a shellcode becomes very limited. A solution to this problem was published by Rix in Phrack 57 in which he showed it was possible to turn any code into alphanumeric code. A technique often used is to create self-modifying code, because this allows the code to modify its own bytes to include bytes outside of the normally allowed range, thereby expanding the range of instructions it can use. Using this trick, a self-modifying decoder can be created that initially uses only bytes in the allowed range. The main code of the shellcode is encoded, also only using bytes in the allowed range. When the output shellcode is run, the decoder can modify its own code to be able to use any instruction it requires to function properly and then continues to decode the original shellcode. After decoding the shellcode the decoder transfers control to it, so it can be executed as normal. It has been shown that it is possible to create arbitrarily complex shellcode that looks like normal text in English.|$|E

50|$|A {{mnemonic}} is an underlined <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character,</b> typically {{appearing in}} a menu title, menu item, or {{the text of}} a button or component of the user interface. A mnemonic indicates to the user which key to press (in conjunction with the Alt key) to activate a command or navigate to a component.|$|E
5000|$|A keycap is a {{small plastic}} cover placed over the {{keyswitch}} of a computer keyboard. Keycaps are illustrated to indicate the [...] or <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character</b> they correspond to. Early keyboards were manufactured with the keyswitch and keycap integrated in one unit; separate keycaps were introduced to facilitate the production of different keyboard layouts.|$|E

50|$|Other early {{computers}} were character oriented, providing instructions for performing arithmetic on character strings of decimal numerals. On these machines the basic data element was an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character,</b> typically encoded in six bits. UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II used word addressing, with 12-character words. IBM examples include IBM 702, IBM 705, the IBM 1400 series, IBM 7010, and the IBM 7080.|$|E
5000|$|Endfield is co-credited with Chris Rainey for a pocket-sized/miniature {{computer}} with a chorded keypad that allows rapid typing without a bulky single-stroke keyboard. It functions like a musical instrument by pressing combinations of keys that he called a [...] "Microwriter" [...] to generate a full <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character</b> set. It is currently under further development, as [...] "CyKey", for PC and Palm PDA, by Endfield's former partner, Chris Rainey and Bellaire Electronics. CyKey is named after Cy Endfield.|$|E

5000|$|A {{prominent}} issue {{cited by}} detractors {{is the number}} of stylus strokes required to draw a character. The original Graffiti recognition software required only a single stylus stroke for each <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character.</b> Graffiti 2, however, required two strokes to draw some commonly used characters. This was perceived as extra work because the default settings for [...] "i" [...] and [...] "t", the fifth and second most frequently-used letters in English, required two strokes. Preferences settings, however, allowed input using single stroke variants for these letters.|$|E
50|$|In computing, a {{hardware}} code page (HWCP) {{refers to a}} code page supported natively by {{a hardware}} device such as a display adapter or printer.

They are available {{for use by the}} system without having to load any font definitions into the device first. Startup messages issued by a PC's System BIOS or displayed by an operating system before initializing its own code page switching logic and font management and before switching to graphics mode are displayed in a computer's default hardware code page.|$|E
