5|$|The first Prussian corps {{to arrive}} in {{strength}} was Bülow's IV Corps. Bülow's objective was Plancenoit, which the Prussians intended to use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> into {{the rear of the}} French positions. Blücher intended to secure his right upon the Châteaux Frichermont using the Bois de Paris road. Blücher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had agreed to this advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack. General Bülow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow his}} system {{to reach its}} full potential, Chapman {{encouraged}} his chairman {{to spend money on}} new players. The club's first ever transfer fee, £400, was paid for Welsh international Lloyd Davies who remains Northampton's most-capped player, winger Fred McDiarmid and playmaking centre half David McCartney. With this new talent, in his first season in charge, Chapman led Northampton to eighth place; with additional new signings, such as inside forward Albert Lewis from Coventry City, he used this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> to take the Southern League title in 1908–09, with Lewis finishing as top scorer.|$|E
5|$|While {{during the}} late 1920s and early 1930s {{relations}} with the Soviet Union became normalized to a degree, from 1938 on, the Soviets, anxious that Finland could be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> for an invasion, started negotiations to conclude a military agreement. At the same time, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's desire to recover the territories of Tsarist Russia lost during {{the chaos of the}} October Revolution and the Russian Civil War made Finland an obvious target. Due to the nature of Soviet demands, which included the installation of Soviet military facilities on Finnish soil, these negotiations went nowhere.|$|E

50|$|<b>Springboarding</b> {{involves}} <b>a</b> wrestler {{using any}} of the ring ropes to bounce upward. Most high-flying techniques can be performed after a spring board, i.e. springboard legdrop, springboard dropkick. Sometimes wrestlers will bounce off one set of ring ropes then off another to perform a move, this is referred to <b>as</b> <b>a</b> double <b>springboard,</b> the most notable double <b>springboard</b> move is <b>a</b> version of <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> moonsault in which a wrestler bounces off the rope to elevate himself/herself to the top-rope from where he/she bounces off to perform the moonsault.|$|R
50|$|On 6 April 2003, the 26 Green Berets {{were given}} the task to capture a {{strategically}} important junction between Mosul and Kirkuk, {{near the village of}} Debecka (Dibege, دیبه‌گه in Kurdish). Were it captured, it would sever Highway 2 and impede Iraqi movement in the north, as well <b>as</b> provide <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> to eventually drive on and capture the important Kirkuk oil fields. They were to seize the Debecka intersection until relieved by the 173rd Airborne Brigade's artillery component.|$|R
5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{conversion}} in 1625 onwards, Baltimore took care to cater for the religious needs of his colonists, both Catholic and Protestant. He had asked Simon Stock to provide priests for the 1625 expedition, but Stock's recruits arrived in England after Aston had sailed. Stock's own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded Baltimore's: in letters to De Propaganda Fide in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement could act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> for the conversion of natives not only in the New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

50|$|Menari-tori is {{the least}} played of taepyeongso styles. As with neunggye, there are {{particular}} folksong-derived menari-tori melodies—most notably Baetnorae—which can be played on taepyeongso but, like sinawi, menari is used more commonly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> melodic <b>springboard</b> for freer forms of improvisation. Menari's primary characteristic phrase consists of a downwards sequence of tae-hwang-nam. Unlike neunggye and sinawi, the primary tone of menari is tae, while im is only rarely sounded.|$|R

Several {{published}} responses to Heard's article argued that Sedaris' readers are aware that his descriptions and stories are intentionally exaggerated and manipulated to maximize comic effect, while others used the controversy <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> for discussing the liberties publishers are willing to take when calling books 'nonfiction'.|$|E

50|$|She did {{not play}} in December, and ended the year ranked World No. 262. Although this was down 18 places {{from the start of}} the year, the {{marginal}} loss was primarily a consequence of her choosing to focus on higher-level challenges at the expense of her previous year's points attained at $25,000 events; and the useful experience she had gained in the process would serve <b>as</b> <b>an</b> effective <b>springboard</b> into higher echelons of the WTA World rankings in future years.

King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592. Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city.

As a {{follow-up}} to his 6-hour electro-psycho adaptation of [...] "Alice In Wonderland", Greif returned to putting classic literature through the sonic meat-grinder.

40|$|A user-centered {{approach}} to interactive system development requires {{a way to}} represent {{the behavior of a}} user interacting with an interface. While a number of behavioral representation techniques exist, not all provide the capabilities necessary to support the interaction development process. Based on observations of existing representation techniques and comments from users of the User Action Notation (UAN), a user- and task-centered behavioral representation technique, we have developed a model of behavioral representation techniques. Our model is an epistemological framework for discussing, analyzing, extending, and comparing existing behavioral representation techniques, as well <b>as</b> being <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> for developing and evaluating new techniques. We present the model and results of our evaluation demonstrating the model's reusability and utility within the context of behavioral representation techniques...|$|R

25|$|Textiles and {{clothing}} {{is one of}} the largest manufacturing and exporting processes in the country and a huge employment absorber. The Egyptian apparel industry is attractive for two reasons. Firstly, its proximity to European markets, whose rapidly changing fashions require quick replenishment. Egypt's geographical proximity to style-conscious Europe is a logistical advantage. Secondly, the production of garments is a low-capital and high-labor-intensive industry, and the local population of 66 million provides a ready workforce as well as a natural local consumer market that acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> for exports.|$|E

Polk and Jackson hoped the former's election would serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> to the vice presidential nomination in 1840 and the presidency in 1844, but the 1840 Democratic National Convention split among Polk and incumbent Richard Mentor Johnson and failed to nominate anyone for the position.|$|E

40|$|The {{exposure}} of the ‘real or alternative’ has potential to be disruptive. Social and interactive media allows society to communicate and share ideas that disrupt mainstream culture. Visually, these messages have potentially more power when they entertain and engage with an audience. This mode of creative communication isn’t always sustained, progressive or democratic, however it acts <b>as</b> <b>an</b> archive of resistant practices and representations of ‘the other’. Practitioners such as Ministry of Agnes are exploring protest design {{within the context of}} social media and using interactive digital communication to disseminate visual messages. This process acts <b>as</b> both <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> for conversation and discussion around this creative process and design methodology. Design <b>as</b> <b>a</b> professional activity, in conjunction with an interdisciplinary approach to image production, has the potential to create ways within which we can work against the stakeholders of commercially orientated mass media.
