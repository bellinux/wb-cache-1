25|$|On April 10, 2006, John Lott {{filed suit}} for {{defamation}} against Steven Levitt and HarperCollins Publishers over the book Freakonomics and against Levitt over {{a series of}} emails to John McCall. In the book Freakonomics, Levitt <b>and</b> <b>coauthor</b> Stephen J. Dubner claimed {{that the results of}} Lott's research in More Guns, Less Crime had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to economist John McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by several authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of the Journal of Law and Economics had not been peer reviewed, Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue.|$|E

500|$|Alexander Flick's History of New York State {{claims that}} the title was used as early as 1819, coinciding with New York surpassing Virginia in population. He does not provide any source for this claim. Further, Flick adds that the term was [...] "universally {{acknowledged}} and accepted" [...] {{by the time that}} the Erie Canal was completed in 1825. In a later work, Flick <b>and</b> <b>coauthor</b> John Jacob Anderson claim that [...] "New York is well called the Empire State... {{not only because of the}} vastness of its resources, but because it so conspicuously illustrates the imperial power of law-abiding liberty among the people." ...|$|E
500|$|Superficially, Khan {{has been}} {{compared}} to Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the [...] "Übermensch" [...] (superman or overman). Khan is mentally and physically superior to any normal human. In the [...] episode [...] "", Malik, the leader of a group of [...] "supermen" [...] created from the same genetic engineering project as Khan, quotes Nietzsche, telling Archer that [...] "Mankind is something to be surpassed". Professor William J. Devlin <b>and</b> <b>coauthor</b> Shai Biderman examined Khan's character compared to the Übermensch and found that Khan's blind pursuit of revenge is against Nietzsche's ideals of transcendence and self-creation of a meaningful life. Instead, the authors offer Spock's self-sacrifice in The Wrath of Khan as a better example of the Übermensch.|$|E
