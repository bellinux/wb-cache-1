25|$|After {{a year at}} Bonn, Heine left to {{continue}} his law studies at the University of Göttingen. Heine hated the town. It was part of Hanover, ruled by the King of England, the power Heine blamed for bringing Napoleon down. Here the poet experienced an aristocratic snobbery absent elsewhere. He also hated law as the Historical School of law he had to study was used to bolster the reactionary form of government he opposed. Other events conspired to make Heine loathe this period of his life: he was expelled from a student fraternity for anti-Semitic reasons <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the news that his cousin Amalie had become engaged. When Heine challenged another student, Wiebel, to a duel (the first of ten known incidents throughout his life), the authorities stepped in and Heine was suspended from the university for six months. His uncle now decided {{to send him to}} the University of Berlin.|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for Hulk was {{composed}} by Danny Elfman, who scored Spider-Man the previous year. Frequent Ang Lee collaborator, Mychael Danna, {{was the original}} composer for the film. However, Danna's score was rejected by studio executives for its non-traditional approach, which featured Japanese taiko, African drumming, and Arabic singing. Elfman was then approached by Universal's president of film music, Kathy Nelson. With 37 days to compose over two hours of music, Elfman agreed out of respect to Lee. While instructing to retain much {{of the character of}} Danna's score, Lee pushed Elfman to write material that did not sound like his previous superhero scores. [...] "They did leave some of my music in the movie," [...] said Danna, [...] "so the Arabic singing and some of the drumming is mine. What happened is that they panicked, they brought in Danny <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> what I've been doing and I guess he liked it." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{next time}} he woke his brain was clearer, though {{there was still a}} dull sense of pain where he had been struck. Without opening his eyes, he listened attentively. There was some sound of {{movement}} in the room, <b>and,</b> presently, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a faint regular breathing. This continued for some time, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> then <b>heard</b> a sort of grunt.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> again <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> that slight noise, as if {{something}} or someone was moving in the room.|$|R
60|$|Two hours later, perched {{naked on}} the two packs <b>and</b> smoking, <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a voice above {{that he could not}} fail to identify.|$|R
2500|$|Partch {{moved with}} his family to Arizona for his mother's health. [...] His father worked for the Immigration Service there, and they settled {{in the small town of}} Benson. [...] It was still the Wild West there in the early twentieth century, and Partch {{recalled}} seeing outlaws in town. [...] Nearby, there were native Yaqui people, whose music he heard. [...] His mother sang to him in Mandarin Chinese, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> and sang songs in Spanish and the Yaqui language. [...] His mother encouraged her children to learn music, and he learned the mandolin, violin, piano, reed organ, and cornet. [...] His mother taught him to read music.|$|E
2500|$|Ahab {{seems to}} have had no model in real life, though his death may have been based on an actual event. On May 18, 1843, Melville was aboard The Star, which sailed for Honolulu. Aboard were two sailors from the Nantucket who could have told him that they had seen their second mate [...] "taken out of a {{whaleboat}} by a foul line and drowned". The model for the Whaleman's Chapel of chapter 7 is the Seamen's Bethel on Johnny Cake Hill. Melville attended a service there shortly before he shipped out on the Acushnet, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a sermon by the chaplain, 63-year-old Reverend Enoch Mudge, who is at least in part the model for Father Mapple. Even the topic of Jonah and the Whale may be authentic, for Mudge was a contributor to Sailor's Magazine, which printed in December 1840 the ninth of a series of sermons on Jonah.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with The Blaze, O'Reilly said: [...] "And if that moron [...] doesn't {{think it was a}} war zone in Buenos Aires, then he's even dumber than I think he is." [...] This characterization by O'Reilly was disputed by former CBS colleague Eric Engberg who was in Buenos Aires at the time and challenged his (O'Reilly's) description of the riot as a [...] "combat situation". Engberg went on to say it was a moderate riot <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> no [...] "shots fired" [...] and saw no [...] "ambulances or tanks" [...] in the streets. The following week O'Reilly contradicted Engberg's claims, presenting archived CBS video of the riot that ensued after Argentine's surrender. The video appears to show riot police firing tear gas and plastic bullets toward the crowd; additionally, former NBC bureau chief Don Browne referred to the riot as an [...] "intense situation", with many people hurt and tanks in the streets of Buenos Aires.|$|E
60|$|Nobody answered, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> listened attentively. The horses {{had been}} {{tethered}} {{in the bushes}} close to the shelter, <b>and</b> now <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> several of the animals move around uneasily.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> what <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> we {{may very}} fairly guess, {{because we know}} from St. Paul's {{writings}} what {{he was in the}} habit of saying.|$|R
50|$|Seth is big {{and strong}} and a natural athlete, but he has zero {{confidence}} which really hurts him lots of times during missions. Despite his size <b>and</b> strength <b>he</b> can't seem to carry the giant reputation of his dead father that everyone compares him to. His dad was a military hero who died before Seth was even born, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>heard</b> hundreds of stories about him.|$|R
2500|$|A Tanna in {{the name}} of Rabbi deduced from the words [...] "the sons of Korah did not die" [...] in [...] that Providence set up a special place for them to stand on high in Gehinnom. There, Korah's sons sat and sang praises to God. Rabbah bar bar Hana told that once when he was travelling, an Arab showed him where the earth {{swallowed}} Korah's congregation. Rabbah bar bar Hana saw two cracks in the ground from which smoke issued. He took a piece of wool, soaked it in water, attached it to the point of his spear, and passed it over the cracks, and the wool was singed. The Arab told Rabbah bar bar Hana to listen, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> them saying, [...] "Moses and his Torah are true, but Korah's company are liars." [...] The Arab told Rabbah bar bar Hana that every 30 days Gehinnom caused them to return for judgment, as if they were being stirred like meat in a pot, and every 30 days they said those same words.|$|E
2500|$|Schumann {{returned}} to Düsseldorf {{and began to}} edit his complete works and make an anthology {{on the subject of}} music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of tinnitus), he imagined that voices sounded in his ear <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> angelic music. One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a [...] "spirit theme" [...] to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his Lieder-Album für die Jugend, and finally in the slow movement of his Violin Concerto. In {{the days leading up to}} his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the Geistervariationen (Ghost Variations). Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his Variations for Piano Four Hands, Op. 23, based on this theme.|$|E
2500|$|George Glenn Jones {{was born}} on September 12, 1931 in Saratoga, Texas, and was raised in Colmesneil, Texas, with his brother and five sisters. His father, George Washington Jones, worked in a {{shipyard}} and played harmonica and guitar while his mother, Clara, played piano in the Pentecostal Church on Sundays. During his delivery, {{one of the doctors}} dropped Jones and broke his arm. When he was seven, his parents bought a radio <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> country music for the first time. [...] Jones recalled to Billboard in 2006 that he would lie in bed with his parents on Saturday nights listening to the Grand Ole Opry and insist that his mother wake him if he fell asleep so he could hear Roy Acuff or Bill Monroe. [...] In his autobiography I Lived To Tell It All, Jones explains that the early death of his sister Ethel spurred on his father's drinking problem and, by all accounts, George Washington Jones could be physically and emotionally abusive to his wife and children when he drank. [...] In the book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, Bob Allen recounts how George Washington Jones would return home {{in the middle of the}} night with his cronies roaring drunk, wake up a terrified George Glenn Jones and demand that he sing for them or face a beating. [...] In a CMT episode of Inside Fame dedicated to Jones' life, country music historian Robert K. Oermann marveled, [...] "You would think that it would make him not a singer, because it was so abusively thrust on him. [...] But the opposite happened; he became a chronic singer. [...] He became someone who had to sing." [...] In the same program, Jones admitted that he remained ambivalent and resentful towards his father up until the day he died and observed in his autobiography [...] "The Jones family makeup doesn't sit well with liquor...Daddy was an unusual drinker. [...] He drank to excess but never while working, and he probably was the hardest working man I've ever known." [...] His father bought him his first guitar at age nine and he learned his first chords and songs at church and there are several photographs of a young George busking on the streets of Beaumont.|$|E
6000|$|He fell to {{brooding}} on it, <b>and</b> presently <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> his son saying, [...] "I suppose, papa, that Mr. Lindau {{died in a}} bad cause?" ...|$|R

60|$|The other insisted; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> them {{chop the}} gold chain in two.|$|E
60|$|Rapidly I {{described}} to him my adventures, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{me out in}} silence.|$|E

50|$|White Creole {{composer}} Louis Moreau Gottschalk incorporated rhythms <b>and</b> tunes <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> in Congo Square {{into some}} of his compositions, like his famous Bamboula, Op. 2.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence. Then {{the door}} closed gently <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> her go upstairs.|$|E

60|$|What <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{need not}} be {{repeated}} here. Suffice it that as the wine went round <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> enough to acquaint him with the characters and designs of those whose conversation he overhead; to possess him with {{the full extent of}} Ralph's villainy, and the real reason of his own presence being required in London. <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> all this <b>and</b> more. <b>He</b> <b>heard</b> his sister's sufferings derided, and her virtuous conduct jeered at <b>and</b> brutally misconstrued; <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> her name bandied from mouth to mouth, and herself made the subject of coarse and insolent wagers, free speech, and licentious jesting.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} {{he was at a}} loss to know what had happened, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>heard,</b> as if from afar off, Joe calling him by name.|$|R
