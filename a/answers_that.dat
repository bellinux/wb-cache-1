When he <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> he is reading the newspaper, Aminah turns it right-side up and ridicules him. After she again interrupts him, Mahmud leaves the home.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{scene in}} the film The Bridge by Brett Hanover, where two young women looking for a laugh tell a Scientology {{volunteer}} they learned about the organization from South Park. The volunteer <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> she hasn't seen the episode in question, and the two women later leave {{during the middle of}} an orientation video.|$|E
5|$|With {{a scenic}} {{view of the}} Taj Mahal, Chanda motivates Apu to always follow her dreams, as they are {{dependent}} on efforts and not circumstances. A few years later, Apu attends her Union Public Service Commission interview, having passed her examinations successfully. After being asked what inspired her to apply for IAS, she <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> she is inspired by her mother, who now tutors struggling math students for free.|$|E
2500|$|... "Should it be overturned? I don't <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> because I wouldn't want a {{judge to}} have to <b>answer</b> <b>that.</b> I don't {{consider}} it a litmus test. I think a conservative strict constructionist judge could come to either conclusion." ...|$|R

5|$|When the two {{return to}} The Evil Queen's palace, {{she opens the}} satchel to reveal a {{poisoned}} apple. The Evil Queen offers Hansel and Gretel a home at the palace, but they are adamant about returning to their father. She sends {{them back into the}} forest and summons her newest prisoner, Hansel and Gretel's father. The Evil Queen asks why the children turned down the luxurious life of the palace and he <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> they are family, and family finds each other. Frustrated, she sends him away to see if they indeed find each other.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student {{stage of}} life), then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student stage of life, or after the householder stage, {{regardless of whether or}} not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference to marriage, and thus the text asserts that those who have married or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce on the day he feels detached from the world, regardless of which stage of life he is in, and whether he has completed that stage.|$|E
5|$|Sen, No-Face and Boh {{meet with}} the now benevolent Zeniba, who reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba used the black slug to control Haku. Haku appears in his dragon form and flies Sen and Boh to the bathhouse. No-Face becomes Zeniba's spinner. In midflight, Sen recalls falling in her youth into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, thus {{revealing}} Haku's real identity as the Kohaku River. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from {{among a group of}} pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> none of the pigs are her parents, her contract combusts and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything. They quietly walk back to their car (which is now covered in dust) and drive away.|$|E
40|$|An {{imperative}} conditional is a conditional in {{the imperative}} mood (by analogy with “indicative conditional”, “subjunctive conditional”). What, in general, {{is the meaning}} and the illocutionary effect of an imperative conditional? I survey four answers: the <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> imperative conditionals are commands {{to the effect that}} an indicative conditional be true; two versions of the <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> imperative conditionals express irreducibly conditional commands; and finally, the <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> imperative conditionals express a kind of hybrid speech act between command and assertion. ...|$|R

Almost all participants (99 %) <b>answered</b> <b>that</b> 3 D movies were quite useful or useful for medical practice.|$|R
5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E
5|$|The episode's five flashbacks {{focus on}} the {{reactions}} and activities of the freighter's crew who made contact with the Oceanic 815 survivors; Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) is shown crying while watching a newscast confirming the deaths of all Oceanic 815 passengers. His caretaker asks why he is crying, and he <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> he does not know. Miles Straume (Ken Leung) is a medium hired by an elderly woman to remove the ghost of her grandson from her home. After conversing with the spirit, Miles finds a hidden cache of money and drugs. Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) is an anthropologist who finds a polar bear skeleton bearing a Dharma Initiative collar buried in the Tunisian desert. Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) is an alcoholic who was originally scheduled to pilot flight 815. He phones the Oceanic hotline while watching the newscast and claims that the footage of the plane wreckage being aired on television is not authentic, while Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) is shown in a posthumous flashback, criticizing her employer Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) for his choice in her coworkers.|$|E

Two new approaches are proposed: Multi-Grained Query <b>Answering</b> <b>that</b> bridges the gap between Information Retrieval and Question Answering and Learning-Enhanced Query <b>Answering</b> <b>that</b> enables the improvement of retrieval performance based on the experience of previous queries and answers. ...|$|R
25|$|On many episodes, <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> {{are deemed}} {{inappropriate}} for broadcast are edited out with comical effects, including a slide whistle sound effect dubbed over the audible answer {{in place of}} the usual bleep censor. In addition, the answer card and celebrity's mouth may be blurred or pixelated.|$|E
25|$|Karma–Sanyasa yoga (Religion by Renouncing Fruits of Works {{contains}} 29 verses): Arjuna asks Krishna if it {{is better}} to forgo action or to act ("renunciation or discipline of action"). Krishna <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> both are ways to the same goal, but that acting in Karma yoga is superior.|$|E
25|$|However, {{with the}} {{technological}} advances, {{the government has}} received the ability to invade privacy in more subtle ways; further, {{there is no reason}} to think that the rate of such technological advances will slow down. “Can it be that the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security?”, Brandeis asks. He <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> a clear negative answer is evident in Boyd v. United States.|$|E

25|$|Kilgour and Matas {{concede that}} {{in at least}} some instances, the {{hospital}} staff may have been supplying <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> the callers wanted to hear {{in order to make a}} sale. The results of these phone calls would also be difficult to replicate; as allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong gained attention, hospitals would become more reluctant to candidly discuss their organ sourcing practices.|$|E

The Institute’s work has yielded <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> are improving the treatment and care of children with conditions such as autism, cerebral palsy and spina bifida. A team of international scientists and investigators at Kennedy Krieger is working to isolate culprit genes and develop new treatment models and therapies. The institute has a swift transfer of research to patient care.|$|E
25|$|Russell {{claimed that}} he was more {{convinced}} of his method of doing philosophy than of his philosophical conclusions. Science was one of the principal components of analysis. Russell was a believer in the scientific method, that science reaches only tentative <b>answers,</b> <b>that</b> scientific progress is piecemeal, and attempts to find organic unities were largely futile. He believed the same was true of philosophy. Russell held that the ultimate objective of both science and philosophy was to understand reality, not simply to make predictions.|$|E

25|$|In the 1998 survey, blacks (34%) {{were nearly}} {{four times as}} likely as whites (9%) to have <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> {{identified}} them as being of the most anti-Semitic category (those agreeing with at least 6 of 11 statements that were potentially or clearly antisemitic). Among blacks with no college education, 43% responded as the most anti-Semitic group (vs. 18% for the general population). This percentage fell to 27% among blacks with some college education, and 18% among blacks with a four-year college degree (vs. 5% for the general population).|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} ceremony the candidate, often a ploughboy, {{was told to}} come to the barn where the ceremonial procedures were to take place, normally held between 11pm and 1 am. Once at the door he was blindfolded and taken before the master of ceremonies, who was often an elder ploughman. As in Masonic rituals there was then a prearranged and established exchange of questions and <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> was to be given. In the case of the Horseman's Word and the Miller's Word this exchange was often a parody of catechism. After this was completed the inductee was then asked to seal the pact and shake hands with the devil, which would often be a branch or pole covered in animal fur.|$|E
25|$|According to a Human Rights Watch and Helsinki Watch researcher, the prosecutor's {{questions}} were formulated to elicit <b>answers</b> <b>that</b> supported the defense. The prosecution's witnesses, {{two members of}} the Yellow Wasps, revealed nothing about the crimes but praised Vojin and Dušan's soldiery. Implied Serbian government involvement in the crimes was not pursued. The prosecution failed to present evidence of wrongdoing, witnesses did not appear, a judge allegedly showed inappropriate support towards the Vučković brothers, guards offered the brothers cigarettes, and on the third day of the trial, defense lawyers announced that Vučković had already been tried and found not guilty by a military court in Banja Luka for war crimes allegedly perpetrated in Bijeljina. The court was dismissed, the presiding judge fell ill, and the trial was then postponed indefinitely.|$|E
