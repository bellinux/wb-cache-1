Also, if the blast hit the adversary, the tension gauge is filled to its maximum capacity immediately.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns' {{drilling}} operation causes further harm and distress to many Springfield citizens: Moe's Tavern is closed {{due to the}} harmful fumes from the drilling, leaving Moe and Barney enraged; the drilling destroys the Springfield Retirement Castle, leaving Grampa homeless, forcing him {{to move in with}} the Simpsons; and Bart's treehouse is destroyed by <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> of oil from the rig, which also injures Santa's Little Helper.|$|E

5|$|Working {{alongside}} Gemma whilst {{they were}} producing the globes, Mercator would {{have witnessed the}} process of progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and collating their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and seamen.

In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with {{a map of the}} Holy Land which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its surface}} {{circulation}} had dissipated, its circulation aloft remained intact {{and led to}} <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> of rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94inches/303.3mm that fell at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1972. One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was attempting to navigate onto. Nine water rescues occurred along the I-44 corridor, mostly caused by Erin's rainfall. Damage totaled about $19.8million (2007USD) in the state, primarily in Polk County.|$|E

5|$|By August12, the NHC {{reported}} that Tropical Depression Two was near tropical storm intensity after <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> of deep convection over the center. At this point, {{the system was}} not upgraded to a tropical storm; however, in a post-storm analysis, {{it was determined that}} the system had attained tropical storm-force winds, peaking at 40mph (65km/h) for 12hours on August12. Several hours later, the system became disorganized due to increased wind shear. By the afternoon of August13, the system had weakened to a tropical depression and shortly thereafter, degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure area as it failed to maintain convection around the center for 24hours. At this time, the NHC issued their final advisory on the system but noted that there was the possibility of regeneration.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> {{of intense}} neutron and gamma {{radiation}} came {{directly from the}} fireball. Its lethal radius was , covering {{about half of the}} firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries. Among injured survivors, 30% had radiation injuries from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E

5|$|Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, died in May 1705. His successor, Joseph I, took to {{government}} with <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> of ebullience. Following the Battle of Turin, a decisive Imperial victory, the Emperor sent an envoy to Florence to collect feudal dues, amounting to 300,000 doubloons, an exorbitant sum; and to force Cosimo to recognise the Archduke Charles as King of Spain. Fearing a Franco-Dutch invasion, Cosimo III refused to recognise Charles's title, {{but he did}} pay {{a fraction of the}} dues.|$|E
5|$|Moving very little, the {{depression}} was disorganized due to continued shear, leaving {{the center of}} circulation west of the convective activity. By later in the morning hours of May27, the system began to show overall signs of organization, primarily related to <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> of convection in the eastern semicircle. At the same time, the center of circulation either reformed or began to move farther north, possibly north-northeast. Embedded within the steering currents of a ridge, most forecasts anticipated the storm would drift northward for several days, though some computer models predicted the storm would eventually move inland near Acapulco. At 1800UTC on May27, {{the depression}} organized into a tropical storm, and as such was named Aletta by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{paleontology}} {{that has}} {{seen a lot of}} activity during the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond is the study of the Cambrian explosion during which many of the various phyla of animals with their distinctive body plans first appear. The well-known Burgess Shale Cambrian fossil site was found in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, and another important site in Chengjiang China was found in 1912. However, new analysis in the 1980s by Harry B. Whittington, Derek Briggs, Simon Conway Morris and others sparked a renewed interest and <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> of activity including discovery of an important new fossil site, Sirius Passet, in Greenland, and the publication of a popular and controversial book, Wonderful Life by Stephen Jay Gould in 1989.|$|E

5|$|Starting in January 1990, four WATCH instruments, {{designed}} by the Danish Space Research Institute, were in operation on the Granat observatory. The instruments could localize bright sources in the 6 to 180keV range to within 0.5° using a Rotation Modulation Collimator. Taken together, the instruments' three fields of view covered approximately 75% of the sky. The energy resolution was 30% FWHM at 60keV. During quiet periods, count rates in two energy bands (6 to 15 and 15 to 180keV) were accumulated for 4, 8, or 16 seconds, depending on onboard computer memory availability. During <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> or transient event, count rates were accumulated with a time resolution of 1 second per 36 energy channels.|$|E
5|$|The Muhammad al-Durrah {{incident}} {{took place}} in the Gaza Strip on 30 September 2000, {{on the second day of}} the Second Intifada, during widespread rioting throughout the Palestinian territories. Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for France 2, as they were caught in crossfire between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. The footage shows the pair crouching behind a concrete cylinder, the boy crying and the father waving, then <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> of gunfire and dust, after which the boy is seen slumped across his father's legs.|$|E

Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E
