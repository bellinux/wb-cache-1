40|$|Leonardo da Vinci is {{not only}} famous as the artist who painted master pieces such as "The Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa", {{he is also a}} great {{scientist}} and engineer. He left records of many original scientific investions and explorations in books now known as Leonardo 2 ̆ 7 s Codices. These codices include <b>anatomical</b> <b>charts,</b> mechanical equipment, civil engineering concepts, and drawings related to architecture, astronomy, botany, and so on. The contents of these Codices are interesting for beginners who are studying mechanical engineering, although beginners are not used to recognizing a solid from a drawing. Therefore, models were reconstructed from the drawings in these codices, to be used as teaching materials for the study of mechanical engineering. In a lecture as part of a mechanics course, it was possible to generate an interest in mechanical engineering among beginners who studied the mechanics by using the reconstructed models. Similarly, an opportunity to consider the field of mechanical engineering was given to students of primary schools, junior high schools, senior high schools, and their parents, by the reconstructed models presented in the DA VINCI Festival at Toyama Prefectural University...|$|R

40|$|Assaults on the Police {{continue}} to increase. Of particular {{concern is the}} threat of injury from edged weapons. Shootings remain rare. The Home Office {{has embarked on a}} program to provide all police officers with suitable body armour. Body armour has been on general issue to police officers in America for over twenty years and has a superb record in saving lives from shootings. Little is known about its ability to prevent serious stab wounds from knives, as this is a much less common threat in the American policing environment. Therefore the specification for armour for police use in this country must be set to provide protection against the threats in the UK policing environment. Current knife-resistance standards are based on animal experimentation and have not been examined by any other model. To understand the protective requirements of armour, it is necessary to understand the weapon threat, the assailant’s method of delivery, and the vulnerability of the target. The biophysics of human stabbing (the assailant’s method of delivery), is the subject of ongoing investigation, and is outwith the scope of this thesis. In this thesis, the history and development of body armour is reviewed. An overview of the materials and properties of modern armour is presented. To understand the threat, the epidemiology of assaults on police officers and civilians is described. To determine the ideal protective qualities of body armour for issue to the police, two studies are presented. The first is a retrospective cohort study of 500 civilian victims of penetrating injury. The frequency of wounding, and the severity of wounding by body region is plotted on <b>anatomical</b> <b>charts.</b> This will demonstrate the vulnerability, and hence the protection requirements of each body area to penetrating injury. No previous study has measured the depth of the internal organs from the skin. A CT study is presented. It describes the accessibility of the internal organs to the passage of a blade by measuring the shortest distances from the skin. By applying the results of these two studies to the location of the internal organs (which lie in fairly constant relation to surface anatomy landmarks), the ideal protective qualities of armour panels over corresponding areas of organ vulnerability are plotted. The case for adopting three levels of knife resistance protection is made. The ballistic protective requirements of body armour are discussed. Finally, proposals for zoned body armour are presented and ergonomic and production issues are described. The model presented in this thesis has been accepted in principle by the Police Scientific Development Branch of the Home Office with a view to establishing a zoned body coverage requirement for police body armour...|$|R
40|$|Background: To compare {{functional}} and anatomical outcomes after idiopathic macular pucker removal between eyes that underwent internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and eyes that did not. Methods: In this multicentric, randomized clinical trial, 60 eyes of 60 patients affected with idiopathic macular pucker were enrolled. Thirty eyes underwent 23 -gauge pars plana vitrectomy associated with ILM peeling (“ILM peeling group”), whereas 30 eyes did not undergo ILM peeling (“ILM not peeling group”). Retinal sensitivity, frequency of microsco-tomas, {{and all the}} other microperimetric parameters were tested by MP 1 microperimetry. Best-corrected visual acuity was investigated with the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopa-thy Study <b>chart.</b> <b>Anatomical</b> outcomes were analyzed with spectral domain optical coher-ence tomography. Results: After a 12 -month follow-up, the mean retinal sensitivity in the 4 ° central area showed a greater and faster recovery in the ILM not peeling group than in the ILM peeling group (P = 0. 041). The number of absolute microscotomas (0 dB) within the 12 ° central retinal area was significantly higher in the ILM peeling group than in the ILM not peelin...|$|R

40|$|The {{advance of}} axonal tract-tracing has {{revolutionized}} neuroscience {{in the past}} three decades 1. The elementary purpose of neuronal tract-tracing is to <b>chart</b> <b>anatomical</b> connections within the nervous system providing useful information on afferent and efferent connectivity in the brain. Biocytin is a classical neuroanatomical tract-tracer that is taken up by neurons and transported in both antero- and retrograde directions. Our aim was to develop non-toxic, efficient neuronal tracers that allow both, in vivo brain connectivity studies by means of MRI and postmortem-microscopic investigation in fixed tissue, in the same experimental animal. We have designed five novel biocytin-based neuroanatomical tract-tracers (L 1 -L 5). In newly modified-biocytin (L 1), propylamine is linked to amide of biocytin to make it tert-amide, which is stable to biotinidase degradation. The propylamine of L 1 was used as a linker to link, FITC as a fluorescent moiety (L 2) or Gd-DOTA as MR detectable part (L 3). L 4 has an amide linkage between amine of GdDO 3 A-EA and carboxylate of biocytin while L 5 consists of a novel precursor based on serine containing Gd-DO 3 A. This precursor has an amine and a carboxylate group available for coupling of biotin and l-lysine. In vivo histological experiments with L 1 demonstrated an increased molecular stability compared with biocytin and excellent neuronal tract-tracing capabilities. In vitro efficiency of cell internalization of L 2 into N 18 neuroblastoma cells was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy. In vitro MRI of L 3 -L 5 with increasing concentrations of avidin were performed at 7 T. The increase in R 2 for L 3 -L 5 (300 - 100 respectively) demonstrated strong binding of all tracers in the pocket of tetrameric avidin through biotin. The above studies and preliminary results reveal a new strategy for neuroanatomical tract-tracing, which combines the powerful spatial resolution of the conventional microscopic techniques with the whole brain tri-dimensional coverage and in vivo applicability of MRI...|$|R
