Nevertheless, photogrammetric base map production process became easier and rapid due to developments of high resolution digital aerial cameras and computer systems. Therefore object extraction and integration to the GIS started to play very important role. Updated road data is required for transportation, navigation, environmental and urban planning issues. Automatic extraction of roads from satellite images is still popular subject for many researchers. However, it has many challenging problems as shadows of trees and buildings, cars, illumination effects. One of the major component of the road extraction is sensor resolution. Although only main <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> can be extracted from low-resolution images, high resolution images can make possible to road borders too.

40|$|Abstract. Parametric cubic spline curves are {{commonly}} used to model the geometry <b>of</b> <b>road</b> surfaces in real-time driving simulators. Roads are represented by space curves that define a curvilinear frame of reference in which three-dimensional points are expressed in coordinates of distance along the curve, offset from the central axis, and loft from the road surface. Simulators must map from global Cartesian coordinates to local road coordinates at very high frequencies. A key component in this mapping is the computation of the closest point on the central <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>road</b> to a three-dimensional point expressed in Cartesian coordinates. The paper investigates a two-step method that exploits the complementary strengths of two optimization techniques: Newton’s method and quadratic minimization.

40|$|Most {{geographic}} {{data sets}} available today mainly provide two-dimensional geometric information about topographic objects in different aggregation levels. Three dimensional information is distributed separately {{by means of}} digital terrain models. In contrast, many applications presume that integrated data sets are available. The extraction of man-made objects from images and laser scanner data {{has been in the}} focus of image processing research in recent years. In this paper an approach is presented to identify road objects in laser scanner data sets. The information that is of interest is the outline <b>of</b> the <b>road,</b> its height and further tributary properties like longitudinal and transversal slope, width and curvature. In order to derive the width and further properties <b>of</b> <b>roads,</b> features and attributes of 2 D data sets have to be evaluated against their contribution to the integration of height information into a common data model. Planning and construction facilities make use of standardised longitudinal and cross sections. Topographic data sets only contain the middle <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>roads.</b> In this paper the information will be detected, analysed and measured by a model based approach, investigating the neighbourhood <b>of</b> two dimensional <b>road</b> elements in terms of cross sections.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{discusses}} the problematic disarray of the registration and {{regulation of the}} ownership of plots {{of the state and}} municipality roads. The introduction presents the division of longitudinal objects into parcels as a condition for regulating the property rights of state and municipality roads. Land surveying and mapping is briefly presented, including the tasks and role of the land surveying companies and mapping authority in the procedure of determining boundaries and land subdivision, and also their role in the additional procedures for regulating the property rights in the land register, which is regulated by the court. We have used two methods for analyzing the property rights <b>of</b> longitudinal objects (<b>roads)</b> on the example of the land cadastre data in the municipality of Medvode. Firstly, we have selected the parcels based on the ownership data by preselecting the owners who have a public interest in roads (the state, the municipality, etc.), so we could determine road sections which are considered public property. The second method involved intersecting the data layers of the axes of longitudinal objects (state and municipality roads) with the graphical part of the land cadastre, which resulted in the ownership data for the parcels on the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> public <b>roads.</b> The owners <b>of</b> these <b>roads</b> have been analysed to determine the ratio between the public and private parcels on the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> public <b>roads.</b> Despite the limitations of both methodologies, such as the incompleteness of the data on ownership from the land cadastre and its positional accuracy, {{we have been able to}} determine for the study area that the ownership regulation is satisfactory for higher category roads (state and regional roads), but much worse for lower category <b>of</b> <b>roads</b> according to the official classification...|$|R

Error in measuring the length of a curve is proposed to determine the position errors start and end points of curvature. When traveling laboratory "round-trip " by rounding can obtain an average length of a curve to be more precise definition of this unit of length for each passage.

Hence, <b>road</b> extraction that is significantly more automated than the employment of costly and scarce human resources has become a challenging technical issue for the geospatial community. An automatic road extraction based on Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) and variable structured multiple model particle filter (VS-MMPF) from satellite images is addressed. EKF traces the median <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> a single <b>road</b> segment while VS-MMPF traces all road branches initializing at the intersection. In case of Local Linearization Particle filter (LLPF), {{a large number of}} particles are used and therefore high computational expense is usually required in order to attain certain accuracy and robustness. The basic idea is to reduce the whole sampling space of the multiple model system to the mode subspace by marginalization over the target subspace and choose better importance function for mode state sampling. The core of the system is based on profile matching.
