5|$|A large {{percentage}} of people who live in urban areas have access to parks and gardens in their areas, which <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> only connections they have with nature. A study shows that having contact with nature helps promote our health and well-being. People who had access to gardens or parks were found to be healthier than those who did not.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to activities run by individual Scout groups, {{a large number}} of rallies, activities, competitions, and training courses are held by the different Regions. The biggest of these <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> Kon-Tiki raft building competitions held annually in Cape Town and Gauteng. Nationally, the Senior Scout Adventure is held every two years in the Cederberg mountains. In the past, South Africa has also held a national Jamboree, known as SANJAMB.|$|E
5|$|The Caelifera {{includes}} some 2,400 valid genera and about 11,000 known species. Many undescribed species probably exist, especially in tropical wet forests. The Caelifera have a predominantly tropical distribution with fewer species known from temperate zones, {{but most of}} the superfamilies have representatives worldwide. They are almost exclusively herbivorous and <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> oldest living group of chewing herbivorous insects.|$|E

5|$|The high plains {{found on}} Triton's eastern hemisphere, such as Cipango Planum, cover over and blot out older features, and are {{therefore}} almost certainly the result of icy lava washing over the previous landscape. The plains are dotted with pits, such as Leviathan Patera, which <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> vents from which this lava emerged. The composition of the lava is unknown, although a mixture of ammonia and water is suspected.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodical}} cicadas (Magicicada) {{make use}} of predator satiation: they emerge, all at once, at long intervals of 13 or 17 years; their juveniles <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> longest-lived of all insect development stages. Since the number of cicadas in any given area exceeds the amount predators can eat, all available predators are satiated, and the remaining cicadas can breed in peace.|$|E
5|$|From {{this period}} there are {{extensive}} examples of rock art. These include cup and ring marks, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe {{and have been}} found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the Kilmartin district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in Kilmartin, and a boat pecked into Wemyss Cave, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> oldest two-dimensional representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Similar carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial cists in Lanarkshire and Kincardine.|$|E

5|$|Grand Canyon {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on the Richter Scale occurred in the Grand Canyon region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 on the Richter Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the Grand Canyon area.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{communication}} can {{be transmitted}} through sound, sight, and smell (olfaction). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures are probably more noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face {{as well as a}} submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.|$|E
5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser {{running away with}} little more than a few {{scratches}} to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E

50|$|Stapper <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> son of MP, William Stapper.|$|R
50|$|He was {{possibly}} a Conradine, a relative for sure of Adalard the Seneschal, a Girardid. Berengar <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> namesake of Berengar II of Neustria, who <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> son of Berengar I's successor, Henry of Franconia. He {{is believed to}} be the same person as Bérenger I, Count of Ivois.|$|R
5|$|The BBC Film Library, meanwhile, had no {{responsibility}} for storing programmes that had not originated on film, and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over which party held the responsibility for archiving programmes. As each body believed it the other's responsibility to archive the material, each thought nothing of destroying its own copies as necessary. This lack of communication contributed to the erasure {{of much of the}} Corporation's film archive of older black-and-white programming. While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this way around the world, the missing Doctor Who episodes <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> best-known example of how the lack of a consistent programme archiving policy risks permanent loss.|$|E
5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> result of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones {{to the floor of}} the cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{house for}} which there is {{evidence}} in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE. The earliest stone structures <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> three hearths found at Jura, dated to about 6000 BCE. With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish soil in the Neolithic era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the oldest}} surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village.|$|E
50|$|Rede <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> {{son of the}} clothier Thomas Rede. He <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> William who <b>was</b> from Yate, Gloucestershire {{and married}} a {{daughter}} of the clothier, Walter Bailey. He had a son, Edward Rede. In 1554, he was described as 'of Bristol', suggesting a possible connection to William Rede I.|$|R

25|$|Frank Hurley's {{black and}} white images from the 1950s which are in the National Library online collection, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most evocative and easily {{accessible}} images close up of the features around Frenchmans Cap.|$|E
25|$|Validity {{describes}} {{the evidence that}} an assessment tool measures what {{it was supposed to}} measure. There are many different ways of checking validity. For screening measures, diagnostic accuracy and discriminative validity <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most useful ways of looking at validity.|$|E
25|$|Hippopotami and {{crocodiles}} {{are found}} in large groups in the Mara and Talek rivers. Leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, jackals, and bat-eared foxes {{can also be found}} in the reserve. The plains between the Mara River and the Esoit Siria Escarpment <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> best area for game viewing, in particular regarding lion and cheetah.|$|E

50|$|From the {{earliest}} times, {{the portrayal of}} Benben was stylised in two ways; the first was as a pointed, pyramidal form, which <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> model for pyramids and obelisks. The other form was round-topped; this <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> origin of Benben as a free standing votive object, and an object of veneration.|$|R
25|$|Oil spills <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most emotive {{of marine}} {{pollution}} events. However, while a tanker wreck {{may result in}} extensive newspaper headlines, much of the oil in the world's seas comes from other smaller sources, such as tankers discharging ballast water from oil tanks used on return ships, leaking pipelines or engine oil disposed of down sewers.|$|E
25|$|Intestinal {{stem cells}} divide {{continuously}} throughout life {{and use a}} complex genetic program to produce the cells lining {{the surface of the}} small and large intestines. Intestinal stem cells reside near the base of the stem cell niche, called the crypts of Lieberkuhn. Intestinal stem cells <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> source of most cancers of the small intestine and colon.|$|E
25|$|The first map series, still {{unpublished}} to this day, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> First Saxon {{land survey}} by Matthias Oeder and Balthasar Zimmermann (surveyed between 1586 and 1633) and the Swedish land survey of Western Pomerania (surveyed 1692-1709). The first published, and thus trendsetting, map series {{is likely to}} be the Carte de Cassini, published from 1756 and finished only at the beginning of the 19th century.|$|E
