40|$|In this thesis, we {{are going}} to study <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> {{management}} throughout the macroeconomic cycle in financial institutions. There are two important problems in financial institutions. The first is that <b>asset</b> and <b>liability</b> management has significant effects on the financial institution's value. The second is that in different stages of the macroeconomic cycle, the effect of <b>asset</b> and <b>liability</b> management approaches is not same. Therefore, the purpose of the thesis is to study how <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> management causes economic consequences for financial institutions and in what capacity. In this thesis, based on the analysis of <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> management and the economic cycle, we establish a dynamic system to simulate how a financial institution makes decision throughout economic cycles. In order to simulate the system, we established a model to reflect how the economic cycle affects the financial institution's value by using the economic relationship and we built up the decision making progress. Then we simulate the system through Matlab. From the simulation results, we can observe the changes of system in the given time horizon. by Jingsi Yan. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{approach}} to <b>Asset</b> <b>Liability</b> Management of various institutions, in particular insurance companies, based on a dual VaR constraint for the asset and the surplus.

VaR constraints on the asset and on the surplus also take tractable forms, and graphical illustrations of the impact and of the sensitivity of these constraints are easily explicited in terms of various parameters: share of stocks, duration and convexity of the bonds on the <b>asset</b> and <b>liability</b> sides, expected return and volatility of the <b>asset</b> [...] . <b>Asset</b> <b>Liability</b> Management, interest rates, Asset VaR constraint, Surplus VaR constraint, Optimal Portfolio. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Asset</b> <b>liability</b> {{management}} (ALM) is {{the traditional}} risk management practice in banking. ALM is the coordinated and integrated management of <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities.</b> Some studies argue that ALM lost importance due {{to the use of}} new risk mitigation tools by banks. This study aims to identify the role of ALM in the risk management of banks in Turkey. For this purpose, it analyzes the relationship between <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> of the banks by using canonical correlation for the period of 2002 - 2012. High canonical correlation indicates that dependency of <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> has been high for banks operating in Turkey. Canonical loadings also provide evidence for the coordinated <b>asset</b> and <b>liability</b> management. Thus, ALM is still very common in Turkish banking sector. Further analysis on liquidity of banks reveal that profitability, equity capital, illiquid assets and credit risk influence the liquidity. Besides, liquidity of public banks is higher than that of other banks...|$|R
