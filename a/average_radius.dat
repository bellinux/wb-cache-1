40|$|International audienceIn 1934 J. Leray {{proposed}} a regularization of the Navier-Stokes equations whose limits were weak solutions of the NSE. Recently, {{a modification of}} the Leray model, called the Leray-alpha model, has atracted study for turbulent flow simulation. One common drawback of Leray type regularizations is their low accuracy. Increasing the accuracy of a simulation based on a Leray regularization requires cutting the <b>averaging</b> <b>radius,</b> i. e., remeshing and resolving on finer meshes. This report analyzes a family of Leray type models of arbitrarily high orders of accuracy for fixed <b>averaging</b> <b>radius.</b> We establish the basic theory of the entire family including limiting behavior as the <b>averaging</b> <b>radius</b> decreases to zero, (a simple extension of results known for the Leray model). We also give a more technically interesting result on the limit as {{the order of the}} models increases with fixed <b>averaging</b> <b>radius.</b> Because of this property, increasing accuracy of the model is potentially cheaper than decreasing the <b>averaging</b> <b>radius</b> (or meshwidth) and high order models are doubly interesting...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the early}} results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the {{discovery}} of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60, and 100μm, and came from within an angular radius of 10arcseconds (10″) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80astronomical units (AU), where an AU is the <b>average</b> <b>radius</b> of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension {{on the order of}} a millimeter, as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting–Robertson drag. The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.|$|E

If these means are defined by local spacial averaging with an <b>averaging</b> <b>radius</b> of δ the approach is known as large eddy simulation, and ū denotes the eddies of size 0 (δ) and larger. One approach to the closure problem which arises from averaging the nonlinear term is use of a scale-similarity hypothesis. We consider one such scale-similarity model. For this model we show the solution w to the model for ū converging to u as the <b>averaging</b> <b>radius</b> δ→ 0.
