500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> he's not showing you attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single was [...] "Moto Psycho", and a {{video was}} also made for this song. The song is about people who commute every day to work, {{spending}} a lot of time on the road. [...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind" [...] was released on the [...] compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth's former label, Capitol Records. The album's opener, [...] "Disconnect", is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and [...] "the person I want you to think that I am and the person inside that I really know I am." [...] "Coming Home" [...] was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the Warchest box set. Mustaine has stated that concept for [...] "Promises" [...] is [...] "prejudiced relationships," [...] such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, [...] "it could be about <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> a sheep for all I care. It just means that if we can't be together in this life, maybe we'll make it in the next." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{cast member}} Dan Castellaneta {{occasionally}} voiced Santa's Little Helper for bit parts, American voice artist Frank Welker most often provided {{the sounds of}} the dog and other animals on the show from [...] "Bart's Dog Gets an F", which aired on March 7, 1991, to [...] "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily", which aired on October 1, 1995. He said on his official website in 2007 that he liked portraying Santa's Little Helper because the dog was a [...] "sympathetic" [...] character. Welker has been praised by staff members for his performances on the show. David Mirkin has noted that [...] "he can do anything, and it fits perfectly. You forget you're listening to <b>a</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>and</b> he's a pleasure to work with." [...] Groening has commented that he was [...] "unbelievably good" [...] at doing animal noises. After 1995, Castellaneta voiced Santa's Little Helper on his own while Welker performed other animal noises until his full departure in 2002, when he was denied a pay raise. In the [...] "questions and answers" [...] section on his website, Welker revealed that the reason he stopped performing as Santa's Little Helper was because [...] "The producers thought... 'Hmmm, Dan barks pretty good, and we are already paying him and he seems to like doing the dog thing... why do we need to pay Welker who comes in here, spends less than an hour, eats all the doughnuts, refuses to come to rehearsals... let's just give the damn dog to Dan!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, {{and now he has}} [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell said that this is the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part of it was that if you just began with <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E
