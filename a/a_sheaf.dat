Her father, Charles Doolittle, was professor of astronomy at Lehigh University and her mother, Helen (Wolle), was a Moravian with {{a strong interest in}} music. H.D. was their only surviving daughter in a family of five sons. In 1896, Charles Doolittle was appointed Flower Professor of Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, and the family moved to a house in Upper Darby. She attended Philadelphia's Friends' Central High School, at Fifteenth and Race streets, graduating in 1905. In 1901, she met and befriended Ezra Pound, who was {{to play a major role}} both in her private life and her emergence as a writer. In 1905, Pound presented her with <b>a</b> <b>sheaf</b> of love poems under the collective title Hilda's Book.|$|E
5|$|Kubera {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a dwarf, with complexion of lotus leaves and a big belly. He is described as having three legs, only eight teeth, one eye, and being adorned with jewels. He is sometimes depicted riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry <b>a</b> <b>sheaf</b> of jewels or a mongoose with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over Nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.|$|E
5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and <b>a</b> <b>sheaf</b> of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

By analogy, an étale presheaf is called <b>a</b> <b>sheaf</b> if it satisfies the same condition (with intersections of open sets replaced by pullbacks of étale morphisms, and where a set of étale maps to U is said to cover U if the topological space underlying U is the union of their images).

25|$|Let F(U) be {{the set of}} all {{sections}} on U.

25|$|Often {{one would}} like to define {{sections}} only locally (especially when global sections do not exist). A local section of a fiber bundle is a continuous map f : U → E where U is an open set in B and π(f(x))=x for all x in U. If (U, φ) is a local trivialization chart then local sections always exist over U. Such sections are in 1-1 correspondence with continuous maps U → F. Sections form <b>a</b> <b>sheaf.</b>|$|E

25|$|Notice {{that the}} empty subset of a topological space {{is covered by}} the empty family of sets. The product of an empty family or the limit of an empty family is a {{terminal}} object, and consequently the value of <b>a</b> <b>sheaf</b> on the empty set must be a terminal object. If sheaf values are {{in the category of}} sets, applying the local identity axiom to the empty family shows that over the empty set, there is at most one section, and applying the gluing axiom to the empty family shows that {{there is at least one}} section. This property is called the normalisation axiom.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, <b>a</b> <b>sheaf</b> is a {{tool for}} {{systematically}} tracking locally defined data attached to the open sets of a topological space. The data can be restricted to smaller open sets, and the data assigned to an open set is equivalent to all collections of compatible data assigned to collections of smaller open sets covering the original one. For example, such data can consist of the rings of continuous or smooth real-valued functions defined on each open set. Sheaves are by design quite general and abstract objects, and their correct definition is rather technical. They are variously defined, for example, as sheaves of sets or sheaves of rings, {{depending on the type}} of data assigned to open sets.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} feature of coherent sheaves F is that the properties of F at a point p control the behavior of F in a neighborhood of p, more than would be true for <b>an</b> arbitrary <b>sheaf.</b> For example, Nakayama's lemma says (in geometric language) that if F is <b>a</b> coherent <b>sheaf</b> on <b>a</b> scheme X, then the fiber Fp⊗OX,pk(p) of F at a point p (a vector space over the residue field k(p)) is zero {{if and only if}} the sheaf F is zero on some open neighborhood of p. A related fact is that the dimension of the fibers of <b>a</b> coherent <b>sheaf</b> is upper-semicontinuous. Thus <b>a</b> coherent <b>sheaf</b> has constant rank on an open set, while the rank can jump up on a lower-dimensional closed subset.|$|R
