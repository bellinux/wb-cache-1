500|$|Mrs. Puff plays a small {{role in the}} 2004 film The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and its [...] Her lack {{of screen}} time in both movies was criticized. Jessica Walsh of the Reading Eagle felt that the first film was [...] "missing something, since key characters, such as Sandy the Squirrel and Mrs. Puff, make only cameo appearances". Sandie Chen of Common Sense Media wrote that the {{decision}} to relegate characters like Mrs. Puff to small roles [...] "won't go over well with some fans". About.com's Nancy Basille considered this the first movie's biggest flaw and asked, [...] "why didn't they use more of Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Gary, Mrs. Puff <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> other favorite secondary characters?" [...] The novelization of the 2004 movie includes additional scenes starring Mrs. Puff and Squidward that were not in the motion picture.

According to Toland, in June 1943, Pius XII {{addressed the issue of}} mistreatment of Jews at a conference of the Sacred College of Cardinals and said: [...] "Every word We address to the competent authority on this subject, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>Our</b> public utterances have to be carefully weighed and measured by Us {{in the interests of the}} victims themselves, lest, contrary to Our intentions, We make their situation worse and harder to bear".|$|E

[115:1] January 21st, 1794, in {{the debate}} on the Address to his Majesty, on the speech from the Throne, the Earl of Guildford (sic) moved an Amendment to the {{following}} effect:--'That the House hoped his Majesty would seize the earliest opportunity to conclude a peace with France,' &c. This motion was opposed by the Duke of Portland, who 'considered the war to be merely grounded on one principle--the preservation of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION'. May 30th, 1794, the Duke of Bedford moved a number of Resolutions, with a view to the Establishment of a Peace with France. He was opposed (among others) by Lord Abingdon in these remarkable words: 'The best road to Peace, my Lords, is WAR! and WAR carried on in the same manner in which we are taught to worship our CREATOR, namely, with <b>all</b> <b>our</b> souls, <b>and</b> with <b>all</b> <b>our</b> minds, <b>and</b> with <b>all</b> <b>our</b> hearts, <b>and</b> with <b>all</b> <b>our</b> strength.'

[...] Jackson had put on 11 runs in South Africa's first-innings, and didn't bat as they declared the second-innings. [...] She only bowled 11 overs in the match; five in the first-innings and six in the second, finishing with match figures of 1/29 as the match was drawn. [...] Due to the expense involved, Jackson couldn't participate {{in the second and third}} Tests; [...] "We had to pay all our own travelling expenses <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> kit.

2500|$|After leaving Rio, Ocean {{sailed through}} the Southern Atlantic {{and into the}} Indian Ocean. She {{experienced}} frightening weather conditions for 77 days.

Parker saved ideas using a voice recorder on his phone, and wrote many songs on a drum machine. Guitars are present in every song on Currents, but are used to accompany and answer other instruments. This was partially due to his gear being inaccessible: [...] "We'd finish one tour in say, Europe, go home for two weeks, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> gear, including my guitars and pedals, would be on their way to South America." [...] He had a larger array of synthesizers at his home studio, which allowed them to become the prominent instrument. He said, [...] "It's really just whatever is sitting around when I think of the song." [...] The album incorporates Parker's falsetto, as well as a vocoder.|$|E

The law is an extremely competitive profession as was emphasised by all our panellists. To succeed, you do not necessarily need a first from Oxbridge.

2500|$|To these {{concrete}} five {{might be}} added a vaguer sixth, {{having to do}} with maintaining a chemical purity in the reaction between product and appraiser. Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike, or committed by friendship to like. Do not imagine yourself a caretaker of any tradition, an enforcer of any party standards, a warrior in any ideological battle, a corrections officer of any kind. Never, never... try to put the author [...] "in his place," [...] making of him a pawn in a contest with other reviewers. Review the book, not the reputation. Submit to whatever spell, weak or strong, is being cast. Better to praise and share than blame and ban. The communion between reviewer and his public is based upon the presumption of certain possible joys of reading, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> discriminations should curve toward that end.|$|E
2500|$|According to Cohen's {{hometown}} paper, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, he was [...] "accused of upsetting the newfound {{atmosphere of}} civility in the House" [...] following the assassination attempt on Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Republicans, {{as well as}} many in the media and in the Jewish community, expressed outrage and demanded that Democrats condemn Cohen's comment. Ron Kampeas of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency wrote that [...] "someone needs to carpet Cohen, pronto, for his rhetoric." [...] His remarks were also condemned by the National Jewish Democratic Council, which issued a statement saying that [...] "invoking the Holocaust to make a political point is never acceptable—on either side of the aisle. Cohen’s comments and similar comments made by others are not helpful as our leaders and citizens conduct a joint effort to advance civility in our political discourse.

2500|$|According to the Muqata blog on Jewish Press {{removal of}} the book was hypocritical as Amazon {{continues}} to sell The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and other materials calling for the erasure of Israel, including those that amount to calls for genocide. [...] "Legal Insurrection", a conservative law blog, also said that banning {{the sale of the}} book wasn't justified, particularly since Amazon continues to sell other blank titles, Mein Kampf, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and [...] "Free Palestine" [...] merchandise. Conversely Tom Suarez on Mondoweiss wrote whereas the Protocols claim is correct and that one could argue that Amazon is in fact a [...] "common utility", but that [...] " [...] History of the Palestinian People is explicitly intended to reinforce the dehumanization of an entire people in order to grease the machinery of subjugation and ethnic cleansing".
