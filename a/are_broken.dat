5|$|Another legend {{about the}} demon Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than the}} god himself. The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid eyes on a woman (extreme chastity). Krishna {{takes the form of}} the beautiful Mohini and marries him. After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of chastity <b>are</b> <b>broken,</b> and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a transsexual deity.|$|E
5|$|Cave 16 {{is a small}} dwelling, on a {{slightly}} higher level above cave 15. It has a cell with a bench along its right wall and a veranda, {{which leads to the}} cell through a door. The side walls as well {{as a part of the}} ceiling <b>are</b> <b>broken.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nineteen carved stone monuments were {{originally}} found at El Chal, {{all of which}} are badly eroded. Various monuments <b>are</b> <b>broken</b> into fragments. Only five stelae and three altars bore sculpted designs. The stelae exhibit a variety of forms but all the altars are circular. None of the hieroglyphic texts found on the monuments of El Chal have yet been deciphered. The sculptural style of the monuments {{is similar to that of}} 8th century monuments from Sacul, Ucanal and Naranjo.|$|E

5|$|Nutrients are transported {{throughout}} the coelom, including the mantle lobes, by cilia. The wastes produced by metabolism <b>are</b> <b>broken</b> into ammonia, which is eliminated by diffusion through the mantle and lophophore. Brachiopods have metanephridia, {{used by many}} phyla to excrete ammonia and other dissolved wastes. However, brachiopods have {{no sign of the}} podocytes, which perform the first phase of excretion in this process, and brachiopod metanephridia appear to be used only to emit sperm and ova.|$|E
5|$|Reduce {{proteolytic}} susceptibility. The rate {{at which}} proteins <b>are</b> <b>broken</b> down can have a large impact on their activity in cells. Since termini are often accessible to proteases, designing a circularly permuted protein with less-accessible termini can increase the lifespan of that protein in the cell.|$|E
5|$|The Parashurameshvara Temple at Bhubaneswar has {{a dancing}} eight-armed Ardhanarishvara. The upper male arms hold a lute and akshamala (rosary), while the upper female ones hold {{a mirror and}} a book; the others <b>are</b> <b>broken.</b> Another non-conventional Ardhanarishvara is found at Darasuram. The {{sculpture}} is three-headed and eight-armed, holding akshamala, khadga (sword), pasha, musala, kapala (skull cup), lotus and other objects.|$|E

5|$|The modern red-brick Grundtvig's Church, {{southeast}} of the town centre, was designed by Ole Nielsen. With its strangely shaped, red-tiled roof, it was completed in 1969. Inside, the large wall surfaces <b>are</b> <b>broken</b> only by 12 narrow windows {{on the east side}}, creating a contrast with the much brighter tower room which opens into the chancel with light entering from a window high {{on the east side of}} the tower.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is similar}} to cave 1 in design. The veranda has two pillars and two {{pilaster}}s, a bench between each pillar and pilaster with curtains in the back, which have a rail pattern. Over the pillars rests the rail-patterned rock beam, above which is the ceiling. Parts of the pillars and pilasters <b>are</b> <b>broken.</b> In front over the beam project rock imitations of rafters. A doorway with grooves for a wooden frame, leads into a middle room, with a bench along the left wall. The position of the hall-cell and cell are exchanged with respect to cave 1 design. Each has a bench.|$|E

5|$|December 44 Museum, La Gleize, Belgium. A cosmetically {{restored}} Tiger II (production turret) Hull number 280273, {{built in}} October 1944. Turret number 213 from s.SS Pz.Abt 501. Displayed {{at the entrance}} to DECEMBER 44 MUSEUM Collections, a museum devoted entirely to the Battle of the Bulge. This tank was abandoned in La Gleize on 24 December 1944, where the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper was halted. The front part, about 1/3, of the gun barrel is restored with a Panther gun barrel and muzzle brake. It also has restored mudguards. It is stripped of exterior and internal fittings and most of the torsion bars <b>are</b> <b>broken,</b> but it still has its gearbox and engine in place.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by acidic water or because it passed through the digestive tract of a predator. The roots <b>are</b> <b>broken</b> off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E
5|$|Nebula Award nominees and {{winners are}} chosen {{by members of}} the SFWA. Works are {{nominated}} each year between November 15 and February 15 by published authors who are members of the organization, with the six works that receive the most nominations forming the final ballot. Additional nominees are possible in the case of ties. Members then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, though they can decline nominations. Ties in the final vote <b>are</b> <b>broken,</b> if possible, by the number of nominations the works received.|$|E
50|$|Bailey's time of 9.84 in Atlanta was the 100m {{world record}} from 1996 until 1999, when it <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> by Maurice Greene.

5|$|Since {{the remains}} of brain cases found in shell middens <b>are</b> <b>broken</b> {{and many of the}} bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and {{possibly}} for exchange and ceremonial purposes. One study looking at the remains in shell middens in Penobscot Bay reported that sea mink craniums were intact, more so than that of other animals found, implying that they were specifically placed there. Males were more often collected than females.|$|E

At the start of the series, all three authors were contributing; the first twenty papers <b>are</b> <b>broken</b> down as eleven by Hamilton, five by Madison and four by Jay. The rest of the series, however, is {{dominated}} by three long segments by a single writer: No. 21 through No. 36 by Hamilton, No. 37 through 58 by Madison, written while Hamilton was in Albany, and No. 65 through the end by Hamilton, published after Madison had left for Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Also, Norway was {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to have all-electric cars topping the new car sales monthly ranking. The Tesla Model S has been the top selling new car four times, and the Nissan Leaf has topped the monthly new car sales ranking twice. In March 2014 the Tesla Model S also broke the 28-year-old record for monthly sales of a single model {{regardless}} of its power source, surpassing the previous record set in May 1986. In July 2016, when new car registrations are break down by type of powertrain, {{for the first time a}} plug-in hybrid, the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, listed as the top selling new car. In September 2016, the Tesla Model X ranked as the top selling new car model in Norway when registrations <b>are</b> <b>broken</b> down by type of powetrain. The BMW i3 was the top selling new car model in the country in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Beta {{oxidation}} is {{the metabolic}} {{process by which}} fatty acids <b>are</b> <b>broken</b> down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, {{a reversal of the}} process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP, CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if {{there is little or no}} glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.|$|E
5|$|Bhairava's {{headgear}} has a ruff on the back, a {{skull and}} cobra over the forehead, and the crescent {{high on the}} right. His facial expression is of anger, conviction of something he must do, {{and one in the}} middle of action. The legs and five of the eight arms <b>are</b> <b>broken,</b> attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava's image. Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva mythology states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon. A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood had the power to become new demons if they got nourished by the ground. Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts of a male and two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs. The uppermost part shows flying apsaras bringing garlands.|$|E
