The carvings are dated to the 9th century and include Celtic patterns, lions, people, cocks and other birds that are pecking at vines.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-fourteenth century a misericord at Gloucester cathedral, England shows {{two young}} men playing a ball game. It looks <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> using their hands for the game; however, kicking {{certainly}} cannot be excluded. It is notable {{for the fact that}} most other medieval images of ball games in England show large balls. This picture clearly shows that small balls were also used.|$|E

25|$|Gödel's Platonism postulates {{a special}} kind of {{mathematical}} intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things Husserl said about mathematics, and supports Kant's idea that mathematics is synthetic a priori.) Davis and Hersh have suggested in their book The Mathematical Experience that most mathematicians act <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> Platonists, even though, if pressed to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to formalism (see below).|$|E

Movement of this reflected normal limb is then performed so that it looks to the patient <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> performing movement with the affected limb (although it will be pain free due to the fact it is a normal limb being reflected).|$|E
25|$|Extrasolar planets – methane was {{detected}} on extrasolar planet HD 189733b; {{this is the}} first detection of an organic compound on a planet outside the solar system. Its origin is unknown, since the planet's high temperature (700°C) would normally favor the formation of carbon monoxide instead. Research indicates that meteoroids slamming against exoplanet atmospheres could add hydrocarbon gases such as methane, making the exoplanets look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> inhabited by life, even if they are not.|$|E

25|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} are {{the most}} prevalent type of hallucinations. They include hearing voices and music. Many times an individual suffering from auditory hallucinations will hear a voice or voices saying the individual's own thoughts out loud, commenting on all their actions, or commanding and ordering the individual around. These voices tend to be negative and critical toward the individual. People who suffer from schizophrenia and have auditory hallucinations will often speak to the voice <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> speaking to a second person.|$|E
25|$|Ingesting a {{compound}} by smoking {{is one of}} the most rapid and efficient methods of introducing it into the bloodstream, second only to injection, which allows for the rapid feedback which supports the smokers' ability to titrate their dosage. On average it takes about ten seconds for the substance to reach the brain. As a result of the efficiency of this delivery system, many smokers feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> unable to cease. Of those who attempt cessation and last three months without succumbing to nicotine, most are able to remain smoke-free for the rest of their lives. There exists a possibility of depression in some who attempt cessation, as with other psychoactive substances. Depression is also common in teenage smokers; teens who smoke are four times as likely to develop depressive symptoms as their nonsmoking peers.|$|E
25|$|Jealous {{servants}} of Ketil who {{look down on}} slaves, destroy Thorfinn's and Einar's wheat crops. When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted {{him to become a}} Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E

The {{instruments in the}} orchestra frequently interrupt both {{each other and the}} female voices, and some sections of the composition seem <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> improvised. Laborintus II makes use of both traditional percussion instruments and electronic sounds, and their interplay serves to [...] "erect musical and textural architectures, then disassemble them quickly". Max Feldman has compared the style to that of Raymond Scott.|$|E
500|$|When asked before {{publication}} {{about the}} forthcoming book, Rowling stated {{that she could}} not change the ending even if she wanted. [...] "These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they're all leading a certain direction. So, I really can't". She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, [...] "almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> two-halves of the same novel". She has said that the last chapter of the book was written [...] "in something like 1990", as part of her earliest work on the series. Rowling also revealed she originally wrote the last words to be [...] "something like: 'Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar. Rowling changed this because she did not want people to think Voldemort would rise again and to say that Harry's mission was over.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the acting}} and the characters, Sims and Monahan praised Middleton's performance. By contrast, Crichlow's role was {{considered}} to be repetitive. Monahan stated she just wailed, and Parker called it [...] "a harrowing performance with no arc or resolutions, just sheer fear and distress." [...] Lambie said: [...] "If there's a criticism to be levelled at the first two-thirds of White Bear, it's that Victoria's carried helplessly along by events." [...] Simon said Crichlow's potential was wasted because of the script. Jeffery criticized the fact [...] "Victoria maintains one emotional level across the episode ... she's tearful, panicked and terrified throughout", but he remarked it was not Crichlow's fault, while praising Middleton and Smiley as [...] "uniformly excellent." [...] Cocks was more favorable, praising Crichlow's commitment to her performance. He also attributed to her performance [...] "one of the episode's greatest accomplishments ... how much it makes audience members feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in the position of [...] ". Edwards asserted she gave a [...] " [...] performance" [...] that is [...] "an excellent, convincing portrayal of a frightened, confused woman".|$|E

500|$|... {{is one of}} the few Australian artists {{here who}} {{combines}} a firm technique with a sensitive and rich emotion. In some of the lighter landscapes in this exhibition, Miss Bellette seems to have been trying to solve some of the particular difficulties of painting Australian landscapes. The clear, strong light tends to flatten the form and bleach the colour; a problem that doesn't lend itself to the dramatic tensions and dark moods that are characteristic of her work. It requires a colder and more dispassionate approach. But when she finds landscapes to her taste, such as the rugged hills and beetling clouds in No. 8, the earth decaying with erosion in No. 19, or the prickly desolation of [...] "Rough Country", No. 14, she handles them with great skill and effectiveness. Her figure drawings are decisively drawn and firmly modelled. The girls have a pensive dignity <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> pondering the burdens and joylessness of a future to be spent as caryatids. The still lives and the interior are admirable exercises in formal organisation, the colours being sombre yet rich.|$|E
500|$|There are {{multiple}} features {{omitted from the}} game that the team considered typical of most video games, such as boss fights. A traditional cover system was excluded for the game as the team wanted players to constantly move around. The team also attempted to cause players to feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> lacking, particularly in the supplies that they collect. [...] "You're not building yourself into a tank," [...] said Straley. This also motivated many of the design decisions of the gameplay, such as the weightlessness of the animations, and the melee combat mechanic. To further add to the realism, the team developed the game's combat mechanic {{in a way that}} forces players to spend more time planning. They also wanted players to be forced to retreat from combat after alerting the Infected, despite their belief that retreating is the [...] "anti-video game play mechanic". The combat mechanic was developed to feel intense, intentionally moving the camera closer to players, {{in order for them to}} [...] "feel every strike". The team felt that the game forces players to make difficult choices, in terms of combat, stealth and resource management, allowing them to understand the decisions made by the characters.|$|E

Gray stated: [...] "While many {{events that}} run across {{multiple}} titles often slap a logo on an existing series {{and call it}} a tie-in...Lemire ensures that his team are an integral part, [...] the team finally feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> part of a wider DC universe. Indeed, in many ways, this appears to be the primary goal of “Trinity War”, in that it unites the often disparate strands of the New 52." [...] Joshua Yehl of IGN gave the issue a 7.0 out of 10, saying [...] "While the art and characters are done well, the overall plot of Trinity War leaves much to be desired." [...] However, he praised Jeff Lemire's character work, and felt that Mikel Janin's art was the [...] "cleanest and most consistent looking chapter of [...] "Trinity War" [...] thus far." [...] Comic Book Resources' Kelly Thompson gave the issue 2.5 stars out of 5, saying the issue [...] "gets devoured by the massive [...] "Trinity War" [...] and buckles under the weight" [...] adding that the debate seems more plot driven than character driven. Despite the criticism of the story, Thompson praised Janin's art saying, [...] "he does nearly the impossible and draws just about every single major character in the DCU perfectly." ...|$|E
