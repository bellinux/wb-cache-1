On January 2, 1858, the Economic Society unanimously named him the Secretary of the Studies Commission. On June 4, 1860, the organization named him spokesman of a commission to promote conservation of the island's natural resources. Later that year, Baldorioty de Castro represented Puerto Rico as a delegate in the Spanish Parliament, serving for five years until 1865. On September 17, 1864, he was certified as an <b>applied</b> <b>mechanics</b> professor and worked for a salary of thirty-five dollars a month.|$|E

25|$|Soon after returning, Asachi was {{appointed}} caretaker of all Moldavian schools and Vel Agha. In March 1828, {{he succeeded in}} opening a multilingual upper school and gymnasium, connected to the Trei Ierarhi Church, named Şcoala Vasiliană or Gimnaziul Vasilian (in honor of the 17th-century prince Vasile Lupu, who had created the original education institution on that site). It was the first modern institution {{of its kind in}} Moldavia, and was soon supplemented by a college. Şcoala Vasiliană also continued the engineering course, taught by Gheorghe Filipescu, and had additional chairs in mathematics, architecture, <b>applied</b> <b>mechanics</b> and hydraulics; in 1834, it sent several of its alumni, including the architect Alexandru Costinescu, for further studies abroad. On July 19, 1827, a great fire in Iaşi's western quarter destroyed Asachi's lodging, as well as the vast majority of his possessions and manuscripts.|$|E

[...] At around this time, he {{was appointed to the}} governing council of Cheltenham College, of which he remained a member {{for the rest of his}} life. [...] Inglis was the president of the 1934 International Congress on Theoretical and <b>Applied</b> <b>Mechanics</b> held at Cambridge, one of the series of Congresses that gave rise to the IUTAM.

Giovanni Borelli was prolific in <b>applying</b> <b>mechanics</b> {{to a wide variety}} of humans and animals in different degrees of activity, drawing upon an array of simple machines and models for translational and rotational motion and equilibrium.|$|R
500|$|Inglis was {{associated}} with the Institution of Naval Architects, Institution of Civil Engineers, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Institution of Structural Engineers, Institution of Waterworks Engineers and British Waterworks Association; he sat on several of their councils and was elected the Institution of Civil Engineers' president for the 1941–42 session. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society. [...] Inglis sat on the board of inquiry investigating the loss of the airship R101 and was chair of a Ministry of War Transport railway modernisation committee in 1946. [...] Knighted in 1945, he spent his later years developing his theories on the education of engineers and wrote a textbook on <b>applied</b> <b>mechanics.</b> [...] He has been described as the greatest teacher of engineering of his time and has a building named in his honour at Cambridge University.|$|E
500|$|In 1901 Inglis {{was made}} a fellow of King's College after writing a thesis {{entitled}} The Balancing of Engines, the first general treatment of the subject– which was becoming increasingly important due to the growing speeds of locomotives. In the same year, he received his Master of Arts degree and was accepted as an Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) associate member after winning the institution's Miller Prize for his student paper on The Geometrical Methods in Investigating Mechanical Problems. [...] Inglis left his employment with Wolfe-Barry, having completed {{two years of his}} five-year apprenticeship, to return to King's College and become an assistant to James Alfred Ewing, professor of mechanism and <b>applied</b> <b>mechanics.</b> [...] Inglis maintained his interest in engine balancing and filed a US patent on 16 April 1902 for an improved engine with the cylinders mounted end to end to balance out the forces acting between them.|$|E
500|$|Inglis {{returned}} to Cambridge in 1918 and was appointed as the professor of Mechanism and <b>Applied</b> <b>Mechanics</b> (renamed Mechanical Sciences in 1934). On 25 March 1919, {{he was selected}} to head the Cambridge University Engineering Department as the successor of Hopkinson, {{who had died in}} an air crash the previous year. Though he made no radical changes, such as had occurred under his predecessors, under Inglis' supervision the department became the largest in the university {{and one of the best}} engineering schools in the world. [...] He was responsible for expanding the department to meet the increased post-war demand for engineers and for the move from its traditional home at Free School Lane. [...] Inglis acquired the [...] Scroope House on Trumpington Street for the department and constructed a [...] laboratory on the site by 1923, followed in 1931 by a structure containing lecture theatres and a drawing office.|$|E

500|$|After his {{retirement}} as department head Inglis served as Vice-Provost of King's College from 1943 to 1947. [...] He received a knighthood in the 1945 King's Birthday Honours, and in 1946 was appointed {{as chair of}} the committee charged with advising the Minister of War Transport on railway modernisation. [...] Inglis continued to develop his theories on teaching engineering and wrote in the Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1947 on the teaching of engineering mathematics: [...] "Mathematics [...] though it must be sound and incisive as far as goes, need not be of that artistic and exalted quality which calls for the mentality of the real mathematician. [...] It can be termed mathematics of the tin-opening variety, and in contrast to real mathematicians, engineers are more interested in the contents of the tin than in the elegance of the tin-opener employed". [...] He published the textbook <b>Applied</b> <b>Mechanics</b> for Engineers in 1951, following which he spent three months as a visiting professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. [...] His wife, Lady Eleanor Inglis, died on 1 April 1952, and Charles died eighteen days later at Southwold, Suffolk. [...] The Cambridge University Engineering Department's Inglis Building is named in his honour. [...] Inglis has been described as the greatest teacher of engineering of his time.|$|E
