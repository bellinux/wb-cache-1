40|$|M. Ing. (Civil Engineering) Cold-formed steel lipped {{channels}} {{are among the}} most used sections, as framing members in the building construction industry, especially in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. In portal frame, when lipped {{channels are}} used as main frame members, they are usually restrained from the top flange through angle-cleat to prevent lateral-torsional buckling. This restraining system works together with an additional restrain system called fly-bracing. Drilling a bolt-hole or welding the <b>angle</b> <b>cleat</b> onto the flange of the main frame weakens its bearing length. Additional disadvantage of this restraining system is the fabrication costs of providing fly bracing. However, past research into lateral-torsional buckling of cold-formed steel lipped channel sections are limited. Therefore this study investigates a restrain that avoids bolt holes and welding in the top flange of the rafter, and the use of fly bracing. In the first phase of this research, tensile coupon tests of the three cross-sections are conducted to obtain the material properties. The elastic modulus and yield strength of the cold-formed steel used are determined from stress-strain relationship. These properties are used to calculate the code-predicted lateral-torsional buckling moment resistance. The second phase of this study involves a series of experiments on the lateral torsional instability of single cold-formed channels. The channels are restrained by a purlin – <b>angle</b> <b>cleat</b> connection and are subjected to a two point loading system in order to simulate a distributed load. Failure of the channels occurred by local buckling of the compression zone of the flange and web and lateral torsional buckling of the channels between points of lateral support. Tests have shown the purlin – <b>angle</b> <b>cleat</b> connection to be capable of restraining the frames from failing due to lateral-torsional buckling. This eliminates the idea of using fly-bracings, as is normally done in practice to restrain torsional instability. The results from the experimental study do agree well with those predict by the South- African code, SANS 10162 - 2 : 2005. This research presents the details and results of the experimental study including a comparison of results with the South-African code SANS 10162 - 2 : 2005 predictions. It also presents the recommendations made regarding the use of a numerical model study in order to compare the results with those from the experiments...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{numerical}} simulations {{were performed on}} reinforced concrete cladding panels with different curvatures subjected to explosive loading. The LS-DYNA finite element program along with the Concrete Damage Model was used to develop the numerical model and calibrated using the results of existing explosive trials. Both convex and concave shaped single curvature panels were assessed along with standards flat panels for the blast performance. Two different connection types were considered for the evaluation, which were identical to those used in the original explosive trials, named as dowelled type and <b>angle</b> <b>cleat</b> type connections. Improved performance with reduced transverse deformations was observed for the convex shaped panels {{in comparison with the}} original flat panel. However, concave shaped panels exhibited a more flexible response. Connection forces did not exhibit a significant variation although the panel response was different with change in curvature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It {{is common}} {{practice}} in the steel construction industry to restrain members that largely in flexure and torsion {{using a combination of}} <b>angle</b> <b>cleats,</b> connected at the top flange, and fly-bracings. This system is complicated and expensive, especially when used to restrain channels in bending. This paper investigates experimentally the use of <b>angle</b> <b>cleats,</b> connected to the webs of both the purlin and the channels, as a restraining system. Pairs of channels were subjected to a two point loading system in order to simulate a distributed load. Variable in the tests include the unbraced length between the two-point loads {{and the size of the}} channels. Failure of the channels occurred by lateral torsional buckling and catastrophic distortional buckling of the intermediate unbraced length. Tests showed that the purlin-cleat restraining system is able to resist lateral torsional buckling of the channels, and that this system can be used without any fly bracing. Distortional buckling was the final failure mode, and it occurred at moments less than the predicted lateral-torsional buckling moment of resistance. Distortional buckling is more critical in frames with shorter unbraced lengths and thicker channels...|$|R

Different means for precast beam column connections were adopted such as connection using dowel bar, dowel bar with <b>cleat</b> <b>angles,</b> <b>cleat</b> <b>angles</b> with single stiffener and double stiffener, tie rod and steel plates, use of cast in place concrete in beam and column, composite connection with welding, bolted connections, etc. Performance of precast connections was measured {{on the basis of}} strength, hysteretic behavior, energy dissipation capacity, ductility, and stiffness degradation and the same were compared with monolithic beam column connection.|$|R

40|$|Robustness of {{structures}} to prevent progressive collapse {{has been considered}} by different building codes since the Ronan Point accident in the UK in 1968 and research on this type of collapse {{was brought to the}} fore after the building collapses at the World Trade Center on 9 / 11 2001. In the case of losing a column, to maintain the integrity of the building large end rotation of the beams is likely to be required in order to transfer the vertical loads from the floor above by redistribution of loads through the remaining structure. For this reason connections are important in enabling the structure to bridge over the lost column. Connections also need to be capable of resisting high strain rates arising from the dynamic redistribution of moments and tension loads which means they require high ductility to dissipate energy and undergo deformation without failure. This thesis presents results from both experimental tests conducted on connections under quasi-static and rapidly applied loading (performed as part of an EPSRC funded research project [1] Prior to the PhD research), and a series of ANSYS LS-DYNA finite element analyses which have been developed to model the connection response. Web-cleat and End-plate connection models, with their complex geometry, has been produced and validated against experimental data. The effect of rate of applied loading on connection response has been investigated both experimentally and by numerical modelling. It is important to understand the effect of loading rate on the response of connections in dynamic frame response to column loss. The results indicate that web <b>angle</b> <b>cleat</b> connections are relatively insensitive to the rate of loading within the range considered here. This suggests that static characterisation of web <b>angle</b> <b>cleat</b> connections may yield suitable data for use in dynamic analysis of frame response in column loss scenarios. End-plate connections behaved differently and this type of connection was sensitive to loading rates and this showed that static characterisation of this connection is not enough for dynamic analysis. This study highlight a gap in knowledge of welded material properties, and provided the results of parametric studies (different loading types, rates and connection geometry) on these two types of connections. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to develop numerical modelling procedures for composite connections and to use results generated in conjunction with data from other sources {{as the basis for}} the preparation of design procedures. The finite element method has been used for the numerical simulation of composite endplate connections. The developed model was verified by comparing both local measures of response and overall behaviour with test results. The validated model was then used in conjunction with theoretical analysis to study the behaviour of composite endplate connections for variable shear to moment ratios. This permitted the identification of those cases for which changes in the shear to moment ratio affects the connection's moment capacity. The model was also used in conjunction with theoretical analysis to study the effect of varying levels of axial column loading on the connection moment capacity. Results of both studies indicated a need for modifications to the equations of EC 3 (for bare steel connections but which are also applicable to composite connections) that consider the interaction with column loading. These are: the equations for column web compression resistance, column web shear resistance and the bolt force. Using the FEM results, available test results and EC 3 and EC 4 equations for the determination of basic component forces, design procedures for composite flush endplate, finplate and <b>angle</b> <b>cleated</b> connections are proposed. Predictions from the design method have been compared with a total of 53 test and finite element results for the flush endplate connections (32 laboratory tests from 7 different sources plus a further 21 numerical results) so as to provide validation over the full range of parameters. These comparisons gave an overall prediction to test ratio of 0. 99 with a standard deviation of 0. 14, thereby demonstrating that the proposed method can accurately predict the resistance of composite flush endplate connections under a variety of different connection arrangements and loading conditions. Similarly, the prediction from the design method was compared with 6 finplate test results which gave an average prediction to test ratio of 1. 06 with a standard deviation of 0. 18. Comparisons for the <b>angle</b> <b>cleated</b> connection using 16 test results from 4 different sources gave an average prediction to test ratio of 0. 98 with a standard deviation of 0. 13. Theoretical studies have been performed to develop equations to predict the initial stiffness for composite endplate connections and these have been verified against test results. Suggestions to predict the available rotation capacity of flush endplate connections have also been made. This two methods has been combined with the moment capacity model to develop a prediction method for the overall behaviour of the flush endplate connections. The finite element method has also been used to develop a numerical simulation of non-sway composite frames. Comparisons of results show good agreement with the observed test behaviour. It has been found that it is possible to model the non-sway frames in a way that can predict the frame moment distribution, connection moment - rotation response and the beam load displacement history with sufficient accuracy. This provides an economic tool to study different aspects of the behaviour of composite non-sway frames. A numerical model has been developed for un-braced steel frames by simplifying the composite frame model. This model was verified using numerical results selected from the work of other researchers. Using the model for steel frames, studies were conducted for sway behaviour which provide guidance on behaviour suitable as a basis for developing design procedures...|$|R
40|$|Disproportionate {{collapse}} {{occurs when}} the removal of load bearing members (one or more columns, or load bearing walls) causes localized structural damage which leads to further loss of load bearing members and, ultimately, {{to the collapse of}} whole or part of the structure. The accidental load, carried by the removed column can be transferred to nearby columns either by beam action or by catenary action. Simple connections such as fin plate, double <b>angle</b> web <b>cleat</b> and flexible end plate connections are routinely assumed to be com-pliant with the tying force design method, which aims to ensure that column loads are redistributed via cate-nary action in the event of damage. This is feasible only if the joints have sufficient ductility as well as tensile strength. Semi-rigid and rigid connections redistribute the column loads through beam action, provided that the connections have sufficient rotation capacity. This investigation demonstrates that the beam-column joints (simple and semi-rigid connections) in many designs have insufficient ductility to successfully bridge dam-aged columns. In simple (nominally pinned) connections, a couple can develop between beam flange and col-umn due to insufficient joint ductility. The resulting prying action is shown to cause early joint fracture and subsequently to lead to progressive failure. In semi-rigid connections, the beam remains elastic and the con-nections plastify, leading to early joint failure...|$|R
30|$|The present work {{evaluates the}} Frye and Morris (1975) {{polynomial}} {{model for the}} design of DWA connection. The moment-rotation behaviour of bolted DWA connections is studied by varying three key parameters: <b>cleat</b> <b>angle</b> thickness, depth of angle and the gauge distance. The effect of air gap between the beam web and column flange is considered as it is found to affect the connection stiffness to a great extent (Prabha et al. 2008). Numerical simulations are carried out using the commercial FEA software package, ABAQUS. To validate the numerical model, test details and the results of previous experimental work conducted by Raman 2005 on DWA connection are used. The results from the numerical parametric studies are then used to modify the Frye and Morris (1975) model for DWA connections with air gap as an additional size parameter.|$|R
40|$|Structural steel design {{standards}} recognize lateral torsional buckling {{as a failure}} mode governing the capacity of long span unsupported beams with wide flange cross-sections. Standard solutions start with the closed form solution of the Vlasov thin-walled beam theory for {{the case of a}} simply supported beam under uniform moments, and modify the solution to accommodate various moment distributions through moment gradient expressions. The Vlasov theory solution {{is based on the assumption}} that cross-sectional distortional effects have a negligible effect on the predicted elastic critical moment. The present study systematically examines the validity of the Vlasov assumption related to cross-section distortion through a parametric study. A series of elastic shell finite element eigen-value buckling analyses is conducted on simply supported beams subject to uniform moments, linear moments and mid span point loads as well as cantilevers subject to top flange loading acting at the tip. Cross-sectional dimensions are selected to represent structural steel cross-section geometries used in practice. Particular attention is paid to model end connection details commonly used in practice involving moment connections with two pairs of stiffeners, simply supported ends with a pair of transverse stiffeners, simply supported ends with <b>cleat</b> <b>angle</b> details, and built in fixation at cantilever roots. The critical moments obtained from the FEA are compared to those based on conventional critical moment equations in various Standards and published solutions. The effects of web slenderness, flange slenderness, web height to flange width ratio, and span to height ratios on the critical moment ratio are systematically quantified. For some combinations of section geometries and connection details, it is shown that present solutions derived from the Vlasov theory can overestimate the lateral torsional buckling resistance for beams...|$|R
