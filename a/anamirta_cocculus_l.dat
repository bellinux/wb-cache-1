40|$|AbstractThe present work {{is aimed}} at primary {{screening}} of the phytochemical contents of seven solvents (petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform, acetone, methanol, ethanol and a mixture of methanol and ethyl acetate (1 : 3)) extracts of the seeds of <b>Anamirta</b> <b>cocculus</b> (Linn.) and to evaluate the antibacterial activity of these extracts against five species of pathogenic bacteria. The powdered seeds of A. cocculus were extracted with seven solvents (polar and non-polar) with Soxhlet apparatus and the extracts were subjected to preliminary phytochemical screening by standard biochemical tests. The antibacterial activity of various extracts was evaluated against five bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The zone of inhibitions and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the various extracts were determined by running the experiments in triplicates. The extracts of the seeds of A. cocculus contained various pharmaceutically active substances viz., aldehydes, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, glycosides, phytosterols, volatile oils, gums and mucilage and other minor phytochemicals. All the extracts showed significant levels of antibacterial activity. Methanol extract was the most active one with remarkable antibacterial activity on the various species tested. MICs of the extracts revealed methanol extract as the most potent one with the lowest inhibitory concentration of 3 μg/mL on E. coli. The findings {{of the present study}} indicated that the seeds of A. cocculus possess various secondary metabolites having the potential for developing pharmaceutical drugs, especially antimicrobial ones...|$|R

40|$|Spotted wing {{drosophila}} (SWD), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) is {{a serious}} invasive pest of small fruit production in North and South America and Europe since 2008. The primary control method is to apply insecticides every 5 - 7 days. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop control tactics that are less chemical dependent to enhance an integrated approach for SWD management. The objectives of this study were to monitor SWD populations in different crop systems and adjacent landscape habitats; identify wild hosts of SWD; evaluate the effectiveness of insect exclusion netting in tunnels to prevent blackberry and blueberry infestations, and compare effects of netted tunnels on temperature and fruit quality. The majority of seasonal averages of SWD were lower in the traps placed in fruit crop plots than in the perimeter traps located next to a refuse pile of culled fruit and mulch than the traps located in host crop species. Of the potential wild fruit hosts sampled in Arkansas, these 12 had SWD infested fruit: wild blackberry and dewberry (Rubus spp.), American pokeweed (Phytolacca americana L.), black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), Carolina buckthorn (Frangula caroliniana (Walter) A. Gray), porcelain berry (Ampelopsis glandulosa var. brevipedunculata (Maxim.) Momiy), amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Herder); autumn olive (Elaeagnus spp.); elderberry (Sambucus spp.); mulberry (Morus spp.); native honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.); and Carolina moonseed (<b>Cocculus</b> carolinus (<b>L.)</b> DC.).
