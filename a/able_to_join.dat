Various candidates were considered for his replacement, including: Buzz Shearman, ex-Moxy member, who was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> because of voice problems, ex-Back Street Crawler vocalist Terry Slesser and then Slade vocalist, Noddy Holder.

5|$|Prost won his fourth, and final, title, {{but in a}} {{year where}} he was {{regularly}} challenged by teammate Hill, and Ayrton Senna. Shortly before the Portuguese Grand Prix in October 1993, Prost announced he would not defend his world title, as the clause in the Frenchman's contract did not extend to 1994 and Senna would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> Williams for the upcoming season, and instead opted to retire as the driver with the record for most grand prix victories — a record which stood for almost a decade. On the podium in Adelaide in 1993, Prost's last race, he and Senna embraced. Prost {{was surprised by the}} gesture, as Senna had declined a handshake the race before. Prost's performances earned him an OBE.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclave}} {{began on}} February 15, 1769. Initially only 27 cardinals participated. Zelanti, {{taking advantage of}} the small number of the electors and the absence of the French and Spanish cardinals, tried to achieve a quick election of Cardinal Flavio Chigi. In one ballot he was only two votes short of being elected. The efforts of Zelanti met with strong protests from the ambassadors of France and Spain, but, fortunately for them, Cardinal Orsini, protector of the Kingdom of Naples and the only crown-cardinal present in the early ballots, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> some neutral cardinals to block Chigi’s candidature.|$|E

5|$|Tittle {{was then}} {{drafted by the}} San Francisco 49ers in the 1951 NFL Draft after the Colts folded. While many players {{at the time were}} unable to play {{immediately}} due to military duties, Tittle had received a class IV-F exemption due to physical ailments, so he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the 49ers roster that season. In 1951 and 1952, he shared time at quarterback with Frankie Albert. In 1953, his first full season as the 49ers' starter, he passed for 2,121 yards and twenty touchdowns and was invited to his first Pro Bowl. San Francisco finished with a 9–3 regular season record, which was good enough for second in the Western Conference, and led the league in points scored.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the eternal.|$|E
5|$|When news {{first arrived}} that Philip was in Elatea, {{just three days}} march away, there was panic in Athens. In what Cawkwell {{describes}} as his proudest moment, Demosthenes alone counseled against despair, and proposed that the Athenians should seek an alliance with the Thebans; his decree was passed, and he was sent as ambassador. Philip had also sent an embassy to Thebes, requesting that the Thebans join him, or at least allow him to pass through Boeotia unhindered. Since the Thebans were still not formally at war with Philip, they could have avoided the conflict altogether. However, in spite of Philip's proximity, and their traditional enmity with Athens, they chose to ally with the Athenians, {{in the cause of}} liberty for Greece. The Athenian army had already pre-emptively been sent in the direction of Boeotia, and was therefore <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the Thebans within days of the alliance being agreed.|$|E
25|$|Sobremonte gave a speech, {{directing}} <b>able</b> men <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the militias. Organization {{was lacking}} and not everybody was supplied with arms.

His own officers accused him of the chaos and confusion, but did little to remedy the situation.|$|R

5|$|During the Western Han, farming peasants {{formed the}} {{majority}} of those who were conscripted by the government to perform corvée labor or military duties. For the labor service (gengzu 更卒), males aged fifteen to fifty-six would be drafted for one month out of the year to work on construction projects and perform other duties in their commanderies and counties. For the military obligation (zhengzu 正卒), all males aged twenty-three were to train for one year in one of three branches of the military: infantry, cavalry, or navy. Until they reached age fifty-six, they were liable to perform one year of active service as troops sent to guard the frontiers from hostile nomads or to act as guards in the capital city. Significant changes were made to this system during Eastern Han; a commuting tax could be paid by peasants if they wanted to avoid the one-month labor obligation, since hired labor became more popular in construction and other projects. The military service obligation could even be avoided if a peasant paid a commuting tax, since the Eastern Han military became largely a volunteer force. Other commoners such as merchants were also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the army.|$|E
5|$|Mansell {{was rewarded}} {{for his part}} in the victory and was named Vice-Admiral of the Narrow Seas in {{commemoration}} of the name of the battle. Van Duyvenvoorde and Cant both received honorary golden chains from the States of Holland. As for Spinola, he managed to save half of the galleys, as the two which had reached Nieuwpoort were soon <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> San Luis in Dunkirk. From there, the three ships sailed unmolested to Sluis, where Spinola with his five galleys still possessed a threat to the English and Dutch shipping. Both the English and the Dutch were gradually able to gain supremacy in the seas not just in and around the English Channel but in all the European waters. As a result, Spinola would be defeated again and mortally wounded at the Battle of Sluys by the blockading Dutch forces in an attempt to escape. Spinola's death and the subsequent surrender of Sluis to the Dutch in 1604 ended his and Philip III's dreams, and English fears, of a galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly won a {{scholarship}} to the Sydney Teachers College at Sydney University, to train as a schoolmaster. However, the financial assistance was only {{for two years and}} merely sufficient for O'Reilly's rent at Glebe Point. When he was in Sydney, O'Reilly received an invitation to join an athletics club based on his performances in Goulburn, but was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> after the secretary Dick Corish waived his membership fee. Jumping 47feet, he came second in a triple jump competition behind Nick Winter, who went on to win gold in the event at the 1924 Summer Olympics with a world record of 50ft. O'Reilly also placed second in a high jumping competition, clearing six feet. Corish was also a cricket administrator and invited O'Reilly to play in a David Jones Second XI. Not knowing anything of his new recruit's abilities, Corish did not allow O'Reilly to bowl until he explicitly complained of only being allowed to field. O'Reilly promptly finished off the opposition's innings by removing the middle and lower order. After an encounter with journalist Johnny Moyes, who wrote glowingly about O'Reilly's skills.|$|E

25|$|For 1994, Senna was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>join</b> the Williams team {{given the}} {{retirement}} of Prost and was reportedly paid a $20 million salary.
