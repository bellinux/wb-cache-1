40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} building a subsea power cable between Iceland and the UK. It aims to provide {{a better understanding of}} the cost and benefits associated with the international liberalisation of Iceland’s electricity market. The first part of the thesis explores the simulation results of a large-scale simulation model for the European energy market (LIBEMOD), where a cable has been implemented. The model accounts for total energy produced, as well as total energy consumed, in each of the model countries, including the 27 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. The second part of the thesis mainly focuses on the decision for buying and selling electricity through a subsea power cable between Iceland and the UK in order to explore the <b>arbitrage</b> <b>possibility,</b> which provides a thorough account of the value of the adaptability of Icelandic hydropower. There are two interlinked issues in hydropower scheduling: i) determination of the water value; and ii) optimal bidding into the day-ahead marked conditional upon the water value, which are identified theoretically. A conceptual solution using stochastic dynamic programming is provided and is supported by a simplified version of the problem along the lines of a battery problem (i. e., a given storage with a stochastic inflow and fixed domestic demand interacting with the UK market through a day-ahead auction). The study concludes that building a 900 MW subsea power cable between Iceland and the UK would significantly increase electricity production in Iceland due to higher prices. This would result in a considerable redistribution of welfare from consumers to producers, and an increase in welfare in the country’s energy sector by € 64 million a year, compared to no cable being installed. In addition, the connection to cheap green power supplies is beneficial to the UK, where the economic welfare would increase by € 41 million per year for a 900 MW cable in contrast to a scenario where there is no cable. Moreover, there is an increase in the total economic welfare of both countries when there is a higher investment resulting in a 1471 MW cable, together with an increase in the total producer and consumer surplus in both countries...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} trading of the Chinese American Depositories Receipts (ADRs) and their {{respective}} underlying H shares issued in Hong Kong. The primary intention of this work is to investigate the arbitrage opportunity between the Chinese ADRs and their underlying H shares. This intention is motivated by the market observation that hedge funds are often in the top 10 shareholders of these Chinese ADRs. We start our study from the origin place of the Chinese ADRs, China’s stock market. We {{pay particular attention to}} the ownership structure of the Chinese listed firms, because part of the Chinese ADRs also listed A shares (exclusively owned by the Chinese citizens) in Shanghai. We also pay attention to the market microstructures and trading costs of the three China-related stock exchanges. We then proceed to empirical study on the Chinese ADRs <b>arbitrage</b> <b>possibility</b> by comparing the return distribution of two securities; we find these two securities are different in their return distributions, and which is due to the inequality in the higher moments, such as skewness, and kurtosis. Based on the law of one price and the weak-form efficient markets, the prices of identical securities that are traded in different markets should be similar, as any deviation in their prices will be arbitraged away. Given the intrinsic property of the ADRs that a convenient transferable mechanism exists between the ADRs and their underlying shares which makes arbitrage easy; the different return distributions of the ADRs and the underlying shares address the question that if arbitrage is costly that the equilibrium price of the security achieved in each market is affected mainly by its local market where the Chinese ADRs/the underlying Hong Kong shares are traded, such as the demand for and the supply of the stock in each market, the different market microstructures and market mechanisms which produce different trading costs in each market, and different noise trading arose from asymmetric information across multi-markets. And because of these trading costs, noise trading risk, and liquidity risk, the arbitrage opportunity between the two markets would not be exploited promptly. This concern then leads to the second intention of this work that how noise trading and trading cost comes into playing the role of determining asset prices, which makes us to empirically investigate the comovement effect, as well as liquidity risk. With regards to these issues, we progress into two strands, firstly, we test the relationship between the price differentials of the Chinese ADRs and the market return of the US and Hong Kong market. This test is to examine the comovement effect which is caused by asynchronous noise trading. We find the US market impact dominant over Hong Kong market impact, though both markets display significant impact on the ADRs’ price differentials. Secondly, we analyze the liquidity effect on the Chinese ADRs and their underlying Hong Kong shares by using two proxies to measure illiquidity cost and liquidity risk. We find significant positive relation between return and trading volume which is used to capture liquidity risk. This finding leads to a deeper study on the relationship between trading volume and return volatility from market microstructure perspective. In order to verify a proper model to describe return volatility, we carry out test to examine the heteroscedasticity condition, and proceed to use two asymmetric GARCH models to capture leverage effect. We find the Chinese ADRs and their underlying Hong Kong shares have different patterns in the leverage effect as modeled by these two asymmetric GARCH models, and this finding from another angle explains why these two securities are unequal in the higher moments of their return distribution. We then test two opposite hypotheses about volume-volatility relation. The Mixture of Distributions Hypothesis suggests a positive relation between contemporaneous volume and volatility, while the Sequential Information Arrival Hypothesis indicates a causality relationship between lead-lag volume and volatility. We find supportive evidence for the Sequential Information Arrival Hypothesis but not for the Mixture of Distributions Hypothesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|In the {{canonical}} model of frictionless markets, arbitrage is usually taken to force all trades of homogeneous goods to occur at {{essentially the same}} price.

We characterize the configurations that, at an intertemporal bargaining equilibrium, lead to a uniform price.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{investigated}} the ex-dividend stock price behavior on the Stockholm Stock Exchange {{to see if there}} are any <b>arbitrage</b> trading <b>possibilities</b> in connection with the ex-day. Our data sample consisted of all Swedish stocks that paid out a cash dividend during the period 1994 - 1998 which amounted to 837 observations. We can conclude that there in fact are <b>arbitrage</b> <b>possibilities</b> since the price correction has on average been less than the dividend paid out. The OTC market is the market where the biggest <b>arbitrage</b> <b>possibilities</b> exist. In 1994 taxes on dividend were zero and that attracted short-term traders who determined the price setting on the ex-day and therefore the price fall was closer to the dividend. In 1995 the taxes on dividends and capital gains were set equal and as a consequence the price correction ratio was significantly lower which indicates that the price determination was now dominated by long-term investors who trade on other issues than the dividend. We can also conclude that there was a Clientele Effect on the ex-dividend day in the sense that higher dividend yield stocks attracted more short-term traders than the low dividend yield stocks. We found no significant differences for the ex-day effect for those companies that that are cross-listed on both the New York Stock Exchange and Stockholm's Stock Exchange compared to those only listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange...|$|R

40|$|The current {{literature}} {{does not provide}} efficient models for commodity prices and futures valuation. This inadequacy {{is partly due to}} the fact that the two main streams of the literature - structural models and reduced form models - are largely disjoint. In particular, existing structural models are developed under rigid discrete time framework that does not take into account the mean-reverting properties of commodity prices. Furthermore, most of the literature within this class does not analyze the properties of the futures prices. Current reduced-form models allow cash-and-carry <b>arbitrage</b> <b>possibilities</b> and do not take into account the dependence between the spot price volatility and the inventory levels. This thesis investigates three new models for the price of a storable commodity and futures valuation. Specifically, we develop a structural model and two reduced-form models. In doing so, we expand the leading models within each of the two streams of the literature, by establishing a link between them. Each of these models provide an advance of their type. This study makes several contributions to the literature. We provide a new structural model in continuous time that takes into account the mean reversion of commodity prices. This model is formulated as a stochastic dynamic control problem. The formulation provided is flexible and can easily be extended to encompass alternative microeconomic specifications of the market. The results provide an optimal storage policy, the equilibrium prices and the spot price variability. We also develop a numerical method that allows the construction and analysis of the forward curves implied by this model. We provide a separate analysis considering a competitive storage and considering a monopolistic storage. The results are consistent with the theory of storage. Furthermore, the comparison between monopoly and competition confirm the economic theory. We developed a simple reduced-form model that focuses both on the mean reverting properties of commodity prices and excludes cash-and-carry <b>arbitrage</b> <b>possibilities.</b> This model is compared with a standard single-factor model in the literature. This new model adds two important features to the standard model and motivates the development of a more sophisticated reduced-form model. Accordingly, the last model developed in this thesis is a reduced-form model. It is a two-factor model that represents the spot price and the convenience yield as two correlated stochastic factors. This model excludes cash-and-carry <b>arbitrage</b> <b>possibilities</b> and takes into account the relationship between the spot price volatility and the inventory level. We find an analytical solution for the futures prices. This model is tested empirically using crude oil futures data and it Is compared with one of the leading models in the literature. Both models are calibrated using Kalman filter techniques. The empirical results suggest that both models need to be improved in order to better fit the long-term volatility structure of futures contracts.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{modification}} of the option pricing framework derived by Borland which removes the <b>possibilities</b> for <b>arbitrage</b> within this framework.

For a sample of European sectoral iTraxx CDS indexes, a correlation study reveals a tendency for iTraxx CDS spreads to narrow when stock prices rise and vice versa. Furthermore, there is some evidence of firm-specific information being embedded into stock prices before it is embedded into CDS spreads.
