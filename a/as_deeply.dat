5|$|By 1816, the Shelleys {{were living}} in Italy and in 1818 and 1819, two of their young {{children}} died, Clara and William. Mary entered into a deep depression and became alienated from Percy, who was not <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> affected {{by the loss of}} their children. Mary Shelley revived a bit with the birth of Percy Florence later in 1819.|$|E
5|$|The dark bluish-green {{color and}} the widely spaced, deeply cut and {{indented}} pinnae differentiate A.montanum from most related species. The pinnae of Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi) are toothed and less deeply cut, and the dark color of the stipe continues partway up the rachis in that species. Wall-rue (A.ruta-muraria) has a green stipe, and its pinnae have longer stalks and are broadest near the tip. Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a hybrid between Bradley's spleenwort and mountain spleenwort, is intermediate between its parents. When compared with mountain spleenwort, the blade of Wherry's spleenwort is lance-shaped, rather than triangular; the upper parts of the blade are not <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> cut; and the dark color of the stipe extends {{to the beginning of}} the rachis.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, {{the siege}} of Nicaea was the high-water-mark of the post-718 Umayyad raids; never again would Umayyad armies {{penetrate}} <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> into Asia Minor. Increasingly thereafter the Syro-Jaziran army, that provided the manpower for the raids against Byzantium, was diverted in the hard and fruitless wars against the Khazars in the Caucasus: the Khazars inflicted a heavy defeat on the Muslims in 730, and a Byzantine–Khazar alliance was sealed by the marriage of Leo III's son and heir Constantine V (r. 741–775) with the Khazar princess Irene shortly after. Over the next few years, while Byzantine strength revived, the Muslim military situation on all fronts of the over-extended Caliphate deteriorated. Consequently, in the 730s, Arab raids were mostly limited to the immediate frontier regions and their successes became fewer. By 740, when the Umayyads assembled the largest invasion force fielded after 718, the Byzantines had recovered enough to inflict a heavy defeat against them at the Battle of Akroinon.|$|E

5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of the palate near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends {{along the length of}} the palate. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> as in Holochilus and Lundomys. The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|Kumara Vyasa wrote Gadugina Bharata in 1430 in the Vyasa tradition. The {{title of}} the work is a {{reference}} to Gadagu (modern Gadag), where the author lived. The writing is based on the first ten chapters of the Hindu epic Mahabharata and is also alternatively titled Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari or Kumaravyasa Bharata. It is a dedication to the deity of Gadag and emphasises the divinity and grace of the Hindu god Krishna. Unlike Pampa, who adhered to a strictly Jain interpretation of the epic in his Vikramarjuna Vijaya (941), eulogising Pandava Arjuna as the hero, making Draupadi solely Arjuna's wife and casting the Kaurava prince Duryodhana and his loyal companion Karna as lofty individuals, Kumara Vyasa portrays all characters with the exception of Krishna <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> human with foibles. His depiction of the secondary characters, such as the cunning Keechaka and the coward Uttara Kumara, is also noteworthy. An interesting aspect {{of the work is}} the sense of humour exhibited by the poet and his hero, Krishna. This work marks the transition in Kannada literature from old to modern. Particularly known for his use of sophisticated metaphors, Kumara Vyasa earned the title Rupaka Samrajya Chakravarti ("Emperor of the land of Metaphors"). The remaining chapters of the epic were translated by Timmanna Kavi (1510) of the court of King Krishnadevaraya. The poet named his work Krishnaraya Bharata after his patron king. Airavata (1430) by Kumara Vyasa recounts an episode from the Mahabharata and is a story of the elephant ridden by god Indra.|$|E

25|$|Max Weber {{and some}} schools of {{modernization}} theory suggest that cultural values could affect economic success. However, researchers have gathered evidence {{that suggest that}} values are not <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement {{into and out of}} poverty, as opposed to shifts in values. Studies have shown that poverty changes the personalities of children who live in it. The Great Smoky Mountains Study was a ten-year study that was unexpectedly able to demonstrate this. During the study, about one-quarter of the families saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in income. The study showed that among these children, instances of behavioral and emotional disorders decreased, and conscientiousness and agreeableness increased.|$|E
25|$|Many extant lung-breathing marine {{vertebrates}} {{are capable}} of deep diving. There are some indications about the diving capacity of ichthyosaurs. Quickly ascending from a greater depth can cause decompression sickness. The resulting bone necrosis {{has been well documented}} with Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs, where it is present in 15% and 18% of specimens respectively, but is rare in Triassic species. This could be a sign that basal forms did not dive <b>as</b> <b>deeply,</b> but might also be explained by a greater predation pressure during the later epochs, more often necessitating a fast flight to the surface. However, this last possibility is contradicted by the fact that, with modern animals, damage is not caused by a limited number of rapid ascension incidents, but by a gradual accumulation of non-invalidating degeneration during normal diving behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Leibniz's first {{position}} {{was as a}} salaried secretary to an alchemical society in Nuremberg. He knew fairly little about the subject at that time but presented himself <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> learned. He soon met Johann Christian von Boyneburg (1622–1672), the dismissed chief minister of the Elector of Mainz, Johann Philipp von Schönborn. Von Boyneburg hired Leibniz as an assistant, and shortly thereafter reconciled with the Elector and introduced Leibniz to him. Leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the Elector {{in the hope of}} obtaining employment. The stratagem worked; the Elector asked Leibniz to assist with the redrafting of the legal code for the Electorate. In 1669, Leibniz was appointed assessor in the Court of Appeal. Although von Boyneburg died late in 1672, Leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674.|$|E
25|$|Yet this strange-ness {{also has}} a more {{negative}} side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled and ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is constantly threatening. Bauman's most famous book, Modernity and the Holocaust, {{is an attempt to}} give a full account of the dangers of these kinds of fears. Drawing upon Hannah Arendt and Theodor Adorno's books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman argues that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he says, the Holocaust should be seen <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorization of different species, and the tendency to view rule-following as morally good all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass.|$|E
25|$|McLuhan {{writes about}} robotism {{in the context}} of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of {{thinking}} about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of Blade Runner and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: “Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours.” The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.|$|E
