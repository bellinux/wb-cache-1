500|$|The {{issue of}} torture on {{the series was}} {{discussed}} by President Bill Clinton who stated {{that he does not}} feel there is a place in U.S. policy for torture, but [...] "If you're the Jack Bauer person, you'll do whatever you do <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> prepared to take the consequences." [...] Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada, [...] "thankfully", did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no jury would convict Bauer in those types of situations.|$|E
500|$|Biden became {{interested}} in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. [...] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden {{was among the first to}} call for the [...] "lift and strike" [...] policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes. [...] Both the George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement. [...] In April 1993, Biden spent a week in the Balkans and held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević. [...] Biden related that he told Milošević, [...] "I think you're a damn war criminal <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> tried as one." [...] Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel the Bush administration to arm the Bosnians, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance preferred by the Clinton administration, before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman. The engagement led to a successful NATO peacekeeping effort. [...] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his [...] "proudest moment in public life" [...] that related to foreign policy. [...] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia and Montenegro, and co-sponsored with his friend John McCain the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on President Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milosevic over Serbian actions in Kosovo. [...] In 1998, Congressional Quarterly named Biden one of [...] "Twelve Who Made a Difference" [...] for playing a lead role in several foreign policy matters, including NATO enlargement and the successful passage of bills to streamline foreign affairs agencies and punish religious persecution overseas.|$|E

'He lives {{a little}} {{distance}} from the Grange,' I replied; 'just beyond those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> glad to go home, and to see him.
