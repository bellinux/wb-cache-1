40|$|International audienceWe present new {{analytical}} {{approach to the}} problem of energy pumping in strongly non- homogeneous nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) systems with single anchor spring under condition of initial impact. Energy pumping is a passive, almost irreversible transfer of mechanical energy from the main substructure of the system to the light <b>auxiliary</b> <b>attachment.</b> The mechanism of energy pumping in the system under consideration is a resonance capture. The approach is based on application of Laplace transformation to the principal asymptotic approximation of the equations of motion in complex form and using the power expansion of the solution in terms of time. Obtained temporal dependence of the system energetic characteristics gives a tool for estimation of energy pumping efficiency. In particular, we show that the system without an anchor spring in attachment is more efficient than the system with such a spring. Numerical simulations confirm the analytical results...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we study energy pumping {{phenomena}} in two- and three-degrees-of-freedom systems of coupled linear and nonlinear oscillators. Energy pumping is a passive, almost irreversible transfer of mechanical {{energy from the}} main substructure of the system to the light <b>auxiliary</b> <b>attachment.</b> The mechanism of energy pumping in the systems under consideration is resonance capture. Different designs of systems allowing energy pumping are examined both analytically and numerically. We propose a novel methodology for analyzing the transient response via time evolution of modulating functions. The analytical description of the process in terms of complex variables {{turns out to be}} in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations. We show that necessary conditions for applications of energy pumping can actually be provided. We show {{that it is possible to}} design a type of gear box (i. e. a system of various attachments connected with the main substructure in turn) providing more efficient energy transfer from the heavy oscillator (the main system) to the light auxiliary oscillator. We also study the design of the nonlinear auxiliary subsystem comprised of two linearly coupled cubic oscillators with different parameters linearly coupled with the main system. We show that such a design can improve the technical characteristics of the energy pumping device...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Pelton {{wheel is}} the only {{hydraulic}} turbine of the impulse type in common use, is named after an American engineer Laster A Pelton, who contributed much to its development around the year 1880. Therefore this machine is known as Pelton turbine or Pelton wheel. It is an efficient machine particularly suited to high heads, many modifications is being suggested up to now the major modification was near 1903 after that no major modification is being implemented. The author in this paper with his noble and native concept tried {{to increase the efficiency}} of the turbine with the modification in the blade and with some <b>auxiliary</b> <b>attachments</b> which will lead to less wastage of the head and result in better efficiency.

50|$|A panzer corps {{consisted}} of two to three divisions and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>attachments.</b> Panzergruppen ("Panzer Groups") were commands larger than a corps, approximately {{the size of an}} army, and named after their commander (e.g. Panzergruppe Hoth). These were later recognized as Panzerarmeen ("Panzer Armies"), an army-level command of two to three corps. These higher-level organizations almost always mixed ordinary infantry units with the Panzerwaffe.|$|R
40|$|Presented herein is a {{literature}} review {{on the design}} and performance of antimotion structures/devices such as breakwaters, submerged plates, oscillating water column breakwaters, air-cushion, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>attachments,</b> and mechanical joints for mitigating the hydroelastic response of very large floating structures (VLFS) under wave action. Shapes of VLFS that could minimize the hydrodynamic response of the structure are also discussed. The analytical, numerical, and experimental methods used in studying {{the effect of these}} antimotion structures/devices toward reducing the hydroelastic responses of VLFS are also reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{air heaters}} {{are used to}} capture heat from solar radiation, {{give it to the}} working fluid and that hot fluid can be used in various applications. In the present paper {{comparison}} of the thermal performance of double pass solar air heater of different types of absorber plates has been discussed. Three different types/colours of metallic sheets have been used. The absorber plates have- metallic colour, black colour and black colour with mesh wire as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>attachments.</b> It is found that the highest heat transfer is found out to be for black coloured plate with wire mesh at all the exit wind velocity. Metallic coloured plate is able to absorb least heat...|$|R

Removing the hot shoe protector will re-enable the built-in flash. A micro-switch in the hot-shoe senses the presence of the flash.|$|R
30|$|The interrelationship {{matrices}} for {{flexible and}} mass production plans are slightly {{different from each}} other. For example, presence of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>attachments</b> in a CNC turning centre makes it more flexible. This affects the overall cost of the machine more strongly in flexible production than mass production. In flexible production plan, the correlation indices between flexibility and all other technical requirements are high due to greater impact of these requirements on flexibility. Moreover, a large volume of finished products is required in mass production and hence, {{if the number of}} tools is more in a CNC turning centre, its productivity will also be high. Therefore, there exists a stronger relationship between productivity and number of tools in mass production than flexible production. Similarly, the capacity of a CNC turning centre for mass production should be such that it can accommodate more number of tools so that several machining operations can be performed simultaneously. Hence, capacity of the machine and number of tools are more strongly related in mass production than flexible production.|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a {{versatile}} means {{to predict the}} characteristics of flow in fluid mechanics problems under {{a wide range of}} design and operating conditions. Applying the CFD in many engineering fields alleviates the problem of the usual engineering design. Recent advance in computational methods and computer technology make CFD an efficient means to study the dynamics of many physical systems. CFD simulations use three dimensional grid and the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) to investigate the flow without air core in a 6 ˝ hydrocyclone have been conducted using FLUENT. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data related to the Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) measurements of velocity. In the experimental study, a new procedure is developed to reorient the laser beams that permit one to measure two velocity components at a single point using LDA. The conclusion developed from these experiments enables one to use the LDA directly in the hydrocyclone wall without recourse to <b>auxiliary</b> <b>attachments</b> such as an enclosing box that usually used to minimize the refraction effects of laser beams which are caused by the curved solid wall of the hydrocyclone and the refractive index of the test medium...|$|R
50|$|An {{auxiliary}} {{hydraulic system}} delivers pressurized hydraulic fluid from a hydraulic pump to operate <b>auxiliary</b> equipment or <b>attachments.</b> The addition of an auxiliary hydraulic system to heavy construction equipment increases the versatility {{of the vehicle}} by allowing it to perform additional functions with different attachments.|$|R
50|$|An <b>Auxiliary</b> Lifting <b>Attachment</b> (ALA) - a davit with a {{winch rope}} roller - fitted {{to the inside}} of the {{earthmoving}} bucket was used for lifting loads of up to 4tonnes. Loads such as Medium Girder Bridge pallets could be lifted vertically to a height of 1.8m. This then allowed a cargo vehicle to back under the suspended load, the CET could not travel or turn with a suspended load on the ALA due to lateral weakness of the ALA and the proximity of the load to the earthmoving bucket. Use of the ALA was discontinued in the 1990s due to difficulties in annual testing of the safe working load, and a reduced requirement for its use.|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrocyclone}} is a {{very useful}} tool which utilizes high centrifugal forces to separate solids from liquids. Its success is primarily due to the simplicity of construction and operation, versatility in application, and relative insensitivity to changes in design. In the present study, the Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) has been deployed to measure the mean velocities in the 6 " hydrocyclone. Traditionally, a flat surface box or jacket is used to encase the hydrocyclone in an auxiliary box to minimize the refraction effects of laser beams which {{is caused by the}} curved solid wall of the hydrocyclone and the refractive index of the test medium. A new procedure is developed to reorient the laser beams that permit one to measure two velocity components at a single point. In this new procedure, the probe is tilted by 45 ° (called the transform position) to force the four laser beams of the LDA to intersect at the same point. Therefore, the tangential and axial velocities yet fully characterized and measured. The measured axial velocity profiles in the transform position were all corrected for index of refraction effects. This gives approximately the same results for this velocity in the traditional optical probe position (called the regular position). The conclusion developed from these experiments enables one to use the LDA directly in the hydrocyclone wall without recourse to <b>auxiliary</b> <b>attachments</b> such as an enclosing box. Further, the new procedure permits the determination of the turbulent intensity as the fluctuations of two velocity components can be measured at the same point. Flow visualization by droplet dye injection shows five different kinds of flow field patterns inside the hydrocyclone. The features of the flow field in the hydrocyclone, as seen in the dye tests, were confirmed by the flow patterns derived from LDA experimental data. The number of turns associated with the flow in the hydrocyclone was also determined. Prediction of flow field characteristic was also achieved by a very short study related to Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling. A 3 -D turbulence model that uses the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) was adopted to simulate the flow field patterns. RSM predicted the velocity field in the hydrocyclone very well. The predicted velocities agree well with the experimental results by LDA and flow visualization study...|$|R
50|$|During its {{development}} {{prior to the}} opening of World War II, the CSBS added several new features. A simple modification found on pre-war models was the <b>Auxiliary</b> Drift Bar <b>attachment.</b> This consisted of a single drift wire in a C-shaped clamp that could be moved along the main drift wires, and rotated in relation to them. Previously, the bomb aimer would use the main drift bar as a tool to measure wind speed, but {{it was found that the}} bomb aimers would forget to reset it to the proper angle for bombing when things got busy. These same measurements could be made with the Auxiliary Bar, leaving the main drift bar in the proper position.|$|R
5|$|In {{a process}} known as the Marian reforms, Roman consul Gaius Marius carried out a {{programme}} of reform of the Roman military. In 107BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service. The distinction between hastati, principes and triarii, which had already become blurred, was officially removed, and the legionary infantry of popular imagination was created. Legionary infantry formed a homogeneous force of heavy infantry. These legionaries were drawn from citizen stock; by this time, Roman or Latin citizenship had been regionally expanded over much of ancient Italy and Cisalpine Gaul. Lighter citizen infantry, such as the velites and equites, were replaced by non-citizen auxilia that could consist of foreign mercenaries. Due to the concentration of the citizen legions into a force of heavy infantry Rome's armies depended on <b>auxiliary</b> cavalry <b>attachments</b> for support. As a tactical necessity, legions were almost always accompanied by an equal or greater number of lighter auxiliary troops, which were drawn from the non-citizens of the Empire's territories. One known exception of legions being formed from non-citizen provinces during this period was the legion that was raised in the province of Galatia.|$|R
30|$|Treatment {{procedures}} {{as well as}} complications {{were among}} the main themes identified in Internet discussion forums visited by orthognathic patients [24]. Problems experienced with braces were also primarily posted by orthodontic patients in Twitter communication [25]. IER or refinements were rarely described by the vloggers. Nonetheless, the Invisalign process is not relied on aligners alone. It requires the standard use of <b>auxiliaries</b> like <b>attachments,</b> interarch elastics, IER, and altered aligner geometries to improve the predictability of orthodontic movement [8]. Pain and oral symptoms were most frequently reported by vloggers, while they were also highly viewed as Invisalign’s disadvantage by the audience. Notwithstanding, Invisalign tends to cause less pain compared to fixed appliances during {{the initial stages of}} treatment, relatively high levels of pain may be anticipated in the first days after insertion [26] or after tray deformation [27]. Several vloggers complained about the need to brush teeth after snacking or tooth sensitivity that made them to adjust the frequency or type of meals (“Invisalign-diet”), which may question the advantage of Invisalign that allows aligner patients “to enjoy all foods” as Align Technology argues [28]. Speech impairment was frequently noted as side effect in the video testimonials. Patients with acrylic plates experienced significantly more pronounced speech difficulties than others with fixed appliances [29] and vacuum-formed retainers [30]. Plenty of viewers appeared to confuse Invisalign aligners with retainers, which might indicate a possible gap in providing sufficient information by specialists during consultation [24]. It is the anonymity of social media that allows patients to communicate topics that they felt uncomfortable to discuss in person or self-perceived inappropriate to ask directly to health care professionals [31].|$|R
