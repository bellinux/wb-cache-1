5000|$|HMS Campania {{served with}} the <b>Admiralty</b> <b>right</b> up until 5 November 1918 - just six days before the {{armistice}} was signed, when {{she was involved in}} an accident in the Firth of Forth during high winds.

40|$|This Note {{argues that}} {{maintenance}} and cure {{is a right}} inherent in general admiralty law. As such, it applies equally to unionized and non-unionized seamen, regardless of whether a bargained-for rate of maintenance and cure exists. Part I traces {{the development of the}} doctrine of maintenance and cure. Part II presents and compares the courts 2 ̆ 7 positions on the assessment of maintenance and cure. Part III proposes that maintenance and cure is an <b>admiralty</b> <b>right,</b> implicit in every seaman 2 ̆ 7 s employment, which no contractual provision can abrogate. This Note concludes that courts should decide each maintenance and cure case on an individual basis {{in order to ensure that}} the rate awarded to the seaman reflects the actual costs incurred...|$|R

50|$|The harbour of Gibraltar was {{transformed}} {{as a result}} of the British Government's plans to ensure that the Royal Navy could not just defeat any other navy, but any two other navies combined. Both Gibraltar and Malta were to be made torpedo proof, and as a result the North and South Mole were extended and the Detached Mole was constructed. Three large dry docks were constructed and plans were available by 1894. Over 2,000 men were required and they had to be billeted in old ships which had not been required since convict labour was abandoned. The demand for stone and sand necessitated building the <b>Admiralty</b> Tunnel <b>right</b> through the Rock of Gibraltar.|$|R
5000|$|Ignoring expert opinion, {{his initial}} {{investment}} was {{to buy from}} the <b>Admiralty</b> the <b>rights</b> to salvage two battlecruisers - [...] and [...] - and twenty six destroyers. The two heavy ships were both accessible from the surface; Seydlitz was often mistaken for a small island as her port flank stuck perhaps six metres out of the water, and Hindenburg was upright with her decks awash. Cox's idea was to raise the Hindenburg and use its twenty-six thousand ton hull as a floating platform from which to enable salvage of the other ships. This was ultimately to prove impractical, as several attempts to lift the Hindenburg ended in failure, due to the hulk's instability {{and the likelihood of}} its capsizing whilst being pumped out, as it was sitting on rock and not shingle as had been first supposed.|$|R

2500|$|Ever {{since the}} {{formation}} of the RAF in 1918, the Air Council had wanted to introduce a flag which would be flown at RAF stations. However, the <b>Admiralty</b> had the <b>right</b> to veto the introduction of any new flag that was to be flown within the British Empire or on a British vessel. [...] Although the Admiralty were initially opposed to granting the RAF its own flag, after considerable pressure from the Air Council, they reluctantly agreed to the introduction of such a flag, stating that the Air Force should adopt the Union Flag defaced with a suitable device. The Air Council did not welcome the Admiralty's condition, as they wished to use the White Ensign with the St George's Cross removed. [...] Whilst the War Office had no objections to this proposed design, the Admiralty certainly did, and they rejected the Air Council's suggestion on the basis that the White Ensign was exclusively reserved for Royal Navy use.|$|R
25|$|Luftwaffe {{attacks on}} {{shipping}} were made much easier by {{the capture of}} bases in France and the Low Countries, while in the North Sea, the Grimsby fishing fleet was attacked twice in June. Air attacks increased and in July, ship losses off the east coast exceeded those by naval mines. Attacks on minesweepers, escort vessels and anti-invasion patrols rapidly increased and was made worse {{by a lack of}} light anti-aircraft guns and the concentration of the air defence effort in the south-east of England, against a possible invasion. The <b>Admiralty</b> reserved the <b>right</b> for ships to fire on aircraft on an apparently attacking course, because it had been found that a high volume of prompt, accurate fire could reduce the accuracy of bombing and sometimes shoot down the attacker. Hurried training and lack of experience in aircraft recognition among navy crews led to many RAF aircraft being taken for hostile and fired on, even escorts for the ships. While demanding close escort, the Admiralty required ships to engage unidentified aircraft within , a practice the RAF considered irresponsible. More training in aircraft recognition and pilots not flying towards to ships on tracks similar to bomb runs were obvious remedies and with experience, navy gunners made fewer mistakes.|$|R
5000|$|By 1938 {{the governments}} of Ireland and the United Kingdom had been {{involved}} in a long-running Anglo-Irish Trade War that was not in the interest of either country's economy. Negotiations to settle the matters in dispute took place in 1938. One of the items the Irish side pushed for was the transfer of the Treaty Ports. The treaty was signed on 25 April 1938; the section relating to the Treaty Ports was as follows: AN AGREEMENT REGARDING ARTICLES 6 AND 7 OF THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT OF DECEMBER 6, 1921The Government of Éire and the Government of the United Kingdom have agreed as follows:1. The provisions of Articles 6 and 7 of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland signed on the 6th day of December, 1921, and of the Annex thereto shall cease to have effect.2. Thereafter the Government of the United Kingdom will transfer to the Government of Éire the <b>Admiralty</b> property and <b>rights</b> at Berehaven, and the harbour defences at Berehaven, Cobh (Queenstown) and Lough Swilly now occupied by care and maintenance parties furnished by the United Kingdom, together with buildings, magazines, emplacements, instruments and fixed armaments with ammunition therefor at present at the said ports.3. The transfer will take place not later than the 31st December, 1938. In the meantime the detailed arrangements for the transfer will be the subject of discussion between the two Governments.Done in duplicate at London, this 25th day of April, 1938.|$|R
5000|$|On the court, he {{made his}} mark in {{opinions}} on public lands, Indian questions, water <b>rights,</b> <b>admiralty,</b> jurisdiction, and corporate law, but is best remembered for his opinions defending limited government in the 1920s and 1930s. He served for over twenty-five years, and voted against the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (United States v. Butler), the National Recovery Administration (Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States), federal regulation of labor relations (National Labor Relations Board v. Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp.), the Railway Pension Act (Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad), unemployment insurance (Steward Machine Co. v. Davis), and the minimum wage (West Coast Hotel v. Parrish). For his conservatism, {{he was known as}} one of the Four Horsemen, along with Pierce Butler, James Clark McReynolds, and George Sutherland; the four would dominate the Supreme Court for over two decades. By all accounts he was anti-Semitic but was more private about his prejudices than the notorious McReynolds (for example, while McReynolds refused to interact with or speak with eventual Jewish Supreme Court Justices Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter, Van Devanter's interactions with them were non-fractious). His opinion in United States v. Sandoval (1913) is one of the more racist decisions of the Supreme Court, holding that because the New Mexico Pueblos were [...] "intellectually and morally inferior" [...] and [...] "easy victims to the evils and debasing influence of intoxicants" [...] they were subject to restrictions on alcohol sales in Indian Country. Ironically, the decision has since been the basis for Pueblo self-government and protection of tribal lands.|$|R
