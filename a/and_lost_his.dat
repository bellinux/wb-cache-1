5|$|Alfred Roberts was an {{alderman}} and a Methodist local preacher, {{and brought}} up his daughter as a strict Wesleyan Methodist attending the Finkin Street Methodist Church. He came from a Liberal family but stood (as was then customary in local government) as an Independent. He was Mayor of Grantham in 1945–46 <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> position as alderman in 1952 after the Labour Party won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian {{weightlifter}} Fabrício Mafra {{lost his}} bronze {{medal in the}} men's 105 kg competition. He tested positive for abnormal levels of testosterone, and Damian Abbiate, the competitor from Argentina, received the medal in his place. Colombian cyclist Libardo Niño Corridor, who won a silver medal in the men's individual road time trial, {{tested positive for the}} banned substance erythropoietin (EPO), and consequently the silver medal went to Matias Medici of Argentina and the bronze medal to Dominique Rollin of Canada. Nicaraguan baseball player Pedro Wilder Rayo Rojas tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid boldenone, <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> bronze medal from the men's baseball competition, but his teammates kept their medals.|$|E
5|$|Bróðir and Óspak of Man {{were two}} Danish {{brothers}} who {{were active in}} the Isle of Man and Ireland in the 11th century. They are mentioned in the 12th century Irish Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh and the 13th century Icelandic Njal's Saga as key leaders who fought on opposite sides in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. The latter account names Bróðir as the killer of Brian Boru, the High King of Ireland. Both Boru and Bróðir died in the battle, although accounts differ as to who killed whom. Óspak fought {{on the side of}} Boru, was injured, <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> two sons in the battle.|$|E

5|$|Early in the 1190s, the Georgian {{government}} began {{to interfere in}} the affairs of the Ildenizids and of the Shirvanshahs, aiding rivaling local princes and reducing Shirvan to a tributary state. The Ildenizid atabeg Abu Bakr attempted to stem the Georgian advance, but suffered a defeat at the hands of David Soslan at the Battle of Shamkor <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> capital to a Georgian protégé in 1195. Although Abu Bakr was able to resume his reign a year later, the Ildenizids were only barely able to contain further Georgian forays.|$|E
5|$|Greaves scored 13 {{goals in}} 12 England under-23 internationals and scored 44 goals in 57 full England internationals between 1959 and 1967. He {{played in the}} 1962 and 1966 FIFA World Cup, but was injured in the group stage of the 1966 World Cup <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> first team place to Geoff Hurst, who kept Greaves {{out of the first}} team in the final. England won the World Cup, but Greaves was not given his medal until a change of FIFA rules in 2009.|$|E
5|$|He {{signed a}} five-year contract, which was worth nearly eight million dollars with a {{five and a}} half million dollar signing bonus, within two months of the draft. Dick Jauron, who was then the Bears' head coach, {{recognized}} Urlacher's versatility as a middle and outside linebacker, and appointed him as the team's starting strongside linebacker. However, Urlacher struggled to perform consistently in his first professional game, <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> starting position to Rosevelt Colvin. Jauron left Urlacher on the sidelines during the following week, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers shut out the Bears, 41–0.|$|E

5|$|In 1215 William {{joined the}} baronial {{rebellion}} against John, <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> naval offices, the royal forester's office for Somerset, and custody of Lydford Castle. In May 1216 the king offered William a safe conduct, which noted that William had fled overseas. The letters were witnessed by Peter des Roches. In mid-1217, he rejoined the royalist cause, {{returning to the}} side of Henry III. This action regained him some of his lost lands.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, O'Leary was {{the subject}} of several scandals, being arrested for {{smuggling}} illegal immigrants and later for irregularities in his investigations. Although he was acquitted both times, he spent a week in prison following the second arrest <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> job with the railway. Several months later, the municipal authorities in Hamilton, Ontario loaned him £70 to pay for him and his family to return to Ireland. Although his family sailed on the SS Leticia, O'Leary remained in Ontario, working with the attorney general's office.|$|E
5|$|In March 1923, Lenin {{suffered}} a third stroke <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> ability to speak; that month, he experienced partial paralysis {{on his right}} side and began exhibiting sensory aphasia. By May, {{he appeared to be}} making a slow recovery, regaining some of his mobility, speech, and writing skills. In October, he made a final visit to the Moscow Kremlin. In his final weeks, Lenin was visited by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, with the latter visiting him at his Gorki mansion on the day of his death. On 21 January 1924, Lenin fell into a coma and died later that day. His official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|In March 1989, he {{was sold}} to Hull City for £200,000 (at the time a Hull record). This move reunited him with manager Eddie Gray. Leeds spent the money they {{received}} {{from the sale of}} Swan on bringing Gordon Strachan in from Manchester United. Leeds would go on to win the league title in 1991–92 under Wilkinson, with Strachan playing a large part in the success. However Swan and Hull did not find success; Gray used Swan in defence, <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> job in the summer following a run of just one win in twelve games.|$|E
5|$|In the fallout, Bo {{was removed}} {{as the party}} chief of Chongqing <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> seat on the Politburo. Bo's {{dismissal}} exposed disunity within Communist Party ranks shortly before a major leadership transition, and some observers suspected {{that it was because}} he threatened Xi Jinping's future grip on power. He was later stripped of all his positions, lost his seat at the National People's Congress, and was eventually expelled from the party.|$|E
5|$|Northampton signed Johnson on {{a two-year}} {{contract}} in July 2010 following the successful loan spell. After signing {{for the club}} on a permanent basis, Johnson's first match was the opening game of the season, in a 3–0 loss against Torquay United. Two months later, he received a straight red card after fouling Simon Clist <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> appeal, resulting in a one-match ban, missing a 3–1 loss against Oxford United. A week after his suspension, he scored his first goal as a permanent Northampton player in a 2–0 win over Lincoln City. In his first season at Northampton (as a permanent player), he made 41 appearances and scored seven goals.|$|E
50|$|Aged 23, Steel {{was bought}} by John McGrath at Port Vale for £10,000 in March 1983. He played in every game {{for the rest of}} that season as the club were {{promoted}} from the Fourth Division in third place. Vale struggled in the Third Division in the 1983-84 season, <b>and</b> Steel <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> place in the team in December, <b>and</b> McGrath <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> job.|$|R

5|$|One of Bond's closest {{allies in}} both the novels and films is CIA {{operative}} Felix Leiter. Fleming wrote twelve novels, of which Leiter appears in six; in the second book, Live and Let Die, Leiter was attacked by a shark <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> right arm and half his left leg and his subsequent appearances were with prosthetics. For the film series the shark attack occurred in Licence to Kill, the fifteenth instalment in the series. Following Licence to Kill, Leiter did not appear until the reboot of the franchise with Casino Royale.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing fasciitis <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E
5|$|Steele was {{investigated}} by a joint FA/Football League inquiry for {{his time as}} Mansfield Town manager in regard to suspected illegal payments – found guilty, {{he was given a}} £250 fine. The good run of results continued though, as they beat fifth-placed Barnsley 1–0 at Oakwell through a Hayward goal. On Christmas Day and Boxing Day Vale recorded two 1–0 wins over Chester, with Hayward again the only player to find the net. Captain Tommy Cheadle pulled a hamstring against Chester, <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> place in the team as Steele moved the positions around to accommodate Derek Tomkinson in the team. Roland Lewis was made available on a free transfer in December, and moved to non-league side Witton Albion.|$|E

5|$|Sviatopolk {{lost the}} throne soon {{afterwards}} <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> life the following year. As Bolesław {{was involved in}} a conflict with Holy Roman Emperor Henry II, he did not intervene on behalf of his son-in-law when he was deposed and instead signed a pact with Yaroslav, who had successfully regained the throne. Although he lost control of Kiev, Bolesław succeeded in keeping the Cherven Towns captured by Vladimir the Great in 981; he was crowned King of Poland in 1025. Yaroslav outlived Bolesław and contributed greatly to the strengthening of Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|After {{the very}} warm {{practice}} sessions, qualifying on Saturday was run under difficult weather conditions. Qualifying one (Q1) {{started on a}} damp track and therefore on intermediate tyres, while by Q2 the track was almost dry and slick tyres were used. In Q1 Romain Grosjean collided with the slower running HRT of Pedro de la Rosa <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> front wing. While he succeeded in nursing the car back into the pit lane, {{he was unable to}} change his tyres and was therefore left in a disappointing 18th position on the grid. Michael Schumacher's last ever qualifying did not go well either. He took 14th position, almost half a second down on his teammate, admitting he had perhaps compromised his setup too much for an expected wet race. The McLarens were fastest all weekend and easily took the front row, with Lewis Hamilton securing his last pole position with the team. Title contenders Vettel and Alonso both struggled, taking 4th and 8th position on the grid respectively. Pastor Maldonado was handed a 10-place grid penalty for missing the weighbridge {{in the second part of}} qualifying. He dropped from sixth to 16th, moving Alonso one place up to seventh.|$|E
5|$|Debbie and Darren have a brief {{relationship}}, but it ends {{when her}} boyfriend Dan Hunter (Andrew McNair) returns from prison. He later begins {{a relationship with}} Steph, but ends it when she has an epileptic seizure, and he begins dating Zoe. Darren begins gambling, and becomes addicted. The relationship ends when Darren has sex with Zoe's best friend Jessica after he and Zoe fight over his gambling addiction. Darren steals Frankie Osborne's (Helen Pearson) jewellery to settle a debt with a loan shark, and blames Newt (Nico Mirallegro), who is sent back to care. Jack, unaware of Darren's addiction, gives him half The Dog in recognition of how much he has matured. Darren begins counselling for his gambling addiction, but later plays poker with Warren and loses his half of The Dog to him. Jack and Frankie discover that Darren has stolen Frankie's jewellery <b>and</b> <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> half of The Dog. Jack then has a heart attack which Darren blames himself for.|$|E
