40|$|Abstract- This paper {{deals with}} a few major {{application}} of <b>AC</b> motors and <b>drives</b> with special controls in steel plants. Application of <b>AC</b> <b>drives</b> for electrically operated overhead crane have been discussed in details. Application of <b>AC</b> <b>drives</b> has reduced the maintenance expenses and {{a large amount of}} power is saved. AC power is also used for high frequency welding and other special applications. Large numbers of high power AC motors are used in steel industries which require control of speed to suit the process requirement. In a steel plant, power electronics {{plays an important role in}} process improvement and dimensional control of rolled products. Proper selection of drives not only saves electrical energy but also produce quality products. Advancements in the field of drives and control techniques are responsible for improvements in the quality and yield of steel products...|$|R

40|$|AC motors {{have been}} used {{in a wide range of}} power ratings to date and are playing a {{prominent}} role in drive applications. However, their highly non-linear dynamic structure with strong dynamic interactions requires more complex control schemes than dc motors. [...] The conventional linear techniques can no longer satisfy the stringent requirement placed on high-performance <b>ac</b> motor <b>drive</b> applications. Modern control techniques, such as optimal control and adaptive control, are applied in motor drive systems. But the realization of these techniques is generally difficult because of large time-critical computation requirements. Typical field-oriented control of ac motors uses current loop sampling rates of 5 to 10 KHz. This implies that the controller must process the control algorithms within 100 to 200 μs. Thus, for high-performance <b>ac</b> <b>drives,</b> some powerful microcomputers, such as Transputers, and parallel processing techniques are used in <b>ac</b> motor <b>drive</b> systems. On the other hand, reducing the energy losses in adjustable-speed electric motor drives is becoming increasingly important due to the high cost of energy. [...] Transputer-based parallel processing of high performance <b>ac</b> motor <b>drives</b> can be a good solution for fast dynamic calculation, flexible architecture and interactive control in order to achieve both requirements of high performance and loss minimization of <b>ac</b> motor <b>drives.</b> [...] The purpose of this study is to investigate and apply multiple Transputers in parallel processing of indirect field-oriented vector control employing loss minimization for high performance <b>ac</b> motor <b>drives.</b> A new scheme is proposed based on the use of multiple Transputers for real-time parallel processing implementation of the indirect field-oriented control scheme incorporating the loss minimization strategy. Losses in <b>ac</b> motor <b>drives</b> are studied and verified by experiments. Computer simulation results of trials using five Transputers and experimental results of using four Transputers for parallel processing are presented in the thesis. It is shown that high performance as well as significant energy savings for <b>ac</b> motor <b>drives</b> can be achieved by the proposed scheme...|$|R
