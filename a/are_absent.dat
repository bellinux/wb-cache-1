5|$|Although in the English {{language}} borscht refers {{almost invariably}} to a beet-based soup, in some culinary cultures there exist soups {{with the same}} or similar names where beetroots <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> or merely optional. The principal common trait among them is a tart flavor obtained by adding various sour-tasting ingredients.|$|E
5|$|In the jawless fish (lampreys and hagfish), true lymphoid organs <b>are</b> <b>absent.</b> These fish rely on {{regions of}} lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are {{produced}} in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and {{some areas of the}} gut (where granulocytes mature.) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves show a {{preference}} for the seeds of certain species of plant over others. Foods taken in preference to others include pine nuts, sweetgum seeds, and the seeds of pokeberry, amaranth, canary grass, corn, sesame, and wheat. When their favorite foods <b>are</b> <b>absent,</b> mourning doves will eat the seeds of other plants, including buckwheat, rye, goosegrass and smartweed.|$|E

5|$|The procellariids {{are present}} in all the world's oceans {{and most of the}} seas. They <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> from the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, but are present year round or {{seasonally}} in the rest. The seas north of New Zealand are the centre of procellariid biodiversity, with the most species. Among the four groups, the fulmarine petrels have a mostly polar distribution, with most species living around Antarctica and one, the northern fulmar ranging in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The prions are restricted to the Southern Ocean, and the gadfly petrels are found mostly in the tropics with some temperate species. The shearwaters are the most widespread group and breed in most temperate and tropical seas, although by a biogeographical quirk <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> as breeders from the North Pacific.|$|E
5|$|The smooth, dextrinoid spores are in {{side view}} {{triangular}} with a spurred base, in frontal view oblong, and typically measure 5–9 by 3–4μm. Staining with Cresyl blue shows them to be somewhat metachromatic, and binucleate. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are club-shaped to cylindric or sometimes spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem), and have dimensions of 20–44 by 6.5–13.5μm. Basidia are 18–30 by 5–8μm, mostly four-spored, and <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> on the gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) <b>are</b> <b>absent.</b> The cap cuticle is a hymeniderm (lengthened cells arranged side by side) with mostly colorless elements of different lengths, measuring 16–62 by 8–18μm. The stipitipellis (outer covering of the stem) comprises a layer of colorless hyphae measuring about 2–3μm wide. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae of all parts of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E
60|$|Above all things, the {{tradesman}} {{should take}} care not to <b>be</b> <b>absent</b> in the season of business, as I have mentioned above; for the warehouse-keeper to <b>be</b> <b>absent</b> from 'Change, which is his market, or from his warehouse, at the times when the merchants generally go about to buy, he had better <b>be</b> <b>absent</b> {{all the rest of the}} day.|$|R

5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} vertebrae, <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal end of the humerus.|$|E
5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> from their definitions. In the example above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{introduced to}} {{areas such as}} Australia or North America, where {{other members of the}} genus <b>are</b> <b>absent,</b> may affect native species through competition for nest holes. In North America, chickadees, nuthatches, woodpeckers, purple martins and other swallows may be affected. In Australia, competitors for nesting sites include the crimson and eastern rosellas. For its role in the decline of local native species and the damages to agriculture, the common starling has been included in the IUCN List of the world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E

5|$|Cortinarius iodes {{produces}} a rusty-brown spore print. Spores are elliptical, with a finely roughened surface, measuring 8–10 by 5–6.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 28–39.5 by 9.3–14μm. Both cheliocystidia and pleurocystidia <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> from the hymenium; the gill edge is populated by basidia and their undeveloped equivalents, basidioles. The cap cuticle comprises a distinctive layer of 3–8μm-wide hyphae that form a layer usually 110–125μm thick; this layer is less distinct or thinner in old or poorly preserved specimens. Clamp connections {{are present in}} hyphae throughout the fruit body.|$|E
5|$|Distribution of mecopterans is worldwide; the {{greatest}} diversity at the species level {{is in the}} Afrotropic and Palearctic realms, but there is greater diversity at the generic and family level in the Neotropic, Nearctic and Australasian realms. They <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> from Madagascar and many islands and island groups; this may demonstrate that their dispersal ability is low, with Trinidad, Taiwan and Japan, where they are found, having had recent land bridges to the nearest continental land masses.|$|E
5|$|Exit numbers <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> {{along the}} Creek Turnpike until the 51st Street South interchange, which is {{numbered}} as exit 28. Exit numbers are posted north of this interchange, continuing until the highway's terminus (exits 33A–B).

5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} {{yellow-brown}} spore print. Spores are egg-shaped to ellipsoid, smooth, thin-walled, and measure 8.4–10.5 by 4.2–4.9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–35 by 7–9µm. Cystidia are present {{on both the}} tube walls (as pleurocystidia) and abundantly on the edges (as cheilocystidia). They are somewhat spindle-shaped, sometimes with a central swelling, and measure 45–70 by 7–12μm. Clamp connections <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> from the hyphae, {{and all of the}} hyphae are inamyloid.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous investment in {{a large number of}} sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources <b>are</b> <b>absent,</b> this principle doesn't fit.|$|E
5|$|Leicestershire and Rutland are {{landlocked}} lowland {{counties and}} most of the birds are typical of English farmland habitat. Many coastal, oceanic and highland birds <b>are</b> <b>absent</b> or rare, and there are few rare vagrants compared to coastal areas. The construction of two large reservoirs, Eyebrook Reservoir in 1940 and Rutland Water (England's largest reservoir) in 1976, has provided freshwater environments enabling many aquatic birds to thrive.|$|E
