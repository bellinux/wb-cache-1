40|$|PURPOSES: The intents of {{the study}} are to {{identify}} the accident factors and to demonstrate the potentials of tobit model {{as a tool to}} study the number of accidents on <b>arterial</b> <b>roads</b> segments. METHODS: This paper uses a tobit regression as a methodology to analyze the factors affecting the number of accidents. In pursuing the above goal, this study gives particular attentions to analyzing the data of 2, 446 accidents (1, 610 in major <b>arterial</b> <b>roads</b> and 836 in minor <b>arterial</b> <b>roads)</b> occurred on <b>arterial</b> <b>roads</b> in 2007 to 2010. RESULTS: First, 3 accident models which were classified by total <b>arterial</b> <b>roads,</b> major <b>arterial</b> <b>roads</b> and minor <b>arterial</b> <b>roads,</b> and were all statistically significant were developed. Second, the exclusive right-turn lane as common variable, and the number of accident, traffic volume, number of lanes, link length, rate of median, number of entrances, number of pedestrian crossings, number of curves, number of bus stops and exclusive left-turn as specific variables of the models were selected. Finally, the paired sample t-test could not be rejected the null hypotheses of three types of models.

5|$|After a brief postwar increase, Troy's {{population}} began {{a continuing}} decline. The city began {{the first of}} several urban renewal plans shortly after adopting its 1962 master plan.

South of this intersection, traffic is reduced further to 350 until the hamlet of Minerva, rising to 751 south of Minerva until near the Warren county line.

A second contract then extended those two lanes north to Aurora Sideroad. These two projects both began {{in the summer of}} 2001 and were completed in December.

The Road Board was formed in 1910 to address traffic issues, which led to the London <b>Arterial</b> <b>Road</b> Conferences in 1913–14 that revived the earlier plans. Progress was halted because of the war, but resumed in 1920, when it was hoped it would find work for demobilised soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the site}} of Noel Park was {{virtually}} uninhabited. The 1619 Earl of Dorset's Survey of Tottenham shows the area as forming the historic Duckett's (Dovecote) Manor; as {{with the rest of}} the Moselle valley, the land consisted almost entirely of woodland and pasture, with the only building shown in the area which was to become Noel Park being Dovecote House itself, dating from 1254 and the earliest recorded property in Wood Green. The small village of Wood Green itself is shown a short distance to the north-east. The manor itself was situated on the ancient <b>arterial</b> <b>road</b> of Green Lanes. The last recorded occupancy of the manor was in 1881, shortly before the site was cleared for the construction of Noel Park.|$|E
5|$|A known {{historical}} {{resident of}} Zaprešić was Count Josip Jelačić of Bužim (1801–59), the Ban of Croatia from 1848 until his death. Although born in Novi Sad, Serbia (then Habsburg Monarchy), {{he received an}} estate in Zaprešić together with his title. He is responsible for abolishing serfdom in Croatia in 1848, but also for an infamous suppression of Croatian intelligentsia, and the Illyrian movement during his reign under the orders of Baron Alexander von Bach, and Emperor Franz Joseph I. A statue of Jelačić riding a horse was constructed by Anton Dominik Fernkorn, and placed on the Zagreb's central square, Ban Jelačić Square. The statue has been repeatedly removed, and reinstated during changes in political power and orientation in Croatia, from monarchist, through ultra-nationalist, and communist, up to democratic. After the Croatian declaration of independence, marking {{the start of the}} democratic era, the statue was returned to the square, and Zaprešić credits Jelačić with a major <b>arterial</b> <b>road</b> named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|From here to Finch Avenue, {{the freeway}} follows the {{boundary}} line between Toronto and Mississauga. It encounters the third multi-level junction along its length, with Highway409, which {{provides access to}} the airport {{as well as the}} southbound to eastbound movement that cannot be performed at the interchange with Highway401 to the south. Highway427 continues straight north and narrows again to six lanes. After crossing the Kitchener GO line, it passes west of Woodbine Racetrack and beneath Rexdale Boulevard, Morning Star Drive, and Finch Avenue West, the first and last interchange with the route. The freeway bends slightly eastward, diverging from the Mississauga–Toronto boundary, and crosses the West Humber River where it drains from Claireville Reservoir. Approaching the fourth and final sprawling interchange, it crosses Steeles Avenue and enters Vaughan. It passes beneath Highway407 and crosses through an undeveloped area before terminating at its final interchange with Highway7. The mainline continues north as a four lane <b>arterial</b> <b>road</b> to Zenway Boulevard and is designated as York Regional Road99.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries manorial homes, {{including}} Cranham Hall, became attractive {{properties for}} merchants from the City of London. Initial attempts {{to expand the}} suburban estates from Upminster in the early 20th century ran into problems {{because of the lack}} of water supply. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. In the 1930s land was used to develop some council housing and following the sale of the Benyon estate the pace of new building quickened. Cranham's location on the very edge of London's urban sprawl is explained by the halting effect on suburban house building of the introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt and World War II. Thereafter building took place within the area bounded by the Southend <b>Arterial</b> <b>Road</b> in the north and St Mary's Lane in the south; and there were 615 council houses built by 1971.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Federal {{government}} {{agreed to}} apply the Monaro Highway name to Cooma-Canberra road within the ACT. This gave the roadway a single name between Canberra and the Victorian border. Originally, the highway ended where it met Jerrabomberra Avenue. Plans were publicised during the mid-1980s for an upgrade of the existing Monaro Highway to dual-carriageway standard between Isabella Drive and Jerrabomberra Avenue, and {{an extension of the}} roadway to the north. These works were known as the Eastern Parkway. These plans were then given the go ahead in a report tabled on 5 May 1987, the estimated costs were $50 million including upgrades to other nearby roadways. Around the same time period a large service centre was proposed for near the Isabella Drive intersection, though it was quite controversial, and the developer pulled out. Between 1988 and November 1989 the duplication was completed, and the roadway extended as far as Canberra Avenue. After this the road was extended to its current terminus at Morshead Drive, although the northbound carriageway was originally routed over Dairy Flat Road until a southbound carriageway was constructed later on. Further duplication was performed to other sections of the extension until all sections were completed in mid-2012. The northern end of the Monaro Highway will connect to {{the southern end of the}} Majura Parkway following its expected completion in 2016. Territory and Municipal Services has classified the Monaro Highway as an <b>arterial</b> <b>road</b> within the ACT Road Hierarchy.|$|E
