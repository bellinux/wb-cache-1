5|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Jean-Pierre Lafitte {{defeated}} Bob Holly {{in a standard}} dark match. In the weeks preceding the event, the WWF ran a competition to win a house in Orlando, Florida. Todd Pettengill and Stephanie Wiand showed footage {{of the home and}} later hand-picked one of the entries. They phoned Matt Pomposelli of Henderson, Nevada and told him that he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> won the vacant home. The home was officially presented to Pomposelli on the May 22 episode of Raw.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Katrina 50 {{families}} that were members of Beth Israel left New Orleans, and gave up membership in the congregation. These included Rabbi Schiff and his family. After the flood Beth Israel's board of directors informed Schiff, who had joined they synagogue in April 2002, {{that it would not}} be able to meet its contractual obligations and pay him past December. Schiff <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> also lost their home and much of their possessions, and had been living in Memphis. Schiff resigned effective November 1, 2005, citing this loss, and the lack of a functioning Jewish Day School in the area for his children.|$|E

5|$|The role of Mahmud {{was filled}} when Balink {{was out with}} coffee with Joshua and Othniel Wong and saw a young man, tall, strong, and handsome– as he {{expected}} for the role– driving by. Balink called the Wongs and they got into their car, then chased and caught the young man. The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title Raden for the film, which he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> already abandoned. According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, the emphasis on Mochtar's title was meant {{as a way to}} draw a higher-class audience.|$|E
5|$|His {{greatest}} {{and most}} famous wartime contribution was the Seventh Symphony. The composer {{wrote the first}} three movements in Leningrad and completed the work in Kuibyshev (now Samara) where he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been evacuated. It remains unclear whether Shostakovich really conceived {{the idea of the}} symphony with the siege of Leningrad in mind, it was officially claimed as a representation of the people of Leningrad’s brave resistance to the German invaders and an authentic piece of patriotic art at a time when morale needed boosting. The symphony was first premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra in Kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in London and the United States. The most compelling performance was the Leningrad premiere by the Radio Orchestra in the besieged city. The orchestra had only fourteen musicians left, so the conductor Karl Eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play a musical instrument to perform the symphony.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects {{with an interest in}} Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford a mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E

5|$|Many Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) {{officers}} {{were members of}} other anti-communist nationalist groups that were opposed to Diệm, such as the Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam) and the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (VNQDĐ, Vietnamese Nationalist Party), which were both established before World War II. The VNQDĐ had run a military academy in Yunnan near the Chinese border {{with the assistance of}} their nationalist Chinese counterparts, the Kuomintang. Diệm <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> crushed all alternative anti-communist nationalists, and his politicisation of the army had alienated the servicemen. Officers were promoted on the basis of political allegiance rather than competence, meaning that many VNQDĐ and Đại Việt trained {{officers were}} denied such promotions. They felt that politically minded officers, who joined Diệm's secret Catholic-dominated Cần Lao Party, which was used to control South Vietnamese society, were rewarded with promotion rather than those most capable.|$|E
5|$|Niels Bohr {{and his son}} Aage, a {{physicist}} who acted as his father's assistant, arrived on 30 December {{on the first of}} several visits as a consultant. Bohr <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> escaped from occupied Denmark to Sweden. A De Havilland Mosquito bomber brought him to England where he joined Tube Alloys. In America, he was able to visit Oak Ridge and Los Alamos, where he found many of his former students. Bohr acted as a critic, a facilitator and a role model for younger scientists. He arrived at a critical time, and several nuclear fission studies and experiments were conducted at his instigation. He {{played an important role in}} the development of the uranium tamper, and in the design and adoption of the modulated neutron initiator. His presence boosted morale, and helped improve the administration of the laboratory to strengthen ties with the Army.|$|E
5|$|The Boys from Baghdad High {{received}} its world première at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, an annual film festival for documentary productions held in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. In the US it was screened on 29 April 2008 at the Tribeca Film Festival, and 1 August 2008 at the Traverse City Film Festival. The first time Winter and O'Mahoney met {{one of the}} film's subjects was at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, nearly {{a year after the}} filming had completed. Ali <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> relocated to the US since completing the documentary, and so he was able to attend the screening. Winter and Ali met a second time at the Traverse City Film Festival. The producers had tried to get the boys visas to enter the UK for a screening in London, but they were denied entry by the British Government.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} three members, Staples, guitarist Neil Fraser, and multi-instrumentalist David Boulter, felt reinvigorated by the concert and were keen {{to continue as}} Tindersticks. In 2006 Staples <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> relocated to Limousin in France, and {{during the first half}} of 2007 the band built their own studio, Le Chien Chanceaux, in a barn in his garden. Most of the recording for The Hungry Saw, the first new Tindersticks material in five years, took place over an eight-day period in June 2007 in the new studio. Dan McKinna and Thomas Belhom, who later became full-time members of the group, were recruited to play bass and drums respectively, and long-time collaborators Ian Caple, Terry Edwards, Lucy Wilkins and Calina de la Mare helped with the recording and the arrangements. Following further recording sessions at Eastcote Studios and Olympic Studios in London, the album was produced and mixed at Le Chien Chanceaux by Stuart Staples.|$|E
5|$|When his nephew, Arnold, died without issue, Salentin von Isenburg-Grenzau (1532–1610) {{resigned}} {{from the office of}} Elector (September 1577) and, in December, married Antonia Wilhelmine d'Arenburg, sister of Charles d'Ligne, Prince of Arenberg. Salentin's resignation required the election of a new archbishop and prince-elector from among the Cathedral Chapter. Two candidates emerged. Gebhard (1547–1601) was the second son of William, Truchsess of Waldburg, known as William the younger, and Johanna von Fürstenberg. He was descended from the Jacobin line of the House of Waldburg; his uncle was a cardinal, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> significant imperial contacts. The second candidate, Ernst of Bavaria (1554–1612), was the third son of Albert V, Duke of Bavaria. As a member of the powerful House of Wittelsbach, Ernst could marshal support from his extensive family connections throughout the Catholic houses of the empire; he also had contacts in important canonic establishments at Salzburg, Trier, Würzburg, and Münster that could exert collateral pressure.|$|E
