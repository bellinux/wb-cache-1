5|$|After {{the major}} {{collapse}} approximately 5,000years <b>ago,</b> subsequent eruptions of lava and tephra built up the modern summit cone until about {{as recently as}} 1,000years <b>ago.</b> As many as 11 Holocene tephra layers have been found.|$|E
5|$|Although the cheetah is an African cat, {{molecular}} {{evidence indicates}} that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three million years <b>ago,</b> where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene. They possibly diverged from this ancestor 8.25 million years <b>ago.</b> The cheetah diverged from the puma and the jaguarundi around 6.7 million years <b>ago.</b> A genome study concluded that cheetahs experienced two genetic bottlenecks in their history, the first about 100,000 years <b>ago</b> and the second about 12,000 years <b>ago,</b> greatly lowering their genetic variability. These bottlenecks may {{have been associated with}} migrations across Asia and into Africa (with the current African population founded about 12,000 years <b>ago),</b> and/or with a depletion of prey species {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene.|$|E

5|$|Based on genome sequencing, the Tapanuli {{orangutan}} {{separated from}} other orangutans about 700,000 years <b>ago,</b> {{and the two}} other species diverged about 400,000 years <b>ago.</b> The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which also included several other species, such as the three extinct species of the genus Gigantopithecus, including the largest known primate Gigantopithecus blacki. The ancestors of the Ponginae subfamily split from the main ape line in Africa 16 to 19 million years <b>ago</b> (mya) and spread into Asia.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{has been}} active for over half a million years, with the oldest {{activity}} between 1,000,000 and 750,000 years <b>ago</b> forming lava domes. Older estimates indicate that activity did not start before 250,000 years <b>ago,</b> while more recent research indicated a start of volcanism over 600,000 years <b>ago.</b> Volcanism at Ciomadul consisted mostly of the extrusion of lava domes, their collapse forming block-and-ash flows and subplinian and Vulcanian eruptions.|$|E
25|$|At its inception, <b>Agos</b> {{started with}} a {{circulation}} of 2,000, {{and at the time}} of Hrant Dink's death had reached a circulation of around 6,000.

25|$|Dink had {{not been}} a {{professional}} journalist until founding <b>Agos.</b> Up to that point, he had contributed occasional articles and book reviews to local Armenian language newspapers and corrections and letters to the editor to the national dailies.

5|$|Continents formed, {{then broke}} up and {{reformed}} as {{the surface of}} Earth reshaped over {{hundreds of millions of}} years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750million years <b>ago,</b> the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540million years <b>ago,</b> then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180million years <b>ago.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eruptions {{along the}} narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera 400,000 to 60,000 years <b>ago.</b> Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years <b>ago</b> created the Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years <b>ago</b> formed the Inyo Craters. Lava flows 5,000 years <b>ago</b> built the Red Cones, and {{explosion}} pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. Uplift of Paoha Island in Mono Lake about 250 years <b>ago</b> is the most recent activity. These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single, large magma chamber {{like the one that}} produced the massive Long Valley Caldera eruption 760,000 years <b>ago.</b> During the past 3,000 years, eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years. In 1980, a series of earthquakes and uplift within and south of Long Valley Caldera indicated renewed activity in the area.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{springbok}} {{are known}} from the Pliocene; the antelope appears to have evolved about three million years <b>ago</b> from a gazelle-like ancestor. Three fossil species of Antidorcas have been identified, {{in addition to the}} extant form, and appear to have been widespread across Africa. Two of these, A. bondi and A. australis, became extinct around 7,000 years <b>ago</b> (early Holocene). The third species, A. recki, probably gave rise to the extant form A. marsupialis during the Pleistocene, about 100,000 years <b>ago.</b> Fossils have been reported from Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene sites in northern, southern, and eastern Africa. Fossils dating back to 80 and 100 thousand years <b>ago</b> have been excavated at Herolds Bay Cave (Western Cape Province, South Africa) and Florisbad (Free State), respectively.|$|E
5|$|Four super {{radiations}} {{of insects}} have occurred: beetles (evolved about 300 million years <b>ago),</b> flies (evolved about 250 million years <b>ago),</b> and moths and wasps (evolved about 150 million years <b>ago).</b> These four groups {{account for the}} majority of described species.

5|$|Free {{oxygen gas}} was almost nonexistent in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years <b>ago.</b> Free oxygen {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years <b>ago).</b> For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations.
