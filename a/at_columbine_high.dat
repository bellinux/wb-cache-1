Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' {{basement}} to plot {{a series of}} bombings that will precede their planned shooting.

Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow.

Violence, or the threat of violence, has a direct impact on the quality of education provided and on the way teachers and students work together in the classroom (Winett, 1998). Well-disciplined, effective schools are not a product of chance; it takes administrators, teachers, students, and parents working together to provide an environment conducive to learning (Marzano & Pickering, 2002). Developments in recent years indicate {{there is a need to}} change the way discipline is addressed. It is no longer enough to preserve the past’s narrow perception of the role of discipline. School administrators are just beginning to learn and understand that discipline includes much more than handing down punishment. This qualitative study focused on perceptions of administrators, teachers and parents in terms of effective discipline practices. Schools are discovering that the mos...|$|R

This was the lowest number of such deaths since the 2002-03 school year, the highest being the 2006-07 school year, in which there were 66 deaths from school violence. Suggesting that Columbine was a catalyst for attention to school shootings, the article's author wrote that heightened awareness of the problem may be responsible for the decline.|$|R

2500|$|In 1999, {{a school}} {{shooting}} <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School in Littleton, Colorado created a public backlash against local goths and especially gothic youths as some {{teachers and parents}} suddenly began to view goth fashion with suspicion and mistrust. Violence of any kind had always been very rare at Toronto goth clubs, and notable figures in the goth community spoke to the media against associating violence with [...] "goth". They insisted that the shooters were not goths, did not listen to goth music, and that goths were non-violent and pacifistic. Certain elements of the media, notably the local entertainment and culture media, also defended goths. Eye Weekly columnist Donna Lypchuk wrote, [...] "I've been laughing {{for the past two}} weeks as talking heads blame the goth subculture for the killings in Colorado. The mainstream goth movement, which has been around for at least 25 years, is not secret enough to be a subversive society." [...] Five months later a report from authorities in Colorado confirmed that the shooting was not related to goth subculture, and stated that the shooters held goth music in [...] "contempt".|$|E

Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a [...] "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible".

As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked {{at it from the}} fuckin' {{point of view of the}} kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad." [...] The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song [...] "Rap God" [...] from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line [...] "It doesn't matter [...] faggot" [...] was also censored from [...] "Marshall Mathers", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson's lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.|$|E
