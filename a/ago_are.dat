5|$|The {{discovery}} of Vegavis, a late Cretaceous {{member of the}} Anatidae, proved that the diversification of modern birds started before the Cenozoic.

5|$|The oldest {{rocks are}} of Silurian age (443–419 million years ago). They {{make up a}} {{sequence}} of lavas, tuffs (volcanic ash), shales and mudstones in a narrow outcrop to the northeast of Shepton Mallet in the eastern Mendip Hills. Rocks from the Devonian (419–359 million years <b>ago)</b> <b>are</b> found across much of Exmoor, the Quantocks, and in the cores of the folded masses that form the Mendip Hills.|$|E

5|$|Although its {{evolutionary}} history—what the forerunner to {{the species}} {{was and how}} the close relatives branched off—is not well understood, the painted turtle is common in the fossil record. The oldest samples, found in Nebraska, date to about 15million years ago. Fossils from 15million to about 5million years <b>ago</b> <b>are</b> restricted to the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed. Fossils newer than 300,000years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} fossils {{dating back}} some {{two and a}} half million years <b>ago</b> <b>are</b> common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the Cradle of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa they are plentiful at such sites as Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and dated back about eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Devonian (400 million years <b>ago)</b> <b>are</b> all wingless, {{but by the}} Carboniferous (320 million years ago), more than 10 {{different}} genera of insects had fully functional wings. There is little preservation of transitional forms between the two periods. The earliest winged insects are from this time period (Pterygota), including the Blattoptera, Caloneurodea, primitive stem-group Ephemeropterans, Orthoptera and Palaeodictyopteroidea. Very early Blattopterans (during the Carboniferous) had a very large discoid pronotum and coriaceous forewings with a distinct CuP vein (an unbranched wing vein, lying near the claval fold and reaching the wing posterior margin). Even though the oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, estimated at 396–407 million years old, it possessed dicondylic mandibles, a feature associated with winged insects.|$|E

5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to codify the compositions {{in a uniform}} manner impossible. An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades <b>ago</b> <b>are</b> now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.|$|E
5|$|Now often also {{considered}} a distinct species, Homo neanderthalensis (otherwise known as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis) {{lived in the}} southern half of Poland during the Middle Paleolithic period, that is between 300,000 and 40,000 BCE. Various relics were found and different Neanderthal cultures are distinguished. Acheulean handaxes from Silesia dated 200,000-180,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>are</b> among the older tools. Gatherer-hunter sporadic groups of Neanderthals penetrated southern Poland also during the Eemian interglacial, 128,000-115,000 BCE. Examination of the Micoquien-Prądnik culture (East Micoquien complex) sites in the Prądnik River Valley north of Kraków and in Zwoleń near Radom from about 85,000 to 70,000 BCE (early phase of the Vistula River glaciation period) shows that some Neanderthals were skilled collective hunters, able to kill numerous large mammals characteristic of the cold Pleistocene climate and process the meat, skin and bones using specialized tools.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Turkish theatre dates back {{thousands}} of years to ancient pagan rituals. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia <b>ago</b> <b>are</b> the elements from which the first shows originated. These rituals later became theatrical shows. In the 10th century, a blend of traditions occurred between the Seljuk Turks {{and those of the}} inhabitants of Anatolia. The interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays. After the Tanzimat (Reformation) period, characters in Turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on European-style stages with the actors wearing European costumes. Following the declaration of the second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected in the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, Darülbedayi-i Osmani, was established in Istanbul in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Turkish playwrights emerged. Some wrote on romantic subjects, others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. There were even those who wrote musicals. In time, Turkish ladies began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time, since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey’s ethnic minorities. Today, theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the Turkish State Theatres.|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} climate processes {{since the middle}} to late Pliocene (approximately 3 million years <b>ago)</b> <b>are</b> the glacial and interglacial cycles. The present interglacial period (the Holocene) has lasted about 11,700 years. Shaped by orbital variations, responses such as {{the rise and fall}} of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate. Other changes, including Heinrich events, Dansgaard–Oeschger events and the Younger Dryas, however, illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing.|$|E

Second event (ca. 1100 Ma <b>ago)</b> <b>is</b> the intermediate pressure granulite facies metamorphism and charnockite formation probably associated with some folding tectionics. Third event (ca. 560 Ma <b>ago</b> or earlier) <b>is</b> the high amphibolite facies metamorphism associated with E-W upright foldings. Fourth event (ca. 460 Ma <b>ago)</b> <b>is</b> the low amphibolite facies metamorphism associated with N-S upright folds and faults and pink granite intrusion, succeeded by the greenschist facies or slightly lower grade metamorphism. Fifth event (Jurassic?) is the fracturing under stress field with N-S maximum extensional axis. Some problems and alternative explanations are briefly discussed with conclusions that there remain some problems on the preferred metamorphic-tectonic history...|$|R
