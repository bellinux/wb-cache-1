The {{glass is}} taken from the furnace in large iron ladles, which are carried upon slings running on {{overhead}} rails; from the ladle the glass is thrown upon the cast-iron bed of a rolling-table; and is rolled into sheet by an iron roller, the process being similar to that employed in making plate-glass, but on a smaller scale. The sheet thus rolled is roughly trimmed while hot and soft, so as to remove those portions of glass which have been spoiled by immediate contact with the ladle, and the sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an <b>annealing</b> <b>tunnel</b> or temperature-controlled oven called a lehr, down which it is carried by a system of rollers.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of glass}} as a {{building}} material was heralded by The Crystal Palace of 1851, built by Joseph Paxton {{to house the}} Great Exhibition. Paxton's revolutionary new building inspired the public use of glass as a material for domestic and horticultural architecture. In 1832, the British Crown Glass Company (later Chance Brothers) became the first company to adopt the cylinder method to produce sheet glass with the expertise of Georges Bontemps, a famous French glassmaker. This glass was produced by blowing long cylinders of glass, which were then cut along the length and then flattened onto a cast-iron table, before being annealed. Plate glass involves the glass being ladled onto a cast-iron bed, where it is rolled into a sheet with an iron roller. The sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an <b>annealing</b> <b>tunnel</b> or temperature-controlled oven called a lehr, down which it was carried by a system of rollers. James Hartley introduced the Rolled Plate method in 1847. This allowed a ribbed finish and was often used for extensive glass roofs such as within railway stations.|$|E
40|$|Operational {{radioactive}} waste is generated during routine operation of NPP. Process waste is mainly generated by treatment {{of water from}} reactor or ancillaries including spent fuel storage pools and some decontamination operations. Typical process wastes of pressurized water reactors (PWR or WWER) are borated water concentrates, whereas typical process wastes of boiling and RBMK type reactors are water concentrates with no boron content. NPP operational wastes are classified as low and intermediate level waste (LILW). NPP operational waste must be solidified {{in order to ensure}} safe conditions of storage and disposal. Currently the most promising solidification method for this waste is the vitrification technology. Vitrification of NPP operational waste is a relative new option being developed for last years. Nevertheless there is already accumulated operational experience on vitrifying low and intermediate level waste in Russian Federation at Moscow SIA ''Radon'' vitrification plant. This plant uses the most advanced type induction high frequency melters that facilitate the melting process and significantly reduce the generation of secondary waste and henceforth the overall cost. The plant was put into operation by the end of 1999. It has three operating cold crucible melters with the overall capacity up to 75 kg/h. The vitrification technology comprises a few stages, starting with evaporation of excess water from liquid {{radioactive waste}}, followed by batch preparation, glass melting, and ending with vitrified waste blocks and some relative small amounts of secondary waste. First of all since the original waste contain as main component water, this water is removed from waste through evaporation. Then the remaining salt concentrate is mixed with necessary technological additives, thus a glass-forming batch is formed. The batch is fed into melters where the glass melting occurs. From here there are two streams: one is the glass melt containing the most part of radioactivity and second is the off gas flow, which contains off gaseous and aerosol airborne. The melt glass is fed into containers, which are slowly cooled in an <b>annealing</b> <b>tunnel</b> furnace to avoid accumulation of mechanical stresses in the glass. Containers with glass are the final processing product containing the overwhelming part of waste contaminants. The second stream from melter is directed to gas purification system, which is a rather complex system taking into account the necessity to remove from off gas not only radionuclides but also the chemical contaminants. Operation of this purification system leads to generation of a small amount of secondary waste. This waste stream slightly contaminated with volatilized radionuclides is recycled in the same technological scheme. As a result only non-radioactive materials are produced. They are either discharged into environment or reused. Based on the experience gained during operation of vitrification plant one can conclude on high efficiency achieved through vitrification method. Another significant argument on vitrifying NPP operational waste is the minimal impact of vitrified radioactive waste onto environment. Solidified waste shall be disposed of into a near surface disposal facility. Waste forms disposed of in a near-surface wet repository eventually come into contact with groundwater. Engineered structures used or designed to prevent or postpone such contact and the subsequent radionuclide release are complex and often too expensive. Vitrification technologies provide waste forms with excellent resistance to corrosion and gave the basic possibility of maximal simplification of engineered barrier systems. The most simple disposal option is to locate the vitrified waste form packages directly into earthen trenches provided the host rock has the necessary sorption and confinement properties. Such an approach will significantly make simpler the disposal facilities thus contributing both to enhancing safety and economic al efficiency...|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} <b>annealing</b> Al-AlOx-Al <b>tunnel</b> {{junctions}} {{in a vacuum}} chamber at temperature of 400 C reduces the characteristic 1 /f noise in the junctions, in some cases by an order of magnitude. Both ultra high vacuum and high vacuum fabricated samples demonstrated {{a significant reduction in}} the 1 /f noise level. Temperature dependence of the noise was studied between 4. 2 and 340 Kelvin, with a linear dependence below 100 K, but a faster increase above. The results are consistent with a model where the density of charge trapping two level-systems within the tunneling barrier is reduced by the annealing process...|$|R
40|$|An n(++) -GaAs/p(++) -AlGaAs tunnel {{junction}} with a peak current density of 10 100 Acm(- 2) is developed. This device is a {{tunnel junction}} for multijunction solar cells, grown lattice-matched on standard GaAs or Ge substrates, {{with the highest}} peak current density ever reported. The voltage drop for a current density equivalent to {{the operation of the}} multijunction solar cell up to 10 000 suns is below 5 mV. Trap-assisted tunnelling is proposed to be behind this performance, which cannot be justified by simple band-to-band tunnelling. The metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy growth conditions, which are in the limits of the transport-limited regime, and the heavy tellurium doping levels are the proposed origins of the defects enabling trap-assisted tunnelling. The hypothesis of trap-assisted tunnelling is supported by the observed annealing behaviour of the tunnel junctions, which cannot be explained in terms of dopant diffusion or passivation. For the integration of these tunnel junctions into a triple-junction solar cell, AlGaAs barrier layers are introduced to suppress the formation of parasitic junctions, but this is found to significantly degrade the performance of the tunnel junctions. However, the <b>annealed</b> <b>tunnel</b> junctions with barrier layers still exhibit a peak current density higher than 2500 Acm(- 2) and a voltage drop at 10 000 suns of around 20 mV, which are excellent properties for tunnel junctions and mean they can serve as low-loss interconnections in multijunction solar cells working at ultra-high concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Équipe 101 : Nanomagnétisme et électronique de spinInternational audienceThe authors {{performed}} magnetotransport {{experiments to}} determine whether annealing alters the oxygen vacancy-mediated tunnelling potential landscape of the central portion of a MgO ultrathin film within sputtered CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions. Using the Irel method reveals a temperature-dependent tunnelling barrier height for a non-annealed barrier that arises from single oxygen vacancies (F centres) and is qualitatively identical to that found for its partly and fully annealed counterparts. Thus these MTJs with F centres remain of F-type upon annealing. This explicitly confirms that the large tunnel-magnetoresistance (TMR) increase upon annealing results mainly from structural modifications of MgO and CoFeB and not from vacancy pairing within the barrier. Photoluminescence spectra performed on both annealed and non-annealed thin MgO films grown on CoFeB electrodes support this conclusion. This work should promote renewed scrutiny over the precise impact of <b>annealing</b> on <b>tunnelling</b> magnetotransport across MgO...|$|R

The TMR ratio increased with increasing annealing temperature (Ta) and tRu, reaching 361 % at Ta = 425 C, whereas the TMR ratio of the MTJs with pinned layers without Ru spacers decreased at Ta over 325 C.

Variation in both Rn and Rj are subject to the junction size effect. An effect of aging history on the junction degradation after consequent annealing was discovered. Discussion and interpretation of the observed phenomena are presented in terms of structural ordering and reconstruction in the AlOx layer, driven by diffusion flows enhanced due to stress relaxation processes in the Al layer interfacing the AlOx layer...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{characteristics}} of uniformly doped silicon Esaki tunnel diodes grown by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy (= 275 C) using in situ boron and phosphorus doping. The effects of ex situ thermal annealing are presented for temperatures between 640 and 800 C. A maximum peak to valley current ratio (PVCR) of 1. 47 was obtained at the optimum annealing temperature of 680 C for 1 min. Peak and valley (excess) currents decreased more than two orders of magnitude as annealing temperatures and times were increased with rates empirically determined to have thermal activation energies of 2. 2 and 2. 4 eV respectively. The decrease in current density is attributed to widening of the tunneling barrier due to the diffusion of phosphorus and boron. A peak current density of 47 kA/cm 2 (PVCR = 13) was achieved and is the highest reported current density for a Si-based Esaki diode (grown by either epitaxy or by alloying). The temperature dependence of the current voltage characteristics of a Si Esaki diode {{in the range from}} 4. 2 to 325 K indicated that both the peak current and the excess current are dominated by quantum mechanical tunneling rather than by recombination. The temperature dependence of the peak and valley currents is due to the band gap dependence of the tunneling probability.

40|$|Non-volatile memory (NVM) {{technology}} {{is widely used}} for data storage applications and embedded systems. Flash memory {{has been the most}} popular kind of NVM owing to the high demand of portable electronic devices in the market. One way to implement NVM is by incorporating a floating gate in the device structure [ [...] . ]. Nanodot based memory devices have gained a lot of importance recently due to their potential in overcoming the limitations of conventional conductive floating gate based memory devices. The presence of nanodots in the floating gate can provide the additional advantage of discrete storage of charge and overcome the limitations of the conventional NVM devices by allowing further scaling of the tunnel oxide. Each insulated nanocrystalline dot can trap and de-trap charges based on the applied gate voltage and hence cause a shift in the threshold voltage. Distributed storage of charge prevents the device from being vulnerable to fatal leakage owing to a single leakage path, enhancing its non-volatility and retention characteristics. Since the means of charge storage is now discrete, the devices are immune to stress induced leakage current [ [...] . ]. This work proposes the study and comparison of fabrication techniques of Nickel nanodots (Ni-NDs). The project will thus contribute {{to a better understanding of}} nanostructure formation, in particular, comparing equilibrium and non-equilibrium processing environments. In order to prove the applicability of Ni-NDs for memory devices, some of the Ni-NDs structures produced will be implemented in a sandwich configuration to verify storage of electrical charges. In this sandwich configuration the Ni-NDs are in between two layers of SiO₂ which act as the control and tunnel oxide, respectively. The target size of the Ni-NDs is on the order of a few tens of nanometers. Although it is important to reduce the size of the nanodots considerably, it is equally important to integrate an adequate number of dots under the gate. The advantages that a nanostructured floating gate offers over the conventional floating gate can only be exploited if the nanodots obtained are within 10 nm [ [...] . ]. Different approaches to Ni-NDs formation are investigated, namely, using plasma-based processes and thermal <b>annealing.</b> The <b>tunnel</b> and control oxides will be deposited by plasma sputtering and/or thermal growth. Variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) will be used to measure the thickness of the Ni/SiO₂ films and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize the topography after the Ni-NDs formation. Aluminum contacts will be produced for conducting hysteresis loop measurements, followed by generation of capacitance-voltage (C-V) curves...|$|R
