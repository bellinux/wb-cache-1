5|$|The food {{industry}} {{is also a}} major consumer of amino acids, in particular, glutamic acid, which is used as <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> enhancer, and aspartame (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) as a low-calorie artificial sweetener. Similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in the human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation.|$|E

25|$|MSG {{is used in}} {{the food}} {{industry}} as <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> enhancer with an umami taste that intensifies the meaty, savory flavor of food, as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups. It was first prepared in 1908 by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda, who was trying to isolate and duplicate the savory taste of kombu, an edible seaweed used as a base for many Japanese soups. MSG as <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> enhancer balances, blends, and rounds the perception of other tastes.|$|E

25|$|Salt {{is added}} to food, either by the food {{producer}} or by the consumer, as <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> enhancer, preservative, binder, fermentation-control additive, texture-control agent and color developer. The salt consumption in the food industry is subdivided, in descending order of consumption, into other food processing, meat packers, canning, baking, dairy and grain mill products. Salt {{is added to}} promote color development in bacon, ham and other processed meat products. As a preservative, salt inhibits the growth of bacteria. Salt acts as a binder in sausages to form a binding gel made up of meat, fat, and moisture. Salt also acts as <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> enhancer and as a tenderizer.|$|E

25|$|In many dairy industries, salt {{is added}} to cheese as a color-, fermentation-, and texture-control agent. The dairy subsector {{includes}} companies that manufacture creamery butter, condensed and evaporated milk, frozen desserts, ice cream, natural and processed cheese, and specialty dairy products. In canning, salt is primarily added as <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> enhancer and preservative. It also {{is used as a}} carrier for other ingredients, dehydrating agent, enzyme inhibitor and tenderizer. In baking, salt {{is added to}} control the rate of fermentation in bread dough. It also is used to strengthen the gluten (the elastic protein-water complex in certain doughs) and as <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> enhancer, such as a topping on baked goods. The food-processing category also contains grain mill products. These products consist of milling flour and rice and manufacturing cereal breakfast food and blended or prepared flour. Salt is also used a seasoning agent, e.g. in potato chips, pretzels, cat and dog food.|$|E
25|$|Liquid coffee {{concentrates}} {{are sometimes}} used in large institutional situations where coffee {{needs to be}} produced for thousands {{of people at the}} same time. It is described as having <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> about as good as low-grade robusta coffee, and costs about 10¢ a cup to produce. The machines can process up to 500 cups an hour, or 1,000 if the water is preheated.|$|E
25|$|Wine is {{important}} in cuisine not just for its value as a beverage, but as <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> agent, primarily in stocks and braising, since its acidity lends balance to rich savory or sweet dishes. Wine sauce {{is an example of}} a culinary sauce that uses wine as a primary ingredient. Natural wines may exhibit a broad range of alcohol content, from below 9% to above 16% ABV, with most wines being in the 12.5–14.5% range. Fortified wines (usually with brandy) may contain 20% alcohol or more.|$|E

25|$|Dolphin meat is {{dense and}} such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat {{is located in a}} layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either {{horseradish}} or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of whale or horse meat (basashi). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a miso sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> very similar to beef liver.|$|E
25|$|Ralea's {{literary}} columns {{very often}} promoted modernist writers, or modernist interpretations of classical ones, {{such as when}} he used Janet's psychology to explain the genesis of works by Thomas Hardy. More famous was his reading of Proust through Henri Bergson's classification of memory. Ralea offered much praise to rationalist modernists such as Alexandru A. Philippide, and hailed Tudor Arghezi, the eclectic modernizer of poetic language, as Romania's greatest poet of the day. Ralea (and, before him, Ibrăileanu) campaigned for social realism in prose. His natural favorite was Sadoveanu, {{but he was also}} enthusiastic about modernist novels with <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> of social radicalism, including those by Sburătoruls Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu.|$|E
25|$|Tasting {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the sensory analysis (also referred to as organoleptic analysis) of wine. Employing a trained or consumer panel, oenologists may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. Difference tests are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> chemist and a trained panel.|$|E

25|$|In {{the manner}} of Greek wine, Roman wine was often flavored with herbs and spices (similar to modern vermouth and mulled wine) and was {{sometimes}} stored in resin-coated containers, giving it <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> similar to modern retsina. Romans were {{particularly interested in the}} aroma of wine and experimented with various methods of enhancing a wine's bouquet. One technique that gained some usage in southern Gaul was planting herbs such as lavender and thyme in the vineyards, believing that their flavors would pass through the ground and into the grapes. Modern-day wines from the Rhone are often characterized by using the aroma descriptors of lavender and thyme, presumably as a reflection of the grape varieties used and the terroir. Another widespread practice was the storage of amphoras in a smoke chamber called a fumarium to add smokiness to a wine's flavor.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} grains in Poland were millet (often made into kasza, {{a type of}} porridge) and wheat. Barley and oats were cultivated, but used mostly as animal feed or for brewing beer. Cabbage (especially as sauerkraut), kale, peas, broad beans, and onions were the most common vegetables. Dill and mustard were almost {{ubiquitous}} potherbs and parsley {{was used as a}} leafy green in stews, as <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> additive, and applied as a coloring agent in dishes for the upper classes. Beef, pork and poultry (primarily chicken) were the most common meats, with the occasional appearance of mutton and lamb. Game, as elsewhere, was highly prized, but in short supply and usually limited to the high nobility, as hunting licenses were controlled by land owners. Fish was a staple, but unlike Germans, Poles tended only to eat it on fast days when meat was forbidden by the church.|$|E
25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has <b>a</b> <b>flavor</b> that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|E
