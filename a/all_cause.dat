5|$|The most {{effective}} treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion.

One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending {{on the type of}} procedure performed) at 10years, and a 29% reduction in <b>all</b> <b>cause</b> mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures. Complications occur in about 17% of cases and reoperation is needed in 7% of cases. Due to its cost and risks, researchers are searching for other effective yet less invasive treatments including devices that occupy space in the stomach.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommended}} that rotavirus vaccine {{be included in}} all national immunisation programmes. The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49-92 percent and <b>all</b> <b>cause</b> diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17-55 percent. In Mexico, which in 2006 {{was among the first}} countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months, and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by 70 percent. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by rotavirus have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction of the vaccine.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{association}} between alcohol consumption and mortality from <b>all</b> <b>causes</b> and from ischaemic heart disease {{with a focus on}} differentiating between long term abstainers and more recent non-drinkers. DESIGN [...] Cohort study of changes in alcohol consumption from 1965 to 1974 and mortality from <b>all</b> <b>causes</b> and ischaemic heart disease during 1974 - 84. SETTING [...] Population based study of adult residents of Alameda County, California. SUBJECTS [...] 2225 women and 1845 men aged 35 and over in 1965. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Alcohol consumption in 1964 and 1974 and mortality from <b>all</b> <b>causes</b> and from ischaemic heart disease during 1974 - 84. RESULTS [...] There was a significantly higher risk of death from <b>all</b> <b>causes</b> and from ischaemic heart disease in women who gave up drinking between 1965 and 1974 than in women who continued to drink (relative risk 1. 72, 95 % confidence interval 1. 11 to 2. 66, and 2. 75, 1. 44 to 5. 23, for <b>all</b> <b>causes</b> and ischaemic heart disease respectively). A significant increase in risk was not seen in men who gave up drinking (1. 32, 0. 87 to 2. 01, and 0. 95, 0. 41 to 2. 20, respectively). Among men, long term abstainers compared with drinkers were at increased risk of death from <b>all</b> <b>causes</b> and from ischaemic heart disease, though the associations were not significant (1. 40, 0. 98 to 2. 00, and 1. 40, 0. 76 to 2. 58, for <b>all</b> <b>causes</b> and ischaemic heart disease respectively). CONCLUSION [...] Some of the increased risk of death from <b>all</b> <b>causes</b> and from ischaemic heart disease associated with not drinking in women seems to be accounted for by higher risks among those who gave up drinking. Men who are long term abstainers may also be at an increased risk of death. The heterogeneity of the non-drinking group should be considered when comparisons are made with drinkers...|$|R

25|$|These {{recommendations}} {{have not}} held up with further data analysis, however. Subsequent findings {{released by the}} WHI showed that <b>all</b> <b>cause</b> mortality was not dramatically different between the groups receiving conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), those receiving estrogen and progesterone, and those not on HRT at all. Specifically, the relative risk for all-cause mortality was 1.04 (confidence interval 0.88–1.22) in the CEE-alone trial and 1.00 (CI, 0.83–1.19) in the estrogen plus progesterone trial. Further, in analysis pooling data from both trials, post menopausal HRT {{was associated with a}} significant reduction in mortality (RR, 0.70; CI, 0.51–0.96) among women ages 50 to 59.
