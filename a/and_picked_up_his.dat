25|$|In 2002, {{preparing}} for his retirement from cricket, Berry was the runner for the St Kilda Football Club, {{for which he}} played at Under 19 level, a team which he passionately supports. That year he also took up boundary riding for Triple M before he graduated {{to the role of}} match-day play-by-play commentator on matches following his retirement from cricket in 2004. Berry was later released by Triple M <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> commentary career with K-Rock in Geelong.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home to finish {{the season with a}} three-game series against the Diamondbacks. John Ely was shaky in the opener, as the Dodgers lost 7–5. The loss assured the Dodgers of their first losing record since 2005. In the following game, Chad Billingsley took a no-hitter into the sixth <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first win since September 3 in the Dodgers 3–2 victory. The Dodgers ended their season with a 3–1 victory in the finale. Matt Kemp became the first Dodger to homer in five straight games since Shawn Green in 2001. Hong-Chih Kuo pitched a scoreless ninth for the save, also breaking Éric Gagné's single-season Dodger ERA record in the process. The game was the final appearance for backup catcher Brad Ausmus and Manager Joe Torre, both retiring after the game.|$|E
500|$|Johnny Fry is {{credited}} in some sources as the rider. Nonetheless, the first westbound rider carried the pouch across the Missouri River ferry to Elwood, Kansas. The first horse-ridden {{leg of the}} Express was only about [...] from the Express stables/railroad area to the Missouri River ferry {{at the foot of}} Jules Street. Reports indicated that horse and rider crossed the river. In later rides, the courier crossed the river without a horse <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> mount at a stable on the other side.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. {{force of}} 600-750 militia men {{had picked up}} Black Hawk's trail {{following}} the Battle of Pecatonica. Colonel Henry Dodge and James D. Henry pursued the band up the Rock River, engaging in minor skirmishes along the way. The militia marched [...] from Four Lakes {{the day of the}} battle, discovering the body of a dead Native American along the way, in whose pouch they found the watch of George Force, a lieutenant who was killed in an attack at Fort Blue Mounds on June 20. Ahead of the main party of militia, a small band of U.S. allied Ho-Chunk warriors had been sent ahead to scout the area with Pierre Pauquette, a trader from Portage, Wisconsin. Rumors that Black Hawk's band was at Lake Koshkonong persisted and Dodge and his men attempted to intercept Black Hawk there. Although Black Hawk's band had already moved on by the time the militia arrived at the lake, they found evidence of his presence <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> trail again, continuing their pursuit toward the Wisconsin River.|$|E

500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, Reimer again was {{assigned}} to the AHL's Marlies. [...] Reimer was not expected to contribute to the Maple Leafs at the NHL level during the 2010–11 season. Expectations for the young netminder were low heading into the season, with head coach Ron Wilson saying [...] "We wanted him to play in the minors and continue to get better, develop and try to stay healthy." [...] He was recalled by the Maple Leafs several months into the season, making his NHL debut on December 20, 2010 in relief of Jonas Gustavsson against the Atlanta Thrashers. [...] He played 14 minutes in the third period, stopping all four shots he faced. [...] Reimer made his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators on January 1, 2011. [...] The Maple Leafs won the game 5–1, with Reimer recording 32 saves while picking up his first career NHL win. [...] On February 3, 2011, Reimer recorded 27 saves <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first career NHL shutout against the Carolina Hurricanes. [...] A combination of injuries and poor play by Gustavsson and Jean-Sebastien Giguere provided an opportunity for Reimer at the NHL level. [...] His strong play caused the Leafs to carry three goalies on their NHL roster, a fact which did not surprise Giguere, who said [...] "The way he played the last time he was up, you {{knew he was going to}} get another chance." [...] Leafs head coach Ron Wilson acknowledged Reimer as the team's starting goalie as they set out on a late-season run for a playoff spot, saying [...] "It’s going to be his ball the rest of the way. [...] As long as we stay in the race. And I think he’s up to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{ended his}} first season in Toronto with a 3–4 mark, <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> second career save. [...] Schoeneweis’s ERA {{improved}} to 3.32. He also saw action in a career-high 80 games (2nd in the American League). The lefty was also among the league leaders in holds, with 35. Left-handed hitters batted a meager [...]188 against him. [...] In 2006, he went 2–2 for Toronto with a high ERA of 6.51 in 55 games.|$|E
2500|$|... then {{assumed the}} {{leadership}} of the peloton, looking to help with Levi Leipheimer's bid for the overall race as a whole; in a reverse to what occurred at Paris–Nice earlier in the month where [...] initiated the pace when Leipheimer fell three times during the penultimate stage. The breakaway's gap out front quickly dwindled, and were caught with over [...] left to travel in the stage. This allowed for the Alt dels Angels, a first-category climb [...] from the end, to take a greater presence in the stage's running, increasing the chances of riders going off the front to attack. After Leipheimer and Tejay van Garderen (...) made failed bids to get away, three riders – 's Damiano Cunego, [...] rider Dan Martin and Matteo Carrara of [...] – went clear on the descent and held station off the front until the closing stages. A reduced peloton contested the sprint in Girona; Bradley Wiggins tried to set the sprint up for his [...] team-mate Rigoberto Urán, but Albasini surprised the field by accelerating clear in the finishing straight <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> second successive stage victory. Urán finished third behind 's Dario Cataldo.|$|E
50|$|He {{eventually}} {{decided to}} quit coaching <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> career in law, {{in which he}} was successful in the Cleveland area. In 1925, he played professional football for the then-independent Hartford Blues.|$|R
6000|$|MORE {{gives him}} a quick look, goes quietly to the dining-table [...] <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> sheaf of notes. Hiding them with his sleeve, [...] {{he goes back to}} the window, where he again stands hesitating.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, I'll {{begin this}} evening," [...] said the ex-parson; <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> slouched hat, which he still wore {{somewhat}} broader in the brim than his comrades, {{in deference to}} old associations, he departed upon his mission.|$|R
2500|$|Orwell {{returned}} to London in late 1946 <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> literary journalism again. Now a well-known writer, he was swamped with work. Apart from {{a visit to}} Jura {{in the new year}} he stayed in London for one of the coldest British winters on record and with such a national shortage of fuel that he burnt his furniture and his child's toys. The heavy smog {{in the days before the}} Clean Air Act 1956 did little to help his health about which he was reticent, keeping clear of medical attention. Meanwhile, he had to cope with rival claims of publishers Gollancz and Warburg for publishing rights. About this time he co-edited a collection titled British Pamphleteers with Reginald Reynolds. As a result of the success of Animal Farm, Orwell was expecting a large bill from the Inland Revenue and he contacted a firm of accountants of which the senior partner was Jack Harrison. The firm advised Orwell to establish a company to own his copyright and to receive his royalties and set up a [...] "service agreement" [...] so that he could draw a salary. Such a company [...] "George Orwell Productions Ltd" [...] (GOP Ltd) was set up on 12 September 1947 although the service agreement was not then put into effect. Jack Harrison left the details at this stage to junior colleagues.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{straightforward}} method for a crimp to shanghai a sailor was to render him unconscious, forge his signature on the ship's articles, <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> [...] "blood money."

6000|$|... "Almost ready," [...] replied Fred, {{thrusting}} a brace of revolvers into <b>his</b> belt <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> rifle. [...] "Go for the horses, Pat, {{and wait}} at the stable for me. Our neighbours might hear the noise if you brought them round here." ...|$|R

6000|$|While she is speaking, Sir John's {{voice had}} been heard off the stage. [...] "No, thank you, Ransome, I'll get them myself, I know just where I left them."

60|$|As {{soon as she}} {{had entered}} the field Troy saw her, and {{sticking}} his pitchfork into the ground <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> crop or cane, he came forward. Bathsheba blushed with half-angry embarrassment, and adjusted her eyes {{as well as her}} feet to the direct line of her path.|$|R
60|$|Her words {{seemed to}} bring him back to his old self. He stooped down <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> cap.|$|E
60|$|He stamped one foot, <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> other laced boot, heavy, thick-soled, unblacked, mended many times. He {{smiled to}} himself grimly.|$|E

6000|$|...

6000|$|... "Iss, Zackey Maggot, so we'll knack'n, and try {{the higher}} mine to-morrow."
