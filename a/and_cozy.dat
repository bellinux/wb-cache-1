The ambience that the interiors of the earthen structures provide is one of cool comfort.|$|E
25|$|There was resistance, {{much of it}} from Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors. But {{there was}} also a pattern of denial, {{cover-up}} <b>and</b> <b>cozy</b> bureaucratic collusion between industry and government, the last especially notorious in Japan but by no means limited to that country. Even then, pro-nuclear power forces could prevail only by managing to instill in the minds of Japanese people a dichotomy between the physics of nuclear power and that of nuclear weapons, an illusory distinction made not only in Japan but throughout the world.|$|E

25|$|Amsterdam {{is famous}} for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many cafés (bars). They range from large and modern to small <b>and</b> <b>cozy.</b> The typical Bruine Kroeg (brown café) breathe a more old {{fashioned}} atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. Most cafés have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many discothèques. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the Leidseplein and the Rembrandtplein. The Paradiso, Melkweg and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discothèques on some nights. Examples of discothèques near the Rembrandtplein are the Escape, Air, John Doe and Club Abe. Also noteworthy are Panama, Hotel Arena (East), TrouwAmsterdam and Studio 80.

500|$|Jill M. Smith in Romantic Times {{gave the}} novel {{four out of}} five stars, {{labeling}} it a [...] "wonderful <b>and</b> <b>cozy</b> read". A Publishers Weekly review highlighted the [...] "gentle humor and likable cast" [...] and predicted that readers would be eager to follow the characters {{through the rest of the}} series. In Booklist, John Charles called the novel [...] "thoroughly charming" [...] and lauded the deep characterization and [...] "sharp, clever writing" [...] that combined to celebrate [...] "friendship and love".|$|E
500|$|In 125 games {{during the}} 1903 season, Chance {{recorded}} a [...]327 batting average, and 67 stolen bases; the latter mark led the National League (NL). His [...]439 on-base percentage was third-best in the league, behind Roy Thomas and Roger Bresnahan, and his 81 {{runs batted in}} (RBIs) tied Jake Beckley for sixth-best.

50|$|As the {{competition}} amongst dabangs {{increased in the}} 1980s, they decorated themselves with distinctive items, such as pink lights and indoor waterfalls, {{to survive in the}} increasingly crowded marketplace. At this time of the century, dabangs underwent huge changes in terms of their atmosphere and menu. For example, dark dabangs with dividers to block others’ view changed into the ones with bright <b>and</b> <b>cozier</b> atmospheres. This new type of coffee shops, which called themselves cafés to distinguish themselves from old style dabangs, began to focus on different kinds of coffee instead of selling traditional teas and sodas.|$|R
500|$|Following Butler's departure, newly {{returned}} drummer Ward {{once again}} left the band. Iommi reinstated former members Neil Murray on bass <b>and</b> <b>Cozy</b> Powell on drums, effectively reuniting the Tyr line-up. The band enlisted Body Count guitarist Ernie C {{to produce the}} new album, which was recorded in London in autumn of 1994. The album featured a guest vocal on [...] "Illusion of Power" [...] by Body Count vocalist Ice-T. The resulting Forbidden was released on 8 June 1995, but failed to chart in the US or the UK. The album was widely panned by critics; Allmusic's Bradley Torreano said [...] "with boring songs, awful production, and uninspired performances, this is easily avoidable {{for all but the}} most enthusiastic fan"; while Blender magazine called Forbidden [...] "an embarrassment... the band's worst album".|$|E
500|$|Mark Gevisser {{writes that}} the Kremlin's backing of the law was {{reflective}} of a [...] "dramatic tilt toward homophobia" [...] in Russia {{that began in the}} years preceding the law's passage. Gevisser {{writes that the}} law's passage allowed the Russian government to find [...] "common ground" [...] with the nationalist far right, and also appeal to the many Russians who view [...] "homosexuality as a sign of encroaching decadence in a globalized era." [...] He writes: [...] "Many Russians feel they can steady themselves against this cultural tsunami by laying claim to 'traditional values,' of which rejection of homosexuality is the easiest shorthand. This message plays particularly well for a government wishing to mobilize against demographic decline (childless homosexuals are evil) <b>and</b> <b>cozy</b> up to the Russian Orthodox Church (homosexuals with children are evil)." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2001, Moore further {{explained}} his opposition, citing how a reader {{can take the}} time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film forces you to watch the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added {{that he would not be}} going to see the film when completed. Moore said, [...] "My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice <b>and</b> <b>cozy</b> next to a fire, with a steaming cup of coffee." ...|$|E

500|$|Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler joined Tony Iommi <b>and</b> <b>Cozy</b> Powell {{in autumn}} of 1990 to begin {{working on the}} next Black Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell {{suffered}} a broken hip when his horse died, falling on the drummer's legs. Unable to complete work on the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, reuniting the Mob Rules era line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack. The year-long recording process was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Some songs were re-written multiple times. [...] "Dehumanizer took a long time, it was just hard work", Iommi said. [...] "We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous". Dio later recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort. [...] "It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works", he said. [...] "Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you end up making the Christmas album".|$|E
2500|$|Herbert's and Romberg's Viennese {{counterpart}} Franz Lehár and his music, including [...] "Dein ist mein ganzes Herz" [...] and the [...] "Merry Widow Waltz" [...] {{represent the}} gemütlicher (comfortable <b>and</b> <b>cozy)</b> {{side of the}} restaurant's personality. Other musical fare from this branch – The Tales of Hoffmann by Offenbach and Hansel and Gretel by Engelbert Humperdinck, along with the Strauss Waltzes such as [...] "Blue Danube" [...] – made up {{a good part of}} the basic Lüchow's repertoire performed by the piano and string ensemble first known as the Vienna Art Strings, or Quartet, and later as the Victor Herbert Quartet, or Trio. Add to that some of the numbers from Herbert's Babes in Toyland, such as [...] "Toyland" [...] and [...] "March of the Toys" [...] for instance, plus a few from The Nutcracker, and a great many of the well known Christmas carols and songs, and you get something like what was played during the Christmas season at Lüchow's down through the years.|$|E
