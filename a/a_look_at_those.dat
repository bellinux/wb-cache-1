2500|$|Although {{not officially}} confirmed, Ralf Hütter {{suggested}} that a second boxed set of their first three experimental albums—Kraftwerk, Kraftwerk 2 and Ralf and Florian—could be on its way, possibly seeing commercial release after their next studio album: [...] "We've just never really taken <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> albums. They've always been available, but as really bad bootlegs. Now we have more artwork. Emil has researched extra contemporary drawings, graphics, and photographs to go with each album, collections of paintings that we worked with, and drawings that Florian and I did. We {{took a lot of}} Polaroids in those days." [...] Kraftwerk also released an iOS app called Kraftwerk Kling Klang Machine. The Lenbach House in Munich exhibited some Kraftwerk 3-D pieces in Autumn 2011. Kraftwerk performed three concerts to open the exhibit.|$|E

25|$|On 1 December 2008, his dance DVD Access 2 All Areas was released. The one-hour DVD {{contains}} {{a documentary about}} his rise to stardom, four music videos in which Sampson sings as well as dances, and <b>a</b> behind-the-scenes <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> videos, dance tutorials {{and a set of}} photographs.|$|R
60|$|A {{man took}} up the hammer, and then waited <b>a</b> moment, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> who stood about Larry. He could see the faces {{of one or two}} in the lantern light, and {{recognized}} that he need expect no support from them. The men were resolute Americans, who had no desire for anything approaching anarchy.|$|R

"It's {{difficult}} to be sure in this light, but I should think {{that it may be}} the remains of a cage in which some people who lived here kept monkeys, or perhaps it was <b>an</b> aviary. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> little ladders for the monkeys to climb by, or possibly for the birds to sit on." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We can't do much till Dias comes back. We {{may as well}} go {{down and}} {{have a look at the}} lower rooms. I don't think there is much dust on the floor there, but while José is away looking after the mules we will cut enough bushes to make a couple of brooms. We shall want the place swept as clean as possible, so that we can look about, but I don't think there is the least chance of our being able to move the stones. Before we do {{anything}} we will go down to the pool and have a swim, and dive out through the entrance and have <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> rocks." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was all {{the more}} {{comfortable}} to do this because he was in a coup, warmly shut against the sharp, wholesome Christmas-week weather, and was wrapped to the chin in a long fur overcoat, which he wore that night as a duty to his family, with a conscience against taking cold and alarming them for his health. He now practised another piece of self-denial: he let the cabman drive rapidly past the interesting spectacle, and carry him to the house where he was going to fetch away the child from the Christmas party. He wished to be in good time, so as to save the child from anxiety about his coming; but he promised himself to stop, going back, and glut his sensibility in a leisurely study of the scene. He got the child, with her arms full of things from the Christmas-tree, into the coup, and then he said to the cabman, respectfully leaning as far over from his box to listen as his thick greatcoat would let him: [...] "When you get up there near that bakery again, drive slowly. I want to have <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> men." ...|$|E
60|$|The superintendent, {{who knew}} me well enough by sight and repute as a {{responsible}} amateur collector, readily gave me permission to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> drawerful {{of the earliest}} Mercian gold and silver coinage. I had brought one or two numismatic books with me, and I sat down to have <b>a</b> good <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> delightful cases.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{microarray}} {{experiment that}} also showed evidence that C10orf71's expression was lowered in skeletal muscle tissues that experienced sepsis. There was clinical significance {{found in the}} expression level of C10orf71 in <b>an</b> experiment <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> with Myotonic dystrophy. One microarray analysis produced results that showed C10orf71's expression level decreased in those with prostate cancer as well.|$|R

30|$|As for discriminative {{approaches}} with CNN, we can {{see their}} accuracies are relatively {{better than the other}} family of approaches. Taking <b>a</b> closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> approaches, we also noticed that 1 in-GEINet yielded the best accuracy for the identification task (i.e., rank 1 identification rate), while the Siamese yielded the best performance for the verification task (i.e., EER). We will discuss these points in Subsection 4.7.|$|R

5000|$|... "For Goodness Sakes, Look at Those Cakes" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{performed}} by James Brown. Released as an edited two-part single in 1978, it charted #52 R&B in 1979. A full-length version appears on the album Take <b>a</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>Those</b> Cakes. Robert Christgau described the song as [...] "a great throwaway--an eleven-minute rumination on ass-watching, including genuinely tasteless suggestions that Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder join the fun." ...|$|E
50|$|Emblidge’s work in {{education}} and literacy includes service on the City of Richmond School Board. Starting in 1994, he served for four terms, including three as chairman. In 2002 Dr Emblidge was appointed President to the Board of Education in Virginia by Governor Mark R. Warner, and held that position until January 2010. “The {{fact that we have}} 92 percent of our schools fully accredited is wonderful, but there are still students who are not passing the tests. We also want to take <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> students who have no difficulty passing the SOL tests and figure out how we can continually challenge them, so that when they graduate they can compete with anyone in the world.”, Emblidge said about his work.|$|E

60|$|As the day advanced, {{both the}} Chainbearer and the {{squatter}} became aroused from the languor that had succeeded the receiving {{of their respective}} hurts, and more or less alive to what was passing around them. Life was ebbing fast in both, yet each seemed, just at that moment, to turn his thoughts backward on the world, in order, as it might be, to take <b>a</b> last <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> scenes {{in which he had}} now been an actor for the long period of threescore-and-ten years.|$|R

50|$|The {{first series}} of Downton Abbey {{comprises}} 7 episodes, and was broadcast in the UK on 26 September 2010, and explored {{the lives of}} the Crawley family and their servants from the day after the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 1912 to the outbreak of the First World War on 4 August 1914. The ties between blood relations in family {{are an important part of}} the series.

40|$|In its {{consideration}} of the remarkable extent and variety of non-university researchers, this book takes a broader view of ‘knowledge’ and ‘research’ than in the many hot debates about today’s knowledge society, ‘learning age’, or organisation of research. It goes beyond the commonly held image of ‘knowledge’ as something produced and owned by the full-time experts to take <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> engaged in active knowledge building outside the university walls...|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} {{has already been}} written about the UN Conference on Sustainable Development and its outcome document, “The Future We Want”. Much of the {{commentary}} has been critical of both the process and the document. To understand the process and the final result, it may be useful to look at how one or two issues advanced {{over the course of the}} negotiations. Both ocean advocates and representatives of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) seemed relatively satisfied with the results of the conference, and <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> interlinked matters is interesting...|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{interested}} in economically vulnerable {{populations in the}} United States generally study populations living below the official poverty thresholds used by the U. S. Census Bureau. We know less about those living just above the poverty thresholds. This paper takes <b>a</b> deeper <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> living just above the official poverty thresholds. Using Mollie Orshansky’s (1966) definition of near poor, those living between 100 and less than 133 percent of the poverty thresholds, it compares rates by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics over 45 years (1966 - 2011). In addition, it examines how these rates change under alternative poverty measures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} itself {{mainly with}} the problems presently facing Logan 2 ̆ 7 s CBD (Central Business District). With the possibility of competition from a mall on 14 th north, increased population with all its ramifications and continuing natural decay, the problems of downtown Logan today will not get any easier. This paper offers <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> problems and considers a few alternative solutions. In no way is it intended to cover {{the entire range of}} solutions available, nor does it offer in depth answers to these problems. Rather, it is an overview of possible avenues where effort may be directed...|$|E
40|$|Cells from cancers show {{aberrant}} behaviour such as unrestrained growth, invasion into adjacent tissue and metastasis. All these features of cancer cell behaviour {{can be explained}} in terms of genetic changes and the functional impact of these changes. In this review, colorectal cancer (CRC) is examined as a classical example of multistep carcinogenesis. First there is an overview which shows that cancers develop by a process of somatic evolution. This gives rise to preferred genetic pathways of tumorigenesis. The factors which may influence the development and ultimate choice of genetic pathways are then examined. Next, CRC is studied as a specific disease and the putative genetic pathways are described. The mutations that comprise these pathways and the possible functional sequelae of these are explored. The review concludes with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> avenues which may further elucidate the natural history of CRC and lead to improved therapy...|$|E

Traditionally as producers we 2 ̆ 7 re very good at producing, and by golly, somebody will buy it: build it and they will come. You will be learning today about what can and cannot be produced in these [alternative] systems and how profitably it can be done. This is very important, but you 2 ̆ 7 ve still got to sell the stuff. I think some of these alternative systems offer some challenges, and we 2 ̆ 7 re going to take <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those.</b> And they offer some opportunities {{that we have not}} seen for a long, long time.

40|$|The {{following}} essay takes <b>a</b> closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> inter- and intra-branch {{dynamics of}} the U.

According to LeLoup and Shull, {{the question of whether}} president and Congress are able to exert influence depends on such factors as the domestic political climate, public expectations, the result of presidential and congressional elections, as well as the influence of interest groups, intra-executive dynamics and the specific content of the policies formulated by the White House. This paper will therefore focus on the politics of the run-up and aftermath of the U. S. -led regime change in Iraq rather than on the respective policies themselves...|$|R

How locally concentrated are those occupations? This report concludes with recommendations for how the K- 12 education system could be improved to increase opportunities in LA's creative occupations, in ways that benefit the LA County economy as a whole...|$|R
