The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian terraces were unsuitable for modern inhabitation. Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful {{indicators}} of climate changes during the Paleozoic era. When global temperatures were low, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of the Ordovician, the large difference in temperature between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such {{much of the}} Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low to middle latitudes were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E

25|$|Pashto and Dari are the {{official}} languages of Afghanistan; bilingualism is very common.

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of North America, human {{habitation}} {{appeared in}} the island fairly rapidly after the retreat of the ice sheet.

Various Clovis artifacts have been discovered since then, on property owned by Mobil Oil.|$|E

25|$|The first European {{settlers}} {{were red}} cedar cutters, who were first recorded as having visited and logged {{in the area}} in 1814. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of coastal New South Wales, the cleared land was used for dairy farming and cedar cutting died out, as the cedar trees disappeared. Dairy farming became the predominant primary industry and remains so to this day. Gerringong had a small boat harbour used for the export of cedar and dairy produce.|$|E
25|$|Most Sudanese Muslims are {{adherents of}} the Sunni branch of Islam; Sunni Islam in Sudan is not {{marked by a}} uniform body of belief and practice, however. Some Muslims opposed aspects of Sunni orthodoxy, and rites having a non-Islamic origin were widespread, being {{accepted}} {{as if they were}} integral to Islam, or sometimes being recognized as separate. Moreover, Sunni Islam in Sudan (<b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of Africa) has been characterized by the formation of religious orders or brotherhoods, each of which made special demands on its adherents.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} human {{settlers in}} the area around Broken Hill are thought to have been the Wiljakali Indigenous Australians, once thought to have only intermittently lived in the area {{because of the lack of}} permanent water sources, but it has since been found that the Indigenous Clans of the area were able to survive on underground water holes and wells that were unknown to the European settlers. Many of these waterholes are still kept secret from non-Indigenous people. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of Australia, a combination of disease and aggression by white settlers drove them from their lands.|$|E

25|$|By the 1840s the Gothic Revival style {{had become}} {{virtually}} universal among Anglicans {{and used for}} most other Christian denominations as well. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of the English speaking world the lancet windows and buttresses of the Gothic Revival style soon became permanently associated in most people's mind with ecclesiastical buildings. It was soon also embraced for secular purposes as well, such as government buildings and universities. Canadian universities modeled themselves on the great British universities, Oxford and Cambridge, and this extended to embracing the Collegiate Gothic architecture used in their construction. Two of the first Gothic Revival colleges were Trinity College in Toronto and Bishop's University in Quebec.|$|E
25|$|Darwin's {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} (published in 1859) spurred scientific interest in chimpanzees, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of life science, leading eventually to numerous studies of the animals in the wild and captivity. The observers of chimpanzees {{at the time were}} mainly interested in behaviour as it related to that of humans. This was less strictly and disinterestedly scientific than it might sound, with much attention being focused on whether or not the animals had traits that could be considered 'good'; the intelligence of chimpanzees was often significantly exaggerated, as immortalized in Hugo Rheinhold's Affe mit Schädel (see image, left). By the end of the 19th century, chimpanzees remained very much a mystery to humans, with very little factual scientific information available.|$|E
25|$|Until about 10,000 years ago, ground sloths such as Megatherium {{lived in}} South America as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of North America; they colonized the latter {{as part of}} the Great American Interchange. Along with many other animals, however, they {{disappeared}} shortly after the appearance of humans on both continents. Large amounts of evidence suggest human hunting contributed to the extinction of the American megafauna, like that of North Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Madagascar. Simultaneous climate change that came {{with the end of the}} last ice age may have also played a role in some cases. However, the survival of Megalocnus on the Antilles until about 5000 years ago (after these islands were finally settled by humans), long after other ground sloths died out on the mainland, points toward human activities as the cause of extinction.|$|E

25|$|A basic {{distinction}} is between sculpture in the round, free-standing sculpture, such as statues, not attached (except possibly at the base) {{to any other}} surface, and {{the various types of}} relief, which are at least partly attached to a background surface. Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or bas-relief, high relief, and sometimes an intermediate mid-relief. Sunk-relief is a technique restricted to ancient Egypt. Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large figure groups and narrative subjects, which are difficult to accomplish in the round, and is the typical technique used both for architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings, and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> pottery, metalwork and jewellery. Relief sculpture may also decorate steles, upright slabs, usually of stone, often also containing inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of Madagascar, the Mahafaly {{bury their}} dead in tombs. The tombs {{of family members}} were {{historically}} located in sacred forest areas far from the houses of the living, although due to deforestation and other factors {{this is no longer}} always the case. Tombs are typically clustered together and laid out according to the rank and role of the family members, with the eldest ancestor's tomb the furthest south, his descendants to his north, and wives and unmarried family members to his west. Funerals consist of several ceremonies, and zebu are sacrificed at each; their skulls are placed on top of the tomb. The first ceremony is one of preparation for the following events and the ombilahy zebu sacrificed at this ceremony is particularly important because the meat is shared with all those gathered as a gesture of unity and friendship.|$|E
25|$|He {{tended to}} dramatize where {{traditional}} novelists narrated; {{he is more}} concerned with the interplay of ideas and opinions than of feelings and emotions; his dramatis personae is more likely to consist of a cast of more or less equal characters than of one outstanding hero or heroine and a host of minor auxiliaries; his novels have a tendency to approximate the Classical unities, with few changes of scene and few if any subplots; his novels are novels of conversation rather than novels of action; in fact, Peacock is so much more interested in what his characters say to one another than in what they do to one another that he often sets out entire chapters of his novels in dialogue form. Plato's Symposium is the literary ancestor of these works, by way of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus, in which (<b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of Peacock) the conversation relates less to exalted philosophical themes than to the points of a good fish dinner.|$|E

25|$|Due {{in part to}} its {{political}} commitment—and its replacement by Stalinist architecture—the mechanistic, dynamic forms of Constructivism {{were not part of}} the calm Platonism of the International Style as it was defined by Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell Hitchcock. Their book included only one building from the USSR, an electrical laboratory by a government team led by Nikolaev. During the 1960s Constructivism was rehabilitated to a certain extent, and both the wilder experimental buildings of the era (such as the Globus Theatre or the Tbilisi Roads Ministry Building) and the unornamented Khrushchyovka apartments are in a sense a continuation of the aborted experiment, although under very different conditions. Outside the USSR, Constructivism has often been seen as an alternative, more radical modernism, and its legacy can be seen in designers as diverse as Team 10, Archigram and Kenzo Tange, as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> Brutalist work. Their integration of the avant-garde and everyday life has parallels with the Situationists, particularly the New Babylon project of Guy Debord and Constant Nieuwenhuys.|$|E
25|$|In Sudan <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>much</b> of African Islam, {{the cult}} of the saint is of {{considerable}} importance, although some Muslims would reject it. The development of the cult is closely related to the presence of the religious orders; many who came to be considered saints on their deaths were founders or leaders of religious orders who in their lifetimes were thought to have barakah, a state of blessedness implying an indwelling spiritual power inherent in the religious office. Baraka intensifies after death as the deceased becomes a wali (literally friend of God, but in this context translated as saint). The tomb and other places associated with the saintly being become the loci of the person's baraka, and in some views he or she becomes the guardian spirit of the locality. The intercession of the wali is sought on a variety of occasions, particularly by those seeking cures or by barren women desiring children. A saint's annual holy day is the occasion of a local festival that may attract a large gathering.|$|E
