5|$|Fallout 3 {{takes place}} in the year 2277, and within the region that covers most of the ruined city of Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and parts of Maryland. The game's {{landscape}} includes war-ravaged variants of numerous real-life landmarks such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, Arlington National Cemetery and the Washington Monument, with a small number of settlements dotted around the Capital Wastelands that consist of descendants of survivors from the Great War, including one that surrounds an unexploded bomb, another consisting primarily of ghoul inhabitants, and another formed within the hulking remains of an aircraft carrier. While the city can be explored, much of the interior zones are cut off by giant rubble over many of the roads leading in, meaning that access can only be achieved by using the city's former underground metro tunnels (loosely based on the real-life Washington Metro).|$|E

25|$|Stress {{patterns}} may distinguish {{a compound}} word from a noun phrase {{consisting of the}} same component words. For example, a black board, adjective plus noun, is any board that is black, and has equal stress on both elements. The compound blackboard, on the other hand, though it may have started out historically as black board, now is stressed on only the first element, black. Thus a compound such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> normally has a falling intonation which a phrase such as a white house does not.|$|E

25|$|The Secret Service Uniformed Division is a {{security}} police {{similar to the}} U.S. Capitol Police or DHS Federal Protective Service and {{is in charge of}} protecting the physical White House grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the Washington, D.C. area.

25|$|Fannie stock plunged. Some {{worried that}} Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others {{worried about a}} {{government}} seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{went on the air}} to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people. If they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|This {{investigation}} included {{over one}} hundred interviews of former students, family of former students, and former staff members of the school. The interviews confirmed {{that in addition to}} the implementation of the Individual Rating System, school administrators used corporal punishment as a tool to encourage obedience. The interviews revealed little disagreement about the way in which corporal punishment was administered. The former students were consistent in that punishment was administered by school administrators and adult staff witnesses in the building referred to <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> The former students were consistent in stating that a wooden paddle or leather strap was the implement used for administering punishment. The area of disagreement amongst former students was the number of spankings administered and their severity. Although some former students stated that they were “beaten” {{to the point that the}} skin of their buttocks blistered and bled profusely, there was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring. A secondary disagreement was the former students’ perceptions of the punishment process. Some former students stated that their spankings caused them no psychological harm and that they learned from their mistakes while others stated that, mentally, they suffered greatly as a result and still do so to this day.|$|E
500|$|Mark Hanna and William McKinley {{continued}} their friendship as they assumed their offices in March 1897. [...] Senator Hanna {{was looking for}} a residence; President McKinley suggested that he stay at the Executive Mansion (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> was still formally known) until he found one. [...] According to Hearst's New York Journal, [...] "the Senator doubtless feels that if anyone has the right to make himself at home in the White House he is the man". [...] Hanna soon moved into the Arlington Hotel, close to the White House, where he occupied a large suite. [...] After the death of Vice President Hobart in November 1899, Hanna took over the lease on his house on Lafayette Square, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{moving to}} Washington, the Hobarts {{established}} {{themselves at the}} Arlington Hotel, which was the Washington home to many political men of the era, including Hanna. Soon, however, Pennsylvania Senator Don Cameron offered them the lease of the house he owned at 21 Madison Place, diagonally across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Executive Mansion (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> was still formally known). The asking price was $10,000 per year; the Vice President bargained Cameron down to $8,000 (equal to the vice presidential salary) by suggesting that the public might assume he stole the excess. Among the frequent visitors at {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Cream White House" [...] was Hanna, by then a senator, who would come by for breakfast and talk with the Vice President until it was time for both to go to the Senate.|$|E
500|$|Adams's {{credentials}} as a revolutionary secured for him two terms as President George Washington's vice president (1789 to 1797) and also his own election in 1796 {{as the second}} president. In his single term as president, he encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans, {{as well as the}} dominant faction in his own Federalist Party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts, and built up the army and navy {{in the face of an}} undeclared naval [...] "Quasi-War" [...] with France. The major accomplishment of his presidency was a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton's opposition. Due to his strong posture on defense, Adams is [...] "often called the father of the American Navy." [...] He was the first U.S. president to reside in the executive mansion, now known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b>|$|E
500|$|Testing {{revealed}} that {{their idea of}} a role-playing game based {{in the real world}} was more interesting in theory than actuality. They chose two real-world inspirations for levels: [...] "highly interconnected, multi-level" [...] spaces and places one cannot normally visit (such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House).</b> In practice, they felt that some functions of the real world, such as hotels and office buildings, were not compelling in a game, and that [...] "reality" [...] always lost when up against [...] "fun". Their recreations of notable locations and items such as the Statue of Liberty and payphones were questioned when they did not emulate the actual site or function. Internally, the team began to doubt their investment in a non-player character-driven game as sufficiently interesting. Spector was swayed by this widespread sentiment to have [...] "monsters and bad guys", and the team increased the prominence of several robots and added genetically-altered animals that still fit the story.|$|E
