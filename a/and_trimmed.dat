5|$|The Tiger {{went into}} {{production}} in June 1964, {{little more than}} a year after the completion of the Shelby prototype. Painted <b>and</b> <b>trimmed</b> bodies were supplied by Pressed Steel in Oxfordshire, and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America. Installing the engine required some unusual manufacturing methods, including using a sledgehammer to bash in part of the already primed and painted bulkhead to allow the engine to be slid into place. Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month, which were initially offered for sale only in North America. The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg-Warner 4-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox, until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang.|$|E
5|$|The jacket {{prescribed}} for infantry use {{was of the}} same design for all service men. The design itself depended entirely on the region, time, {{and the source of}} fabrics. The Eastern Theater uniform jacket was the Richmond Depot design, with three primary types issued throughout the war. The jacket varied from a cadet gray, piped <b>and</b> <b>trimmed</b> jacket, looking much like a pre-war militia jacket, to the jeans-cloth jacket that was worn out in six months. The materials and uniforms imported from England were also issued to the troops through this facility. The Western and Deep Southern facilities manufactured similar uniforms, being jeans-cloth, dyed with vegetable based grays, that would fade to brown or tan. The typical jackets issued had 5-7 button fronts, with collar and cuff trim that varied from era, region and source, and an outside pocket on occasion.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} race sixteen was delayed for 30 minutes while the race {{committee}} {{waited for the}} wind to increase. Emirates Team New Zealand took the leeward position at the start line but Oracle Team USA got onto its foils and sailed over {{on top of the}} Kiwis to lead by five seconds at the reach mark. At the second mark the New Zealand team were 13 seconds behind Oracle and after a tacking duel upwind to the third mark Oracle was able to get the wind advantage for the downwind leg. Oracle sailed conservatively downwind gaining a 21-second lead for the fourth mark, which they extended to 33 seconds by finish line. Oracle stayed alive 6–8 <b>and</b> <b>trimmed</b> the Kiwis' lead to just 2 points. It was their 5th straight win.|$|E
25|$|This era {{signaled}} {{the loss of}} any lingering neoclassical, pseudo-Grecian styles in women's dress. This decline was especially evident in France due to the Emperor Napoleon's suppression of trade in the fabrics used in neoclassical dress. While waistlines were still high, they were beginning to drop slightly. Larger and more abundant decoration, especially near the hem and neckline foreshadowed greater extravagance in the coming years. More petticoats were being worn, and a stiffer, more cone-shaped skirt became popular. Stiffness could be supplemented by layers of ruffles and tucks on a hem, as well as corded or flounced petticoats. Sleeves began to be pulled, tied, and pinched {{in ways that were}} more influenced by romantic and gothic styles than neoclassical. Hats and hairstyles became more elaborate <b>and</b> <b>trimmed,</b> climbing higher to balance widening skirts.|$|E
25|$|Few {{sparked a}} long-simmering legal {{problem for the}} {{department}} when he began implementing in March 2001 a never-enforced 1977 policy requiring all DCFEMS personnel to have short hair <b>and</b> <b>trimmed</b> beards. Three firefighters were suspended {{and a number of}} others threatened with suspension for refusing to adhere to the policy. Few claimed firefighters were unable to wear their helmets or poperly seal their safety helmets due to over-long hair. However, on June 21, 2001, Judge James Robertson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia imposed a temporary injunction against the department, preventing it from applying the short-hair policy to those individuals (such as Rastafarians or Muslims) who wore long hair or beards for religious purposes. Judge Robertson's ruling only delayed a final disposition regarding the policy, however, and appeals were made.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the Tent Room is drawn from the original use of striped fabric draped {{on the walls and}} hung in swaths from the ceiling in order to temporarily transform what was normally the tennis court into a dining hall. The room today has a wall covering of vertically sriped red and gold fabric with a padded backing, which rises to meet the same fabric hung in a swag fashion outwards from a single coffer in the centre of the ceiling <b>and</b> <b>trimmed</b> {{around the perimeter of the}} room with a scallop edged valence of simple passementerie and tassels. This gives the space an overall resemblance to the interior of a large tent. The west wall of the room is broken by series of windows, each paired with a double door into the Long Gallery on the opposite wall, and between them a continuous frame and panel wainscotting. All this woodwork, including the door frames and other trim, is painted in a gloss white to contrast with the textured and patterned wall fabric.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the central}} body and towers are eight panels {{consisting}} of two-floors and a mezzanine, each panel divided by two orders of columns: {{on the first floor}} Tuscan and on the second floor Tuscan-Ionic columns. The first floor windows are moulded <b>and</b> <b>trimmed</b> sills with cornices, while a similar number of windows on the upper floor are have veranda-like railings, surmounted by smaller square windows. The three-storey towers are also divided by Tuscan and Tuscan-Ionic columns: the first floor, have three windows and sills with angular cornices on the outside and rounded cornices on the interior; the intermediary floor has a comparable number of windows, while the third floor windows are surmounted by smaller windows (much like on the panels). The southern lateral façade has three storeys, with 19 windows in succession, comparable to the main entrance, although there are a series of niches at the base. The uncompleted western façade show signs of vestiges of various dependencies with a wall of open window sills/arches with Tuscan pillars and access to the central courtyard by three rounded arches. Embedded in the vast foyer with a vaulted edge supported by Tuscan columns, has twenty-two marble statues, some signed and dated.|$|E
25|$|After a Chiefs punt on a {{drive in}} which Chiefs quarterback Brodie Croyle was injured on a sack by Adalius Thomas, the Patriots drove 80 yards on 11 plays, capping off the series with a 5-yard {{touchdown}} run by running back Sammy Morris {{to extend the}} Patriots' lead to 14–3. The next Chiefs drive began with backup quarterback Damon Huard replacing Croyle. The Chiefs drove 63 yards <b>and</b> <b>trimmed</b> the Patriots' lead to 14–10 on a 13-yard touchdown reception by wide receiver Dwayne Bowe. After three punts, Huard and the Chiefs began a fourth-quarter drive by throwing an interception to Patriots cornerback Ellis Hobbs; a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on the Patriots caused their ensuing series to begin at their own 47-yard line. A handful of Morris runs and Cassel passes, including an 11-yard reception by Morris, brought the Patriots into the Chiefs' red zone, but the Patriots failed to convert on third down and settled for a 37-yard Stephen Gostkowski field goal to make their lead 17–10. Starting from his own 22-yard line with 2:20 remaining, Huard was strip-sacked on the third play of the series, but recovered his own fumble at the Chiefs' 27-yard line. On the next play, Huard hit wide receiver Devard Darling for a 68-yard completion, giving the Chiefs first-and-goal from the Patriots' 5-yard line with 53 seconds left. However, the Patriots' defense prevented the Chiefs from advancing another yard, as an incomplete pass, a Larry Johnson run for no gain, and two more incomplete passes gave the Patriots the ball back to seal their first victory of the season, and their 20th consecutive regular-season win.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{unsteady}} Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes {{method is}} developed {{to account for}} sinkage <b>and</b> <b>trim</b> effects in the calculation of steadily advancing surface ship. Volume of fluid method (VOF) is devised {{for the treatment of}} free surface. The sinkage <b>and</b> <b>trim</b> were predicted by using dynamic mesh technology, and the motion of ship is controlled by six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) code. Predicted results for sinkage <b>and</b> <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> resistance at seven Froude numbers (from Fn= 0. 15 to Fn= 0. 45) were compared against experimental data, showing good agreement.
