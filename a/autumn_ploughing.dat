50|$|Over fifteen million {{hectares}} {{in the affected}} areas of west and central Asia suffer from infestations with this pest. The number of pests varies enormously {{from year to year}} and a significant attack may occur about once in every seven years, potentially causing yield losses worth tens of millions of dollars. The loss in yield of grain has been estimated at 50-90% in wheat and 20-30% in barley. While feeding, the sunn bugs inject proteolytic and amlolytic enzymes into the wheat causing breakdown of the gluten which reduces the quality of the flour resulting in the production of inferior dough. Traditional control methods include the early application of fertilizer on winter crops, the early sowing of spring crops, the selection of varieties resistant to the pest and varieties that ripen early and can be harvested early, <b>autumn</b> <b>ploughing</b> in of crop residues and the spraying of crops with pesticides, which should only be done when pest populations rise to economically damaging levels.|$|E

In cotton crops, blooms that have been attacked may open prematurely and stay fruitless. When the bolls are damaged, some will fall off and others will fail to produce lint or produce lint of an inferior quality. Secondary infections by fungi and bacteria are common and may lead to rotting of fruits.

He specialized in landscapes, producing works which often had a high horizon and excelled in conveying the changing weather conditions encountered in Odsherred. Several of his early works depict scenes of winter and <b>autumn</b> with <b>ploughed</b> fields and the occasional farm building. Later he adopted a lighter palette and painted summer scenes, often comparable to those of the Funen Painters. A period he spent in Skagen in the mid-1950s contributed to his rather sketchy manner of painting with stronger and more brilliant colour. After travelling to Bahrein with the archaeologist P.V. Glob in the 1950s and 1960s, his paintings benefited from even more colour and brightness. Indeed, he found he could better represent these effects in watercolours than in oils. Though closely involved with the impressionists, he continued to develop his own style and motifs with the result that he became one of the best landscape painters of the 20th century, painting his natural surroundings in winter, summer and spring.|$|R

Surface water ponding or crop hampering occurred when the amount of rainfall was clearly greater than the long-term average. The mean of the relative area of the ponded surface water, indicating the risk of surface runoff, and hampered crop growth was larger in the CT fields than in the AP fields.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the time of {{incorporation}} of different green manures and barley residues on the grain yield of spring cereals in two successive seasons was studied in seven field trials. Annual hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), westerwold ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. var. westerwoldicum) and straw of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were incorporated into the soil by ploughing in early September, late October and the following May, and by reduced tillage in May. Spring barley was established in the following spring, and spring oats (Avena sativa L.) one year later. In general the grain yield of spring barley after legumes was similar to that after barley, {{in spite of the fact}} that N fertilization was reduced by 40 kg ha- 1. The two <b>autumn</b> <b>ploughing</b> treatments resulted in a good yield of spring barley more reliably than did the spring incorporations. Because delayed <b>autumn</b> <b>ploughing</b> did not decrease the grain yield, a delaying procedure can be recommended for its potential of decreasing nitrogen leaching.

40|$|In crop production, {{the right}} {{operations}} {{are not known}} in beforehand. Many different factors are included: weather, soil type and preceding crop are examples of factors that vary. When soil tillage and seeding are carried out {{there are many different}} strategies to choose between. For a farmer {{to be able to handle}} every situation can be expensive, as it would be essential that the farmer have access to many different types of implements. The question to be asked before a operation is if the cost for the operation is leading to a equal amount of income. In a project that was started in the autumn 2003 with draught measurements the aim was to find out draught requirements for the most common types of implements as a function of soil type and working depth. Draught requirements for the different types of implements should then be the basis for calculation of power requirement and fuel consumption in a computer program for guidance of machinery costs. This work aim to complement earlier draught measurements with values from tillage operations carried out in the spring 2004 and to develop a calculation program for machinery costs. The tillage operations that was studied in this work was harrowing, seeding with shoe coulter, seeding with discs and reduced tillage (carrier and disk harrow). Measurements of draught requirement during seedbed preparation and seeding was done after catch crop, <b>autumn</b> mouldboard <b>ploughing,</b> spring mouldboard ploughing and reduced tillage. The tractor used for draught measurements was a Massey Fergusson 6290 (130 hp). The tractor's fuel consumption had been measured and calibrated by measuring the power at the PTO. With a logger that registered fuel consumption the power that the tractor developed during field work could be registered. Draught requirement for harrowing after ploughing was higher than after reduced tillage. Harrowing after spring mouldboard ploughing had the highest draught requirements. The draught requirement was reduced between first and second passage. Draught requirement for the grain drill with discs was highest at direct drilling tillage but there was small difference between the series. Seeding after conventional tillage (2 times harrowing after <b>autumn</b> mouldboard <b>ploughing)</b> was done with both shoe coulter and discs, the grain drill whit discs had a double draught requirement compared with shoe coulter. The calculation program was build up with the aim to be able to calculate the costs for all the machinery operations on a farm and use the results of the draught measurements to calculate fuel consumption. The program can simulate a farm with up to eight tractors and fifteen implements. Through connecting tractors with implements it´s possible to simulate tillage on the field. The program calculate tillage costs and time consumption for the farm. What changes in machinery and tillage system do for cost and time consumption for the farm can easily be answered by the program...|$|R

40|$|Winter {{oilseed rape}} {{can take up}} more {{nitrogen}} during autumn than cereal crops and requires high amounts of nitrogen (N) for maximum yield. In organic farming clover-grass leys are often the previous crop to winter oilseed rape since large amounts of nitrogen are mineralised during the <b>autumn,</b> after <b>ploughing</b> the ley, and the following growing season. Whether the Nsupply to winter oilseed rape is affected by harvesting the ley once or twice or keeping it as a green mulching crop are discussed in organic farming. Winter oilseed rape gives a good residual- N effect on the following crop but increased amounts of soil mineral nitrogen (Nmin) is often found at harvest of oilseed rape and late autumn which increases the risk for N-losses during winter. Consequently {{there is a need}} to optimise the N-supply to winter oilseed rape and reduce the risk for N-losses. This is especially important in organic farming where N often is a limiting source. In five field trials (2001 - 2006) the effect of three treatments of a clover- grass ley (no harvest, one harvest, two harvests) on Nmin, net N-mineralisation, N-uptake and seed yield of organically grown winter oilseed rape (with and without application of dairy slurry in the spring) was studied. In the subsequent year the effect on Nmin, N-uptake and grain yield was studied in winter wheat (following early soil cultivation/ploughing) and in spring wheat (following early soil cultivation/ploughing, catchcrop/late ploughing and no catchcrop/late ploughing). Different amounts of above ground ley crop incorporated into the ground (in the three treatments) had no impact on oilseed rape seed production or Nmin in late <b>autumn</b> after <b>ploughing</b> the ley, in early spring or at harvest of the following winter oilseed rape. The reason for this could be that the roots are of more importance for the N-supply after leys and were most likely similar in all treatments. The impact of the slurry application to the winter oilseed rape was surprisingly small and increased yield with 300 kg ts/ha. In late autumn after harvest of oilseed rape Nmin was reduced by 50 % with catch crop (or spontaneously occurring crop) and late ploughing compared to where winter wheat was sown after early cultivation and ploughing or early cultivation followed by late ploughing. The results showed that catch crop (or spontaneous crop) and late ploughing (followed by spring wheat) were efficient methods to reduce the risk for N-losses after winter oilseed rape. Subsequent wheat yield was relatively high, indicating a sufficient N-supply, but was not affected by the ley treatments, slurry application or various soil cultivation (with or without catchcrop) after harvest of oilseed rape. Yield of winter and spring wheat was similar and with a price 0, 5 kr/kg higher for spring wheat, economically as well as environmentally the best choice of subsequent crop to winter oilseed rape was spring wheat...|$|R

Effects of no-tillage system and direct sowing (D) with cultivation with autumn deep (A) and shallow (B) ploughing and cultivation with spring pre-sowing ploughing (C) were compared. It was demonstrated that the 13 -year maize grain yield in no-tillage system and direct sowing was lower by 10. 4 % than the yield obtained in conventional tillage system. The depth of <b>autumn</b> <b>ploughing</b> and its replacement with spring pre-sowing ploughing did not significantly affect the level of grain yield. Direct sowing compared to conventional tillage system reduced costs by on average 11. 6 %, and energy inputs only by 0. 9 %.

The negative effect of direct sowing on grain yield was compensated by lower costs, which caused that the mean cost of 100 kg grain production for 13 years in direct sowing did not significantly differ from the costs of ploughing cultivations. Energy effectiveness of maize grain production in direct sowing was significantly lower than in the examined ploughing tillage cultivations.

The main purposes for the construction is to save time and money, and to reduce excessive packing of the soil. Its drilling and row hoeing qualities were examined at the Department of Soil Sciences in three series of field trials during 1991. Two of the series, 'Seed coulters: Different tillage methods' (Rl- 5015) and 'Seed coulters: Minimized tillage' (R 2 - 5016), were carried out on the Ultuna property. The third (R 2 -S 017), concerning row hoeing in small grains, {{was carried out in}} the county of Östergötland. In R 2 - 5015, the use of Ekoodlaren and three other drills were compared after three different seedbed preparations. The seedbed treatments were seeding after mouldboard plowing and harrowing, stubble cultivation and harrowing and direct drilling. In R 2 -S 016, three different drills were compared after three different seedbed preparations (zero, one and three harrowings) in both <b>autumn</b> <b>ploughed</b> and shallow cultivated plots. In R 2 - 5017, the work of Ekoodlaren was compared with a drill equipped with hoe coulters in one treatment. The other treatments concerned row hoeing and fertilizing with Ekoodlaren. The shape of the frame of the Ekoodlaren is a T. The seed box emanates from a Tive air drill. The load carrying wheels are mounted on bogies, where the working depth regulation mechanism and the coulters (duckfoot shovels) are also mounted. The placement of the seeds was carried out nearly as well by the Ekoodlaren as by the reference machines equipped with hoe coulters. Then number of emerged plants was slightly higher than for the reference drill in the row weeding trials. The stands of wintering weeds and volunteer plants were strongly decreased by the drill operation of the Ekoodlaren. The effect on annual weeds depended upon the conditions during the seeding operation. Rainy weather delayed the row weeding to a time when the crop was too developed for normal weeding operations in practical farming. Row weeding small grains did decrease the weed stand. The shovels did not remove any grain plants, but weeding did decrease the yield compared to the unworked Ekoodlaren treatment. The abnormal weather conditions (unusually wet) prevented any attempts to interpret the results for a more normal year. No notable yield differences occurred in the Ultuna trials, while in the row weeding trials, seeding with Ekoodlaren gave a higher yield in all treatments. In the Ultuna trials, the overall variances were small. This was not the case in the Östergötland trials due to a considerable weed stand (developed during previous cropping seasons) and unusually wet weather conditions.

In autumn, single applications of soil active herbicides were not effective enough, especially at a high density of more than 500 heads of blackgrass per m 2. The mixtures of soil active herbicides with leave active herbicides applied in autumn achieved very good control. The herbicide sequences were more effective than single applications.

The study (1991 - 2001) was performed on a gently (2 %) sloping clayey soil of southern Finland, with two replicates of the tillage treatments on 0. 5 ha plots. The annual shares of surface runoff of the total flow (surface runoff + subsurface drainflow) were 842 % for ploughing (depth 2023 cm), 3666 % for shallow autumn stubble cultivation (depth 58 cm) and 3682 % for soil left untilled over winter. Surface runoff increased with decrease in the tillage intensity, and {{in line with the}} values of depressional water storage, macroporosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Erodibility of this gently sloping soil was at highest after autumn and spring tillage operations and decreased with time. Shallow autumn tillage produced erosion as high as mouldboard ploughing (4071700 kg ha 1 yr 1), but 48 % and 12 % lower erosion levels were measured from plots left untilled in autumn, covered by grass or barley residues, respectively. Eroded soil particles moved relatively freely to the subsurface drains, which carried 3794 % of the annual soil losses from the field. The study shows that even on the relatively flat clayey soils typical for southern Finland, tillage has a great influence on soil losses. The frequency of tillage needs to be reduced rather than the depth of tillage on clayey soils with poor water conductivity and structural stability if soil loss is to be diminished by conservation tillage. ...|$|R

Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions in the 1 - 2 month period after <b>autumn</b> or spring <b>ploughing</b> or after sowing were typically between 20 and 150 g N ha- 1 day- 1 and increased with temperature and rainfall. Tillage and sowing operations on previously ploughed soil stimulated N 2 O emissions even several months after ploughing. Cumulative N 2 O emissions were highest (~ 8 kg ha- 1 over 17 months) after late cessation of grazing and late ploughing, and lowest (~ 5. 5 kg ha- 1) after early cessation of grazing and early ploughing. The optimum time of ploughing appears to be midwinter when the cold restricts nitrogen mineralisation, but sufficient nitrogen subsequently becomes available for early spring crop growth and satisfactory N offtake. Restricting tillage operations to cool conditions should help to reduce N 2 O emissions. However, the soil should also be dry enough {{to reduce the risk}} of damage to soil structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experiment}} studying the effects of vinasse (an alcohol industry waste) recycling in agriculture are reported in this work. Vinasse was applied in a durum wheat crop by a trailed vinasse sprayer system compacting about 10 % of the field. The experiment {{was carried out in}} Central Greece, on two soils (a clay and a silty clay loam) with three levels of vinasse rate (one fully covering N requirements of the crop, one covering half the N requirements, the rest covered by chemical fertilizers and a control without vinasse and use only of chemical fertilizers) and three times of application (Summer, <b>Autumn</b> before <b>ploughing</b> and <b>Autumn</b> before drilling). The middle strip of the plots was compacted by three passes of the tractor-trailed vinasse sprayer producing the compacted treatment. During the experiment, the physical and chemical properties of the soil were measured as well as the plant growth and yield. It was found that the compacted plots had higher dry bulk density and soil strength, while vinasse rate and time of application effects were not significant. An increase in N, exchangeable Na +, K + and available Mn was caused by vinasse application. Compaction had a significant effect on plant growth, while vinasse rate and time of application effects were not significant. Yields were affected by weather conditions. In the compacted plots, the yields were generally lower but in the wet years they were also significant. Yields were higher at higher vinasse rates and lower for the application before <b>ploughing</b> in the <b>autumn,</b> indicating an adverse effect of that treatment. The combined analysis of the yields for the four years showed a significant adverse effect of compaction in the clay soil, while in the silty clay loam the effect was not significant. Vinasse application significantly increased yields, while an adverse effect was observed for the applications before ploughing. The work proved the beneficial effects of vinasse recycling as a substitute for chemical fertilizers and the feasibility of using of a spraying system, which compacts only the 10 % of the field, to reduce any adverse economic effect of soil compaction on the crop. © 1999 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} the period 2007 - 2009 in the Uhrusk Experimental Farm (Lublin region) belonging to the University of Life Sciences in Lublin. Different tillage systems - plough and ploughless tillage - were the experimental factors. In the plough tillage system, tillage involved skimming done after the harvest of the forecrop and <b>autumn</b> <b>ploughing.</b> In the ploughless tillage system, only the herbicide Roundup 360 SL (active substance - glyphosate) was applied after the harvest of the forecrop. In both tillage treatments, spring tillage involved field cultivating {{and the use of}} a tillage assembly consisting of a cultivator, cage roller, and harrow. The present experiment evaluated weed infestation of the crop expressed by the number and air-dry weight of weeds and their species composition. Under the conditions of ploughless tillage, air-dry weight of weeds in the spring wheat crop was shown to increase significantly compared to plough tillage. The tillage systems under comparison did not differentiate the number of weeds per 1 m 2. Spring wheat sown using plough tillage was colonized most extensively by the following weed species: Avena fatua L., Stellaria media (L.) Vill., Galium aparine L., Amaranthus retroflexus L., Chenopodium album L., and Consolida regalis Gray. In the ploughless tillage treatments, the following weeds were predominant: Stellaria media (L.)

40|$|Cover crops {{can reduce}} {{leaching}} and erosion, introduce variability into crop rotations and fix nitrogen (N) {{for use by}} the main crops. In Finland, undersowing is a suitable method for establishing cover crops in cereals. The effect of annual undersowing on soil nitrate N was studied at two sites. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), a mixture of red clover and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), and westerwold ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. var. westerwoldicum) were undersown in spring cereals during six successive seasons, and a pure stand of cereal was grown in two years after that. In all years, the soil nitrate N was measured in late autumn, and in addition in different times of the season in last four years. The effect of undersowing on soil NO 3 -N content was generally low, but in one season when conditions favoured high N leaching, westerwold ryegrass decreased soil NO 3 -N. The negligible increase of N leaching risk in connection with undersowing clovers, associated with late <b>autumn</b> <b>ploughing,</b> supports the use of clovers to increase the cereal grain yield. The highest levels of soil NO 3 -N were recorded at sowing in spring irrespective of whether a crop was undersown or not. NO 3 -N contents were higher in sandy soil than in silt. Undersowing can be done annually in cereal cultivation either to fix or catch N. No cumulative effects on soil nitrate N were associated with undersowing after six years. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates Iberian {{communities}} in central Hispania Citerior during the Roman Republic. I demonstrate {{the usefulness of}} an actor-network approach for understanding a topic characterised by scarce archaeological datasets. This approach {{is not intended to}} create a new narrative for Roman Provincial Studies but instead allows us to ask new questions: what was at stake for these communities? What was of interest to the Iberians? How did things happen? Iberians lived primarily in small, often fortified settlements in elevated locations, although some larger settlements are known and during the Republic many sites were abandoned for new locations on flatter ground. I find that throughout the period settlements were often clustered, creating communities distributed in small groups of sites. These Iberian groups grew versatile staple crops in a variety of locations but may have tailored additional crops to regional environmental conditions. I consider the potential for collaboration in the <b>autumn</b> <b>ploughing</b> and conclude that any such collaboration must have relied on dense and wide relationships given changing patterns of variability in rainfall. I show differences within coin circulation that suggest Iberian coins were part of distinct sets of relationships. I also test the ability of carts to pass over various long-distances routes and find that some coins were bound up in the same assemblages as cart transport. The thesis positions the interface between all these different assemblages as crucial to further work on these communities.

40|$|Losses of {{nitrogen}} (N) and phosphorus (P) from perennial grass ley on a fine sand soil were studied with five treatments: no fertilizer (1), cow slurry applied in autumn (2), winter (3) or spring (4), and mineral fertilizer applied in spring (5). For N, the total amounts applied (1992 - 96) were 0, 772, 807, 805 and 510 kg ha- 1 and for P 0, 141, 119, 143 and 107 kg ha- 1, respectively. In {{the first year}} (establishment of the ley, 1992 - 93), N losses (drainage + surface runoff) were slightly higher after application of slurry in <b>autumn</b> (with immediate <b>ploughing,</b> treatment 2) than in treatments 1, 4 and 5 (21 kg ha- 1 vs. 17 kg ha- 1), but the respective P losses (0. 7 - 0. 9 kg ha- 1) were not affected. During the ley years (1993 - 96) the N and P losses were increased by surface application of fertilizers and by abundance of surface runoff (83 - 100 % of the total runoff). Nutrient losses were extremely high after slurry application in autumn and winter, accounting for 11 % and 33 % of the applied N and 17 % and 59 % of the applied P, respectively. The N losses during the ley years from treatments 1 - 5 were 13, 62, 191, 23 and 24 kg ha- 1, where the proportion of NH 4 -N was 21, 49, 56, 33 and 39 %. The respective P losses were 0. 73, 16, 54, 4. 2 and 4. 0 kg ha- 1, where the proportion of PO 4 -P was 52, 85, 77, 68 and 64 %. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{original}} ridge tillage system as {{practiced in the}} US Corn Belt, ridges are formed during the growing season. Several studies have documented that this can reduce leaching of nutrients and improve fertilizer efficiency. This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether ridges formed in autumn can be used as an alternative to ploughing to reduce N leaching during autumn and winter, and thereby increase growth and N uptake of a subsequent unfertilized crop. A factorial field experiment with tillage and residues as factors was conducted during 1998 - 2000. Tillage treatments were <b>autumn</b> ridging and <b>ploughing.</b> Residue treatments were stubble, stubble+straw and stubble+liquid manure {{in order to create a}} gradient of C/N ratios. From the time of harvest until planting of a subsequent barley crop (Hordeum vulgare L.), inorganic N was determined 11 times in 1998 - 1999 and 10 times in 1999 - 2000 in the 0 - 10, 10 - 30, 30 - 60 and 60 - 90 cm soil layers. Growth and N uptake of barley was quantified 9 times in both 1999 and 2000. Barley grain and straw yields were determined. Ridging resulted in lower levels of inorganic N in the 30 - 90 cm soil layer in November and a significantly higher level of inorganic N in the 0 - 30 cm soil layer in late April, indicating reduced leaching and increased N availability for the subsequent crop. Ridging significantly increased growth, yield and N uptake of barley whereas incorporation of straw generally reduced growth, yield and N uptake. It is concluded that ridging in autumn has a N conserving effect and it is suggested that the potential of ridging in autumn as an alternative to ploughing is further investigated in detailed studies of solute movement, N immobiliza-tion/mineralization and crop performance...|$|R
40|$|In organic grain production, weeds {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{limiting}} factors along with crop nitrogen deficiency. Relay intercropping of forage legume cover crops in an established winter cereal crop might be a viable option but is still not well documented, especially under organic conditions. Four species of forage legumes (Medicago lupulina, Medicago sativa, Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens) were undersown in six organic wheat fields. The density and aerial dry matter of wheat, relay-intercropped legumes and weeds were monitored during wheat-legume relay intercropping and after wheat harvest until late <b>autumn,</b> before the <b>ploughing</b> of cover crops. Our results showed a large diversity of aerial growth of weeds depending on soil, climate and wheat development. The dynamics of the legume cover crops were highly different between species and cropping periods (during relay intercropping and after wheat harvest). For instance, T. repens was two times less developed than the other species during relay intercropping while obtaining the highest aerial dry matter in late autumn. During the relay intercropping period, forage legume cover crops were only efficient in controlling weed density in comparison with wheat sole crop. The control of the aerial dry matter of weeds {{at the end of the}} relay intercropping period was better explained considering both legumes and wheat biomasses instead of legumes alone. In late autumn, 24 weeks after wheat harvest, weed biomass was largely reduced by the cover crops. Weed density and biomass reductions were correlated with cover crop biomass at wheat harvest and in late autumn. The presence of a cover crop also exhibited another positive effect by decreasing the density of spring-germinating annual weeds during the relay intercropping period. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
