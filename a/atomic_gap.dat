40|$|We {{supplement}} (and critically overview) {{the existing}} extensive analysis of antiferromagnetic {{solution for the}} Hubbard model with a detailed discussion of two specific features, namely (i) {{the evolution of the}} magnetic (Slater) gap (here renormalized by the electronic correlations) into the Mott-Hubbard or <b>atomic</b> <b>gap,</b> and (ii) a rather weak renormalization of the effective mass by the correlations in the half-filled-band case, which contrasts with that for the paramagnetic case. The mass remains strongly enhanced in the non-halffilled-band case. We also stress the difference between magnetic and nonmagnetic contributions to the gap. These results are discussed within the slave boson approach in the saddle-point approximation, in which there appears a non-linear staggered molecular field due to the electronic correlations that leads to the appearance of the magnetic gap. They reproduce correctly the ground-state energy in the limit of strong correlations. A brief comparison with the solution in the limit of infinite dimensions and 1 the corresponding situation in the doubly-degenerate-band case with one electron per atom is also made. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I report on {{experiments}} on the quantum dynamics of matter waves in a onedimensional lattice potential. A 87 Rb Bose-Einstein condensates is prepared in a one-dimensional waveguide {{in the lowest}} band of a superimposed optical lattice potential. The action of a weak lattice potential allows to modify the linear wave dispersion. We realized dispersion management by switching from normal to anomalous dispersion during the evolution. In this way the initial expansion of a wave packet is reversed to a compression and thus the effective spreading can be suppressed. By preparing a BEC at the Brillouin zone edge, we observed bright <b>atomic</b> <b>gap</b> solitons – non-spreading wave packets. They form, if the atom number and the lattice potential depth is tuned such {{that the effect of}} the repulsive atomic interaction and the anomalous dispersion cancel. For deep lattice potentials our system is described by a discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation, whose dynamics is determined by the tunneling between adjacent lattice sites and the nonlinear phase evolution. In the main part of this thesis I report on the first experimental observation of nonlinear self-trapping for matter waves. The transition from the diffusive regime, characterized by an continuous expansion of the condensate, to the self-trapping regime is accomplished by increasing the atomic density. Due to the corresponding increase of the repulsive atomic interaction the initial expansion stops and the width of the wave packet remains finite. The comparison with a numerical analysis reveals that the effect is due to an inhibition of the site-to-site tunneling induced by the nonlinear phase evolution...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{numerical}} solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation {{for either}} {{one or two}} active electrons, we propose a method for observing instantaneous level shifts in an oscillating strong infrared (IR) field in time, using a single tunable attosecond pulse to probe excited states of the perturbed atom. The ionization probability in the combined fields depends on both, {{the frequency of the}} attosecond pulse and the time delay between both pulses, since the IR field shifts excited energy levels into and out of resonance with the attosecond probe pulse. We show that this method (i) allows the detection of instantaneous <b>atomic</b> energy <b>gaps</b> with sub-laser-cycle time resolution and (ii) can be applied as an ultrafast gate for more complex processes such as non-sequential double-ionization...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} theoretical analysis of methods to manipulate {{and control the}} momentum state of coherent matter waves. Of particular interest is the coherent acceleration of a quantum-degenerate atomic system, which, as {{a direct consequence of}} the form of the de Broglie wavelength, results in tunable source of matter waves. Such sources are of considerable importance for a number of potential applications in the field of atom optics, including the development of highly sensitive gyroscopes, accelerometers, gravity gradiometers or atom lithography and holography, as well as for potential uses in integrated atom optics. Our basic setup consists of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a moving optical lattice created by a pair of frequency-chirped counterpropagating laser beams acting as a "conveyor belt'' for ultracold atoms. Whereas the acceleration of ultracold but non-condensed atoms in such a lattice was demonstrated earlier, we extend this scheme to the case of Bose-Einstein condensates. As a first step, we investigate the acceleration efficiency for various acceleration rates and nonlinear interaction strengths. We find parameter regimes where efficient acceleration is possible, i. e. all atoms are accelerated to the same velocity and the initially sharp momentum distribution and thus its monochromaticity is preserved. However, in general we identify switch-on effects of the lattice, dynamical loss and nonlinear effects to be responsible for deterioration of the monochromaticity of the condensate: On the one hand, switch-on effects and dynamical loss induce a coupling of the initially populated momentum mode to other modes, thereby distributing the momentum over several modes. On the other hand, the nonlinear release of mean field energy during the acceleration process causes the mode profile itself to broaden, also leading to a contamination of the initial monochromaticity. As a second step, we discuss ways to improve this scheme by removing the restriction of constant accelerations. We employ genetic algorithms to optimize the time-dependent motion of the lattice. We show that with such flexibility, it is possible to achieve a fast and highly efficient coherent acceleration of condensates, even when mean-field effects cannot be neglected. The same scheme also enables the creation of arbitrary coherent superposition states in momentum space. The technique is thus suitable for building highly efficient momentum state beam splitters. In addition to simply accelerating condensates, it is desirable for many potential applications to transport atomic wave packets without dispersion over large distances. This can be achieved by launching bright atomic solitons, where the effects of the nonlinearity counterbalance the dispersion. Placing a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions in a lattice, one can create a negative effective mass. Under these circumstances bright and stable soliton solutions exist, so-called gap solitons. After a careful analysis of the soliton properties, we use the tools we developed for condensate acceleration and demonstrate two feasible schemes to excite the solitons. Experimental data released after publication of our results demonstrating the acceleration of Bose-Einstein condensates in moving lattices and the very recent observation of <b>atomic</b> <b>gap</b> solitons indicates that our theoretical analysis was timely and indeed experimentally feasible. As an outlook, we briefly comment on a new direction in the field of atom optics that holds promise for future applications: the use of quantum degenerate Fermi gases. In atomic as well as in optical physics one often encounters situations where there exists a coupling between several modes of a system. Here, we illustrate the "toy model'' of a fermionic coupler where transitions between two internal states are induced by Raman coupling. Due to Fermi statistics and interatomic interactions, this is a simple example of a nonlinear multimode coupler. Investigation of this system consisting of only a few fermions already clearly illustrates the basic differences between bosonic and fermionic dynamics and sheds light on the role of two-body collisions. Understanding the basic mechanisms of this system is a first step towards more sophisticated coherent control of fermionic systems...|$|E

It was shown recently that an exotic topological superradiant state {{exists in a}} two-component degenerate Fermi gas coupled to a cavity, where local order parameters coexist with global topological invariants. In this work, we characterize in detail various properties of this exotic state, focusing on the feedback interactions between the atoms and the cavity field. In particular, we demonstrate that cavity-induced interband coupling {{plays a crucial role}} in inducing the topological phase transition between the conventional and topological superradiant states. We analyze the interesting signatures in the cavity field left by the closing and reopening of the <b>atomic</b> bulk <b>gap</b> across the topological phase boundary and discuss the robustness of the topological superradiant state by investigating the steady-state phase diagram under various conditions. Furthermore, we consider the interaction effect and discuss the interplay between the pairing order in atomic ensembles and the superradiance of the cavity mode.

These had contained page images from the cover of Nanotechnology, Vol. 21, Nov 2010 and its corresponding web alertDifferent types of thin metal films and oxide materials are studied for their potential application in nanoelectronics: gold and copper films, nickel nanoelectrodes, oxide nanograin superconductors, carboxyl ferromagnetic microspheres and graphene oxide flakes. The crystallization and surface morphology of gold and copper films on SiO 2 /Si substrates is investigated as a function of annealing temperature. Annealing arranges the Au crystallites in the [111] direction and changes the morphology of the surface. Relaxation of the Au layer at high temperatures is responsible for the initial stages of cluster formation. These may form at disordered points on the surface and become islands when the temperature is increased. In the case of Cu/SiO 2 /Si films, oxides are formed after thermal oxidation at different temperatures up to 1000 °C. The phase evolution Cu -> Cu + Cu 2 O -> Cu 2 O -> Cu 2 O + CuO -> CuO is detected. Pure Cu 2 O films are obtained at 200 °C, whereas uniform CuO films without structural surface defects are obtained in the temperature range 300 - 550 °C. A resistivity phase diagram, which is obtained from the current-voltage response of the copper oxides, is presented. In the case of thin nickel films, the necessary reagents, conditions and processes required to obtain nano and <b>atomic</b> <b>gaps</b> between soft and clean nickel electrodes are described by using a conventional electrochemical cell. Current-voltage characteristics are also presented to evaluate possible applications of the nanogap electrodes in electronic nanodevices. In addition to the metal surfaces, oxides materials such as the superconductor LaCaBaCu 3 O 7 (La 1113), carboxyl ferromagnetic microparticles and graphene oxide flakes are studied. La 1113 is a high critical temperature superconductor with TC(onset) = 80 K and its structure is similar to the tetragonal YBCO. This thesis explores the attachment of La 1113 nanograins on Au(111) surfaces through selfassembled monolayers of HS-C 8 H 16 -HS [octane (di) thiol] for their potential application in nanotransistors. It is found that La 1113 particles (100 nm mean diameter) can be functionalized by octane (di) thiol without affecting their superconducting critical temperature (TC = 80 K). A design for a superconducting transistor fabricated by immobilized La 1113 nanograins in between two gold electrodes which could be controlled by an external magnetic field gate is suggested. Furthermore, the mechanical reorientation of thiolated ferromagnetic microspheres bridging a pair of gold electrodes under an external magnetic field is studied. Finally, a flexible film made of graphene oxide flakes is prepared and characterized by X ray diffraction. It is achieved by the chemical oxidation of commercial graphite and the subsequent reaction with NaOH. It is found that the interlayer distance between graphene increases upon oxidation due to the formation of chemical groups and results in the delamination and flexibility of the flakes.

30|$|RCNT/CNT is {{affected}} by the chirality of CNTs, the interface area, the gap between CNTs, and the interface imperfections [21, 22]. It is now common knowledge that the properties of the CNTs within the CNT bump cannot be identical and that each CNT varies in terms of diameters and chirality. However, the work functions for CNTs are identical as they share the same graphene band structure [21]. For MWCNTs, majority of the current only passes through the outermost layer of MWCNTs, and a metallic behavior is expected [23]. Even if the MWCNT is not metallic, the bandgap of semiconducting CNTs can be estimated as E g = 0.9 eV/diameter, approximating a bandgap of 9 meV for a CNT diameter of 100 nm [16]. In this case, the Fermi level of the CNT in contact with another CNT will align within the bandgap of the semiconducting CNT. The resulting band structures have a negligible Schottky barrier height due to the small bandgap. Thus, the metal-to-CNT and CNT-to-CNT interfaces are similar to the metal-to-metal junctions. The major transport mechanism for electron transport is through tunneling across <b>atomic</b> thick air <b>gap,</b> resulting in an ohmic and linear I-V behavior observed in Figure 6 a[22].|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of a metal oxide catalyst was investigated by an integrated approach, combining a variety of surface science techniques in ultrahigh vacuum with batch reactor conversion measurements at high gas pressures. Epitaxial FeO(111), Fe 3 O 4 (111) and a?Fe 2 O 3 (0001) films with defined atomic surface structures were used as model catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, a practized selective oxidation reaction performed over iron oxide based catalysts {{in the presence of}} steam. Ethylbenzene and styrene adsorb onto regular terrace sites with their phenyl rings oriented parallel to the surface, where the p-electron systems interact with Lewis acidic iron sites exposed on Fe 3 O 4 (111) and a?Fe 2 O 3 (0001). The reactant adsorption energies observed on these films correlate with their catalytic activities at high pressures, which indicates that the surface chemical properties do not change significantly across the pressure <b>gap.</b> <b>Atomic</b> defects were identified as catalytically active sites. Based on the surface spectroscopy results a new mechanism was proposed for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, where the upward tilted ethylgroup of flat adsorbed ethylbenzene is dehydrogenated at Brønsted basic oxygen sites located at defects and the coupling of the phenyl ring to Fe 3 + terrace sites determines the reactant adsorption-desorption kinetics. The findings are compared to kinetic measurements over polycrystalline catalyst samples, and an extrapolation of the reaction mechanism found on the model systems to technical catalysts operating under real conditions is discussed.

40|$|We report our first-principles {{investigations}} {{on three}} polytypes of BaTiO 3 (BTO) : a paraelectric phase with cubic Pm- 3 m structure and two ferroelectric (FE) phases with tetragonal P 4 mm and rhombohedral R 3 m structures. We compared the structural and the electrical properties of BTO obtained by using various approaches: e. g., the Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, the density functional theory (DFT) {{with the local}} density approximation (LDA) or with the two generalized gradient approximations (two GGAs: PWGGA and PBE), and three hybrid functionals of the HF and the DFT (B 3 LYP, B 3 PW, and PBE 0). For the P 4 mm structure, the two GGAs and the hybrid functionals reproduced the cell volumes, but slightly overestimated the c/a ratio. The hybrid functionals provided accurate predictions for the experimental energy gaps, but slightly underestimated the experimental dielectric constants. The calculated dielectric constants were inversely proportional to the c/a ratios for the P 4 mm structure (or the cH/aH ratio for the R 3 m structure), irrespective of the functional choice. Also, the over-estimated polarization could be ascribed to a super-tetragonality in the GGA/hybrid functionals. The pressure dependences for the cell parameters, fractional <b>atomic</b> displacements, energy <b>gaps,</b> dielectric constants, and FE polarizations were calculated by using the B 3 PW hybrid functional. As pressure was increased, the polarization decreased monotonically until it reached zero at a critical pressure of ~ 20 GPa for both the P 4 mm and the R 3 m structures.

40|$|Nano-antennas are an {{emerging}} concept for the manipulation {{and control of}} optical fields at the sub-wavelength scale. In analogy to their radio- and micro-wave counterparts they provide an efficient link between propagating and localized fields. Antennas operating at optical frequencies are typically {{on the order of}} a few hundred nanometer in size and are fabricated from noble metals. Upon excitation with an external field the electron gas inside the antenna can respond resonantly, if the dimensions of the antenna are chosen appropriate. Consequently, the resonance wavelength depends on the antenna dimensions. The electron-density oscillation is a hybrid state of electron and photon and is called a localized plasmon resonance. The oscillating currents within the antenna constitute a source for enhanced optical near-fields, which are strongly localized at the metal surface. A particular interesting type of antennas are pairs of metal particles separated by a small insulating gap. For anti-symmetric gap modes charges of opposite sign reside across the gap. The dominating field-components are normal to the metal surface and due to the boundary conditions they are sizable only inside the gap. The attractive Coulomb interaction increases the surface-charge accumulation at the gap and enhanced optical fields occur within the insulating gap. The Coulomb interaction increases with decreasing gap size and extreme localization and strongest intensity enhancement is expected for small gap sizes. In this thesis optical antennas with extremely small gaps, just slightly larger than inter-atomic distances, are investigated by means of optical and electrical excitation. In the case of electrical excitation electron tunneling across the antenna gap is exploited. At the beginning of this thesis little was known about the optical properties of antennas with <b>atomic</b> scale <b>gaps.</b> Standard measurement techniques of field confinement and enhancement involving well-separated source, sample and detector are not applicable at atomic length-scales due to the interaction of the respective elements. Here, an elegant approach has been found. It is {{based on the fact that}} for closely-spaced metallic particles the energy splitting of a hybridized mode pair, consisting of symmetric and anti-symmetric mode, provides a direct measure for the Coulomb interaction over the gap. Gap antennas therefore possess an internal ruler which sensitively reports the size of the gap. Upon self-assembly side-by-side aligned nanorods with gap sizes ranging from 2 to 0. 5 nm could be obtained. These antennas exhibit various symmetric and anti-symmetric modes in the visible range. In order to reveal optical modes of all symmetries a novel scattering setup has been developed and is successfully applied. Careful analysis of the optical spectra and comparison to numerical simulations suggests that extreme field confinement and localization can occur in gaps down to 0. 5 nm. This is possibly the limit of plasmonic enhancement since for smaller gaps electron tunneling as well as non-locality of the dielectric function affect plasmonic resonances. The strongly confined and intense optical fields provided by atomic-scale gaps are ideally suited for enhanced light-matter interaction. The interplay of intense optical-frequency fields and static electric fields or currents is of great interest for opto-electronic applications. In this thesis a concept has been developed, which allows for the electrical connection of optical antennas. By means of numerical simulations the concept was first verified for antennas with gap sizes on the order of 25 nm. It could be shown, that by attaching the leads at positions of a field minimum the resonant properties are nearly undisturbed. The resonance wavelengths shift only by a small amount with respect to isolated antennas and the numerically calculated near-field intensity enhancement is about 1000, which is just slightly lower than for an unconnected antenna. The antennas are fabricated from single-crystalline gold and exhibit superior optical and electrical properties. In particular, the conductivity is a factor of 4 larger with respect to multi-crystalline material, the resistance of the gap is as large as 1 TOhm and electric fields of at least 10 ^ 8 V/m can be continuously applied without damage. Optical scattering spectra reveal well-pronounced and tunable antenna resonances, which demonstrates the concept of electrically-connected antennas also experimentally. By combining atomic-scale gaps and electrically-connected optical antennas a novel sub-wavelength photon source has been realized. To this end an antenna featuring an <b>atomic</b> scale <b>gap</b> is electrically driven by quantum tunneling across the antenna gap. The optical frequency components of this fluctuating current are efficiently converted to photons by the antenna. Consequently, light generation and control are integrated into a planar single-material nano-structure. Tunneling junctions are realized by positioning gold nanoparticles into the antenna <b>gap,</b> using an <b>atomic</b> force microscope. The presence of a stable tunneling junction between antenna and particle is demonstrated by measuring its distinct current-voltage characteristic. A DC voltage is applied to the junction and photons are generated by inelastically tunneling electrons via the enhanced local density of photonic states provided by the antenna resonance. The polarization of the emitted light is found to be along the antenna axis and the directivity is given by the dipolar antenna mode. By comparing electroluminescence and scattering spectra of different antennas, it has been shown that the spectrum of the generated light is determined by the geometry of the antenna. Moreover, the light generation process is enhanced by two orders of magnitude with respect to a non-resonant structure. The controlled fabrication of the presented single-crystalline structures has not only pushed the frontiers of nano-technology, but the extreme confinement and enhancement of optical fields as well as the light generation by tunneling electrons lays a groundwork for a variety of fundamental studies and applications. Field localization down to the (sub-) nanometer scale is a prerequisite for optical spectroscopy with near-atomic resolution. Indeed, recently first pioneering experiments have achieved molecular resolution exploiting plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering. The small modal volume of antennas with atomic-scale gaps can lead to light-matter interaction in the strong coupling regime. Quantum electro-dynamical effects such as Rabi splitting or oscillations are likely when a single emitter is placed into resonant structures with atomic-scale gaps. The concept of electrically-connected optical antennas is expected to be widely applied within the emerging field of electro-plasmonics. The sub-wavelength photon source developed during this thesis will likely gain attention for future plasmonic nanocircuits. It is envisioned that in such a circuit the optical signal provided by the source is processed at ultrafast speed and nanometer-scales on the chip and is finally converted back into an electronic signal. An integrated optical transistor could be realized by means of photon-assisted tunneling. Moreover, it would be interesting to investigate, if it is possible to imprint the fermionic nature of electrons onto photons in order to realize an electrically-driven source of single photons. Non-classical light sources with the potential for on-chip integration could be built from electrically-connected antennas and are of great interest for quantum communication. To this end single emitters could be placed in the antenna gap or single electron tunneling could be achieved by means of a single-channel quantum point contact or the Coulomb-blockade effect. Nanoantennen sind ein zukunftweisendes Konzept für die Manipulation und Kontrolle von optischen Feldern auf der Subwellenlängen-Skala. Analog zu Radio- und Mikrowellenantennen können sie auf effiziente Weise propagierende und lokalisierte Felder ineinander umwandeln. Optische Antennen sind typischerweise nur einige hundert Nanometer groß und werden aus Edelmetallen hergestellt. Besitzt die Antenne passende geometrische Maße, kann das Elektronengas durch Anregung mit einem externen Feld in resonante Schwingungen versetzt werden. Die Resonanzwellenlänge ist somit durch die Antennengeometrie bestimmt. Die Elektronendichte-Schwingung ist ein Hybridzustand aus Elektron und Photon und wird lokalisierte Plasmonenresonanz genannt. Wird die Resonanz angeregt so kommt es zu oszillierenden Strömen, welche eine Quelle für verstärkte optische Nahfelder darstellen. Diese Felder sind an die Metalloberfläche gebunden und daher stark lokalisiert. Eine besonders interessante Antennengeometrie ist ein Paar von Metallpartikeln, die durch einen schmalen Spalt getrennt sind. Antisymmetrische Antennenmoden besitzen Ladungen mit entgegengesetzten Vorzeichen auf der jeweiligen Seite des Spalts. Die dominierenden elektrischen Felder stehen senkrecht zur Metalloberfläche und sind aufgrund der elektromagnetischen Randbedingungen hauptsächlich im Antennenspalt lokalisiert. Bei anti-symmetrischen Moden verstärkt die Coulombanziehung die Landungsträgerdichte in der Nähe des Spalts und es treten verstärkte optische Nahfelder zwischen den zwei Antennenarmen auf. Die Coulombwechselwirkung nimmt mit kleiner werdendem Abstand zu und für Strukturen mit sehr kleinem Abstand ist eine sehr große Feldverstärkung und eine sehr starke Lokalisation zu erwarten. In dieser Dissertation wurden optische Antennen untersucht, deren zwei Antennenarme durch einen extrem schmalen Spalt in der Größenordnung von interatomaren Abständen getrennt sind. Eigenmoden der Antennen werden durch zwei fundamental verschiedene Mechanismen anregt: Entweder durch optische Anregung oder durch das Anlegen einer elektrischen Gleichspannung. Bei der zweiten|$|R
