William Chappell excavated the money pit in 1931 by sinking a 163 ft shaft 12 × 14 feet to the southwest of what he believed {{was the site of}} the 1897 shaft which was close to the original pit. At 127 ft, a number of artifacts, including an axe, an <b>anchor</b> <b>fluke,</b> and a pick, were found. The pick was identified as a Cornish miner's poll pick, but by this time the entire area around the money Pit was littered with the debris and refuse of numerous prior excavation attempts which made finding the owner undeterminable.|$|E
40|$|Sustainable energy {{produced}} by offshore wind will likely increase as technology moves into deeper water. With increasing water depth, floating substructures {{may become the}} most economical and viable means for deploying offshore wind turbines, and thus require a greater reliance on anchoring systems. A green anchor concept called the “flying wing anchor” is currently in development to provide high vertical load capacity, and minimize {{the amount of energy}} needed to transport, install, and recover it from the seabed. Conceptually, the anchor is dynamically installed vertically through free-fall penetration, where the anchor will then rotate and dive into a position that is near normal to the anchor line in response to the service loads imposed by the offshore floating structure. To aid in the development of this novel anchor concept, an experimental program was conducted on scale-model anchors under 1 g acceleration in a rigid sand-filled tank. ^ Chapter 1 describes a novel laboratory approach to measure the strength (i. e. friction angle) at very low confining pressures, typical of 1 g physical model experiments. A simple tilt method is proposed to capture the peak friction angle at very low confining pressures, and then combined with conventional triaxial results to calibrate a modified stress-dilatancy relationship. The results of the tilt method indicate adequate and rational estimates of friction angle at very low stresses, and show to predict the critical state friction angle of the test sands within 1 % to 3 %. Furthermore, the modified stress-dilatancy relationship minimizes the asymptotic nature of the standard relationship at very low confining pressures by adding a second logarithmic term. Chapter 2 presents an experimental and analytical study carried out in the same sand to investigate the effect of anchor shape on the pullout capacity of horizontal plate anchors. The experimental results indicate a difference in normalized capacity over a range of embedment depth with respect to shape. Circular anchors produced consistently larger capacities relative to square anchors, and with increasing embedment depth, circular, equilateral triangular, and kite anchors become comparable within 5 %. The proposed analytical model predicted the pullout capacity within 10 % for circular plates, and within, on average, 30 % for the remaining shapes at shallow embedment depths. ^ Chapter 3 presents a physical model study to identify the anchor shapes that have the most effective dive performance, and to investigate the effects of initial embedment depth, loading line location, initial fluke orientation, and loading line angle on the dive trajectory. The results indicate that the dive performance of a simple kite plate anchor can be optimized when the loading line is attached at or near the anchor centroid at an initial fluke orientation of 10 degrees relative to the horizontal. This configuration has results in an additional 1. 5 fluke lengths of embedment with no indication of pull out. Lastly, Chapter 4 presents an experimental study of the soil-anchor interaction during drag embedment. The capacity in the normal and shear (i. e. parallel to the <b>anchor</b> <b>fluke)</b> direction will control the trajectory and thus {{it is important to understand}} if the presence of one component of the mooring line force in one direction influences the resistance in the other direction. The resistance and kinematics of a simple kite-shaped plate anchor is measured under pure normal, shear, and rotational loading, and compared to force components acting on the anchor that were extracted from the previous dive trajectory experiments. The results suggest there is minimal interaction between the normal and shear components acting on a simple fluke during dive trajectory in sand. Thus, the trajectory may be easily modeled with no adjustment to the resistance in either failure mode. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of {{thickened}} oil thermal recovery, the pre-stress cementing needs to be anchored {{at the bottom of}} the casing pipe. And the reliable opening and closing of <b>anchor</b> <b>flukes</b> directly influence the anchoring. In allusion to the problems of how to get the critical value of drilling fluid flow rate of when the <b>anchor</b> <b>flukes</b> begin to open, completely open, begin to close and completely close, whether different nozzles can open or close reliably, getting the corresponding differential pressure and discharge coefficient of the different nozzles, this paper conducts a study from both theory and experiment to obtain the relevant parameters. By simulating the anchor in actual work and dealing with the data, we conclude that: (1) The fluke can open smoothly when the flow rate reaches a certain flow and it can also close smoothly when the flow rate declines. (2) The critical flow rate of the flukes, when two kinds of anchors are with different nozzles, has been acquired. (3) Corresponding differential pressure and discharge coefficient of the different nozzles in different flow rate have been ascertained...|$|R

After embedment, the central shaft is retrieved leaving the <b>anchor</b> <b>flukes</b> vertically embedded in the seabed. The flukes constitute the load bearing element as a plate anchor. This paper presents and considers field data on the embedment depth loss due to the plate anchor keying process and the subsequent bearing capacity factor of the plate anchor element. The loss in plate anchor embedment {{was significantly higher than}} that reported from corresponding centrifuge tests and is reflected in the larger padeye displacements required to mobilize peak capacity in the field tests. Measured plate capacities and plate rotations during keying indicate that the end of keying coincides with the peak anchor capacity. Experimental bearing capacity factors are in the range Nc = 14. 3 – 14. 6, which is appreciably higher than existing solutions for vanishingly thin circular plates. The higher Nc for the DEPLA is considered to be due to a combination of the cruciform fluke arrangement and the fluke (or plate) thickness...|$|R

The experimental work includes geotechnical centrifuge modelling and field tests using three different reduced anchor scales, whereas the numerical work focused on investigating anchor capacity for a rage of geometries, embedment depths and seabed conditions. The experimental work indicates that expected tip embedments are in the range 2 to 3. 3 times the anchor length and depend on the impact velocity, anchor mass and shear strength of the soil. As with other plate anchors, the anchor needs to key before maximum capacity can be mobilised. Both the centrifuge and field experiments show that this keying and pullout behaviour is typical of other vertically installed plate anchors, where the main issue is the loss in embedment during keying. Both the experimental and numerical studies showed that the capacity of the DEPLA is much higher than that of other dynamically installed anchors with capacities up to 40 times the dry weight of the plate and plate bearing capacity factors of about 15...|$|R
