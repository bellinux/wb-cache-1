50|$|Aniline leather {{is a type}} {{of leather}} dyed {{exclusively}} with soluble dyes without covering the surface with a topcoat paint or insoluble pigments. The resulting product retains the hide's natural surface with the 'grain', i.e. visible pores, scars etc. of the complete original animal's skin structure. For this reason, aniline leather {{is one of the most}} precious finishes in leather manufacturing: only high quality leathers are suitable for <b>aniline</b> <b>finishing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{repeated}} stroking of {{the leather}} smooths and compresses {{the surface and}} raises various color tones. Heat generated by friction during the glazing process can darken and harden the <b>aniline</b> <b>finish</b> of the leather, and can raise oils in the leather to the surface. Because no pigment is used, the porous structure of the leather remains visible, providing a depth to its appearance. The operator of the glazing jack can control the surface finish by varying {{the pressure of the}} tool and the number of strokes applied.|$|R
40|$|In {{the leather}} industry, {{there are many}} {{different}} types of finish, i. e. two-tone, transparent, semi aniline and opaque/solid color. The composition formulation of each finish type is different so each will impact not only on the performance but also on the properties of the finished leather. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of <b>finish</b> type (natural, <b>aniline,</b> semi-aniline, and two-tone) on permeability and organoleptic properties of python skin finished leather. This research focused on the finishing process with various finish types. The results showed that the effect of semi-aniline (I,II) finish type on water vapor permeability reduction is the highest when compared with natural (I, II); aniline (I,II) and two-tone finish types. Otherwise, the effect of semi-aniline (I,II) finish type on organoleptic properties is the lowest compared with natural (I, II); aniline (I,II) and two-tone <b>finish</b> types. The <b>aniline</b> I <b>finish</b> type has better organoleptic properties...|$|R
