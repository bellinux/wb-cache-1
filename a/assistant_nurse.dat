5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an <b>assistant</b> <b>nurse</b> {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E
5|$|During {{a family}} {{vacation}} to New York when Lawrence was 14, she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for agents. Lawrence's mother was not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career, but briefly moved {{to the city to}} let her read for roles. After Lawrence's first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult as she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mother agreed to let her pursue acting on the condition that she graduate from high school. Lawrence was eventually home-schooled in Los Angeles, and graduated two years early with good grades. Considering acting to be a natural fit for her, she turned down several offers for modelling assignments at the time. Between her acting jobs in the city, she made regular visits to Louisville, during which she served as an <b>assistant</b> <b>nurse</b> at her mother's camp.|$|E

The <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> complained of deficiencies in care of the elderly, which ought to be correlated with the structure of partial shifts and the lack of energy and patience that brings with it. On the other hand some participants could find positive aspects of partial shifts regarding time to rest and be there for the caretakers. The impact of the private life was palpable, and despite some aspects to have time to rest, the work-life balance was hard to fulfill and all <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> with schedules containing partial shifts on the weekdays wanted a schedule without it. ...|$|R

40|$|Educational {{investments}} {{may serve}} several purposes. They {{can be carried}} out in order to increase the students’ knowledge within a specific discipline, but also to increase the level of knowledge within an organization. ’Silviahemmet’ in Stockholm, which was inaugurated in the year of 1996, had as one of its objectives to become a school for education of <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> working in the area of dementia care. The educational program had the aim to educate <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> to become supervisors in dementia care, the <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> should acquire an edge competence in the close care of patients with dementia. This educational investment has been investigated in order to study the significance an educational investment may have for a health care organization in which some of the health care personnel has participated in an education and moreover, to study how this knowledge is communicated within the organization. Thus, the overall purpose of my study is to describe and analyse the significance an educational investment is given, by the participating <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> as well as by other health care personnel. The study was carried out during the year 2005 and concerned <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> educated in the years between 1996 and 2001. Four different data gathering techniques were used; questionnaires, interviews, observations at two workplaces and conversations with health care personnel. The questionnaire concerned all 34 <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> who had participated in specialist training in dementia care during this period. Seven persons were interviewed. Summing up my results, the knowledge that the <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> have achieved from the education is theoretical and social knowledge of dementia. This constituted a platform to stand on for the <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> in their work when meeting the patient An important result of the study, concerning the importance of the <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> specialist training for other categories of health care personnel, is the lack of verbal communication between personnel categories that seems to be at hand. Furthermore, dialogues or shared reflections among the personnel could not be noticed. Often it was solely one-way communication that existed on the wards. A knowledge creating dialogue was missing. Questions were asked, but only regarding about "what" and "when" a work task should be performed, not "why" something should be carried out. An obstacle regarding the communication of new knowledge appears to be the gap existing between an educational investment and the everyday reality of the health care organization. The result of the study shows the importance of adopting the theoretical knowledge to the reality that the health care personnel is facing. Other obstacles seem to be status and hierarchies. The study showed that the <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> working hours did not allow for educating health care personnel in dementia. There ought to be possibilities within the organization to make space for the use and communication of new knowledge through the supervising of health care personnel caring for elderly with dementia. This in turn may lead to better health care for elderly. This supervision could {{take the form of a}} dialogue and shared reflections concerning the patients and their need of health care. Keywords: Educational investment, learning, health professionals, elderly care, communication. The theory and the meeting with the patient in practice formed an overall understanding and knowledge regarding all dimensions of dementia. The education also resulted in a strengthened self-confidence of the participants. The feeling of confidence in the newly acquired knowledge seems to have contributed to a professional development. Further, it proved to take time for the <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> to enter their new role as specialists within dementia care. It was revealed that they did not get enough time from their employer to educate the health care personnel. Moreover, it was not easy to return to the old workplace, especially regarding the relation to old working colleagues and <b>nurses.</b> The <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> described this as a feeling that they had to balance their comportment on the wards in order not to take up too much space...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{workplace}} health promotion, {{all potential}} resources {{needs to be}} taken into consideration, not only factors relating to the absence of injury and the physical health of the workers, but also psychological aspects. A dynamic balance between the resources of the individual employees and the demands of work is an important prerequisite. In the home care services, there is a noticeable trend towards increased psychosocial strain on employees at work. There are a high frequency of work-related musculoskeletal disorders and injuries, and a low prevalence of sustainable work ability. The aim of this research was to identify factors promoting work ability and self-efficacy in care aides and <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> within home care services. Methods This study is based on cross-sectional data collected in a municipality in northern Sweden. Care aides (n = 58) and <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> (n = 79) replied to a self-administered questionnaire (response rate 46 %). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the influence of several independent variables on self-efficacy (model 1) and work ability (model 2) for care aides and <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> separately. Results Perceptions of personal safety, self-efficacy and musculoskeletal wellbeing contributed to work ability for <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> (R 2 adj of 0. 36, p 2 adj of 0. 29, p = 0. 001). Self-efficacy was associated with the safety climate and the physical demands of the job in both professions (R 2 adj of 0. 24, p = 0. 003 for care aides), and also by sex and age for the <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> (R 2 adj of 0. 31, p Conclusions The intermediate factors contributed differently to work ability in the two professions. Self-efficacy, personal safety and musculoskeletal wellbeing were important for the <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses,</b> while the work ability of the care aides was associated with the safety climate, but also with the non-changeable factors age and seniority. All these factors are important to acknowledge in practice and in further research. Proactive workplace interventions need to focus on potentially modifiable factors such as self-efficacy, safety climate, physical job demands and musculoskeletal wellbeing. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} among 100 <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> working in six different residential home.

In order to fulfill my purpose, I have chosen to use three questions: Have the period of employment in the workplace any impact on how the <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> experience the psychosocial work environment? In the future it will become a lack of staff in elderly care. How do those working in elderly care today feel about the future? How important are the manager and colleagues for how <b>assistant</b> <b>nurses</b> are experiencing the psychosocial work environment? In order to answer the questions a quantitative method and a questionnaire has been used. The results were analyzed using SPSS and presented in the form of frequency tables, cross tabulations, chi square test and the sperman rho test. The results showed that the period of employment did not had an impact on the staffs´ experience of the psychosocial work environment. But what proved to be important was whether they felt their work as stressful. Where those who have worked between 3 - 10 years felt that the duties were more stressful than those with a shorter or longer period of employment. ...|$|R
