5|$|Nick calls Norah, {{apologizing for}} leaving, and she agrees {{to meet him}} again. Deciding to go somewhere where no one they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play {{something}} {{he wrote in the}} studio, but then joins him in the recording room. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care <b>about</b> <b>missing</b> the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E

Johnson, who later published The Poems of Emily Dickinson, {{was able to}} date only five of Dickinson's poems before 1858. Two of these are mock valentines done in an ornate and humorous style, and two others are conventional lyrics, {{one of which is}} <b>about</b> <b>missing</b> her brother Austin.

500|$|Twyne studied manuscripts at the Bodleian Library, {{founded by}} Thomas Bodley in 1602. Thomas Twyne, his father, gave books to the library.

However, Twyne was displeased with the work of Thomas James, the first Bodley's Librarian, complaining to the library authorities in November 1613 <b>about</b> <b>missing</b> manuscripts, inaccurate records and delays in accessing new acquisitions, and about the librarian's poor attendance and his habit of scattering his papers around the desks.

500|$|According to Lopez, {{the song}} is <b>about</b> <b>missing</b> someone terribly; [...] "someone who is missing someone so much and has done {{something}} so wrong to the person that they know they can't fix it. So they just hate themselves right in that moment, they can't stand , they regret everything that they did and they wish they could change things." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted the chorus of [...] "Me Haces Falta" [...] to be self-loathing, with the lines: [...] "Tú me haces falta/Sí, me arrepiento/Me odio/Estoy desesperada" [...] (English: [...] "I miss you/Yes, I repent/I hate myself/I'm desperate"). Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly praised the song's lyrics, but dismissed the song's production, stating {{that it does not}} live up the song's [...] "florid, romance-novel lyrics".|$|E
500|$|... "Quinto Piso" [...] {{has been}} {{categorized}} as an analytic song—a prologue to the album holding autobiographical tendencies. [...] "Sin Ti... Sin Mi" [...] is <b>about</b> <b>missing</b> {{someone who has}} left, with analogical lyrics talking about absence of one's beloved person. [...] "El Del Espejo" [...] includes lyrics influenced by [...] "self-criticism" [...] that makes people confront themselves, crafted inside a [...] "rhythmic sound". Lead single [...] "Como Duele" [...] was highly praised. Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic named it Arjona's [...] "biggest hit in years", {{as well as a}} standout track of the album alongside [...] "Sin Ti.. Sin Mi" [...] and [...] "El Del Espejo". El Mercurio Online stated that [...] "Como Duele" [...] is [...] "a ballad of merciless chords and lyrics plagued of contradictions made metaphors." [...] It was also compared to his past song [...] "Olvidarte", from Sin Daños a Terceros.|$|E
500|$|Although {{most modern}} comics are told {{in three to}} six issue [...] "arcs" [...] that form a nearly {{complete}} story, Seeley feels that when several plot points climax at once, it provides readers an easy opportunity to quit reading without feeling dissatisfied <b>about</b> <b>missing</b> the true conclusion. For Revival, he and Norton decided to have new mysteries develop constantly. They had several discussions on the right point to begin the story. Early drafts of the first issue included scenes showing the worldwide response to Revival Day, but they were cut {{to focus on the}} people of Wausau. The creators decided to start the story after [...] "Revival Day" [...] partly because they wanted readers to relate to the cast's confusion, and partly as an homage to old superhero comics that told origin stories as quickly as possible to get to the action. They were inspired by Don DeLillo's novel White Noise, which follows people trying to escape an approaching cloud but no one knows what it actually is.|$|E

500|$|Introduced as a Lothario-type character, {{according}} to Anderson, Oliver [...] "had {{a reputation for}} being the hospital bike." [...] His first relationship developed when he attracted the attention of ward sisters Chrissie Williams and Daisha Anderson. Daisha showed less interest in him than Chrissie, of whose attentiveness Anderson said, [...] "I think any hot-blooded male would find that attractive". Oliver appeared to ruin his chances with Daisha when he encouraged a patient to complain about her diagnosis – though Anderson noted, [...] "he does apologise to Daisha, and sweetly gives her a cupcake". This left Chrissie free to pursue Oliver. Before their relationship began, Anderson opined [...] "She's gorgeous, and Oliver would be a fool not to go out with her." [...] He thought that Oliver and Chrissie's [...] "unflappable" [...] natures made them a good fit for one another, though wondered if they were too alike. As an older woman, their relationship was described as a [...] "toyboy storyline" [...] for Chrissie. Hobley admitted to having fun with the storyline due to the real age gap between herself and Anderson. She described Chrissie's feelings for Oliver, stating: [...] "Chrissie is {{having a lot of fun}} with him. But deep down she's really hoping to find true love – she's been quite unlucky so far. She's not getting any younger and she's worried <b>about</b> <b>missing</b> out on kids." [...] Producers Kyle and McHale revealed that the pair could have been a [...] "perfect match", however said the romance would not run smoothly.|$|E
500|$|On {{realizing that}} NBC was {{switching}} {{away from the}} game, Goodman said to Lindemann by phone, [...] "Where the hell has our football game gone?" [...] During the station break which began with the network announcement, Goodman called a BOC phone to which only he knew the number and which {{was not part of}} NBC's CIrcle-7 exchange (which blew a fuse 26 times in an hour). When Cline answered it, Goodman ordered him {{to go back to the}} game. Although Cline knew there was no way to reconnect the feed, he promised to do the best he could. By the time the game ended at 7:07, thousands of viewers were calling the network to complain <b>about</b> <b>missing</b> the end of the football game. Others called newspapers, television stations, even the New York City Police Department, both to seek the final score, and simply to vent. Humorist Art Buchwald wrote [...] "Men who wouldn't get out of their chairs in an earthquake rushed to the phone to scream obscenities [...]" [...] As people learned of the outcome, some became upset because Ridlehuber's touchdown meant the Raiders had won by more than the point spread of 7, and bets thought to be won were now lost. In Oakland, Gowdy and DeRogatis left the broadcast booth to tell Ellis that the final two minutes were the most exciting they had ever seen. Ellis replied, [...] "It's too bad America didn't see it." [...] Realizing that the original call had been lost, Ellis had the two sportscasters re-create their descriptions of the two Raider touchdowns on tape.|$|E
500|$|The Secret of Monkey Island was {{the fifth}} Lucasfilm Games project powered by the SCUMM engine, {{originally}} developed for Maniac Mansion. The company had gradually modified the engine since its creation. For Maniac Mansion, the developers hard coded verb commands in the SCUMM scripting language. These commands become more abstract in subsequent versions of the engine. The developers carried over the practice of referring to individual segments of the gameworld as [...] "rooms", even though the areas in Monkey Island were outdoors. The game uses the same version of the engine used in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with minor changes. A dialog tree was added, which facilitated conversation options and the sword-fighting puzzles. The developers removed the [...] "What is" [...] option (an input command that describes an on-screen object to the player) in favor of allowing the player to simply highlight the object with the mouse cursor. The game's improved interface became the standard for the company's later titles. The game also introduced logical verb shortcuts, which could be performed with the mouse; for example, clicking on a character defaults to the [...] "talk" [...] action, the most obvious action in the situation. SCUMM's visuals were updated for the game—the original EGA version had a 320x200pixel resolution rendered in 16colors. According to artist Steve Purcell, that became a major limitation for the art team; due to a low number of [...] "ghastly" [...] colors, they often chose bizarre tones for backgrounds. They chose black and white for Guybrush's outfit for the same reason. The VGA version of the game later corrected these issues by implementing 256 color support, which allowed for more advanced background and character art. The VGA (and other platform releases) removed the infamous [...] "stump joke" [...] from the game, which was a joke in the EGA version in which the [...] player would examine a tree stump in the forest. Guybrush would exclaim {{that there is an}} opening to a system of catacombs and attempt to enter, but this would result in a message stating the player needed to insert disc 22, then 36, then 114 in order to continue. The joke resulted in numerous calls to the LucasArts hotline asking <b>about</b> <b>missing</b> discs. As a result, the joke was removed from later editions and is a mentioned as a conversation option for the LucasArts Hint Hotline in the sequel.|$|E
