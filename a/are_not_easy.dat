5|$|Blue whales <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> {{to catch}} or kill. Their {{speed and power}} meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established {{on the coast of}} Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Of {{eukaryotic}} groups, the protists {{are most}} commonly unicellular and microscopic. This {{is a highly}} diverse group of organisms that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> to classify. Several algae species are multicellular protists, and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, colonial, and multicellular forms. The number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified. Protist diversity is high in oceans, deep sea-vents, river sediment and an acidic river, suggesting that many eukaryotic microbial communities may yet be discovered.|$|E

25|$|While {{it is not}} {{normally}} legal to keep these chameleons, {{it is possible to}} obtain special permission from the South African government to do so. These chameleons are better admired than handled. However, taming is possible through gentle and consistent (almost daily) contact, allowing trust to build up. This is typically achieved through careful and slow hand-based feeding of flies, small spiders, grasshoppers, etc. In cold weather, a sensitively handled B. pumilum commonly becomes eager to perch on a human hand for the warmth. To maintain them out of their natural environment requires advanced skills and is a demanding project; they require the right amount and type of ultraviolet exposure and large supplies of specific types of live food that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> to supply. They also require moisture, even just tap water sprayed gently onto the foliage with a hose.|$|E

25|$|Opening {{to freight}} traffic was in stages after {{authorisation}} in 1911 from Shepherdswell to Port Richborough, and from Eastry to Wingham (later renamed Wingham Colliery). The process was casual and without formality, hence exact dates <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> to ascertain. Passenger services from Shepherdswell to Wingham started on 16 October 1916. The initial proposal {{was to build}} a line to Canterbury goods yard via Ickham, but authorisation was only granted to build the line {{as far as the}} Wingham parish boundary. (Why this terminus was chosen, near where the direct footpath between Wingham and Ickham crosses the Port Rill, is a puzzle. Perhaps another collery was hoped for.) A major stumbling block to completion was the fact that Canterbury City Council was against a level crossing over the A28 at Sturry Road. The official year of opening of the line between Eastry and Richborough Port was 1925, but this is probably incorrect (see below on Richborough Port). The company's bridge over the River Stour, and hence its traffic over it before then, was illegal, since it had built a fixed-span high-level bridge instead of the low-level swing bridge authorised.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the major}} focuses of {{scholars}} studying Sappho has been to attempt to determine the cultural context in which Sappho's poems were composed and performed. [...] Various cultural contexts and social roles played by Sappho have been suggested, including teacher, cult-leader, and poet performing for a circle of female friends. [...] However, the performance contexts of many of Sappho's fragments <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> to determine, and for many more than one possible context is conceivable.|$|E
500|$|The Proto-Germanic or Germanic {{cultures}} on Polish lands developed gradually and in {{a diverse}} way, beginning with the old local Lusatian and Pomeranian stock, influenced and augmented first by La Tène culture and the Celtic people, {{and then by the}} Jastorf culture and its tribes, which settled northwestern Poland beginning in the 4th century BC, and later migrated in the southeastern direction through and past the main stretch of Polish lands (mid-3rd century BC and afterwards). The disappearing Celtic people made a big impact in central Europe and left a lasting legacy. Their advanced culture catalyzed economic and other progress within the contemporary as well as future populations, which had often had little or no ethnic Celtic component. The archeological period is considered [...] "La Tène" [...] until the beginning of the Common Era. The beginnings of the powerful ascent of the Germanic people, who replaced the Celts, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> to discern (e.g. to what degree the Pomeranian culture lands became the Przeworsk culture lands by internal evolution, external population influx or just permeation by the new regional cultural trends).|$|E

500|$|The {{record was}} {{produced}} by Vives under the executive production of his wife, Claudia Elena Vasquez. The recording of Pombo Musical took two years in four music studios in Colombia. The album comprises songs {{from a variety of}} Colombian folk genres like vallenato, bambuco, joropo and cumbia. Some songs mix genres such as Latin pop and pop rock. Opening track, [...] "El Modelo Alfabético" [...] ("The Model Alphabetical"), is a rock-stylized cumbia and vallenato song performed by Vives, the Dúo Huellas, Eduardo Arias and Karl Troller, about being a real gentleman, such as having good manners, and also teaches the alphabet to children. [...] "El Renacuajo Paseador" [...] ("The Tadpole Walker"), is a bambuco song performed by Andrea Echeverri, Lucia Pulido, Iván Benavides, Carlos Ivan Medina, Bernardo Velasco, Ernesto Ocampo, Dúo Huellas, Fundación Batuta Chorus, and Vives. It tells the story about a tadpole named [...] "Rin Rin", that left his home without the approval of his mother [...] "Rana" [...] ("Frog"), and subsequently dies when he hides in the mouth of a duck. In this song, Echeverri added additional lines to it. Juanes performs on [...] "El Gato Bandido" [...] ("The Bandit Cat"), a pop rock song about a cat that rebels against his family and leaves home, discovering that things <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> by yourself, and returns feeling repentant. Aterciopelados performs on [...] "Mirringa Mirronga", which is about a feline mega-party.|$|E
