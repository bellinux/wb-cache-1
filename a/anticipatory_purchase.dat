For instance, people often buy clothing that is presently too small for them. This dissertation examines the antecedents and consequences of such <b>anticipatory</b> <b>purchase</b> behavior, thereby illuminating both the substantive domain of anticipatory purchasing and providing theoretical insights into the nature of optimism. The first part of this dissertation investigates the fundamental question of why consumers engage in <b>anticipatory</b> <b>purchase.</b> Starting from the intuitive notion that optimistic individuals are more likely to engage in <b>anticipatory</b> <b>purchase,</b> I draw upon ideas from three different literatures, on optimism, mental simulation and goals, to build an overall framework that explains anticipatory purchasing. My conceptualization posits that the positive impact of optimism on anticipatory purchasing is moderated by a sequence of theoretically-derived factors; namely, style of processing (imagery vs. analytical), content of processing (process vs. outcome-focus) and depth of processing (unconstrained vs. constrained). A set of six experiments across different domains provides support for the predictions derived from this framework. The second part of this dissertation looks at the downstream consequences of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>purchase.</b> Here, I investigate how the <b>anticipatory</b> <b>purchase</b> decision affects consumers’ likelihood to engage in subsequent behavior that is consistent with the purchase (e. g., buying exercise equipment after purchasing a pair of jeans that is currently one size too small). Once again integrating insights from goals research with those from the mental simulation literature, I show across five experiments that the specific mental simulation (outcome- vs. process-focus) that individuals use when making their <b>anticipatory</b> <b>purchase</b> decision, together with the decision to buy or not buy, can lead optimists and pessimists to variously infer either progress or commitment towards the goal. These inferences drive different post-purchase decisions, which may be goal-congruent or not. Taken together, these results provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying consumer optimism and the dynamics of optimistic behavior...|$|E
40|$|Consumers often behave optimistically, {{purchasing}} {{products that}} {{they are unable to}} use at the time of purchase, but anticipate being able to use in the future. This research investigates such <b>anticipatory</b> <b>purchase</b> behavior, and demonstrates that optimism exerts its influence on <b>anticipatory</b> <b>purchase</b> via two distinct routes. One is driven by the perceived ease of the process required to achieve a given outcome and prevails when sufficient cognitive resources are available, while the other is driven directly by the perceived favorability of the outcome itself and holds when cognitive resources are constrained. Within each route, the focus of thought (process vs. outcome-focus) moderates the influence of optimism, and the two routes converge on enhanced motivation. Multiple experiments provide support for predictions derived from this framework, illuminating the substantive domain of anticipatory purchasing and providing theoretical insights into the nature of optimism.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the interconnections between anticipatory socialization, personality, marketplace behaviors, and communication patterns and preferences {{in an attempt}} to establish anticipatory socialization as the link between an individual 2 ̆ 7 s social tendencies {{on the one hand and}} his/her marketplace and communication behaviors on the other. Anticipatory socialization is conceptually defined as the extent to which an individual intends to behave in accordance with product consumption norms and expectations for a specific life stage. It is presented as a temporary, transitional phenomenon characterized by high levels of importance attached to purchasing the right brands (i. e., the belief that early career success will depend on purchasing the right brands or styles), high levels of purchase intentions for standard package items, and high levels of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>purchasing.</b> An underlying assumption of this conceptual definition is that marketplace behaviors and communication patterns change during life-stage transitions. ^ Although this study did not find evidence of a relationship between personality and anticipatory socialization, it did find support for the hypothesized relationships between anticipatory socialization and communication patterns and preferences. The results also suggest a strong positive relationship exists between anticipatory socialization and changes in marketplace behaviors. As a consequence, anticipatory socialization appears to have managerial implications for consumer segmentation and promotional strategies, for product and service development, and for an improved understanding of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s information-gathering strategies in the marketplace. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{effectiveness}} of a specific type of guilt appeal. The literature suggests that there are three types of guilt appeals. However the effectiveness of each type of guilt appeal is unclear. This study will investigate the effectiveness of one type of guilt appeal, namely anticipatory guilt appeal using a non-durable consumer good advertisement. The study explores the relationships between anticipatory guilt, attitude towards the brand, inferences of manipulative intent and purchase intentions. Results show no significant relationship between <b>anticipatory</b> guilt and <b>purchase</b> intentions. However, attitude towards the brand increased the likelihood of purchase intentions. The research suggests that anticipatory guilt appeals are inappropriate for the non-durable consumer goods advertisements. It raises an interesting question why so many advertisers are utilising this type of guilt appeal to target consumers. Managerial implications and future directions radiating from the results are discussed...|$|R
