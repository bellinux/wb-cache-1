5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water {{more or less in}} the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E
5|$|The red-legged running frog (Kassina maculata) has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. It {{can move}} fast {{by using a}} running gait {{in which the two}} hind legs are used alternately. Slow-motion {{photography}} shows, unlike a horse that can trot or gallop, the frog's gait remained similar at slow, medium, and fast speeds. This species can also climb trees and shrubs, and does so at night to catch insects. The Indian skipper frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) has broad feet and can run <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water for several metres (yards).|$|E

5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} discovery, {{separate}} teams, one led by David Charbonneau including Timothy Brown and others, {{and the other}} by Gregory W. Henry, were able to detect a transit of the planet <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. On September 9 and 16, 1999, Charbonneau's team measured a 1.7% drop in HD209458's brightness, which was attributed {{to the passage of}} the planet across the star. On November 8, Henry's team observed a partial transit, seeing only the ingress. Initially unsure of their results, the Henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that Charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in September. Papers from both teams were published simultaneously in the same issue of the Astrophysical Journal. Each transit lasts about three hours, during which the planet covers about 1.5% of the star's face.|$|E

25|$|Before {{actually}} quilting fabrics, some quilters baste the quilt.

25|$|There was {{significant}} turbulence {{in the areas}} beneath the downcomers. {{that could result in}} particles detaching from bubbles. These turbulent areas were calmed by the addition of conical diffusers beneath each downcomer. They allowed uniform bubble rise velocities <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell by slowing the superficial gas velocity in the high void-fraction area immediately around the downcomer and provided a more even bubble dispersion. It was reported that the diffusers reduced the turbulence by 69% compared with a standard downcomer with no diffuser.|$|E
25|$|Transform boundaries, {{such as the}} San Andreas Fault system, {{resulted}} in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also has provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, in which the continents move <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology.

25|$|Shrinkage defects {{can occur}} when {{standard}} feed metal {{is not available}} to compensate for shrinkage as the thick metal solidifies. Shrinkage defects can be split into two different types: open shrinkage defects and closed shrinkage defects. Open shrinkage defects {{are open to the}} atmosphere, therefore as the shrinkage cavity forms air compensates. There are two types of open air defects: pipes and caved surfaces. Pipes form at the surface of the casting and burrow into the casting, while caved surfaces are shallow cavities that form <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casting.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of animal {{locomotion}} on water, determined by the ratio of the animal's weight to <b>the</b> water's <b>surface</b> tension: those whose weight is supported by <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> tension at rest, and can therefore easily remain on <b>the</b> water's <b>surface</b> without much exertion, and those whose weight is not supported by <b>the</b> water's <b>surface</b> tension at rest, and must therefore exert additional motion in a direction parallel to <b>the</b> water's <b>surface</b> in order to remain above it. A creature such as the basilisk lizard, often dubbed the 'Jesus lizard', has a weight which is larger than <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> tension can support, and is widely known for running <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> water. Another example, the western grebe, performs a mating ritual that includes running <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> water.|$|R

25|$|These craters {{appear in}} a {{continuum}} of diameters <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, {{ranging in size from}} tiny pits to the immense South Pole–Aitken basin with a diameter of nearly 2,500km and a depth of 13km. In a very general sense, the lunar history of impact cratering follows a trend of decreasing crater size with time. In particular, the largest impact basins were formed during the early periods, and these were successively overlaid by smaller craters. The size frequency distribution (SFD) of crater diameters on a given surface (that is, the number of craters as a function of diameter) approximately follows a power law with increasing number of craters with decreasing crater size. The vertical position of this curve can be used to estimate the age of the surface.|$|E
25|$|The corona is {{not always}} evenly {{distributed}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun. During periods of quiet, the corona {{is more or less}} confined to the equatorial regions, with coronal holes covering the polar regions. However, during the Sun's active periods, the corona is evenly distributed over the equatorial and polar regions, though it is most prominent in areas with sunspot activity. The solar cycle spans approximately 11 years, from solar minimum to the following minimum. Since the solar magnetic field is continually wound up due to the faster rotation of mass at the sun's equator (differential rotation), sunspot activity will be more pronounced at solar maximum where the magnetic field is more twisted. Associated with sunspots are coronal loops, loops of magnetic flux, upwelling from the solar interior. The magnetic flux pushes the hotter photosphere aside, exposing the cooler plasma below, thus creating the relatively dark sun spots.|$|E
25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a rotary cutter and mat. A rotary cutter is a cutting tool with a round blade, {{making it easy to}} cut a smooth, continuous line. Rotary cutters come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A quilting ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. Quilting rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible to cut a piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a measuring tape and fabric chalk. Measurements have to include a seam allowance.|$|E

25|$|VSI crushers use a {{different}} approach involving a high speed rotor with wear resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the rock against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break rock. In its natural state, rock has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubical resulting particles. Utilizing velocity rather than surface force allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock {{as well as through}} the mass of the rock. Rock, regardless of size, has natural fissures (faults) throughout its structure. As rock is 'thrown' by a VSI Rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along these fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the rock is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI Crushing is generally of a consistent cubical shape such as that required by modern SUPERPAVE highway asphalt applications. Using this method also allows materials with much higher abrasiveness to be crushed than is capable with an HSI and most other crushing methods.|$|E
25|$|Nine inscribed copper plates {{thought to}} belong to the mature Harappan phase (2600 - 1900 BCE), are thought to be used for printing. The Indus {{characters}} in the plates are mirrored, and the loss in groove definition indicates repeated cleaning and polishing of the surface. The plates are also significantly larger than any seal, and much thicker, the thickness thought to help support pressure applied to their surface. The large nature of the plates makes them an unlikely candidate for seals as the tablets thus produced would be prone to breakage. The metal composition of the plates were characteristic for that period and location, and showed significant corrosion, indicating its ancient nature. Continuing patination <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate, including on the lines, indicates that the marks were not made recently on an ancient piece of metal. On testing the plates for printing using two kinds of ink (water and oil based) onto rag paper, silk and parchment, the results on all three materials were found to be of remarkable quality. All these suggest that these plates point to the first known examples of printing in the world. One of the plates contains 34 characters, the largest number of characters found so far on any single object from Indus findings.|$|E
