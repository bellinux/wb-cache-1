40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{potential}} of the eROSITA telescope on board the Spectrum-X-Gamma observatory to detect gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray <b>afterglows</b> during its 4 -year all-sky survey. The expected rate of <b>afterglows</b> associated with long-duration GRBs without any information on the bursts proper that can be identified by a characteristic power-law light curve in the eROSITA data is 4 [...] 8 events per year. An additional small number, ≲ 2 per year, of <b>afterglows</b> may be associated with short GRBs, ultra hard (GeV) GRBs and X-ray flashes. eROSITA can thus provide the first unbiased (unaffected by GRB triggering) sample of ≲ 40 X-ray <b>afterglows,</b> which can be used for statistical studies of GRB <b>afterglows</b> and for constraining the shape of the GRB N [...] S distribution at its low-fluence end. The total number of <b>afterglows</b> detected by eROSITA may be yet higher due to orphan <b>afterglows</b> and failed GRBs. The actual detection rate could thus provide interesting constraints on the properties of relativistic jets associated with collapse of massive stars. Finally, eROSITA can provide accurate (≲ 30 ") coordinates of newly discovered <b>afterglows</b> within a day after the event, early enough for scheduling further follow-up observations.

40|$|The {{temporal}} behaviour of {{the early}} optical emission from Gamma-Ray Burst <b>afterglows</b> can be divided in four classes: fast-rising with an early peak, slow-rising with a late peak, flat plateaus, and rapid decays since first measurement. The fast-rising optical <b>afterglows</b> display correlations among peak flux, peak epoch, and post-peak power-law decay index that can be explained with a structured outflow seen off-axis, but the shock origin (reverse or forward) of the optical emission cannot be determined. The <b>afterglows</b> with plateaus and slow-rises may be accommodated by the same model, if observer location offsets are larger than for the fast-rising <b>afterglows,</b> or {{could be due to}} a long-lived injection of energy and/or ejecta in the blast-wave. If better calibrated with more <b>afterglows,</b> the peak flux-peak epoch relation exhibited by the fast and slow-rising optical light-curves could provide a way to use this type of <b>afterglows</b> as standard candles.

5|$|GRB970508 {{was also}} the first burst with an {{observed}} radio frequency <b>afterglow.</b> By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer Dale Frail calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost at the speed of light. This provided strong evidence that GRBs are relativistically expanding explosions.|$|E
5|$|On May13, {{five days}} after the first {{detection}} of GRB 970508, Frail resumed his observations with the Very Large Array. He made observations of the burst's position at a wavelength of 3.5cm and immediately detected a strong signal. After 24hours, the 3.5cm signal became significantly stronger, and he also detected signals at the 6 and 21cm wavelengths. This was the first confirmed observation of a radio <b>afterglow</b> of a GRB.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the longer-wavelength <b>afterglow</b> {{emission}} (ranging from X-ray through radio) that follows gamma-ray bursts is better understood. Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in the burst itself {{takes the form of}} matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light. As this matter collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, it creates a relativistic shock wave that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second shock wave, the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as synchrotron emission across most of the electromagnetic spectrum. This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times (generally, hours to days after the explosion), although there are difficulties explaining all features of the <b>afterglow</b> very shortly after the gamma-ray burst has occurred.|$|E

40|$|In {{the set of}} 236 GRB <b>afterglows</b> {{observed}} by Swift between January 2005 and March 2007, we identify 30 X-ray light-curves whose power-law fall-off exhibit a steepening ("break") at 0. 1 - 10 day after trigger, to a decay steeper than t^{- 1. 5 }. For most of these <b>afterglows,</b> the X-ray spectral slope and the decay indices {{before and after the}} break can be accommodated by the standard jet model although a different origin of the breaks cannot be ruled out. In addition, there are 27 other <b>afterglows</b> whose X-ray light-curves may also exhibit a late break to a steep decay, but the evidence is not that compelling. The X-ray emissions of 38 <b>afterglows</b> decay slower than t^{- 1. 5 } until after 3 day, half of them exhibiting such a slow decay until after 10 day. Therefore, the fraction of well-monitored Swift <b>afterglows</b> with potential jet-breaks is around 60 percent, whether we count only the strongest cases for each type or all of them. This fraction is comparable to the 75 percent of pre-Swift <b>afterglows</b> whose optical light-curves displayed similar breaks at ~ 1 day. The properties of the prompt emission of Swift <b>afterglows</b> with light-curve breaks show the same correlations (peak energy of GRB spectrum with the burst isotropic output and with burst collimated output) as previously found for pre-Swift optical <b>afterglows</b> with light-curve breaks (the Amati and Ghirlanda relations, respectively). However, we find that Ghirlanda relation is largely a consequence of Amati's and that the use of the jet-break time leads to a stronger Ghirlanda correlation only when the few outliers to the Amati relation are included.

5|$|Most {{observed}} events (70%) have a {{duration of}} greater than two seconds and {{are classified as}} long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute {{the majority of the}} population and because they tend to have the brightest afterglows, they have been observed in much greater detail than their short counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a core-collapse supernova as well, unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars. Long GRB <b>afterglow</b> observations, at high redshift, are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.|$|E

5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons.

5|$|Events with a {{duration}} of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no <b>afterglow</b> had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.|$|E

5|$|BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and CGRO (with BATSE) was deorbited in 2000. However, the {{revolution}} {{in the study of}} gamma-ray bursts motivated the development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion. The first such mission, HETE-2, launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period. One of the most successful space missions to date, Swift, was launched in 2004 and as of 2016 is still operational. Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically slewed to observe <b>afterglow</b> emission following a burst. More recently, the Fermi mission was launched carrying the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's Large Area Telescope. Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{evidence}} that the light curves and the spectra of the <b>afterglows</b> of GRB 970228 and GRB 980326 appear to contain a SN component, {{in addition to a}} relativistic shock wave component, provide direct clues that at least the long GRBs detected by BeppoSAX are a result of the collapse of massive stars. We show that, if this is indeed the case, GRBs and their <b>afterglows</b> provide a powerful probe of the very high redshift (VHR) (z > 5) universe. We first establish that GRBs and their <b>afterglows</b> are both detectable out to VHRs. We then show that one expects GRBs to occur out to at least z 10 and possibly z 1 ̃ 5 - 20, redshifts that are far larger than those expected for the most distant quasars. This implies that there are large numbers of GRBs with peak photon number fluxes below the detection thresholds of BATSE and HETE- 2, and even below the detection threshold of Swift. The mere detection of VHR GRBs would give us our first information about the earliest generations of stars. We show that GRBs and their <b>afterglows</b> can be used as beacons to locate core collapse SNe at redshifts z >> 1, and to study the properties of these SNe. We describe the expected properties of the absorption-line systems and the Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of GRB <b>afterglows,</b> and discuss various strategies for determining the redshifts of VHR GRBs. We then show how the absorption-line systems and the Ly-alpha forest visible in the spectra of GRB <b>afterglows</b> can be used to trace the evolution of metallicity in the universe, and to probe the large-scale structure of the universe at VHRs. Finally, we show how measurement of the Ly-alpha break in the spectra of GRB <b>afterglows</b> can be used to constrain, or possibly measure, the epoch at which re-ionization of the universe occurred, using the Gunn-Peterson test.
