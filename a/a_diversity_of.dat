5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was drawn}} to <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> {{interests}} throughout his life, from business to politics. After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms.

5|$|Ilaiyaraaja {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies and string arrangements in Indian film music. This allowed him to craft a rich tapestry of sounds for films, and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences. The range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by Ilaiyaraaja's methodical approach to arranging, recording technique, and his drawing of ideas from <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> musical styles.|$|E
5|$|Plant life {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by the salt spray, strong winds and acidic peaty soils. No trees grow on the archipelago, although {{there are more than}} 130 different flowering plants, 162 species of fungi and 160 bryophytes. Several rarities exist amongst the 194 lichen species. Kelp thrives in the surrounding seas, which contain <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> unusual marine invertebrates.|$|E

A flint arrowhead found in a field near Bridgend, Islay has been dated to 10,800BC. This find may indicate {{the presence of a}} summer hunting party rather than permanent settlement. Burnt hazelnut shells and microscopic charcoal found at Farm Fields, Kinloch on Rùm indicate a settlement of some kind and this is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The larger islands {{have been}} {{continuously}} inhabited since Neolithic times, {{were influenced by}} the emergence of the kingdom of Dál Riata from 500 AD and then absorbed into the emerging Kingdom of Alba under Kenneth MacAlpin.

There is <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> wildlife, including three species of rare endemic tree.|$|E

Many sculptors and stone-cutters of the period lived at the foot of Mount Etna, making <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> objects, including balustrades, pillars, fountains and seats for buildings. Shades of black or grey were used to create contrasting decorative effects, accentuating the Baroque love of light and shade as demonstrated in (illustration 2).|$|E

5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> shapes and sizes, {{and in the}} range from closely {{resembling}} walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E

The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant.

The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, the Indian {{economy was}} the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by {{purchasing}} power parity. Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India {{became one of}} the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly industrialised country. However, it continues to face the challenges of poverty, corruption, malnutrition, and inadequate public healthcare. A nuclear weapons state and regional power, it has the third largest standing army in the world and ranks fifth in military expenditure among nations. India is a federal republic governed under a parliamentary system and consists of 29 states and 7 union territories.

5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above.

The city is home to Odense Palace, erected by King Frederik IV who died there in 1730, the Odense Theatre, the Odense Symphony Orchestra, and the Hans Christian Andersen Museum, situated in the house that was the birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen. In sports, Odense has a number of football clubs including OB, BM, B1909, and B1913, the Odense Bulldogs professional ice hockey team, and the city also hosts the H.C. Andersen Marathon.
