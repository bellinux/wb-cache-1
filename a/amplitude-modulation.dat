The fundamental resonance of a floor in concrete wall construction consists of two closely spaced vibration modes. These modes were identified from experimental modal analysis of an actual multi-story building. The modes corresponded to in-phase and out-of-phase vibrations of {{the upper and lower}} floors. The rigidity of the side walls had influence on the difference between the natural frequencies of the two modes. Low-frequency modulated sounds were generated in a room by the simultaneous excitations of the two vibration modes. The heavy-weight impact sounds were analyzed using auditory experiments to determine the <b>amplitude-modulation</b> effects on the perceived annoyance. The highly modulated impact sounds were judged to be 3 - 5 dB more annoying than the one having the same level without modulation. Consequently, impact sound transmission from floors connected by less rigid side walls exhibited lower annoyance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
