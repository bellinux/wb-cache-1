50|$|<b>Angiocardiography</b> is {{contrast}} radiography of {{the heart}} and great vessels. A liquid radiocontrast agent, typically containing iodine, is injected into the bloodstream, then the tissues are examined using X-rays. To avoid dilution, the radiopaque material is typically introduced with a catheter, a process known as selective <b>angiocardiography.</b> Normally, rather than just a single image, hundreds of X-ray images are rapidly captured on high-speed serial media, such as 35 mm film or a digital imaging counterpart, thus allowing the motion to be observed. The process requires fasting before the test, with a sedative and an antihistamine being administered before the test.|$|E
5000|$|Agustín Walfredo Castellanos (September 12, 1902 in Havana, Cuba — December 7, 2000 in Miami, Florida) was a physician.

Castellanos and colleagues published the first important {{paper on the}} clinical applications of intravenous <b>angiocardiography</b> {{which was published in}} the Archivos de la Sociedad de Estudios Clinicos in 1937. This is believed the first publication which dealt with the normal cardiac structure and the changes seen in ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis (Doby, 1976). A year later they pioneered the method of retrograde injection of dye (Perabrodil) into the aorta which was mainly used to diagnose patent ductus arteriosus (Castellanos and Pereira, 1938). Castellanos expanded his work on <b>angiocardiography</b> to include the study of the various congenital malformations of the heart.

50|$|A MUGA scan (multigated {{acquisition}} scan) is {{a nuclear}} medicine test designed {{to evaluate the}} function of the right and left ventricles of the heart, thus allowing informed diagnostic intervention in heart failure. MUGA scanning is also called radionuclide angiography, equilibrium radionuclide <b>angiocardiography,</b> radionuclide ventriculography, or gated blood pool imaging, as well as SYMA scanning (synchronized multigated acquisition scanning). This mode of imaging uniquely provides a cine type of image of the beating heart, and allows the interpreter to determine the efficiency of the individual heart valves and chambers. MUGA/Cine scanning represents a robust adjunct to the now more common echocardiogram. Mathematics regarding acquisition of Q is well served by both of these methods as well as other inexpensive models supporting ejection fraction as a product of the heart/myocardium in systole. The advantage of a MUGA scan over an echocardiogram or an angiogram is due to its accuracy. An echocardiogram measures the shortening fraction of the ventricle and is limited by the user's ability. Furthermore, an angiogram is invasive and, often, more expensive. A MUGA scan provides a more accurate representation of cardiac ejection fraction.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{compared}} {{left ventricular}} (LV) ejection fraction obtained by gated SPECT with that obtained by equilibrium radionuclide <b>angiocardiography</b> {{in a large}} cohort of patients. METHODS: Within 1 week, 514 subjects with suspected or known coronary artery disease underwent same-day stress-rest (99 m) Tc-sestamibi gated SPECT and radionuclide <b>angiocardiography.</b> For both studies, data were acquired 30 min after completion of exercise and after 3 h rest. RESULTS: In the overall study population, a good correlation between ejection fraction measured by gated SPECT and by radionuclide <b>angiocardiography</b> was observed at rest (r= 0. 82, p< 0. 0001) and after stress (r= 0. 83, p< 0. 0001). In Bland-Altman analysis, the mean differences in ejection fraction (radionuclide <b>angiocardiography</b> minus gated SPECT) were - 0. 6 % at rest and 1. 7 % after stress. In subjects with normal perfusion (n= 362), a good correlation between ejection fraction measured by gated SPECT and by radionuclide <b>angiocardiography</b> was observed at rest (r= 0. 72, p< 0. 0001) and after stress (r= 0. 70, p< 0. 0001) and the mean differences in ejection fraction were - 0. 9 % at rest and 1. 4 % after stress. Also in patients with abnormal perfusion (n= 152), a good correlation between the two techniques was observed both at rest (r= 0. 89, p< 0. 0001) and after stress (r= 0. 90, p< 0. 0001) and the mean differences in ejection fraction were 0. 1 % at rest and 2. 5 % after stress. CONCLUSION: In a large study population, a good agreement was observed {{in the evaluation of}} LV ejection fraction between gated SPECT and radionuclide <b>angiocardiography.</b> However, in patients with perfusion abnormalities, a slight underestimation in poststress LV ejection fraction was observed using gated SPECT as compared to equilibrium radionuclide <b>angiocardiography...</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY A man aged 41 {{years with}} a {{clinical}} diagnosis of cardiomyopathy and hepatic insufficiency was found, on <b>angiocardiography,</b> to have a mass, presumably a thrombus, within the left ventricle. A second angiocardiogram performed five days later showed that the thrombus had disappeared. The mechanism invoked was more probably an increase of spontaneous fibrinolysis as described in cirrhotic patients, perhaps helped by heparin, rather than ejection of the mass from the ventricle with silent embolisation somewhere in the systemic circulation. The detection of a left ventricular mass in vivo may be made by <b>angiocardiography.</b> Two dimensional echocardiography is, however, {{the best and the}} most sensitive technique. A left ventricular mass is usually a thrombus but occasionally a tumour.

40|$|We present here {{some of our}} {{experience}} of angiocardiography; it deals exclusively with children and infants {{as a result of}} our working in a children's hospital. * When a careful clinical examination, electrocardiograms, X rays, and the simple laboratory tests do not make the diagnosis certain, we have two principal procedures: heart catheterization with study of the pressures and gas content from samples obtained in different chambers of the heart, and in addition, <b>angiocardiography.</b> Although the first procedure is of great value, it is very difficult to perform on young children because of their small veins and lack of co-operation. On the contrary, <b>angiocardiography</b> is simple and harmless as far as {{our experience}} shows. Although the extensive and careful study Taussig made of the clinical and radiological picture of the different congenital heart malformations means a very great aid to diagnosis, we still believe that, especially in infants, <b>angiocardiography</b> can be a great help. At this early age diagnosis is difficult because the heart has not acquired its typical form and the physical and electrocardiographic signs are not yet clearly evident. It is also at this stage that the angiocardiograms are clearest as is illustrated by some of the pictures shown here.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{has proved to}} be a reliable noninvasive diagnostic technique in the evaluation of pulmonary arteries (PAs) size. There is no previous experience about the usefulness of MRI in the study of PAs anatomy after stents implantation. Ten pts (age 12 mos–l 0 years) were submitted to implantation of 16 stents (6 in right PA and lain left PA). Measurements of the internal diameters of the PAs were made in the site of the stents implantation by MRI and <b>angiocardiography,</b> utilizing the same projections.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{two-dimensional}} echocardiography and biplane <b>angiocardiography</b> from 47 infants with congenital atrioventricular (AV) valve abnormalities were compared. Eleven patients had atresia {{of the right}} AV valve, 10 had atresia of the left AV valve, 4 had hypoplasia of the right AV valve and 5 had hypoplasia of the left AV valve. Twelve patients had endocardial cushion defect, three had single ventricle and two had straddling of the left AV valve.

40|$|SELECTIVE <b>angiocardiography</b> as a prac-tical {{means of}} {{delineating}} anatomic details of cardiac malformations has been ad-vanced {{by the development}} of contrast agents with greater radiopacity, lower viscosity, and less apparent toxicity.

Occasional deaths that occur within the first few hours after <b>angiocardiography</b> are usually attrib-uted to the severity of the cardiac lesion rather than directly to the procedure. The present study was prompted by obser-vation of a four-month-old infant weighing 4. 8 Kg. with tricuspid atresia who underwent a routine cardiac catheterization with selec-tive <b>angiocardiography.</b> As the child was quite ill, sedation was obtained with only 10 mg. of methohexitol sodium (Brevital) intra-muscularly, and the procedure was carried out expeditiously.

40|$|Objective: We report our {{experience}} in combining tracheobronchography and <b>angiocardiography</b> {{in the assessment}} of a selected cohort of paediatric cardiac patients with problematic airway disorders. Methodology: The clinical records of 11 patients who underwent 17 studies at a median age of 5. 5 months (range 3 months to 10. 8 years) were reviewed. Tracheobronchography and <b>angiocardiography</b> were performed under general anaesthesia using a non-ionic contrast agent. The findings were compared with those of flexible bronchoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Seven patients had cardiac lesions associated with vascular anomalies potentially compressing the airway, while four had no identifiable aberrant or enlarged vessels. All examinations but one were performed without complications. Tracheobronchography demonstrated extrinsic vascular compression with secondary airway malacia in three (27 %), intrinsic tracheobronchial stenosis in five (45 %), and airway malacia in three patients (27 %). Precise measurement of the airway calibre and real-time fluoroscopic monitoring facilitated transcatheter tracheobronchial interventions (six balloon dilations, three stent implantations) in four patients. In conjunction with <b>angiocardiography,</b> cine-tracheobronchography provided detailed information on the spatial relationship between vascular and airway structures in all patients; allowed dynamic assessment of airway malacia; and facilitated preoperative planning in six patients. In contrast, bronchoscopy failed to differentiate malacia from extrinsic compression in four patients (36 %), while MRI, performed in six patients, was unsatisfactory in one due to a motion artefact and failed to diagnose airway malacia and extrinsic compression in three patients. Conclusions: Tracheobronchography is relatively safe in paediatric cardiac patients. Combined tracheobronchography and <b>angiocardiography,</b> a less operator-dependent imaging modality compared to bronchoscopy and MRI, delineated the airway and vascular anatomy in detail; facilitated preoperative planning; and permitted transcatheter tracheo-bronchial interventions. The dynamic capability of tracheobronchography supplements that of flexible bronchoscopy and MRI in the diagnosis of airway malacia. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In view of {{the high}} {{incidence}} and mortality of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with kidney transplantation, a systematic cardiac evaluation was prospectively performed in 103 uraemic patients eligible for transplantation. After clinical examination, 28 patients with symptoms of CAD or diabetes mellitus were referred directly for coronary angiography, whereas the remaining 75 patients had rest and exercise radionuclide <b>angiocardiography</b> for evaluation of possible asymptomatic CAD. Among them, left ventricular ejection fraction was below 40 % at rest or fell during exercise by at least 5 EF% in 12 patients; coronary angiography in nine showed CAD in four and hypertensive heart disease in five. In the remaining 63 (of 75) patients without severe resting left ventricular dysfunction or exercise ischaemia, the follow-up of 28 ± 7 months revealed no clinical manifestation of CAD. Overall incidence of CAD in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients during a follow-up of 27 months after cardiac evaluation was 20 and 25 % in non-diabetic and diabetic candidates for kidney transplantation, respectively (P = n. s.).

Of these, 48 had doubly committed subarterial defects. Morphological review showed that doubly committed defects are roofed by the arterial valves in fibrous continuity because of lack of both the outlet septum and the "septal" aspect of the subpulmonary infundibulum. <b>Angiocardiography</b> had a lower sensitivity (50 %) than echocardiography (95 %) for diagnosis of doubly committed defects, but each was highly specific.
