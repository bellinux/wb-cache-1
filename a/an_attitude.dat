5|$|Musical {{instruments}} such as zithers {{appeared in}} Chinese writings around 12th century BC and earlier. Early Chinese philosophers such as Confucius (551–479 BC), Mencius (372–289 BC), and Laozi shaped {{the development of}} musical instruments in China, adopting <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> toward music {{similar to that of}} the Greeks. The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and community, and developed a unique system of classifying their musical instruments according to their material makeup.|$|E

5|$|The Harajuku Lovers Tour was {{the first}} solo concert tour of American {{recording}} artist Gwen Stefani. The tour began through October to November 2005, to support of her debut studio album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004).

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} {{that the only way}} he could win back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Second World War had {{finished}} the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> of 'if it's not broke don't fix it, {{and if it is}} broke we still won't fix it'. At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of containerisation meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} and analyse the outcome of a 3 -year study program from a student perspective for the purpose of promoting culturally congruent nursing care. Students were asked to complete questionnaires that included cases with open-ended questions at the beginning and end of the 3 -year program. Two nursing situations were described and the students had to imagine how they would act in such cases. Ninety-two students completed the two questionnaires and the result of a manifest content analysis of their answers is presented. Four categories were formulated from the content analysis; <b>an</b> inviting <b>attitude,</b> <b>a</b> non-inviting <b>attitude,</b> <b>a</b> knowledge-driven <b>attitude</b> and <b>a</b> non-knowledge-driven <b>attitude.</b> An inviting attitude meant that the students found different strategies for approaching the patient and his/her spouse or parent. <b>A</b> non-inviting <b>attitude</b> implied that the students became frustrated with the situation and had more difficulty finding solutions that would enhance the relationship. <b>A</b> knowledge-driven <b>attitude</b> meant that the students described how they found it important to base nursing actions on knowledge of the patient. <b>A</b> non-knowledge-driven <b>attitude</b> meant that the students’ responses indicated that they did not consider knowledge to be the foundation of their nursing actions. The study demonstrates marked changes in the students’ approaches to culturally sensitive issues at the end of the education program...|$|R
5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the Box Office Attractions {{name was}} replaced with the newly incorporated Fox Film Corporation. Edwards remained one of the studio's most important directors and one of William Fox's closest advisers. He became known for his epic filmmaking and for a permissive approach to directing his starring cast, <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> that led Bara's biographer to compare him to Alfred Hitchcock. Often, that cast included Bara, whose films with him include Under Two Flags (1916), the epic historical drama Cleopatra (1917), and A Woman There Was (1919).|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, representing the Muslim League, strongly supported {{the right of}} the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the Government of Pakistan accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan—which India refused to recognise—and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as de jure Pakistani territory.|$|E

5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide attitude control {{on the first two}} stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch and yaw control. The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> control system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E
5|$|Usually {{reports were}} issued on any {{incident}} with every aircraft. On the date McCudden died, 29 such returns exist for S.E.5s {{but the report}} pertaining to his accident is not among them leaving the official cause of the crash unexplained. It is possible the engine failed due to a wrongly installed carburettor. However, there is some doubt as to whether a mechanical defect was the culprit. The witnesses reported the pilot was attempting low-level stunts, manifesting in several turns and rolls. Many years later other witnesses disputed the aircraft performed a roll, but all agreed the trouble began when the machine entered <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> resembling a near-vertical turn.|$|E

5|$|With Marais's loans {{combined}} with the Ebden scholarship, Smuts began to enjoy a degree of financial security. Though far from affluent {{he was at least}} able to meet his basic expenses. From his second year onwards Smuts began to enter more into the social arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making a number of friends and acquaintances, principally amongst the other colonial students. Though no longer so reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work; <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> which served as a barrier separating him from the English undergraduates, though not from the Fellows at Cambridge, with many of whom he struck up friendships.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{promotes}} subjective experience, {{particularly in}} relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to {{the world with a}} commercial and mercenary one, <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> she associates with Imlay.|$|E

5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway and Denmark, {{followed by a}} warning by the new Japanese naval attaché Captain Tadashi Meada that a German attack on the Netherlands was certain, {{it became clear to}} the Dutch military that staying out of the conflict might prove impossible. They started to fully prepare for war, both mentally and physically. Dutch border troops were put on greater alert. Reports of the presumed actions of a Fifth Column in Scandinavia caused widespread fears that the Netherlands too had been infiltrated by German agents assisted by traitors. Countermeasures were taken against a possible assault on airfields and ports. On 19 April a state of emergency was declared. However, most civilians still cherished the illusion that their country might be spared, <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> that has since been described as a state of denial. The Dutch hoped that the restrained policy of the Entente and Central Powers during the First World War might be repeated and tried to avoid the attention of the Great Powers and a war in which they feared a loss of human life comparable to that of the previous conflict. On 10 April Britain and France repeated their request that the Dutch enter the war on their side, but were again refused.|$|E
5|$|During {{his search}} for backers, Borchgrevink met Sir George Newnes, a leading British {{magazine}} publisher and cinema pioneer whose portfolio included the Westminster Gazette, Tit-Bits, Country Life and the Strand Magazine. It was not unusual for publishers to support exploration—Newnes's great rival Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) had recently financed Frederick Jackson's expedition to Franz Josef Land, and had pledged financial backing to the National Antarctic Expedition. Newnes was sufficiently impressed by Borchgrevink to offer the full costs of his proposed expedition—around £40,000, (at least £3million in 2008 values). This generosity infuriated Sir Clements Markham and the geographical establishment, who saw Borchgrevink as a penniless Norwegian nobody who had secured British money which they believed {{ought to have been}} theirs. Markham maintained <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> of hostility and contempt towards Borchgrevink, and chastised Mill for attending the launch of his expedition.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream Christianity has {{typically}} {{rejected the}} ideas of the New Age. Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's fundamentalist wing. In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of evangelical Christian groups in the 1980s, <b>an</b> <b>attitude</b> that came to influence British evangelical groups. During that decade, evangelical writers such as Constance Cumbey, Dave Hunt, Gary North, and Douglas Groothuis published books criticising the New Age from their Christian perspective; a number of them have been characterised as propagating conspiracy theories regarding the origin and purpose of the movement. The most successful such publication however was Frank E. Peretti's 1986 novel This Present Darkness, which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with feminism and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.|$|E
