500|$|McCartney's bass, {{placed in}} front of the mix, is an ingenious {{counterpoint}} that takes him all over the fretboard ... At the chorus, for example, while Lennon and McCartney harmonize in fourths on a melody with a slightly Middle Eastern tinge, McCartney first points up the song's droning character by hammering on a high G (approached with a quick slide from the F natural just below it), playing it steadily on the beat for twenty successive beats. [...] The next time the chorus comes around, though, he plays something entirely different, a slightly syncopated descending three-note pattern that <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> to evoke the falling rain.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opened to}} laudatory reviews from the {{television}} critic community, with much praise reserved for John Slattery's direction and the acting work of Vincent Kartheiser. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, his highest grade for the season so far, calling it [...] "transfixing and incredible" [...] and [...] "season five's first instant classic". He praised {{the symbol of the}} dripping faucet as well as the editing choices that suggested [...] "the way that time passes, so that it <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> as if you’ve lost yourself in the mists of your own life". Alan Sepinwall, writing for HitFix, exalted Slattery's [...] "strong command of the comedic moments", and recognized that [...] "most of the carnage" [...] of the episode [...] "comes out of failed attempts by Pete, Lane and Ken to be more than they are by building bridges from one world to another." ...|$|E
500|$|... "So Long Self" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Steve Losey of Allmusic commented that [...] " [...] has mass appeal musically and lyrically", also opining that [...] "the coolest {{part about the}} poppy hook is the ELO type vocals that penetrate the song's middle". Lauren Summerford of Jesus Freak Hideout stated that [...] "Lead single 'So Long Self' is one the best tracks Coming Up To Breathe has to offer. With a lyrical hook sure to have radio listeners singing along, this song finds [...] Millard bidding farewell to sinful nature and moving closer to Christ". Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today commented that [...] "It <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> like MercyMe is overcompensating to gain artistic credibility with the bouncy single 'So Long Self,' an undeniably catchy breakup song with our sinful nature that echoes [...] Chapman covering The Beatles, {{going so far as}} to playfully evoke a carnival in the bridge".|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps {{rated the}} episode an A-, finding it [...] "almost like an {{extension}} of the pilot". Phipps felt the scene featuring Mulder's kidnapping to be [...] "one of the scariest moments from the series' early days, as much for what it suggests as for what it shows". Writing for website Den of Geek, Matt Haigh reviewed the episode positively, praising its decision not to answer all of the questions that it asks. Haigh noted that [...] "the fact that we are left as clueless about what really happened as Mulder and Scully only enhances the viewing experience", finding such mystery to be [...] "a rare thing indeed" [...] on network television. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, finding it to be [...] "much more confident in its pacing and tone" [...] than the previous episode. Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode was [...] "a skilfully scripted story of cover-up and paranoia", and noted that [...] "it sets up the overall themes of the show so well, it <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> like a primer".|$|E
500|$|Fashion {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its direction, screenplay, cinematography, music and performances. Kriti Verma of Headlines India rated the film 4 out of 5, describing it as [...] "an outstanding film and a must watch {{for people who}} visit a theatre for something more than entertainment". Zee News gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5, called it [...] "a must watch" [...] and praised the sets, music, performances and storyline. Nikhat Kazmi rated the film 3.5 out of 5, describing it as [...] " [...] a sensitive parable on bonding and empowerment". Taran Adarsh rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praised the cinematography, screenplay, dialogue, costumes and styling, and called Fashion a [...] "hard-hitting film that enlightens you, moves you, motivates and deflates you, even shocks and surprises you and of course, entertains you". Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and wrote, [...] "Fashion is an easy watch because the very subject lends itself to so much interest. Like the director’s own film Page 3 it is mostly sensational and on several occasions compromises authenticity {{for the sake of}} exaggerated drama". He praised the performances of the lead cast, writing that [...] "Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best. The truth is, it’s one of those by-the-book characters that she understands only too well and performs just as easily. Ditto for Kangana Ranaut who plays the eccentric superdiva with such a practiced hand, it <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> like an effortless delivery. It's...Godse who invests such sincerity into her role, that she makes the character a real flesh and blood person. Kitu Gidwani, as the agency head who mentors our protagonist, Kitu strikes all the right notes, never once slipping out of character." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 24, Khánh {{issued a}} {{declaration}} of independence from [...] "foreign manipulation", and condemned [...] "colonialism", explicitly accusing Taylor of abusing his power. At the time, Khánh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping {{to put together a}} peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam, although this effort did not lead anywhere in the two months before he was forced out of power. For his part, Taylor privately told Americans journalists that Khánh was expressing opposition to the US merely because he knew he had lost Washington's confidence. Taylor said Khánh was completely unprincipled and was stirring up anti-American sentiment purely to try to shore up his political prospects, not because he thought US policy was harmful to South Vietnam. The US media were generally very critical of Khánh's actions and did not blame Taylor for the disharmony. Peter Grose of The New York Times said [...] "It <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> as if Viet Cong insurgents and the Saigon government conspired to make the United States feel unwelcome." [...] The Chicago Tribune lampooned Khánh's junta, calling it a [...] "parody of a government" [...] and saying it would not survive for a week without US support and describing the generals as [...] "remittance men on the United States' payroll". However, the New York Herald Tribune said it was dangerous to pressure South Vietnam too much, citing the instability that followed the American support for the coup against Diệm, who had resisted US advice so often. It said [...] "The issue is not General Khánh versus General Taylor. It is whether the Vietnamese still have the will to exist as an independent state." [...] The newspaper said if the answer was yes, then both Washington and Saigon would have to look beyond personalities.|$|E

500|$|In January 2015, Disney officially {{began the}} film's {{marketing}} campaign by releasing a miniature [...] "ant-sized" [...] teaser trailer, a full-sized {{version of the}} same teaser trailer, a poster, a cover on Entertainment Weekly, and a full-length trailer during the premiere of the television series Agent Carter. Scott Mendelson of Forbes, said, [...] "It was darn-clever for Disney to put out a miniature 'can't see anything without a microscope' version of the now-standard trailer for the trailer. I sighed just a little when they 'gave in' and released a human-sized version, realizing that Disney had just released what amounted to a teaser to a teaser to a trailer... But nonetheless, credit where credit is due, Disney was able to turn a single theatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days." [...] Mendelson {{went on to say that}} [...] "the peppy, witty trailer above is a general audience sell. Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones, but it's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold. So far, so good." [...] However, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of Agent Carter, its tone, its soundtrack, and for being thematically similar to other trailers from Marvel Studios. McMillan concluded, [...] "The Ant-Man trailer isn't bad, per se; it is, however, impressively underwhelming, which <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> worse. Thanks to the last-minute exit of original writer-director Edgar Wright and the subsequent struggle to find a replacement, Ant-Man has become the movie that people are expecting to be Marvel's first failure, in critical if not financial terms, at least; this trailer, which fails to convince and gets by on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand as much as anything else, doesn't do enough — or anything, really — to persuade audiences that that's not the case." [...] The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in three days, the third-largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film, behind trailers for Iron Man 3 and Avengers: Age of Ultron.|$|E
2500|$|With {{approximately}} 5000 musical settings, Eichendorff is {{the most}} popular German poet set into music."The magical, enchanting lyricism of his poetry <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> to be music itself," [...] as it is praised. His poems have been set to music by many composers, including, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss, Hans Pfitzner, Hermann Zilcher, Alexander Zemlinsky, Max Reger, and even Friedrich Nietzsche.|$|E
2500|$|Dmitry Shvidkovsky {{elaborated}} on the [...] "watershed" [...] theory, linking Brenna's art to his Roman studies: [...] "No partisan {{of strict}} Antiquity like Cameron, {{he was able}} to combine the solemn image of Imperial Rome with heightened pre-Romantic emotionalism. Time <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> sublimated in his work in Russia because of the impact of an imperial patron who wanted a complete break with Catherinian tradition... Paul was the first emperor of the Romantic era, Brenna was the precursor of Romantic Neoclassicism." ...|$|E

2500|$|A survey {{published}} by Radio Times magazine in March 2004 revealed that Casualty has featured more future stars {{than any other}} UK soap or drama series. Actors who appeared in the show prior to becoming famous include Kate Winslet, Orlando Bloom, Minnie Driver, Christopher Eccleston, Tom Hiddleston, Parminder Nagra, Sadie Frost, Ray Winstone, David Walliams, Jonny Lee Miller, Martin Freeman, Helen Baxendale, Robson Green and Brenda Fricker. Discussing her 1993 appearance in Casualty, Winslet told the Radio Times: [...] "In England, it <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> {{to be part of}} a jobbing actor's training [...] As far as I was concerned it was a great episode, a great part. Appearing in Casualty taught me a big lesson in how to be natural in front of the camera." [...] In addition, the series has featured a variety of more established stars, including Norman Wisdom, Amanda Redman, Anita Dobson, Jenny Seagrove, Rula Lenska, Prunella Scales, [...] Celia Imrie, Toyah Willcox, Maureen Lipman, [...] Frances Barber, Andrew Sachs, Russ Abbot, Stephanie Beacham, Honor Blackman and Michelle Collins in cameo roles.|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{continued}} his review in part two, where he lauded {{the writing of}} Sinon's backstory and sufferance of PTSD as [...] "masterful", writing [...] "The way she falls apart even in her Sinon persona {{when faced with a}} particular stressor is quite credible, as is the way she struggles to cope with her crushing fear; she is desperately afraid to die, but even more afraid of living with the fear [...] <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> like a deliberate message is being sent to the audience, and the way she finally finds her resolve and fights back when her life is in serious jeopardy is heartening." [...] He also praised Michelle Ruff's voice acting in the English dub. Anime News Network's Rebecca Silverman also praised Sinon's portrayal, noting her to be [...] "a much more interesting character" [...] than both Kirito or Asuna, as [...] "what makes Sinon a more successful character than any to previously appear in the main series is that she has more depth. Rather than being just a scared or traumatized character, she's someone who is actively working to change herself [...] it feels like this is a turning point for Kawahara's writing skill. Sinon isn't perfectly depicted, but she's got more going on than previous characters." [...] Sam of The Otaku's Study similarly noted how Sinon already established herself as [...] "one of the most developed Sword Art Online characters" [...] despite appearing in only 7 episodes thus far, praising her backstory and contrast between her in-game and out-of-game personas.|$|E
