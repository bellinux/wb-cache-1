500|$|One {{example of}} his dogged pursuit of {{excellence}} is that while in high school, Scheyer refused to leave the gym one night until he made 50 consecutive free throws. [...] After finally hitting 49 in a row, he missed on his final attempt. [...] His father encouraged him to join him and go home, but – as his coach recalled – “Jon looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ‘No. I’m starting over.’ Then he stayed until he made 50 in a row.” ...|$|E
500|$|When he {{graduated}} from high school in 1997, Youkilis weighed about 227 pounds and was 6' 1". He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> Well, we need somebody", said Cleary. [...] "I'd love to tell you I saw something no one else did, but he was just better than what we had." ...|$|E
500|$|New Musical Express {{journalist}} Nick Kent jammed occasionally {{with the}} band, but left upon Lydon's recruitment. [...] "When I came along, I {{took one look}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'No.That has to go,'" [...] Lydon later explained. [...] "He's never written a good word about me ever since." [...] In September, McLaren again helped hire private rehearsal space for the group, who had been practising in pubs. Cook, with a full-time job he was loath to give up, was making noises about quitting. According to Matlock's later description, Cook [...] "created a smokescreen" [...] by claiming Jones was not skilled enough to be the band's sole guitarist. An advertisement was placed in Melody Maker for a [...] "Whizz Kid Guitarist. Not older than 20. Not worse looking than Johnny Thunders" [...] (referring to a leading member of the New York punk scene). Most of the guitar players who auditioned were incompetent, but in McLaren's view, the process created {{a new sense of}} solidarity among the four band members. Steve New was considered the only talented guitarist who tried out and the band invited him to join. Jones was improving rapidly, and the band's developing sound had no room for the technical lead work at which New was adept. He departed after a month.|$|E

500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|At some stage, the King {{attempted}} {{to lead his}} lifeguard of horse {{to the rescue of}} his centre or in a counter-attack against Cromwell's troopers, but was prevented from doing so by a Scottish nobleman, the Earl of Carnwath, who seized his bridle, swore <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Would you go upon your death?" [...] Seeing the King swerve away from the enemy, his lifeguard also retreated in disorder for several hundred yards.|$|E
2500|$|After {{two and a}} {{half years}} of dating, Pickler became engaged to {{songwriter}} Kyle Jacobs on June 15, 2010, the day of her late grandmother's birthday, after he proposed on a beach at sunset. For a background piece on Dancing with the Stars, Pickler related that the couple had planned an elaborate ceremony, but as the date approached, [...] "I looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Baby, this ain't us.'" [...] On January 1, 2011, she and Jacobs eloped and married in a [...] "small, intimate ceremony on a private island in the Caribbean".|$|E

2500|$|They {{are heard}} {{of in the}} time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen Thalestris visiting him and {{becoming}} a mother by him (the story is known from the Alexander Romance). [...] However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded secondary source, Plutarch. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, Onesicritus, was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King Lysimachus of Thrace who was on the original expedition: the king smiled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "And where was I, then?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, H. C. Sanders, {{owner of}} a nearby gas station, {{reported}} 20 years earlier {{he ran out of}} gas at night near the Red River across from the Bell Witch Cave. He began to walk towards town when a rabbit came out of the woods and began to follow him. Sanders walked faster, but the rabbit kept pace even as he broke out into a run. After a mile, Sanders sat down on a log to catch his breath. The rabbit hopped up {{on the other side of}} the log looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Hell of a race we had there, wasn't it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, Nathan of Gaza envisioned Shabbetai Zevi as {{the next}} messiah for the Jewish people. However, Shabbetai Zevi’s acceptance of this messianic role was not instantaneous. In fact, his first encounter with Nathan of Gaza was not about his position {{as the next}} Jewish savior, {{but rather as a}} [...] "patient" [...] to a [...] "doctor". At the time, Nathan of Gaza was becoming well known as a spiritual physician. Shabbetai Zevi visited him in hopes of “curing” him from an illness that he had contracted. It turns out, of course, that Shabbetai Zevi suffered from a psychological condition which Gershom Scholem identified as manic-depressive psychosis, today normally called [...] "bipolar syndrome". Instead of trying to aid him with his psychological sickness, Nathan of Gaza divulged to Shabbetai Zevi his prophetic vision. Initially, when “…Nathan addressed him as the messiah, ‘he laughed <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ‘I had it , but have sent it away.’’” [...] It was only through intense discussion and much persuasion {{that he was able to}} sway Shabbetai Zevi into accepting his messianic mission. Then, in May 1665, Shabbetai Zevi made the decision that would place Nathan of Gaza and himself in the public sphere forever. He exposed himself to the world as the true savior.|$|E
6000|$|The latter {{realized}} that {{something must be}} done at once, for the greater portion of the crowd was looking inquiringly <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>said,</b> in a voice which was far from steady: ...|$|R

6000|$|Again {{startled by}} the {{peculiar}} emphasis placed on the magical word wife, Delly, who had long before this, been occasionally struck with the infrequency of his using that term; she looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> perplexedly, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> half-unconsciously-- ...|$|R

6000|$|Basil stepped {{nearer to}} his cousin; he remarked {{to her that}} Miss Verena was very pretty. She turned an instant, glanced <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>said,</b> [...] "Do you think so?" [...] An instant later she added, [...] "How you must hate this place!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lydia made {{no further}} effort to {{enlighten}} <b>him.</b> She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> thoughtfully, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> slowly, [...] "I begin {{to hold the}} clew to your idiosyncrasy.

6000|$|Lydia {{remained}} silent so long after this that Lucian's expression of magisterial severity first deepened, then wavered, and finally {{gave way to}} a sense of injury; for she seemed to have forgotten him.

6000|$|Fanny, who {{was sitting}} {{on the other side of}} Edmund, exactly {{opposite}} Miss Crawford, and who had been attentively listening, now looked <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> in a low voice-- ...|$|E

6000|$|He added this {{question}} in a soothing tone, as he saw her eyes widening sorrowfully, and {{the corners of her}} mouth falling.

6000|$|Lapham looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> silently, <b>and</b> then <b>said</b> {{with quiet}} self-respect, [...] "I {{guess if you}} see these things as a joke, my life won't {{interest}} you." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Fairfax glanced archly <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Nonsense! but, indeed, {{the trip}} was {{absolutely}} necessary for me. I should hardly have been alive had I remained at work; and poor Willie McQuinch was bent on having me." ...|$|E

6000|$|The cocks {{began to}} crow; the gate swung; {{there was a}} tramp of {{footsteps}} in the yard, and Mr. Gilfil heard Dorcas stirring. These sounds seemed to affect Caterina, for she looked anxiously <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Maynard, are you going away?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Maggie {{was frightened}} at Tom's pale, {{trembling}} silence. There {{was something else}} to tell him,--something worse. She threw her arms round <b>him</b> <b>at</b> last, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> with a half sob: ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} {{they went down}} with Roberts to Gravesend, to engage a large and roomy boat with two watermen for their trip.
