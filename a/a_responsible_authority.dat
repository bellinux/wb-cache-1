60|$|It {{would be}} untrue {{to say that}} Mark did not feel the change; {{but it is just}} to add that he felt more concern for the future fate of the colony, than he did for himself or his children. Nor, when he came to reflect on the matter, was he so much {{surprised}} that he could be supplanted in this way, under a system in which the sway of the majority was so much lauded, when he did not entertain a doubt that considerably {{more than half of the}} colony preferred the old system to the new, and that the same proportion of the people would rather see him in the Colony House, than to see John Pennock in his stead. But Mark--we must call him the governor no longer--had watched the progress of events closely, and began to comprehend them. He had learned the great and all-important political truth, THAT THE MORE A PEOPLE ATTEMPT TO EXTEND THEIR POWER DIRECTLY OVER STATE AFFAIRS, THE LESS THEY, IN FACT, CONTROL THEM, AFTER HAVING ONCE PASSED THE POINT OF NAMING LAWGIVERS AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVES; MERELY BESTOWING ON A FEW ARTFUL MANAGERS THE INFLUENCE THEY VAINLY IMAGINE TO HAVE SECURED TO THEMSELVES. This truth should be written in letters of gold, at every corner of the streets and highways in a republic; for truth it is, and truth, those who press the foremost on another path will the soonest discover it to be. The mass may select their representatives, may know them, and may in a good measure so far sway them, as to keep them to their duties; but when a constituency assumes to enact the part of executive and judiciary, they not only get beyond their depth, but into the mire. What can, what does the best-informed layman, for instance, know of the qualifications of this or that candidate to fill a seat on the bench! He has to take another's judgment for his guide; and a popular appointment of this nature, is merely transferring the nomination from an enlightened, and, what is everything, <b>a</b> <b>RESPONSIBLE</b> <b>authority,</b> to one that is unavoidably at the mercy of second persons for its means of judging, and is as IRRESPONSIBLE AS AIR.|$|E

40|$|User {{mobility}} {{is rapidly}} becoming {{an important and}} popular feature in today's networks. This is especially evident in wireless/cellular environments. While useful and desirable, user mobility raises {{a number of important}} security-related issues and concerns. One of them is the issue of tracking mobile user's movements and current whereabouts.

40|$|With {{the boom}} in mining in Fennoscandia, {{reconciliation}} of competing land use interests in governance procedures such as impact assessment {{has come to the}} fore. One of the functions that has been applied to varying degrees in national frameworks is supervision of the procedure by <b>a</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>authority.</b> This paper examines review statements issued in the context of mining project assessments in northern Finland – one of the countries implementing authority supervision. The study shows that third-party review {{may play a role in}} highlighting the importance of competing land use interest such as reindeer herding. Attention to such interests, however, remains limited by the application of spatial planning in the case and by consent processing, up until the end of the period examined. Among the lessons for impact assessment is the need for methodologies for accommodating anticipatory types of (practice-based and non-scientific) information. Unless these types of sources are considered valid, the possibility of substantializing anticipation and finding solutions along those lines will be missed, with the risk of making things on the ground worse before the need for mitigation measures is comprehended in the face of materializing impacts...|$|E

40|$|Magister Artium - MAThe {{extent of}} a {{community}} experiencing social vulnerability depends on the community’s ability to access resources that may contribute to coping mechanisms (either within the household or provided externally by <b>a</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>authority)</b> that decrease the impacts and effects of a disaster. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} research was to identify the existence of social and institutional mechanisms that aim to reduce experiences of water inaccessibility and the causes of social vulnerability, and increase coping mechanisms within Kayamandi. Kayamandi is a low income residential community on the north-westerly periphery of the greater Stellenbosch town in the Western Cape. The research attained responses through questionnaires and surveys from residents,community organisations and responsible personnel. These surveys allowed the researcher to produce raw attribute data for each household that assisted in spatially representing vulnerable households and informing the five priority areas of the Hyogo Framework for Action. Contributing to this method of attaining information, secondary geographic data collection was obtained through the Stellenbosch Local Municipality, the National Geospatial Information Directorate and the National Demarcation Board. The findings of this thesis established that household and public water infrastructure contribute to the risk of experiencing social vulnerability that affects economic standings and quality of health within the community. Contributing to this and due to Kayamandi’s politically sensitive and historically fractioned community, social cohesion has also been noted as an area of vulnerability. Although these vulnerabilities are experienced, residents are able to implement technical, social and municipal reliant coping mechanisms. However, although efforts from Stellenbosch Local Municipality do respond to most of the key indicators within the Hyogo Framework for Action, the study found no concrete efforts within the Stellenbosch Local Municipality that illustrate integrated mechanisms to reduce the impacts of disasters and compound effects...|$|E
40|$|THE FACTORS IMPACTING THE DIFFUSION OF INNOVATION IN DIGITALIZING ACCOUNTING Objectives of {{the study}} The goal {{of the study}} was to find the factors {{impacting}} the diffusion of digital accounting and electronic invoicing. Previous studies have focused on the attributes of the innovation and studied innovations with the assumption that they are efficient. This study has taken into account also the impact of actions as well as internal and external factors and brought in the considerations of the diffusion of inefficient innovations and divided the factors into motivations and hindering and supporting factors. Research method and data 		 The diffusion of digital accounting is viewed as a change process. The study method consisted of 12 semi-structured interviews with experts on digital accounting from six listed companies who already are starting to send and receive electronic invoices. This was supported by observations made in meetings of the FIA project, where several important external parties involved in the diffusion process like operators, solution providers and other facets promoting e-invoicing, were represented. The results from the interviews were connected to the observations and compared to existing research and viewed in the light of the existing theory. Findings The impacting factors are not limited to the attributes of an efficient innovation even though it has been the focus of existing research. The most important motivations are the perceived efficiency of the innovation and harmonisation. The efforts for standardisation, co-operation networks and the development of accounting systems and organisation were found to be the most important supporting factors whereas problems in standardisation and finding efficient SME solutions as well as change resistance and the lack of <b>a</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>authority</b> and competing non-digital solutions were seen as the worst hinders for the diffusion...|$|E
