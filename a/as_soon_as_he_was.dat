5|$|Joachim Gutkeled {{departed}} for Székesfehérvár <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> informed of Stephen V's death, {{because he wanted}} to arrange the boy–king's coronation. Ladislaus's mother joined him, infuriating Stephen V's partisans who accused her of having conspired against her husband. Stephen V's master of the treasury, Egyed Monoszló, laid siege to her palace in Székesfehérvár, but Gutkeled's supporters routed him. Monoszló fled to Pressburg (now Bratislava, Slovakia); he captured the town and ceded it to Ottokar II of Bohemia.|$|E
5|$|Gruban {{successfully}} appealed {{against his}} internment, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> freed brought Booth to court. The case {{was so popular}} that the involved barristers found it physically difficult {{to get into the}} court each day due {{to the size of the}} crowds gathered outside. Although the barristers on both sides were noted for their skill the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty. This was one of the first noted cases of Patrick Hastings, and his victory in it led to him applying to become a King's Counsel.|$|E
5|$|The {{breakaway}} {{was eventually}} caught {{at the bottom}} of the final climb. Valverde, who had crashed earlier in the day, was the first to attack. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> caught, his teammate Nairo Quintana put in his own attack. These attacks dropped Chris Froome from the front group. Dumoulin was the next to attack, seeking to take back the race lead from Chaves. Chaves and Quintana initially followed him, but were soon dropped. Valverde was also unable to follow the pace, but Froome had kept a steady pace and by this point was leading the chase of Dumoulin.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> set free, Theodore {{returned}} to Thessalonica. Lacking any escort or followers, he disguised {{himself as a}} beggar in order to enter the city in secret. There he contacted old supporters and favourites, and organized a conspiracy that soon ousted Manuel and took over the city. As Byzantine custom barred him from re-assuming the imperial office due to his blinding, Theodore installed his son John Komnenos Doukas (r. 1237–44) as emperor (without a coronation ceremony), but remained the real ruler of the empire in his son's name. John himself {{appears to have been}} mostly interested in religion, and more inclined to enter a monastery than to become emperor. Theodore had to persuade him that being named emperor was a God-given gift, and that he was indeed the rightful Emperor of the Romans due to his imperial descent.|$|E
5|$|Miguel feigned {{compliance}} with PedroI's plans. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> declared regent in early 1828, and backed by Carlota Joaquina, he abrogated the Constitution and, supported by those Portuguese {{in favor of}} absolutism, was acclaimed King Dom MiguelI. As painful as was his beloved brother's betrayal, PedroI also endured the defection of his surviving sisters, Maria Teresa, Maria Francisca, Isabel Maria and Maria da Assunção, to MiguelI's faction. Only his youngest sister, Ana de Jesus, remained faithful to him, and she later traveled to Rio de Janeiro {{to be close to}} him. Consumed by hatred and beginning to believe rumors that MiguelI had murdered their father, PedroI turned his focus on Portugal and tried in vain to garner international support for MariaII's rights.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Moreno, {{sent from}} the Audiencia of Santo Domingo in Hispaniola, arrived in Honduras {{shortly after the}} {{founding}} of Trujillo. He found forty colonists in a desperate state, lacking weapons and provisions. A few more Spaniards were still at Nito, the remnants of González Dávila's men, where their plight was even worse. The residents of Trujillo pleaded with Moreno for assistance, which he granted on condition that they renounced Cortés, accepted {{the jurisdiction of the}} Audiencia of Santo Domingo, and agreed to take Juan Ruano, one of Olid's former officers, as Chief Magistrate. Moreno renamed Trujillo as Ascensión, and he sent messages to Hernández de Córdoba, who was in Nicaragua, asking him to renounce his loyalty to Pedrarias and pledge allegiance to Santo Domingo. Moreno then returned to Hispaniola, promising to send aid. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gone, the residents restored the name of Trujillo, pledged their allegiance once more to Cortés, and expelled Juan Ruano.|$|E

5|$|Further westwards, {{the newly}} {{captured}} French island of Malta {{was under a}} much more diligent blockade. The returning convoy from Aboukir Bay under Saumarez reached Malta in September. There he encountered a squadron of four Portuguese ships {{of the line and}} the British ship Lion under the command of Tomás Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama, Marquess de Niza, initially sending them on to Alexandria. While anchored off Malta awaiting favourable winds, a delegation of native Maltese citizens was brought on board Saumarez's ship Orion on 25 September. They announced that the Maltese people, infuriated with French disestablishment of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta, had risen up against the French garrison and were forcing them back towards the fortress of Valletta. Saumarez attempted to negotiate the surrender of the island with Vaubois, but was rebuffed. Unable to delay his passage to Gibraltar any longer, Saumarez gave the Maltese 1,200 muskets and promised to send assistance <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able. By 12 October, the French were besieged in Valletta by 10,000 Maltese irregulars. Vaubois had only 3,000 healthy troops, although the arrival of Villeneuve with the ship of the line Guillaume Tell and two frigates did bolster his defences.|$|E
5|$|Henry re-granted Pevensey Castle to Gilbert I de l'Aigle but {{continued}} {{to use it for}} his own purposes, as happened in 1101 when he spent the summer at Pevensey to deter a threatened invasion by Duke Robert of Normandy. Pevensey was confiscated again by the Crown under King Stephen, with Gilbert's family also losing the rest of their possessions. It was subsequently re-granted to Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who switched his allegiance to Stephen's cousin and rival, the Empress Matilda, in 1141. Although Gilbert changed his loyalty back to Stephen the following year, he was taken hostage by the king in 1147 after a revolt by Gilbert's uncle, Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester. A promise to surrender the Clare family's castles secured Gilbert's release but <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> freed, he too rebelled. In response, Stephen undertook the second siege of Pevensey Castle with a land and sea blockade. The castle once again proved impervious to direct assault but the garrison was eventually starved out.|$|E
5|$|In December 1958 Ngo Dinh NhuDiem's {{younger brother}} and chief adviserbroached {{the idea of}} {{orchestrating}} a coup to overthrow Sihanouk. Nhu contacted Dap Chhuon, Sihanouk's Interior Minister, who {{was known for his}} pro-American sympathies, to prepare for the coup against his boss. Chhuon received covert financial and military assistance from Thailand, South Vietnam, and the CIA. In January 1959 Sihanouk learned of the coup plans through intermediaries who were in contact with Chhuon. The following month, Sihanouk sent the army to capture Chhuon, who was summarily executed <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> captured, effectively ending the coup attempt. Sihanouk then accused South Vietnam and the United States of orchestrating the coup attempt. Six months later, on 31August 1959, a small packaged lacquer gift, which was fitted with a parcel bomb, was delivered to the royal palace. Norodom Vakrivan, the chief of protocol, was killed instantly when he opened the package. Sihanouk's parents, Suramarit and Kossamak, who were sitting in another room not far from Vakrivan, narrowly escaped unscathed. An investigation traced the origin of the parcel bomb to an American military base in Saigon. While Sihanouk publicly accused Ngo Dinh Nhu of masterminding the bomb attack, he secretly suspected that the US was also involved. The incident deepened his distrust of the US.|$|E

5|$|Lee {{wanted to}} seize the high ground south of Gettysburg, {{primarily}} Cemetery Hill, which dominated the town, the Union supply lines, and the road to Washington, D.C., and he believed an attack up the Emmitsburg Road {{would be the best}} approach. He desired an early-morning assault by Longstreet's Corps, reinforced by Ewell, who would move his Corps from its current location north of town to join Longstreet. Ewell protested this arrangement, claiming his men would be demoralized if forced to move from the ground they had captured. And Longstreet protested that his division commanded by John Bell Hood had not arrived completely (and that Pickett's division had not arrived at all). Lee compromised with his subordinates. Ewell would remain in place and conduct a demonstration (a minor diversionary attack) against Culp's Hill, pinning down the right flank of the Union defenders so that they could not reinforce their left, where Longstreet would launch the primary attack <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ready. Ewell's demonstration would be turned into a full-scale assault if the opportunity presented itself.|$|E
25|$|Donnelly {{was born}} in the docks of Dublin, Ireland in March 1788. He came from a family of {{seventeen}} children. Donnelly grew up in poverty; his father was a carpenter, but suffered from chest complaints and was frequently out of work. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able, Donnelly also went to work as a carpenter.|$|E

The Progressive Conservatives ran lawyer Ernest Watkins, who had arrived from England in 1952. Rounding out the field was Frank Bodie who ran on a Labor banner. Liberal candidate Reginald McCollough and Independent Cliff Harris who was running in the election to protest Alberta's liquor laws in force at the time.|$|E
25|$|The mooted Flanders Offensive {{was then}} {{cancelled}} altogether after further lobbying of Kitchener by Joffre and Millerand, who visited England especially {{to demand that}} the BEF instead take over more French line. Sir John agreed (15 January), <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> reinforced, to relieve two French corps north of Ypres to allow Joffre to build up French reserves for his own offensive. Murray was sent off sick for a month (24 January) and French demanded his resignation, despite Murray insisting that he only needed {{to take a few}} days off. Robertson replaced him.|$|E
25|$|Winning {{a regular}} place for Gloucestershire <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{qualified}} in 1930, he {{made more than}} 1,000 runs {{in each of the}} next six seasons, though his average declined steadily over the period. His best season was 1930, when he hit his highest score, 223, with five sixes and 25 fours, in 255 minutes against Worcestershire. He scored two centuries in the match against Worcestershire in 1933. By 1935, he was averaging no more than 21 runs an innings and when his form declined further in 1936 his contract was terminated by mutual agreement and he returned to New Zealand.|$|E

After shooting Fred Palahniuk in the abdomen and Fontaine {{in the back of}} the neck, Shackleford left them to die, though he allegedly returned to the scene multiple times to attempt to start a fire large enough to destroy the evidence.|$|E
25|$|Munro's {{interest}} in speed began {{at an early}} age, riding the family's fastest horse across the farm, despite the complaints of his father. Trips via train to the port at Invercargill were a rare source of excitement, {{and the arrival of}} cars, motorcycles and aircraft added to Burt's eagerness to join the world outside his farm. As Munro's family discouraged his endeavours outside farm life, he became constantly bored with daily routine. At the outbreak of the First World War, he intended to go to war <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> old enough, for a chance to see the world.|$|E
25|$|Anderson {{grew up in}} a semi-rural setting {{north of}} Seattle, in the town of Edmonds, Washington, where he'd been born on November 20, 1906. Some of his early {{paintings}} portrayed his family home. A piano was an important presence in his house. His father, Irving Anderson, was a carpenter-builder and also a musician. From an early age Guy was intrigued by other cultures; he was particularly fascinated by the woodcarvings of Northern Coastal native tribes, and by the collection of Japanese prints owned by his piano teacher. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> old enough to do so on his own, he began commuting to the Seattle Public Library by bus to study art books.|$|E
