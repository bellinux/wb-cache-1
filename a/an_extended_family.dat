5|$|The {{village was}} built in about 300 BC and {{occupied}} into the early Roman period (around 100AD) when it was abandoned, possibly due to {{a rise in the}} water level. It was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble and clay. The village housed around 100 people in five to seven groups of houses, each for <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>family,</b> with sheds and barns, made of hazel and willow covered with reeds, and surrounded either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade.

5|$|The village housed {{people in}} {{five to seven}} groups of round houses, each for <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>family,</b> with sheds and barns, made of hazel and willow covered with reeds, and {{surrounded}} either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade.

At its maximum occupation the village may have had 15 houses in use with a population of up to 200 people. Two distinct phases of occupation have been identified. Early houses were timber framed square or rectangular and built of oak but later buildings were circular huts. Some of the clay spreads were used for barns or animal enclosures rather than houses.|$|E

Thus, the extended family is connected through a lineage of women who live together (that is, matrilocal residence), into which men may enter upon marriage (leaving behind his parents' family).|$|E

They would offer protection from other clans; if conflicts arose, the issue would be decided at a thing, a sacred place where all freemen from the surrounding area would assemble and could determine punishments for crimes, such as paying fines in food.|$|E

Grace is annoyed when she notices him and gives him money to leave the village for good.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} metal type faces, the metal type of Akzidenz-Grotesk shows {{variation}} between sizes, with adaptation of letter-spacing and proportions to different sizes. In addition, there is variation between weights: Karl Gerstner notes that even comparing one size (20pt), the medium and bold weights have different x-height, cap height and descender length {{to the light}} and regular weights. This is common with nineteenth-century sans-serifs, which were often not designed as {{with the intention of}} forming <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> that would match together. The differences in proportions between different sizes and weights of Akzidenz-Grotesk has led to a range of contemporary adaptations, reviving or modifying different aspects of the original design.|$|E
