25|$|The rocky {{shores of}} Heard Island exhibit a clear {{demarcation}} between fauna {{of the lower}} kelp holdfast zone and the upper shore zone community, probably due to effects of desiccation, predation and freezing in the higher areas. The limpet Nacella kerguelensis is abundant in {{the lower part of}} the shore, being found on rock surfaces and on kelp holdfasts. Other common but less abundant species in this habitat include the chiton Hemiarthrum setulosum and the starfish Anasterias mawsoni. The amphipod Hyale sp. and the isopod Cassidinopsis sp. are closely associated with the kelp. Above the kelp holdfast zone, the littornid Laevilitorina (Corneolitorina) heardensis and the bivalve mollusc Kidderia bicolor are found in well-sheltered situations, and another bivalve Gaimardia trapesina trapesina has been recorded from immediately above the holdfast zone.

50|$|<b>Algal</b> <b>mat</b> {{is one of}} {{microbial}} mat made out of blue-green cyanobacteria and sediments. Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophs organisms and commonly found in rocks in fossilized form. And {{they are responsible for}} The Great Oxidation Event which accumulated the oxygen levels during the Proterozoic time and allowed complex life form to thrive (Schirrmeister, Vos, Antonelli, and Bagheri, 2013). However, due to water pollution with nutrient, <b>algal</b> <b>mat</b> can grow rapidly and affect the ecosystem negatively, which is known as Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). In spite of that, with farther development in technology, it can be useful for efficient biofuel.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the role of biological processes in the C-isotopic dynamics of the aquatic ecosystems in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. This cold desert ecosystem {{is characterized by the}} complete lack of vascular plants, and the presence of <b>algal</b> <b>mats</b> in ephemeral streams and perennially ice covered lakes. Streams having abundant <b>algal</b> <b>mats</b> and mosses have very low sigma CO 2 concentrations, as well as the most depleted delta C- 13 values (- 4 %). Previous work has shown that <b>algal</b> <b>mats</b> in these streams have delta C- 13 values averaging - 7. 01 %. These values are similar to those observed in the <b>algal</b> <b>mats</b> in shallow areas of the lakes in Taylor Valley, where CO 2 is thought to be colimiting to growth. These low Sigma CO 2 concentrations, and delta C(13) signatures heavier than the <b>algal</b> <b>mats,</b> suggest that CO 2 may be colimiting in the streams, as well. Streams with little algal growth, especially the longer ones in Fryxell Basin, have higher Sigma CO 2 concentrations and much more enriched isotopic signatures (as high as + 8 %). In these streams, the dissolution of isotopically enriched, cryogenic CaCO 3 is probably the major source of dissolved carbonate. The delta C(13) geochemistry of Antarctic streams is radically different from the geochemistry of more temperate streams, as it is not affected by terrestrially produced, isotopically depleted Sigma CO 2. These results have important implications for the understanding of "biogenic" carbonate that might have been produced from aquatic ecosystems in the past on Mars...|$|R

50|$|The {{waters of}} Paralana {{geothermal}} springs, located at Wooltana, north of Arkaroola, issue from geological faults that date back one billion years.

50|$|Research was {{undertaken}} into the remediation of oil-contaminated {{soil in the}} Persian Gulf. The marshland concerned was covered by an <b>algal</b> <b>mat</b> but was otherwise vegetation-free. The creation of drainage channels {{was followed by the}} return of crabs to the affected areas close to the channels. They churned up the mud and increased the oxygen content, which was quickly followed by the germination of A. macrostachyum, Halocnemum strobilaceum and Salicornia europaea. The crabs advanced into the polluted area at the rate of about one metre per year (3 ft), resulting in a gradual increase in the vegetated area.|$|E
50|$|Diadema savignyi is nocturnal {{and tends}} to hide in crevices or under {{boulders}} during the day, or several individuals may huddle together in the open. The urchins disperse at dusk to feed on the <b>algal</b> <b>mat</b> that grows {{over the surface of}} seabed. In the course of tearing up the mat the urchin also abrades the underlying surface, causing bioerosion. Its activities help control the algae which otherwise might overwhelm the corals. Certain small fish such as cardinal fish, flatworms and shrimps sometimes seek protection from predators among the long spines. The sea urchin is preyed on by pufferfish (Tetraodontidae) and porcupinefish (Diodontidae), and also lobsters and snails. It reacts to a shadow falling on it by angling its spines towards the possible attacker.|$|E

This report presents the results from testing of ten different reactive media, and combinations of media, that are candidates for use in the proposed interceptor trenches to remove uranium and nitrate from groundwater.

50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of Stromatolite, the sub-tidal (always under water) columns and the inter-tidal (exposed to air and sun during low tides) anvil or {{mushroom}} shapes depicted in most pictures. <b>Algal</b> <b>mats</b> {{form in the}} inter-tidal region and appear as areas of flat black mud flats but are actually living stromatolite.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the aquatic environment, which is usually a sea, but might also be a river, lake, coral reef or <b>algal</b> <b>mat,</b> {{the formation of an}} oil or gas reservoir also requires a sedimentary basin that passes through four steps: deep burial under sand and mud, pressure cooking, hydrocarbon migration from the source to the reservoir rock, and trapping by impermeable rock. Timing is also an important consideration; it is suggested that the Ohio River Valley could have had as much oil as the Middle East at one time, but that it escaped {{due to a lack of}} traps. [...] The North Sea, on the other hand, endured millions of years of sea level changes that successfully resulted in the formation of more than 150 oilfields.|$|E
50|$|The rhodolithic {{growth habit}} has been {{attained}} {{by a number}} of unrelated coralline red algae, organisms that deposit calcium carbonate within their cell walls to form hard structures that closely resemble beds of coral. Unlike coral, rhodoliths do not attach themselves to the rocky seabed. Rather, they roll like tumbleweeds along the seafloor until they become too large in size to be mobilised by the prevailing wave and current regime. They may then become incorporated into a semi-continuous <b>algal</b> <b>mat.</b> While corals are animals that are both autotrophic (photosynthesize via their symbionts) or heterotrophic (filter plankton from the water for food), rhodoliths produce energy solely through photosynthesis (i.e. they can only grow and survive in the shallow photic zone of the ocean). Scientists believe rhodoliths have been present in the world's oceans since at least the Eocene epoch, some 55 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|Stream {{channels}} in the McMurdo Dry Valleys are characteristically wide, incised, and stable.

We sampled stream water along the impacted reach and compared concentrations of solutes to the long-term data from this stream ([*]∼[*]  20  years of monitoring). Thermokarst-impacted stream water demonstrated higher electrical conductivity, and concentrations of chloride, sulfate, sodium, and nitrate than the long-term medians. These results suggest that this mode of lateral permafrost degradation may substantially impact stream solute loads and potentially fertilize stream and lake ecosystems. The potential for sediment to scour or bury stream <b>algal</b> <b>mats</b> is yet to be determined, though it may offset impacts of associated increased nutrient loads to streams...|$|R

50|$|<b>Algal</b> <b>mat</b> mostly {{consist of}} {{filaments}} made of autotrophic bacterial and fine-grained particles. These bacterial {{are well known}} {{for the formation of}} stromatolites. Based on an article by Paerl, Pinkney and Steppe (2000), phototrophic bacteria such as cyanobacteria is an evolutionary organism responsible for increased oxygen level during the Proterozoic age. The event was known as The Great Oxidation Event, which was the creation and blooming of complex eukaryotic life form, which was left behind by these cyanobacteria. Preserved stromatolites are called stromatoliths. It can be easily recognized by its crystallized thinly laminated layers and its domed, columnar or conical shaped. However, the same cannot be said to stromatolites that were not crystallized. According to Frantz, Petryshyn, and Corsetti (2015), many of the stromatolites could not be preserved due to a process known as diagenesis. Diagenesis is a weathering process where newly deposited sediments lies on top of the old sedimentary bed, buried and compacted, lithified and uplifted to the surface as sedimentary rocks.|$|E
5000|$|Also, dermal {{diseases}} in the manatee population {{is likely to}} be caused by exposure to Lyngbya. The <b>algal</b> <b>mat</b> samples collected from manatee dorsum were dominated by Lyngbya spp. Other algae were present in very low quantities and varied in composition. Lyngbya-dominated mats were also collected from the walls of manatee holding tanks. Manatee feces was sampled from the anal opening and debromoaplysiatoxin was identified in multiple samples, proving the exposure of manatees to Lyngbya toxins. It is highly plausible that dermal disease in the manatee population is linked with exposure to Lyngbyatoxins. In contrast to humans who would likely have periodic exposure to Lyngbya while swimming, Lyngbya growing on the dorsa of manatees would cause 24 h per day exposure to the toxin. It may be hypothesized that the continual presence of these toxin-producing cyanobacteria on the skin of these clinically ill animals may be contributing to their dermatologic disease. (5) ...|$|E
