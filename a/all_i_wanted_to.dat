500|$|Charmayne James {{was born}} on June 23, 1970, in Boerne, Texas, {{and grew up in}} Clayton, New Mexico. She started riding horses at age three. By age six, she was running barrels. She said, [...] "It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] She began her rodeo career by joining the Rabbit Ear 4-H Club. Customarily, barrel racing is the only event that women compete in at Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) {{sponsored}} events, and it is the second most popular event after bull riding.|$|E
500|$|Tony's doomed quest in the Brazilian jungle {{is framed}} in biblical terms; the {{relevant}} chapter title, [...] "In Search of a City" [...] alludes to Hebrews 13:14: [...] "For {{here we have}} no continuing city, but we seek one to come". However, Waugh remarked of the novel that it was [...] "humanist, and said <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say about humanism". He believed that the essential 20th century conflict was between Christianity and Chaos, and chose to present a chaotic world to demonstrate that civilisation did not have in itself the power to survive. Thus, in the Brazilian jungle, Tony encounters what Davis terms [...] "power without grace... secular feudalism unredeemed by the saving grace of Christianity". Todd is the symbol of humanist, irreligious power.|$|E
500|$|McCormack {{enrolled}} at Ryerson University School of Theatre in Toronto to further improve his acting. He left Ryerson in 1985, {{several months before}} graduating, [...] to accept a position with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, where he spent five seasons performing. [...] "It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted,</b> <b>to</b> be a classical actor {{for the rest of}} my life, but during the last couple of years I was there, I started to realise that it wasn't for me. Perhaps I didn't have to give my Hamlet before I died, that the world might be an OK place without my Hamlet, in fact." [...] McCormack appeared in the productions A Midsummer Night's Dream, Henry V, Murder in the Cathedral and Three Sisters. McCormack later performed with the Manitoba Theatre Centre in a production of Burn This, as well as with Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre in Biloxi Blues.|$|E

500|$|Several {{established}} {{actors were}} {{considered for the}} leading role of Rusty Sabich. Kevin Costner turned down the role, and Robert Redford was vetoed by Pollack due to his age. When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, all the action takes place around him. Things happen to him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There are many things I found I could express with that short haircut. Simplest of <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> tell the audience to leave their baggage at home — not to expect the Harrison Ford they've seen before." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{returning}} from Chicago, Ford {{wrote to the}} same friend: [...] "Had a swell time in Chicago and didn't see Sally Rand either. [...] Saw all of the fair in 25 minutes, at least <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elliott's BMX {{career was}} {{relatively}} short, lasting only six years. Elliott retired from twenty-inch BMX racing {{early in the}} 1986 season, right after the ABA Supernationals (which were held on January 26 and 27). Explaining the reason for her decision, Elliott said [...] "I did <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. I wanted to quit last year, but I thought about getting ABA No. 1 {{two years in a}} row. And I did it—that was my goal." ...|$|E

2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say was that my grandma showed me my first strap. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> put in the song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I {{was an only child}} so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.' Like, 'Your dickies is cut super perfect and they got the right amount of dirt on them. That shit is fly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sutcliffe readily {{acknowledged}} {{his debt}} to his [...] "influential guide" [...] by naming {{his eldest son}} after him and writing, in a booklet published in 1927, that he doubted if Hobbs had an equal and that, as a batsman, [...] "he stands alone (and is) the best I have ever seen". Sutcliffe expressed the view that if W G Grace {{was as good as}} Jack Hobbs, [...] "then he must have been wonderful". [...] He said that Hobbs' earliest advice to him had been simply: [...] "Play your own game". Sutcliffe commented: [...] "Four words – they counted for so much. [...] They told me <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Snowdons had drifted apart. In September 1973, Colin Tennant (later Baron Glenconner) {{introduced}} Margaret to Roddy Llewellyn. Llewellyn was 17 years her junior. In 1974, she invited {{him as a}} guest to the holiday home she had built on Mustique. It {{was the first of}} several visits. Margaret described their relationship as [...] "a loving friendship". Once, when Llewellyn left on an impulsive trip to Turkey, Margaret became emotionally distraught and took an overdose of sleeping tablets. [...] "I was so exhausted because of everything", she later said, [...] "that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do was sleep." [...] As she recovered, her ladies-in-waiting kept Lord Snowdon away from her, afraid that seeing him would distress her further.|$|E

2500|$|Tallchief was {{considered}} America's first major prima ballerina, {{and was the}} first Native American to hold the rank. She remained closely tied to her Osage history until her death, speaking out against stereotypes and misconceptions about Native Americans on many occasions. Tallchief was involved with America for Indian Opportunity and was a director of the Indian Council Fire Achievement Award. She and her sister Marjorie are counted as two of a group of five Native American ballet dancers from Oklahoma born in the 1920s. However, she wished to be judged on the merits of her dance alone. [...] "Above <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be appreciated as a prima ballerina who happened to be a Native American, never as someone who was an American Indian ballerina," [...] she wrote.|$|E
2500|$|On July 27, 2010 it was {{announced}} by Hamilton during {{an interview that he}} had checked himself into a Psychiatric hospital stating: [...] "My stay here is like identical to my stay in the industry. As far as being the new guy in here having to deal with politics and people trying to control you. The critics would have to be the doctors and the rounds. So you can say this is like an experiment to see if the industry is really like an asylum or if I was the one bugging. Some say the industry is like high school but its just like a [...] <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do and still want to do is make music, he explained. It {{got to the point where}} I started talking in rhymes all the time, even in just regular conversations. And music just became me, so I thought it be a good idea if I checked into the hospital just to get my mind right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1987, Orbison was {{inducted}} into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album [...] "Born to Run": [...] "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison." [...] In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt [...] "validated" [...] by the honor. A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: [...] "Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional." [...] The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.|$|E

2500|$|In the Summer 2009 {{edition of}} Rap-Up, R singer Akon spoke {{about working with}} Houston for the then-upcoming album. In the {{interview}} he revealed that he had worked with her on two songs for the album; one of which, [...] "Like I Never Left", was previously leaked to the internet. It had initially been tipped as a single. Davis said Houston wanted an island song, so they reached out to Akon. The song was likened to Janet Jackson's [...] "My Baby," [...] which featured Kanye West. American singer R. Kelly also wrote two songs for the album. One of the songs [...] "Salute" [...] was described as being [...] "militaristic [...] marching beat" [...] that also features Kelly on the backing vocals in the chorus. In the song Houston makes reference to LL Cool J with the lyric, [...] "Don't call it a comeback, I've been here for years." [...] Kelly's other contribution, [...] "I Look to You" [...] became the album's title song, and was released as the album's debut single. When speaking of the piano ballad Houston said, [...] "It sums up <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say." [...] The album also contains a cover of the 1970s Leon Russell song, [...] "A Song for You". Houston's cover begins with a slow piano intro, which picks up in the middle.|$|E
