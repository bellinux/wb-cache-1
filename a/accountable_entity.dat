40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to argue that it is time for change in the way the paper teach, {{theories}} and practice accounting. Traditional accounting practice constructs the identity of the <b>accountable</b> <b>entity</b> as purely self-interested. Yet, there is evidence that firms do engage in broader activities. This paper aims to explain and illustrate that there are groups of firms that engage in socially responsible activities, yet their accounting systems still assume autopoietic behavior. Accounting should resonate with social expectations, but at present it does not. Design/methodology/approach – Literature concerning theories of biological autopoiesis and social equivalents are reviewed. They are related to accounting practices, and to concepts of open and closed systems. The theories are related to survey results of socially responsible activities practiced by firms. National surveys undertaken in New Zealand at three-year intervals are the basis of the empirical content of the paper. Findings – There is evidence that firms behave socially and environmentally responsibly. Yet accounting practice does not encourage such behaviour. Accounting practice has to be able to construct the identity of the <b>accountable</b> <b>entity</b> so that it pursues more than its own self-interest, and resonate with societal expectations. Research limitations/implications – The paper is unconventional. It challenges extant practice. Its theoretical content may not appeal to many traditional accountants. Originality/value – The theory and empirics are original. The theory of autopoiesis is illustrated through survey evidence of business practices...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to review {{instruments}} that assess the level of preparedness of state and local public health departments to respond to health threats such as bioterrorism. METHODS: The authors examined 27 published population-based instruments for planning or evaluating preparedness that were mostly unavailable in the peer-reviewed literature. Using the Essential Public Health Services framework, the instruments were evaluated for (1) clarity of measurement parameters, (2) balance between structural and process measures, (3) evidence of effectiveness, and (4) specification of an <b>accountable</b> <b>entity.</b> RESULTS: There was a great deal of overlap but little consistency in what constitutes "preparedness" or how it should be measured. Most instruments relied excessively on subjective or structural measures, lacked scientific evidence for measures assessed, and failed to clearly define what entity was accountable for accomplishing the task or function. CONCLUSION: Strategies for improvement include measure standardization, better interagency communication, and investment in public health practice research to develop the underlying evidence base required for developing quality measures and assessments...|$|E
40|$|Rural {{communities}} {{living in}} the neighbourhoods of protected areas are among the least developed communities in the LDCs. In the global quest for sustainable development and democracy, participation in natural resource management by these communities has become an important component in rural development and biodiversity conservation programmes. The proliferation of CBNRM initiatives in the LDCs, however, has so far not yielded any fundamental reductions in poverty and insecurity in the targeted communities. This has {{raised questions about the}} viability of CBNRM as a strategy for articulating the development objectives of local communities. Questions have also been raised about the ideological bases of CBNRM. This dissertation presents an analysis of participation in a CBNRM initiative by the Makuleke community of South Africa. Focus is on the issues of community control and gender in the CBNRM process. Findings by the study show that the preconditions for community-level control have largely been met and the Makuleke CBO structure has been constituted as a representative and legally <b>accountable</b> <b>entity.</b> However, there apparently subsists a view that indigenous rural communities like the Makuleke cannot be fully entrusted with leadership roles in CBNRM. The study also finds that despite the securing of gender rights of access to bases of social power and productive wealth through legislative instruments, some social structures and attitudes that favour male dominance remain entrenched in the Makuleke community. These militate against the strategic participation by women in environmental governance and in the benefits stream emanating from CBNRM. The dissertation argues that the success of the CBNRM initiatives such as the Makuleke’s will depend on a more complex interplay of variables tan solely on the empowerment of the community through strengthening of CBO structures, securing resource rights, entry into the benefits stream and developing of capacities. Success will largely depend on the ability of CBNRM programmes to achieve fundamental reductions in poverty and insecurity. Since there are multiple jurisdictions in CBNRM, LDC states will have to strike a difficult balance or make a critical choice between promoting the interests of Northern agencies in order to secure conditions of production and defending the interests of local communities in order to secure social integration. The responses by LDC states will have significant implications on the success of CBNRM initiatives. Dissertation (MA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE: To stimulate {{discussion}} {{within the}} research and policy community {{about the value of}} and issues surrounding different ways to describe access to care in a health system reconfigured by the growth of managed care, competition, and other marketplace changes. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The concept of access has evolved over time to address shifting health policy concerns like the growing interest in looking beyond utilization as a measure of access to a better consideration, too, of the effectiveness of services used as judged by costs and outcomes. Yet current frameworks used to look at access are person-based and do not capture the complexity of the healthcare system and the complex structures involved in managed care organizations that combine delivery and financing and vary substantially within and across markets. In addition, many at times competing or conflicting policy goals on access exist. There also is an increasingly diverse and widening set of uses that include benchmarking against national goals, measuring performance of <b>accountable</b> <b>entities,</b> and providing consumer information. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Traditional access frameworks are invaluable in encouraging focus on historical measures of access, like insurance coverage and other barriers to system entry. But much greater attention needs to be paid to adapting current access frameworks so that they also better support the ability to understand how processes inherent in diverse health delivery and financing arrangements influence access to services within a system and what this means for how well individuals negotiate healthcare systems and the effects on care outcomes. The increasing demands on access measures and the growing diversity of users also point to a need for collaboration to better pool insights, share experiences, and honestly confront trade-offs or disagreements to progress in addressing these issues...|$|R

Summary and conclusions. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has pursued a strong agenda to develop a simplified set of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). IFRS for SMEs published in 2009 was derived from full IFRS with significantly reduced recognition and measurement principles, guidance and disclosure requirements in order to satisfy the accounting information needs of the users of SME financial statements. The aim of this thesis is to undertake a comprehensive examination of the conceptual and practical issues in the convergence of IFRS for SMEs and suggest possible ways to address these issues. In particular, the thesis undertakes the following four research projects under the theme of problems and challenges in implementing IFRS for SMEs: (1) critically reviews IFRS for SMEs, including the development and implementation process of the standards; (2) examines whether accountants are able to distinguish between the recognition and measurement principles of full IFRS and IFRS for SMEs when they exercise professional judgment; (3) investigates the impact of the reduced guidance in IFRS for SMEs on the professional judgment of accountants; and (4) investigates whether users of SME financial statements benefit from a simplified set of IFRS for SMEs. This thesis employs exploratory and empirical research methods to examine the controversial issues in {{the adoption of}} IFRS for SMEs. The findings of this thesis provide evidence that IFRS for SMEs have been a challenge for non-publicly <b>accountable</b> <b>entities</b> to adopt and there are several conceptual and practical issues with IFRS for SMEs. In particular, the thesis provides evidence that accountants are unable to choose accounting treatments that best reflect the economic substance of a transaction when the recognition and measurement requirements are different across full IFRS and IFRS for SMEs and when guidance is significantly reduced from IFRS for SMEs. This thesis also provides evidence that users perceive disclosure of IFRS for SMEs to be decision useful but they do not regard that the simplification significantly enhances their decision making.

40|$|As governments {{increasingly}} delegate traditional public {{functions to}} private, for-profit entities, the {{federal civil rights}} statute, 42 USC § 1983, {{has the potential to}} play an important role in encouraging private entities to respect constitutional rights when they take on public duties. That potential is undermined, however, by the prevailing view that private entities subject to § 1983 should be exempt from the traditional tort principle of respondeat superior liability simply because the Supreme Court already has held that municipal entities are exempt. Exempting private entities carries significant implications, not only because of the growing privatization of government functions, but also because respondeat superior liability often is critical for fulfilling tort law objectives of deterrence and compensation. This Article examines differences regarding how private entities and governmental entities behave and contends that those differences justify imposing respondeat superior liability on private § 1983 defendants even if public § 1983 defendants remain exempt. Initially, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s rationale for exempting municipalities from respondeat superior liability was particular to public entities and does not justify exempting private parties from respondeat superior liability. Additionally, as a policy matter, the fact that profit-motivated, private entities may be both more responsive than electorally <b>accountable</b> public <b>entities</b> to tort liability incentives and less responsive to other nonfinancial constraints on behavior suggests that respondeat superior may be better suited for deterring private misconduct than public misconduct. Imposing respondeat superior liability on private parties therefore can help ensure that when private parties agree to perform important public functions, they will not diminish important constitutional values...|$|R

Pearson correlation coefficients have been generated to determine the relationship between several antecedents and ineffective government audits. Pattern of talk concluded that massive corruption, conservative auditing methods, lack of cooperation from auditee, low morale of auditors, lack of financial independence, lack of power to take action against malpractices, lack of financial, technological and human resources, lack of qualified trainers and ineffective training institutes are antecedents of ineffective audits which ultimately make it difficult to bring transparency and accountability in the public sector.

5000|$|Performance {{measurement}} {{is not a}} new concept, {{but rather}} an old concept of renewed importance today. In 1943, the International City Management Association published an article on measuring the performance of municipal activities. During the Kennedy administration, systems analysis processes were introduced to the Department of Defense which fueled interest in performance measurement in the federal government. Other agencies began experimenting in performance measurement when the Johnson administration introduced what they called planning-programming-budgeting system (PPB). Eventually more and more state and local governments began using performance measurement to improve their management and budgeting. The use of performance measurement became a common practice in the 1970s with the introduction of new social programs that needed to be assessed. However, interest in performance measurement did dwindle in the 1980s, as people did not perceive benefits of using performance measurements in making decisions. In the 1990s, performance measurement was reenergized as the demands for holding government <b>entities</b> <b>accountable</b> to public increased. A number of resolutions were passed by associations such as the National Academy for Public Administration, urging government to set goals and measure their performance and in 1993, The Government Performance and Results Act was passed by the federal government requiring their agencies to become involved in strategic planning, goal-setting, and performance measurement.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article {{addresses}} {{the distribution of}} accountability between the European Union (EU) and its Member States under the current and future climate regime. Belonging to a field of shared competence between the EU and its Member States, the climate regime is characterized by ‘mixed agreements’, not distinguishing between the obligations of the EU and its Member States. This {{raises the question of}} how to determine who is accountable in case of non-compliance. Under the current regime, there is a joint and proportional accountability rule regarding the European common emission reduction target. This rule is well suited to the nature of the EU, and should therefore be maintained in the next climate agreement. For other commitments, third parties, the Secretariat of the Climate Change Convention and the Kyoto Protocol Compliance Committee enjoy a margin of discretion to evaluate whether it is pragmatic to address non-compliance with regard to only the Member State concerned or to involve the EU in the process. This approach, favouring a return to compliance, also appears adapted to the EU. Indeed, an ad hoc intra-European mechanism allows for the identification of the actor actually accountable. To avoid holding the EU as a whole <b>accountable</b> while the <b>entity</b> actually <b>accountable</b> is a Member State or the EU, some intra-European actions for recovery are available to the EU, its Member States and even private persons...|$|R
30|$|One clear {{opportunity}} {{for research in}} virtual network security is the provisioning of nonrepudiation – which, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, has not yet been approached. Nonrepudiation requires providing proof of actions performed by entities on a network, which can be used for holding <b>entities</b> <b>accountable</b> for malicious activity. We deem nonrepudiation an essential security countermeasure for virtual networking environments in order to accurately backtrace attacks – not only to ensure that punitive actions will be taken against the attackers but also to properly contain the attacks themselves. In the event of a DDoS attack, for example, this countermeasure could enable administrators to pinpoint the origins of the attack with a high level of precision – which otherwise tends to be a very difficult task. Moreover, nonrepudiation may even prevent attacks, in the sense that malicious users who are aware that such a mechanism is in use may refrain from carrying out attacks in order to avoid exposing themselves. Provisioning nonrepudiation can be challenging for a number of reasons, such as the complexity of securely storing and handling digital certificates – used for proving that an action was, indeed, performed by a given entity – and the negative impact this has on network performance. Moreover, it is necessary to maintain a desired level of privacy for virtual network requesters as well as end users. Nevertheless, we envision that the importance of this countermeasure will grow steadily as network virtualization becomes increasingly prominent in production environments.|$|R
40|$|Governments {{that have}} the {{capacity}} to carry out policies – and policies that citizens support – are a key feature of state legitimacy and policy credibility. Moreover, in the context of globalization, a dimension of state legitimacy has become the capacity to conduct public policies that respond to a demand for protection. The paper argues that the deficit in legitimacy affecting many Sub-Saharan African states is explained by the following sequence of causalities, which can generate vicious circles. The reliance of Sub-Saharan African countries on primary commodities for their exports induces the “externalization” of the policies of governments, which, in turn, simultaneously erodes their legitimacy vis-à-vis citizens and capacity to conduct specific adapted policies that could reduce this reliance on commodities. These “externalized” policies have relied on a stable conceptual framework over four decades, whatever the characteristics of countries. The paper shows that this externalization takes two major forms. A first modality stems from the dependence of African governments’ fiscal policies on international commodity and financial markets, fiscal revenues depending on volatile prices that African governments cannot influence. This modality is particularly detrimental, commodity-based export structures generating the volatility of revenues, and hence fiscal deficits and indebtedness. A second modality also stems from this dependence, i. e. financing from external agencies that is conditional to policy reform. This second modality is detrimental not only because conditional financing reduces governments’ autonomy, but because it makes governments <b>accountable</b> to external <b>entities</b> and breaks a key element of political legitimacy, i. e. taxation...|$|R
40|$|The Egyptian {{government}} and its legislators have been putting forth legislative amendments to its domestic laws that are controversial in relation to investment, tenders, bids, and investment guarantee as top priority. On one hand, they are doing this {{in order to encourage}} and reassure the foreign investors in Egypt, and on the other hand, they are likely facing psychological fears of international massive litigations. However, these legislative investment amendments could threaten and undermine the stability of inherited Egyptian jurisdiction systems and integrity. These amendments include providing avenues of escape of corruption and financial crimes through the reconciliations with the foreign investors who have been damaging the Egyptian economy and its citizens’ livelihoods. As the role, size, and impact of foreign investment grow worldwide. The mechanisms holding such <b>entities</b> <b>accountable</b> are actively diminishing. Unfortunately, the legal framework of foreign investment is aggressively shrinking the state’s role in regulating these foreign investment enterprises in Egypt, while challenging the very sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Egyptian court system to investigate allegations of violations committed by foreign investors. In effect, this results in absolute impunity by foreign investors in Egypt. Moreover, this trend of more legal privileges and the loose accountability to the foreign investors create a negative impact on Egyptian public interests and then on the Egyptian legal system {{as well as on the}} Egyptian Constitution. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to highlight the lawful deficiencies of the amended investment laws as well as its patterns trespass to the Egyptian Constitution. In addition, this paper brings out the implications of these violations on the inherited Egyptian legal system...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 9). Background: The {{pharmaceutical market}} in Bangladesh is highly concentrated (top ten control around 70 % of the market). Due to high competition aggressive marketing strategies are adopted for greater market share, which sometimes cross limit. There {{is lack of}} data on this aspect in Bangladesh. This exploratory study aimed to fill this gap by investigating current promotional practices of the pharmaceutical companies including the role of their medical representatives (MR). Methods: This qualitative study was conducted {{as part of a}} larger study to explore the status of governance in health sector in 2009. Data were collected from Dhaka, Chittagong and Bogra districts through in-depth interview (healthcare providers and MRs), observation (physician-MR interaction), and round table discussion (chief executives and top management of the pharmaceutical companies). Results: Findings reveal a highly structured system geared to generate prescriptions and ensure market share instituted by the pharmaceuticals. A comprehensive training curriculum for the MRs prepares the newly recruited science graduates for generating enough prescriptions by catering to the identified needs and demands of the physicians expressed or otherwise, and thus grab higher market-share for the companies they represent. Approaches such as inducements, persuasion, emotional blackmail, serving family members, etc. are used. The type, quantity and quality of inducements offered to the physicians depend upon his/her capacity to produce prescriptions. The popular physicians are cultivated meticulously by the MRs to establish brand loyalty and fulfill individual and company targets. The physicians, willingly or unwillingly, become part of the system with few exceptions. Neither the regulatory authority nor the professional or consumer rights bodies has any role to control or ractify the process. Conclusions: The aggressive marketing of the pharmaceutical companies compel their MRs, programmed to maximize market share, to adopt unethical means if and when necessary. When medicines are prescribed and dispensed more for financial interests than for needs of the patients, it reflects system’s failed ability to hold individuals and <b>entities</b> <b>accountable</b> for adhering to basic professional ethics, code of conduct, and statutory laws.

40|$|LLM (Import and Export Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} whether the current South African regulatory framework related to the illegal trade in wildlife, provides the means to regulate the illegal trade in rhino horn effectively. In an effort to combat and eradicate the illegal trade in wild species and parts therein, South Africa has enacted numerous laws and it has ratified various international conservation Conventions. However, with more than 800 rhinos having been killed in 2013 alone, it is doubtful whether these laws and conventions are adequate. The first chapter is an introductory chapter summarising the latest statistics on rhinos fatalities as a result of poaching, an estimate on their numbers as well giving a brief overview of what laws and conventions will be discussed in this study. In the second chapter the historical development of the trade in rhino horn is dissected, who the culprits are and the reason why rhinos are poached for their horn. The third chapter analyses international conventions that have been adopted by South Africa, including conventions such as the Convention on International Trade in Enangered Species, the Convention on Biological Diversity and agreements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The fourth chapter will focus more on the regional contributions which the African Union and Southern African Developing Community have made in an effort to combat the illegal trade in endangered species and their products such as rhino. The fifth and final chapter discusses South African legislation which comprises of the National Environmental Management Act, National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act, National Environmental Management Protected Areas Act and the Criminal Procedure Act so as to determine what influence it has had in the effort to regulate the illegal trade in rhino horn. The conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that the South African regulatory framework on paper is indeed adequate enough to regulate and even eradicate the illegal trade in rhino horn. The reason, however, for it’s currently failure is attributable to a lack of enforcement of these measures as a result of a lack of provisions holding <b>entities</b> <b>accountable.</b> Master...|$|R
