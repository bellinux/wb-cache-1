5|$|Chotiner {{was given}} an office at the RNC, {{nominally}} as the official in charge of tickets for the inauguration. RNC chairman Ray Bliss <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> were disturbed by his presence, and were told he would be gone after January 20. Meanwhile, Nixon <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> considered a new RNC chairman finally settling on Maryland Congressman Rogers Morton, who agreed to take the position once Bliss left, though Morton was not told of the promise to Chotiner. When the President-elect met with Bliss on January 10, 1969, he could {{not bring himself to}} fire the chairman. With the situation unresolved, and Morton's appointment unannounced, Chotiner sat in his RNC office for a month after the inauguration with nothing to do, as the RNC staff wondered at his presence.|$|E
5|$|Hananu and Rashid al-Tali'a {{cooperated with}} Barakat {{in an attempt}} to unify {{northern}} Syria's rebel groups into a single resistance movement against the French, in allegiance with Faisal's government in Damascus. Hananu also formed an alliance with the semi-nomadic Mawali tribesmen of the Aleppo region. Following the battle at Harim, Hananu, with the assistance of Aleppo's Committee of National Defense, had collected up to 2,000 gold pounds in funds, and 1,700 rifles for the 680 men in his iṣābā, who he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> trained.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal battle}} over the tapes {{continued}} through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides.</b> The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. These hearings culminated in votes for impeachment. On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.|$|E

5|$|Duyệt's death {{opened the}} way for Minh Mạng to apply his {{policies}} in the south, as the viceroy's subordinates lacked the influence to defy the court. The emperor also tried to reduce Duyệt's followers’ political power by abolishing the post of viceroy and putting the south under his direct rule, thus making Duyệt the last holder of the post. Soon after Duyệt's death, Minh Mạng's new appointees arrived and took over the local administration. The new officials then launched an investigation and reported that Duyệt <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> had engaged in corrupt and abusive practices.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's agenda {{had been}} impeded {{by the fact}} that Congress was {{controlled}} by Democrats and he hoped {{to take control of the}} Senate in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding {{the level}} of {{controversy}} surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial {{in a number of}} other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of Bovis as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist. In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs. Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from the selection of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the Royal High School on Calton Hill, long thought to be the home of any future devolved Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} crash, Uzbek police sealed off {{the crash site}}. Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov visited the crash site and talked with rescue workers.

25|$|When the {{governor}} exited {{the building at}} around 6:00pm, he found a crowd of protesters blocking his path.

25|$|Shortly after, the {{executive}} director and other staff members of NYSTA began to meet with Shanker <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> to discuss {{the possibility of a}} merger. Each union had spent large amounts of money battling the other for bargaining rights and members while the state legislature and local school districts steadily chipped away at union rights and collective bargaining agreements.|$|E
25|$|The limited ideological {{framework}} of General Howard <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> encouraged their attempt at radical reconstruction of southern society without realizing {{the need for}} essential legislation. They thought that {{the elimination of all}} statutory inequalities—for instance, Black court testimony—would be enough to assure protection. Southern states pretend to comply with this point in order to end the threat of the Freedmen's Bureau courts' system.|$|E
25|$|On 26 January 2009, the {{coalition}} government collapsed {{due to the}} public dissent over {{the handling of the}} financial crisis. A new left-wing government was formed a week later and immediately set about removing Central Bank governor Davíð Oddsson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> from the bank through changes in law. Davíð was removed on 26 February 2009 in the wake of protests outside the Central Bank.|$|E

50|$|Prince Marthanda Varma <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aide,</b> Parameswaran Pilla, go to Bhoothapandi. The {{forces from}} Madurai are camped there, unwilling {{to support the}} royals until they are paid the full price agreed upon by the king. A payment, brought by the prime minister, was {{insufficient}} and {{he was forced to}} stay as an assurance of payment. Marthanda Varma worries that Raman Thambi, the king's second son, may adversely influence the Madurai forces while visiting. When the prince <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aide</b> are at Padmanabhapuram, Padmanabhan Thambi arrives. To evade him, they travel through an underground tunnel to Charottu palace.|$|R
25|$|During his South African {{magistrate}} court {{trial on}} 2 May 2012, the former {{leader of the}} Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), Henry Okah, insisted that President Jonathan masterminded the October 2010 Independence Day bombing. Okah told the court that President Jonathan <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> organised the attacks in Abuja in a desperate political strategy to demonise political opponents, including former military President General Ibrahim Babangida, and to win popular sympathy ahead of the 2011 elections.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{initiated}} several {{democratic reforms}} which affected the renegotiation {{of the national}} coal collective bargaining agreement. UMWA's bargaining demands were now set by a 36-member bargaining council rather than the president <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides.</b> Tentative agreements now were subject to approval by the bargaining council and member ratification. Wildcat strikes had become common in the coal industry as union miners grew frustrated with {{what they saw as}} poor terms of national contracts and employer foot-dragging on resolving disputes and grievances. Miller hoped that these democratic reforms would decrease the number of wildcat strikes.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} the battle opened, Thesiger's {{division}} was suffering heavy casualties and reports were reaching divisional headquarters that the 73rd Infantry Brigade {{was on the verge}} of breaking. Thesiger immediately departed for the front line to investigate the situation with his divisional staff and was touring a trench at Fosse 8 opposite the Hohenzollern Redoubt when the German artillery opened fire on the British positions. One of the first shells fired exploded directly in the trench occupied by the 26th Brigade where the party was sheltering, instantly killing Major General Thesiger <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> Major Le Mottee and Lieutenant Burney. None of their bodies were removed from the battlefield as fighting continued for another day and consequently only Burney's remains were recovered some time later. General Thesiger's name is amongst the 20,000 recorded on the Loos Memorial to the missing.|$|E
25|$|The radio {{version of}} the show has led to {{controversy}} over his portrayal of Ireland's President Michael D. Higgins <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aide</b> Kevin McCarthy which led to RTÉ producers ordering Callan to tone down on.|$|R
50|$|Back on the station, an Alliance soldier, Lieutenant Womack (Richard Burgi), threatens {{first to}} imprison, then to burn to death the postmaster, who quickly tells the man <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aide</b> who {{left with the}} encoffined body.|$|R

25|$|The {{approaching}} Russian cavalry was on {{the heights}} and numbered about 3,000 sabres. The Scots Greys {{and the rest of}} the British dragoons were waiting at the base of the heights, and totalled about 800 men. Satisfied that his brigade was ready, Scarlett finally sounded the advance. Although Scarlett had spent precious minutes ordering his line, it soon proved to be unwieldy, especially in the sector occupied by the Scots Greys, who had to pick their way through the abandoned camp of the Light Brigade. The Scots Greys, once clear of the Light Brigade's camp, had to speed up to catch Scarlett <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides,</b> who were more than 50 yards ahead of them. For some reason, the Russian cavalry commander chose to halt up slope of the Heavy Brigade, choosing to receive the charge at a halt.|$|E
25|$|Searching {{through the}} closets of Orthanc, King Elessar <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> found the long lost first Elendilmir, a white star of Elvish crystal affixed to a fillet of mithril. Once owned by Elendil, the first King of Arnor, {{it was an}} emblem of royalty in the North Kingdom. After Elendil fell in the War of the Last Alliance, his eldest son Isildur ascended to the throne. On his journey back to the {{northern}} capital of Arnor, his retinue was ambushed by orcs. Isildur tried to escape by jumping into a river but was killed by arrows. Saruman may have found his body there, and taken the Elendilmir from it. A replica was made, which was used by Isildur's successors up to the re-establishment of the kingdom (reunited with Gondor) by Elessar. He thus used both, using {{one or the other}} on certain occasions.|$|E
25|$|In June 1958, the ARVN were {{involved}} in border clashes with Cambodia and made gains in the northeastern Cambodian province of Stung Treng. This provoked a war of words between Diệm and Sihanouk. On 31 August 1959, Nhu failed {{in an attempt to}} assassinate Sihanouk. He ordered his agents to send parcel bombs to the Cambodian leader. Two suitcases were delivered to the Sihanouks' palace, one addressed to the head of state, and the other to Prince Vakrivan, his head of protocol. The deliveries were labeled as originating from an American engineer who had previously worked in Cambodia and purported to contain gifts from Hong Kong. Sihanouk's package contained a bomb, but the other did not; however, Vakrivan opened both on behalf of the monarch and was killed instantly, as was a servant. The explosion happened adjacent to a room in the palace where Sihanouk's parents were present. At the same time, anti-Sihanouk broadcasts emanated from a secret transmitter located somewhere in South Vietnam, widely attributed to Nhu. Sihanouk quickly blamed the Ngôs <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>aides</b> made statements implying the United States might {{have played a role in}} the assassination attempt.|$|E
