5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had to {{interact}} with the main characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, the animal was too scared to remain still. They had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog felt comfortable, making a shot that should have taken a few minutes <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> long.|$|E

5|$|Pioneers 10 and 11 {{and both}} Voyager probes carry {{messages}} from the Earth to extraterrestrial life. Communication can be difficult with deep space travel. For instance, it took <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft when {{it was more than}} halfway to Pluto. Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|The {{line has}} been {{suggested}} preserved as a cultural heritage, since it represents one of very few railways with the original narrow gauge profile intact. However, all stations have been demolished; Flekkefjord in 1970, Sirnes in 1977 and Flikkeid in 1988. The organization Friends of the Flekkefjord Line offer rental of draisines for tourists since {{the closure of the}} line, and a round trip from Flekkefjord to Bakkekleivi just outside Sira takes <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> However, the Norwegian National Rail Administration have since banned the operation of draisines until the line is fully fenced in.|$|E
5|$|Determined to {{complete}} the destruction of Minnesota, Catesby ap Roger Jones, acting as captain in Buchanan's absence, returned the ship to the fray the next morning, March 9. During the night, however, the ironclad Monitor had arrived and had taken a position to defend Minnesota. When Virginia approached, Monitor intercepted her. The two ironclads fought for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> with neither being able to inflict significant damage on the other. The duel ended indecisively, Virginia returning to her home at the Gosport Navy Yard for repairs and strengthening, and Monitor to her station defending Minnesota. The ships did not fight again, and the blockade remained in place.|$|E

During their entire time at sea, the two frigates captured nine prizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{tapes were}} {{originally}} {{described as having}} been recorded {{in the spring of}} 1962, an attempt to pre-date The Beatles' June 1962 contract signing with Parlophone. However, song arrangements and dialogue from the tapes pointed to late December 1962, and a recording date of 31 December 1962 (the group's last day in Hamburg) was commonly cited. Later researchers have proposed that the tapes are from multiple days during the last week of December; Allan Williams (The Beatles' booking agent at the time) recalled that a total of <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> was recorded over three or four sessions between Christmas and New Year's Day.|$|E
5|$|After some refitting, President, {{still under}} Rodgers' command, sailed on 8October with Congress, United States, and Argus.

5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final testimony, and her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought the death penalty for both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
5|$|At 0000UTC on January17, Météo-France (MFR) {{upgraded}} {{the disturbance}} to a tropical depression, and six hours later upgraded the system further to Tropical Storm Dina. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and {{later that day}} initiated advisories about 425km (265mi) south of Diego Garcia. Dina quickly intensified, and its T-numbers using the Dvorak technique increased by 0.5 every six hours during the storm's development phase. An eye began developing late on January17, and at 1200UTC on January18, MFR upgraded Dina to a tropical cyclone, or {{the equivalent of a}} Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. This was only 36hours after it was first classified as a tropical disturbance, which is much less than the five days most tropical cyclones take. <b>About</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> earlier, the JTWC had also upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status.|$|E
5|$|Before Chataan {{affected}} Guam, officials canceled U.S. Independence Day festivities, {{and residents}} purchased storm supplies. Although {{the center of}} the eye did not strike Guam, the eyewall affected the entire island with strong winds and heavy rainfall. The highest sustained winds were estimated at 120km/h (75mph), with gusts to 167km/h (104mph) at Andersen Air Force Base. Gusts were slightly higher at Apra Harbor, peaking at 170km/h (106mph), and gusts may have reached as high as 200km/h (125mph). Similar to its effects on Chuuk, Chataan dropped heavy rainfall on Guam, peaking at 536mm (21.1in) on Mount Almagosa; the same station reported 311mm (12.2in) in <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> The Weather Forecast Office on the island reported 265mm (10.4in) in a 24-hour period. The rains were less than 250mm (10in) in northern Guam, and were highest in the mountainous southern region where the eye crossed. While moving across the island, Chataan produced a significant storm surge that peaked at about 3.6m (12ft) in Umatac.|$|E

5|$|In mid-June, a mid-level {{center of}} {{circulation}} formed {{in association with}} a quasi-stationary cold front that stretched across northern Florida and the extreme northeast Gulf of Mexico. On June20, a weak and disorganized {{area of low pressure}} developed in conjunction with the front and it passed by Tampa Bay, Florida the following day. Upon moving into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, there was little convection on observed on satellite imagery, although a distinguishable wind-shift was noted by an offshore buoy. However, by June23, the presence of deep convection atop a circulation had become well-defined enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify the disturbance as a tropical depression, while centered 330mi (535km) southwest of Cape Coral, Florida. Moving generally west to west-northwestward across the central Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center sent a reconnaissance plane into the tropical depression at 1500UTC on June24, at which time winds of 60mph (95km/h) were found. <b>About</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie.|$|E
5|$|Late on 28 November 1980, {{the night}} before the team's {{departure}} for Italy, goalkeeper Józef Młynarczyk and forward Włodzimierz Smolarek, both of Widzew Łódź, left the team hotel in Warsaw, the Hotel Vera, without permission. According to Smolarek they did this to get some dinner because they did not like the food at the hotel. They met a friend of Młynarczyk's, sports journalist Wojciech Zieliński, at the Adria nightclub. According to Andrzej Iwan, another member of the team, the main topic of conversation was Zieliński's estranged wife, who had been caught prostituting herself around Warsaw, and had since moved to Italy. Several Poland players knew her, and Młynarczyk had just been to Italy to play for Widzew Łódź against Juventus. According to Iwan, the journalist encouraged Młynarczyk to drink as they talked, hoping the goalkeeper might have news of her. Smolarek left the club around 02:00, but Młynarczyk and Zieliński stayed until <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> later.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} discovery, {{separate}} teams, one led by David Charbonneau including Timothy Brown and others, {{and the other}} by Gregory W. Henry, were able to detect a transit of the planet {{across the surface of}} the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. On September 9 and 16, 1999, Charbonneau's team measured a 1.7% drop in HD209458's brightness, which was attributed to the passage of the planet across the star. On November 8, Henry's team observed a partial transit, seeing only the ingress. Initially unsure of their results, the Henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that Charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in September. Papers from both teams were published simultaneously in the same issue of the Astrophysical Journal. Each transit lasts <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> during which the planet covers about 1.5% of the star's face.|$|E
5|$|The {{face to face}} meeting lasted <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> Hitler {{demanded the}} {{annexation}} of the Sudetenland, and through questioning him, Chamberlain was able to obtain assurances that Hitler had no designs on the remainder of Czechoslovakia or on the areas in Eastern Europe which had German minorities. After the meeting Chamberlain returned to London, believing that he had obtained a breathing space during which agreement could be reached and the peace preserved. Under the proposals made at Berchtesgaden the Sudetenland would be annexed by Germany if a plebiscite in the Sudetenland favoured it. Czechoslovakia would receive international guarantees of its independence which would replace existing treaty obligations—principally the French pledge to the Czechoslovaks. The French agreed to the requirements. Under considerable pressure the Czechoslovaks also agreed, causing the Czechoslovak government to fall.|$|E
5|$|The puzzles grow in {{complexity}} {{by adding}} complications to several simple mechanics. Mechanical enemies and obstacles, such as gun turrets and raisable platforms, are hackable via computer terminals on nearby nodes. The player drags their {{finger on the}} touchscreen to connect the terminal's node and the hackable device. The character can store an invisibility power-up to move without detection while in an enemy's line of sight. When activated, it lasts two turns. The main game runs <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> in length, and the player can purchase puzzle solutions through microtransactions. An additional puzzle design node—also new to the Go series—lets players make single-screen puzzles to share with others. Square Enix highlights five new puzzles in a weekly rotation.
