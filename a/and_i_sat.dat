5|$|Jermaine, Manuel <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{down and}} Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I {{told him the}} feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E

60|$|He slid {{through the}} bushes <b>and</b> disappeared. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> where <b>I</b> was, musing, my work interrupted, {{a mood of}} bitter disillusionment heavy upon me. So <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> {{it may have been}} for hours.|$|R
60|$|I do {{not think}} I watched them go. I only {{remember}} myself left there somehow--horribly empty <b>and</b> alone. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down again <b>and</b> {{fell into a deep}} shapeless musing.|$|R
500|$|She <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{down and}} wrote this song about some serious insecurities {{that we had}} {{when we first started}} down this road with each other, and we both had trust issues. We were getting over it, but we wrote this song about it. And it's perfect. I couldn't be happier about that song and the way it came about and the honest way ... It is like people getting a look at {{something}} personal for the first time.|$|E
500|$|On the {{direction}} of the film, Selick reflected, [...] "It's as though he [...] laid the egg, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job {{to make it look like}} 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films." [...] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, [...] "I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total." [...] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I went to this restaurant <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|E
60|$|She went--as docile as a well-trained child; she was {{a curious}} mixture of {{tractability}} <b>and</b> firmness: <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> thinking about her, and wondering what her plan could be, when she re-entered.|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} ceased talking and fell fast asleep, leaving me awake, {{seated on a}} chest with my face bent over my knees between my hands. <b>And</b> there <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> till at length the dull beating against the ship's bows, and the silence around soothed me down, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fell asleep as <b>I</b> <b>sat.</b>|$|R

500|$|The {{release of}} the duet was first {{announced}} via Stefani's Twitter account, where she posted the album notes of If I'm Honest, which revealed her name in the track listing. In an interview with People, Shelton expressed that {{the best part of}} the duet was [...] "the honest way it came about". He stated: [...] "There's not a third ghost writer, there's not five writers on it. It's just she <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down and wrote this song [...] and I couldn't be happier about [...]" [...] He further explained that the song was written about [...] "some serious insecurities that we had when we first started down this road with each other"; he called the end result [...] "perfect". The concept for [...] "Go Ahead and Break My Heart" [...] was developed by both singers, and began with Shelton writing the first verse, followed by Stefani creating the second, which Shelton described: ...|$|E
500|$|She {{had just}} taken on a steady job working for Marianne Faithfull and John Dunbar as the nanny to their little boy Nicholas, and it was while taking care of Nicholas in Marianne’s third floor Chelsea flat that she first {{encountered}} Paul McCartney. He buzzed the intercom to ask if John (Dunbar) was around, and when Paul explained who he was, Maggie invited him straight up. “Paul ran {{up the stairs and}} came in. Very casually I told him that John wasn’t really in and that sent us both into hysterics. We were laughing and chatting. I made a nice lunch for Marianne and a bunch of her friends but they never showed up. Paul <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> together and ate it instead. I’ll never forget the meal – it was chicken casserole. It was such a funny introduction that it threw us both off guard. It could have been very embarrassing, but there was an immediate rapport and we just couldn’t stop talking.” ...|$|E
500|$|Swift was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick later went on to join the Navy. During their freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in a class everyday. The two developed a fond friendship, although Swift secretively desired for it to become a romantic relationship. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about a girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, [...] "How beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> there and listened, never meaning it any of the times I said 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'" [...] Hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of Taylor Swift, he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or the song and continued his relationship with the same female. Upon [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward to call back.|$|E
5000|$|Last night I {{went with}} you and watched a tearjerker, {{although}} I wanted to watch [...] "bang bang". <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> listening to a string quartet - me, I only used to like [...] "twang twang".|$|R
60|$|As Charley was at {{her writing}} again in my room in the evening, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{opposite}} to her at work, I felt the table tremble. Looking up, I saw my little maid shivering from head to foot.|$|R
60|$|When the day {{was within}} an hour of its close, I {{suddenly}} became aware that the old soldier was stripping the fringe from his shirt, <b>and</b> immediately <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> bolt upright, fancying for the moment that he had lost his reason.|$|R

"The {{first night}} I saw dailies," [...] replied art {{director}} Wallace, [...] "projected on a bedsheet in the producer's ratty apartment… My jaw dropped <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up so straight I {{cast a shadow}} with my head.

2500|$|The music {{came from}} Brian Wilson's first {{psychedelic}} experience. He was quoted saying in 1986, [...] " [...] something I'm {{very proud of}} in a sense because it represents the Beach Boys really greatest record production we’ve ever made. It goes back to 1965 when I was sitting in my apartment, wondering {{how to write a}} song about girls, because I love girls. I mean, everybody loves girls." [...] He added in 2007, [...] "I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an hour. I got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that." [...] Inspiration came from the rhythm of [...] "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". In 2015, he explained: [...] "'California Girls' had that beat — it's called a shuffle beat — and that's definitely a Bach influence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crazy Horse spoke {{this story}} to Flying Hawk: ‘I {{was sitting on a}} hill or rise, and {{something}} touched me on the head. [...] I felt for it and found {{it was a bit of}} grass. I took it to look at. [...] There was a trail nearby and I followed it. [...] It led to water. [...] I went into the water. There the trail ended <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down in the water. [...] I was nearly out of breath. I started to rise out of the water, and when I came out I was born by my mother. When I was born I could know and see and understand for a time, but afterwards went back to it as a baby. [...] Then I grew up naturally. [...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse. [...] We jumped on him, my brother and I double, and escaped." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{had been}} to Brooklyn several times on errands for the firm, so I knew the streets quite well. But fearful of being seen, I passed close to the wharves, and finally came to a lumber yard, <b>and</b> here <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down.|$|R
