50|$|In each {{of these}} situations, being {{able to figure out}} the way to make the <b>advice</b> <b>system</b> most {{efficient}} and productive has clear benefits. Understanding the most effective ways to give advice has great potential in training programs for advisors, mentors, and in management training as a whole. An example of such application is seen in the work by Wilkins et al. (1999) {{on the development of the}} Raven and CoRaven decision-making aids used by the military to filter and represent massive amounts of battlefield data for strategic planning. Using principles derived from JAS research, the authors were able to analyze and better understand the aids, with the result being a more effective system that makes battlefield decision-making less of a risky process. In this situation, the researchers treated the intelligent software as an advisor, and the commanding officer as the judge. Under this assumption, the researchers then applied past and current JAS research findings to critically evaluate the software with the hopes of improving its functionality. This utilization of JAS research is an example of one of the most promising and direct applications of the paradigm- collaborative technology, which can facilitate decision-making processes that are too complex for human cognition alone.|$|E

40|$|Modeling {{offers a}} {{promising}} form of constructivist learning for students. By making and executing models of dynamic systems {{in a computer}} environment, students are stimulated {{to learn about the}} specific domain that is modeled as well as about the process of modeling in general. However, learning by modeling also leads to characteristic student mistakes, based on a combination of faulty domain knowledge and insufficient modeling skills. In this article, we describe a method of generating advice to students during their modeling process. The on-line <b>advice</b> <b>system</b> was informed by our observations of a teacher who gave advice via a textual communication tool to students building models with a System Dynamics model editor. The first version of the on-line <b>advice</b> <b>system</b> was evaluated in two ways: first, three teachers evaluated the advice the system generated for students’ final solutions; second, we analyzed the advice the system provided as it was used by a sample of students who were building a physics model. These evaluations showed that the overall approach, including matching a student solution to a family of reference solutions together with the other mechanisms of the <b>advice</b> <b>system,</b> is valid. However, they also highlighted the difficulty of building ‘intelligent’ support to help students to improve their models and gain modeling expertise.

Among the Train Management Systems, the ERTMS has attracted the most attention (followed by the much lower ranked Railway Signalling Systems, CTCS and PTC, respectively) (see {{the results of the}} pairwise comparison matrix in Fig. 5). Further, ATP has the greatest importance within the Automatic Train Control Systems, followed by ATO and ATS.

40|$|Abstract—The group {{decision-making}} framework with linguistic preference {{relations is}} studied. In this context, {{we assume that}} there exist several experts who may have different background and knowledge to solve a particular problem and, therefore, different linguistic term sets (multigranular linguistic information) {{could be used to}} express their opinions. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a model of consensus support system to assist the experts in all phases of the consensus reaching process of group decision-making problems with multigranular linguistic preference relations. This consensus support system model is based on i) a multigranular linguistic methodology, ii) two consensus criteria, consensus degrees and proximity measures, and iii) a guidance <b>advice</b> <b>system.</b> The multigranular linguistic methodology permits the unification of the different linguistic domains to facilitate the calculus of consensus degrees and proximity measures on the basis of experts ’ opinions. The consensus degrees assess the agreement amongst all the experts ’ opinions, while the proximity measures are used to find out how far the individual opinions are from the group opinion. The guidance <b>advice</b> <b>system</b> integrated in the consensus support system model acts as a feedback mechanism, and it is based on a set of advice rules to help the experts change their opinions and to find out which direction that change should follow in order to obtain the highest degree of consensus possible. There are two main advantages provided by this model of consensus support system. Firstly, its ability to cope with group decision-making problems with multigranular linguistic preference relations, and, secondly, the figure of the moderator, traditionally presents in the consensus reaching process, is replaced by the guidance <b>advice</b> <b>system,</b> and in such a way, the whole group decision-making process is automated.

40|$|AbstractToday {{one of the}} {{disadvantages}} of electric vehicles is still the lower driving range in comparison to conventional vehicles resulting in subjective fear of drivers not to reach their destination. One approach to extend the driving range {{is to change the}} driver behaviour to a more efficient and intelligent way in terms of energy usage in certain driving situations. To realize a change in driver behaviour it is necessary to support and motivate drivers by means of driving advice and situation preview. This paper introduces a visual and haptic on-trip Human Machine Interface (HMI) for electric vehicles, developed with the purpose to lead drivers to a range optimized way of driving, and the results of the associated driving simulator study about the impact of that HMI on such a range optimized way of driving in electric vehicles. The HMI presented in this paper is the result of an iterative development process with several sub studies and consists of many elements to support the driver in a range optimized way of driving. Central element of the visual HMI is a preview and <b>advice</b> <b>system</b> that provides drivers with information about the current and upcoming situation and advice. It is complemented by visual feedback elements that e. g. rate the efficiency of the current driving style. The visual advice is supported by haptic advice elements like a continuous haptic feedback on the acceleration pedal, when the driver exceeds the speed limit respectively an eco friendly speed, and a “recuperation” advice that provides a pulsation of the acceleration pedal at the time of an optimal start of recuperation manoeuvres regarding energy efficiency. The haptic advice is provided by a force feedback pedal. The impact study was conducted in ika‘s static driving simulator with twenty-seven subjects. Beside an objective evaluation of the driving parameters, an introductory interview on demographic data and driving experiences as well as questionnaires on the acceptance of three different HMI versions (no advice, visual advice & preview, visual & haptic advice & preview) are evaluated. The evaluation shows a positive impact of the developed visual as well as visual & haptic advice and preview system on a range optimized way of driving in electric vehicles. Hereby the visual-haptic <b>advice</b> <b>system</b> showed compared to a baseline (without advice) and a visual <b>advice</b> <b>system</b> the biggest impact on the driving behaviour...|$|E
