25|$|<b>Adrenoleukodystrophy,</b> a {{rare and}} fatal {{disorder}} that is carried by the mother on the x-cell. It affects only boys {{between the ages of}} 5 and 10 and destroys the protective cell surrounding the nerves, myelin, in the brain. The female carrier hardly shows any symptoms because females have a copy of the x-cell. This disorder causes a once healthy boy to lose all abilities to walk, talk, see, hear, and even swallow. Within 2 years after diagnosis, most boys with <b>Adrenoleukodystrophy</b> die.|$|E
25|$|Peroxisomal {{disorders}} are {{a class of}} medical conditions that typically affect the human nervous system {{as well as many}} other organ systems. Two common examples are X-linked <b>adrenoleukodystrophy</b> and peroxisome biogenesis disorders.|$|E
25|$|In September {{researchers}} {{were able to}} give trichromatic vision to squirrel monkeys. In November 2009, researchers halted a fatal genetic disorder called <b>adrenoleukodystrophy</b> in two children using a lentivirus vector to deliver a functioning version of ABCD1, the gene that is mutated in the disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adrenoleukodystrophy</b> is {{a disease}} linked to the X chromosome. It {{is a result of}} fatty acid buildup caused by the {{relevant}} enzymes not functioning properly, which then causes damage to the myelin sheaths of the nerves, resulting in seizures and hyperactivity. Other side effects include problems with speaking, listening, and understanding verbal instructions.|$|E
25|$|Early {{clinical}} failures led to dismissals of gene therapy. Clinical successes since 2006 regained researchers' attention, although as of 2014, it {{was still}} largely an experimental technique. These include treatment of retinal diseases Leber's congenital amaurosis and choroideremia, X-linked SCID, ADA-SCID, <b>adrenoleukodystrophy,</b> chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma, haemophilia, and Parkinson's disease. Between 2013 and April 2014, US companies invested over $600 million in the field.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of ABC {{transporters}} {{have been}} characterized from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. ABC genes {{are essential for}} many processes in the cell, and mutations in human genes cause or contribute to several human genetic diseases. Forty eight ABC genes {{have been reported in}} humans. Among these, many have been characterized and shown to be causally related to diseases present in humans such as cystic fibrosis, <b>adrenoleukodystrophy,</b> Stargardt disease, drug-resistant tumors, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Byler’s disease, progressive familiar intrahepatic cholestasis, X-linked sideroblastic anemia, ataxia, and persistent and hyperinsulimenic hypoglycemia. ABC transporters are also involved in multiple drug resistance, and this is how some of them were first identified. When the ABC transport proteins are overexpressed in cancer cells, they can export anticancer drugs and render tumors resistant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adrenoleukodystrophy</b> (ALD) {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} {{of the brain that}} occurs only in males. The fatal condition destroys the nervous system, often leaving the victim unable to walk, and talk normally. For many years ALD took the lives of many and continues to do so today. In 1987, Augusto and Michaela Odone, parents of a child affected by ALD, invented Lorenzo’s oil as a treatment for the disease. Their story was in the 1992 Universal Studios motion picture, Lorenzo's Oil, starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon. Dr. Hugo Moser, a renowned scientist at Kennedy Krieger Institute, joined forces with the Odone's, ultimately proving that their treatment, Lorenzo's oil, can prevent the onset of ALD if begun before neurological symptoms appear. Moser and colleagues also created the first diagnostic test for ALD, as well as a newborn screening test that can detect the disease from birth. On January 20, 2007 Dr. Hugo Moser died of complications from surgery to treat pancreatic cancer. Today, Dr. Moser's wife Ann B. Moser, continues this important work at Kennedy Krieger. In 2008, she helped to launch a pilot study to screen for ALD in 5000 newborns born in local Baltimore hospitals, the results of which will be used to advocate for nationwide newborn screening for this devastating disorder.|$|E
25|$|Human ABC {{transporters}} {{are involved}} in several diseases that arise from polymorphisms in ABC genes and rarely due to complete loss of function of single ABC proteins. Such diseases include Mendelian diseases and complex genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, <b>adrenoleukodystrophy,</b> Stargardt disease, Tangier disease, immune deficiencies, progressive familial intraheptic cholestasis, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to focal adenomatous hyperplasia, X-linked sideroblastosis and anemia, age-related macular degeneration, familial hypoapoproteinemia, Retinitis pigmentosum, cone rod dystrophy, and others. The human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family is responsible for multiple drug resistance (MDR) against a variety of structurally unrelated drugs. ABCB1 or MDR1 P-glycoprotein is also involved in other biological processes for which lipid transport is the main function. It is found to mediate the secretion of the steroid aldosterone by the adrenals, and its inhibition blocked the migration of dendritic immune cells, possibly related to the outward transport of the lipid platelet activating factor (PAF). It has also been reported that ABCB1 mediates transport of cortisol and dexamethasone, but not of progesterone in ABCB1 transfected cells. MDR1 can also transport cholesterol, short-chain and long-chain analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), sphingomyelin (SM), and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Multispecific transport of diverse endogenous lipids through the MDR1 transporter can possibly affect the transbilayer distribution of lipids, in particular of species normally predominant on the inner plasma membrane leaflet such as PS and PE.|$|E
2500|$|The ABCD {{subfamily}} {{consists of}} four genes that encode half transporters expressed exclusively in the peroxisome. [...] ABCD1 {{is responsible for the}} X-linked form of <b>Adrenoleukodystrophy</b> (ALD) which is a disease characterized by neurodegeneration and adrenal deficiency that typically is initiated in late childhood. [...] The cells of ALD patients feature accumulation of unbranched saturated fatty acids, but the exact role of ABCD1 in the process is still undetermined. [...] In addition, the function of other ABCD genes have yet to be determined but have been thought to exert related functions in fatty acid metabolism.|$|E
2500|$|As {{treatments}} improve, {{newborn screening}} becomes {{a possibility for}} disorders that could benefit from early intervention, but none was previously available. [...] <b>Adrenoleukodystrophy</b> (ALD), a peroxisomal disease that has a variable clinical presentation {{is one of the}} disorders that has become a target for those seeking to identify patients early. [...] ALD can present in several different forms, some of which do not present until adulthood, making it a difficult choice for countries to add to screening programs. [...] The most successful treatment option is a stem cell transplant, a procedure that carries a significant risk.|$|E
2500|$|Since males {{only have}} one copy of the X chromosome, all {{expressed}} X-chromosomal genes (or alleles, {{in the case of}} multiple variant forms for a given gene in the population) are located on that copy of the chromosome. Females, however, will primarily express the genes or alleles located on the X-chromosomal copy that remains active. Considering the situation for one gene or multiple genes causing individual differences in a particular phenotype (i.e., causing variation observed in the population for that phenotype), in homozygous females it doesn’t particularly matter which copy of the chromosome is inactivated, as the alleles on both copies are the same. However, in [...] females that are heterozygous at the causal genes, the inactivation of one copy of the chromosome over the other can have a direct impact on their phenotypic value. Because of this phenomenon, there is an observed increase in phenotypic variation in females that are heterozygous at the involved gene or genes than in females that are homozygous at that gene or those genes. There are many different ways in which the phenotypic variation can play out. In many cases, heterozygous females may be asymptomatic or only present minor symptoms of a given disorder, such as with X-linked <b>adrenoleukodystrophy.</b>|$|E
