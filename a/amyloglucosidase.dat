After showing indirectly, by means of measuring experimental gingivitis and caries parameters, that mouth rinses containing <b>amyloglucosidase</b> (γ-amylase) and glucose oxidase activate the lactoperoxidase system, the protective mechanism of the enzymes in oral care products has been partially elucidated. Enzymes such as lysozyme, lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase are transferred from the tooth pastes to the pellicle. Being components of the pellicle, these enzymes are catalytically highly active. Also, as part of tooth pastes, the lactoperoxidase system has a beneficial influence to avoid early childhood caries by reducing the number of colonies formed by the cariogenic microflora while increasing the thiocyanate concentration. With xerostomia patients, tooth pastes with the lactoperoxidase system are seemingly superior to fluoride-containing tooth pastes with respect to plaque formation and gingivitis. More studies are required to examine further the protective mechanisms.|$|E

Protease caused a progressive increase of surface roughness. Large depressions surrounded by protruding edges, approximately 50 nm in height, were formed and attributed to {{the erosion of the}} mannoprotein outer layer. By contrast, no modification of the cell surface was noted upon addition of <b>amyloglucosidase,</b> which was consistent with the cell wall biochemical composition. These results indicate that AFM is a complementary tool to electron microscopy in that it allows the surface of living cells to be explored directly in real time...|$|E
40|$|Bioethanol {{is known}} as a viable {{alternative}} fuel to solve both energy and environmental crises. This study used response surface methodology based on the Box-Behnken experimental design to obtain the optimum conditions for and quality of bioethanol production. Enzymatic hydrolysis optimization was performed with selected hydrolysis parameters, including substrate loading, stroke speed, α-amylase concentration and <b>amyloglucosidase</b> concentration. From the experiment, the resulting optimum conditions are 23. 88 % (w/v) substrate loading, 109. 43 U/g α-amylase concentration, 65. 44 U/mL <b>amyloglucosidase</b> concentration and 74. 87 rpm stroke speed, which yielded 196. 23 g/L reducing sugar. The fermentation process was also carried out, with a production value of 0. 45 g ethanol/g reducing sugar, which is equivalent to 88. 61 % of ethanol yield after fermentation by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). The physical and chemical properties of the produced ethanol are within the specifications of the ASTM D 4806 standard. The good quality of ethanol produced from this study indicates that Manihot glaziovii (M. glaziovii) has great potential as bioethanol feedstock...|$|E
