5|$|The 1930 season saw the Australians tour England, Bradman's first tour. Over five Tests, {{the young}} Australian scored 974 runs in <b>a</b> <b>flawless</b> batting display to break Hammond's record run {{aggregate}} and average {{set in the}} 1928–29 series. While Bradman dominated, Hammond found {{it very difficult to}} play the leg spin bowling of Clarrie Grimmett, who dismissed him five times. Hammond scored 306 runs at an average of 34.00, passing fifty just twice. He batted over five hours for a match-saving 113 in the third Test. On a difficult pitch and with little support, he made a hard-hitting 60 in the final Test in a losing cause. The visitors took the series 2–1, and the newspapers unfavourably compared Hammond's scoring with Bradman's. Later in the season, Hammond scored 89 for Gloucestershire in a tied match against the Australians which he described as the most exciting of his career. One player said that he had never seen Hammond as excited as he was {{at the conclusion of the}} game. In all first-class cricket that season, he scored 2,032 runs (average 53.47) and for Gloucestershire, he came top of the batting averages as the club finished second in the Championship. He took 30 wickets, including match figures of 12 for 74 against Glamorgan.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} NBA full season (1957–58), Russell {{became the first}} player in NBA history to average more than 20 rebounds per game for an entire season, a feat he {{accomplished}} 10 times in his 13 seasons. Russell's 51 rebounds in a single game is the second-highest performance ever, only trailing Chamberlain's all-time record of 55. He still holds the NBA record for rebounds in one half with 32 (vs. Philadelphia, on November 16, 1957). Career-wise in rebounds, Russell ranks second to Wilt Chamberlain in regular season total (21,620) and average per game (22.5), and he led the NBA in average rebounds per game four times. Russell is the all-time playoff leader in total (4,104) and average (24.9) rebounds per game, he grabbed 40 rebounds in three separate playoff games (twice in the NBA Finals), and he never failed to average at least 20 rebounds per game in any of his 13 post-season campaigns. Russell also had seven regular season games with 40 or more rebounds, the NBA Finals record for highest rebound per game average (29.5 rpg, 1959) and by a rookie (22.9 rpg, 1957). In addition, Russell holds the NBA Finals single-game record for most rebounds (40, March 29, 1960, vs. St. Louis, and April 18, 1962, vs. Los Angeles), most rebounds in a quarter (19, April 18, 1962 vs. Los Angeles), and most consecutive games with 20 or more rebounds (15 from April 9, 1960 – April 16, 1963). He also had 51 in one game, 49 in two others, and twelve straight seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds. Russell was {{known as one of}} the most clutch players in the NBA. He played in 11 deciding games (10 times in Game 7s, once in a Game 5), and ended with <b>a</b> <b>flawless</b> 11–0 record. In these eleven games, Russell averaged 18 points and 29.45 rebounds.|$|E

500|$|Roger Travis, {{associate}} professor of classics at the University of Connecticut, compared the Master Chief to the epic hero Aeneas, in that both superhuman characters save a civilization by defeating strong enemies in a martial setting.

Matthew Stover compared Halo to the Iliad, saying that both stories share the meta-theme that [...] "war is the crucible of character". As military science fiction, Halo further raises the issue of being human. Stover argued that, since players are to imagine themselves as the Master Chief, the character is correctly presented as a cyborg, neither <b>a</b> <b>flawless</b> machine nor fully human. Players would be unable to empathize with the former, and the latter would be too specifically developed.
