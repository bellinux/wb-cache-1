40|$|The bar or <b>net</b> <b>screens</b> {{are ones}} {{of the methods}} to {{increase}} protection level of military vehicle crews against anti-tank grenades fired from RPG- 7. Their task is to prevent generation of the shaped charge jet. The probability of vehicle's protection level when applying such types of screens depends on their structure- percentage share of the open space, i. e. space for which the flying grenade will not touch the structure element with its fuse, {{but it will be}} destructed. The two mechanisms are here mainly used: short circuit in the fuse circuit, deformation of conical section of the shaped charge warhead. This article presents analysis of structure of the bar and <b>net</b> <b>screens</b> due to share of the open space, for various impact angle of grenade in elevation and azimuth. The following were changed: thickness and width of bars and distance between them, thickness of wire and shape of individual net mesh. The solution of bar screen with the lowest weight and grenade destruction ability was selected. This solution was compared with the <b>net</b> <b>screen</b> offered currently on the market For the selected solutions, for angles increasing in elevation, up to 300 value, the bar screen has the larger open space than <b>net</b> <b>screen.</b> For angles in azimuth, the bar screen has larger open space for the entire range of angles. The bar screen is heavier by 50 - 60 % when compared to the selected <b>net</b> <b>screens,</b> but their operation costs are lower. They are repaired in field condition...|$|R

Cross-sectional surveys quantified infestations of adult mosquitoes, immature stages at baseline (pre-intervention) and in four post-intervention samples at 6 -monthly intervals. Identical surveys were carried out in 10 control clusters that received no treatment. Results LLIS clusters had significantly lower infestations compared to control clusters at 5 and 12 months after installation, as measured by adult (male and female) and pupal-based vector indices. After addition of TT to the intervention houses in intervention clusters, indices remained significantly lower in the treated clusters until 18 (immature and adult stage indices) and 24 months (adult indices only) post-intervention.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} and use two novel {{procedures}} {{for the analysis of}} microarray gene expression data. The first is correspondence analysis which visualizes the relationship between genes and tissues as two 2 dimensional graphs, oriented so that distances between genes are preserved, distances between tissues are preserved, and so that genes which primarily distinguish certain types of tissue are spatially close to those tissues. For the inference of genetic links, partial correlations rather than correlations are the key issue. A partial correlation between i and j is the relationship between i and j after the effect of surrounding genes has been subtracted out of their pairwise correlation. This leads to the area of graphical modeling. A limitation of the graphical modeling approach is that the correlation matrix of expression profiles between genes is degenerate whenever the number of genes to be analyzed exceeds the number of distinct expression measurements. This can cause considerable problems, as calculation of partial correlations typically uses the inverse of the correlation matrix. To avoid this limitation, we propose two practical multiple regression procedures with variable selection to measure the <b>net,</b> <b>screened,</b> relationship between pairs of genes. Possible biases arising from the analysis of a subset of genes from the genome are examined in the worked examples. It seems that both these approaches are more natural ways of analyzing gene expression data than the currently popular approach of two way clustering...|$|R

40|$|<b>Nets,</b> <b>screens,</b> and {{filters are}} used to sieve out {{particles}} larger than the pore sizes. However, during separation a significant fraction of particles smaller than the pore diameters will also be removed by collision and adhesion to the mesh fibers. Two filtration models were used to predict the size and mass distributions of particles during size separation. A capillary tube model was used to calculate particle removal by different screens, and a fibrous filter model was used for glass-fiber filters. The extent of particle removal was modeled assuming a size distribution of 3, 100 particles evenly distributed at log-arithmic intervals over 3 1 size classes ranging from 0. 1 to 100 pm. As many as 8 % of the particles and 50 % of the total particle mass could be retained by a 210 -pm (pore diam) mesh even though all particles were < 100 pm. This high retention of particles implies that when size distributions are prepared with screens and filters, the mass concentration in smaller size fractions will be considerably underestimated. Screens and filters are routinely used by aquatic scientists to separate and concentrate material (e. g. Mullin 1965; Malone 197 1). By passing water samples {{through a series of}} screens, samples can be separated into differ-ent size distributions and further analyzed. For example, Back et al. (199 1) size-fractionated lake-water samples through 5 3 - and 1 O-pm Ni-tex nets and determined the distribution of Chl a and other photosynthetic parameters. Sim-ilarly, Azam and Hodson (1977) used different pore-diameter Nuclepore and Millipore filters to separate marine bacteria according to size. A body of literature on filtration has been developed to predict removal of colloidal aero-sol particles by filters, but these models have not been applied to size fractionation of aquat-ic samples with screens and filters. Two dif-ferent approaches have been used to construct these models. The first considers the filter to be a bundle of fibers (e. g. models by Fuch...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{the success of}} {{long-lasting}} insecticidal nets (LLINs) in African countries has been countered by the rapid development of pyrethroid resistance in vector mosquitoes. Few studies have investigated the efficacy of LLINs in areas in which vector mosquitoes are resistant to pyrethroids. The use of excito-repellency chemicals may be bio-rational, because this type of repellency does not induce physiological resistance. However, limited information {{is available on the}} relationship between the mode of insecticide resistance and excito-repellency in pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. The aims of the present study were to investigate (1) differences in reactions to LLINs between individual and populations of vector mosquitos in an area in which multimodal pyrethroid resistance has developed, (2) the effects of LLINs on these malaria vectors, and (3) the development of new control techniques to supplement LLINs. Laboratory contact tests for repellency showed that resistant species governed by kdr (knockdown resistance) (Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s. s.)) lost repellency to pyrethroids, whereas those lacking kdr (Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus s. s.) maintained strong repellency irrespective of whether they possessed cytochrome P 450 -related metabolic resistance factors. LLINs were effective against these pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors because they limited feeding on humans overnight. However, notable time shifts in human blood-feeding activity developed in An. arabiensis and An. funestus s. s., but not in An. gambiae s. s. These time shifts may be partially explained by differences in repellency by pyrethroids for these species. LLINs may not be effective because most blood feeding occurs when people are active outside of bed <b>nets.</b> <b>Screening</b> eaves with pyrethroid-impregnated wide-mesh nets was found to be effective in reducing human exposure to malaria vectors. The excito-repellency of pyrethroids, which act as a spatial barrier or reduce the feeding motivation of mosquitoes, may represent another countermeasure.

An aqueous foam is currently being developed and evaluated by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) as a Less-Than-Lethal Weapon for the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the toxicity of the aqueous foam developed for the NIJ and to determine whether there are any significant adverse health effects associated with completely immersing individuals without protective equipment in the foam. The toxicity of the aqueous foam formulation developed for NIJ is determined by evaluating the toxicity of the individual components of the foam. The foam is made from a 2 [...] 5 % solution of Steol CA- 330 surfactant in water generated at expansion ratios ranging from 500 : 1 to 1000 : 1. SteoI CA- 330 is a 35 % ammonium laureth sulfate in water and is produced by Stepan Chemical Company and containing trace amounts (< 0. 1 %) of 1, 4 -dioxane. The results of this study indicate that Steol CA- 330 is a non-toxic, mildly irritating, surfactant that is used extensively in the cosmetics industry for hair care and bath products. Inhalation or dermal exposure to this material in aqueous foam is not expected to produce significant irritation or systemic toxicity to exposed individuals, even after prolonged exposure. The amount of 1, 4 -dioxane in the surfactant, and subsequently in the foam, is negligible and therefore, the toxicity associated with dioxane exposure is not significant.
