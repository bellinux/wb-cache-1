5|$|During filming, Bale became {{angry with}} {{director}} of photography Shane Hurlbut for walking onto a set during a scene; he swore <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> at Hurlbut {{and threatened to}} leave the film. Audio of Bale's tirade leaked {{to the public and}} went viral. Bale apologized publicly and said he resolved his differences with Hurlbut, explaining that he sometimes has a problem with someone walking on set, and that when the incident took place they continued to work together for a number of hours that day.|$|E
5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, Demeter was searching for her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.|$|E

5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E

25|$|Emoviolence is a stylistic {{fusion of}} screamo and powerviolence. The name was coined {{half-jokingly}} by In/Humanity. Recognizable elements of emoviolence are its incorporation of amplified feedback and blast beats; {{the music is}} highly dissonant and chaotic, generally featuring fast tempos, shouting, <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> vocals. Emoviolence practitioners include Pg. 99, Orchid, Reversal Of Man, Usurp Synapse, RentAmerica, and In/Humanity.|$|E

25|$|One {{of their}} {{trademarks}} {{is the use}} of custom-built instruments, predominantly made out of scrap metal and building tools, and noises, in addition to standard musical instruments. Their early albums were unremittingly harsh, with Bargeld's vocals shouted <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> above a din of banging and scraping metal percussion. Subsequent recordings found the group's sound growing somewhat more conventional, yet still containing many unorthodox elements.|$|E

25|$|When the Lords of the Council {{came for}} her, she panicked <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> aloud, as they manhandled {{her into the}} waiting barge that would escort her to the Tower on Friday 10 February 1542, her {{flotilla}} passing under London Bridge where the heads of Culpeper and Dereham were impaled (and remained until 1546). Entering through the Traitors' Gate she was led to her prison cell. The next day, the bill of attainder received Royal Assent, and Catherine's execution was scheduled for 7:00 am on Monday, 13 February 1542. Arrangements for the execution were supervised by Sir John Gage {{in his role as}} Constable of the Tower.|$|E
25|$|Power {{electronics}} {{was originally}} coined by William Bennett for the noise music {{of his own}} project Whitehouse. It consists of screeching waves of feedback, analogue synthesizers making sub-bass pulses or high frequency squealing sounds, <b>and</b> <b>screamed,</b> distorted, often hateful and offensive lyrics. Deeply atonal, there are no conventional melodies or rhythms. Members of Whitehouse who began other projects, such as Sutcliffe Jügend, also practice power electronics. Death industrial is a similar style associated with groups such as The Grey Wolves, but the term first referred to artists such as Brighter Death Now. The Swedish label Cold Meat Industry issued the releases in this subgenre.|$|E

25|$|Lagun Ein {{was not yet}} off the hook. The king {{assigned}} him to lead {{another attempt}} on Minkhaung. Lagun Ein led a team of 12 commandos to infiltrate the Ava camp. The team made it inside the camp from the lightly guarded north side. He and five men managed to get inside the Ava king's quarters. But the plan was foiled when a concubine of Minkhaung saw them <b>and</b> <b>screamed.</b> She was killed but the king escaped. Lagun Ein and his men took Minkhaung's ruby-studded royal sword and gold-plated betel nut chest. They barely escaped. When they got back, Saw Pyei Chantha, Minkhaung's daughter who had been captured in early 1408 and put in Razadarit's harem, identified that the sword and the chest were her father's. Although the second attempt did not succeed, Razadarit forgave Lagun Ein, and let him live.|$|E
25|$|Demeter's {{search for}} her {{daughter}} Persephone {{took her to the}} palace of Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. She assumed the form of an old woman, and asked him for shelter. He took her in, to nurse Demophon and Triptolemus, his sons by Metanira. To reward his kindness, she planned to make Demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with ambrosia and laid him in the flames of the hearth, to gradually burn away his mortal self. But Metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> in fright. Demeter abandoned the attempt. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he in turn taught them to any who wished to learn them. Thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain. The myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as Eleusis, Rarus and Trochilus. The Demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above {{the roar of the}} water she heard him call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of the}} river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E

25|$|In mid-January {{when the}} boy band Fahrenheit were guests on the Chinese program, Super Winners (超级大赢家), fans had filed {{complaints}} toward the host, Frankie Kao, for his disrespectful and careless attitude towards Fahrenheit and their fans. Fans listed their arguments, criticizing Kao for being contemptuous; before the program was to be recorded Fahrenheit and their fans {{had to wait for}} over two hours because Kao had to practice his dance for the opening; when Aaron Yan accidentally had his eyes burnt by fireworks, Kao completely ignored his injury and continued on with the program. When fans began to worry and cry, he became annoyed <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> at the fans to shut up. Fans also complained that when Fahrenheit was dancing, Kao had caused them to NG many times and therefore they were required to dance several more times. Fans witnessed an extremely exhausted Jiro Wang, who was {{almost to the point of}} collapsing after dancing. The ill Wu Chun was also a victim; fans had witnessed Kao requiring Wu to do health-risking activities when Wu was sick with a fever.|$|E
25|$|The {{band was}} first formed in 1991 by Jonas Renkse and Anders Nyström as a two piece studio-based project. Renkse would provide clean <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> vocals and drums, while Nystrom would provide all bass and guitars. Renkse {{was the primary}} lyricist, while Nystrom was the primary music composer. The duo had been working {{together}} with music in some capacity since 1987, but became serious about making music in 1991, when they began work on their first release, the demo Jhva Elohim Meth... The Revival. The release, along with the next few subsequent releases by the band, were of the death/doom metal sound, with the members being inspired and influenced {{by the rise of}} death metal becoming popular in Europe at the time. The release was enough of a hit in the underground metal scene to garner the attention of a small music label, Vic Records, which re-released it as an EP in 1993, which helped gain more exposure for the duo. The newfound popularity found them recruiting a bass guitarist, Guillaume Le Huche, so the trio could play live performances, and returning to the studio to recreate a debut full-length album. The resulting work, Dance of December Souls, was released in late 1993. The album's bleak melancholy and despair of their sound, continued to give them the classification of death/doom.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E
