The December 23, 1949 episode of Life of Riley saw the show's protagonist Chester Riley {{attempting}} to withdraw his US$2 Christmas club money but discovering his account has accumulated {{a variety of}} fees including one for the passbook, another for early withdrawal, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>another</b> for the bank's mailed reminders.

5|$|Following {{several more}} troubled months, Jackson {{ended up in}} the hospital; he had {{collapsed}} while rehearsing for a concert in New York.

The argument ended after Jackson warned her that she was making his heart rate go up and asked her to leave. She obliged, and was admonished by a doctor and Jackson's mother Katherine along the way. Presley subsequently returned to Los Angeles. Upon being discharged from hospital, Jackson went to Disneyland Paris to recover.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} {{panic in}} Polish ranks convinced Muraviev to renew his assault with fresh forces, despite the losses his columns had suffered. Col. Lukash's grenadiers reinforced with two battalions of the Finnish Guards Regiment (1,300 men, four guns) outflanked Fort 73 {{from the north}} and captured a brickyard <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>another</b> fortified inn, the Karczma Żelazna directly to its rear. Its garrison offered only light resistance before retreating in disarray. The situation seemed critical, as the Russians were now in possession of {{a large part of the}} second line of Polish defences.|$|E

5|$|Boniface and his {{elder brother}} Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy, were sons of Thomas I, Count of Savoy, and Margaret of Geneva. He is thus {{not to be}} {{confused}} with his nephew, and fellow member of the House of Savoy, Count Boniface of Savoy, the son of Amadeus IV. The elder Boniface was born about 1207 in Savoy. He was the eleventh child of his parents. Some sources state that at a young age he joined the Carthusian Order. However, there is no evidence of this, and it would have been very unusual for a nobleman to enter that order with its very strict discipline. He also had a brother Peter of Savoy who was named Earl of Richmond in 1240 <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>another</b> brother William of Savoy, who was Bishop of Valence and a candidate to be Bishop of Winchester in England.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} battle of San Lorenzo is {{acknowledged}} in Argentine historiography as an important battle for Argentine independence, it had little military influence in the conflict. Much of the recognition the battle generated is because San Martín fought in it, as {{the size of the}} forces involved and the length of the clash would normally mean it was considered a military engagement rather than a real battle and it did not influence the development of the Argentine War of Independence. This victory did nothing to prevent further raids from royalist ships as there were new raids at Tigre on August 18, 1813 <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>another</b> one at San Fernando on August 22. William Brown ended the royalist naval supremacy the following year.|$|E
5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>another</b> two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E

5|$|Many {{elements}} {{first introduced}} {{in this game}} have remained in the series. For instance, non-player characters (NPCs) were present in The Legend of Zelda, but their role was rather limited. Starting with The Adventure of Link, Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal roles in Link's quests. Zelda II {{was also one of}} the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas, giving the world a life of its own rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold. The use of metered magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games. The Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The Adventure of Link and plays an important role in later Zelda games, as it is strongly associated with Link. Dark Link is a version of Link's Shadow which appears in , a similar Link clone called Shadow Link appears in , <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>another</b> appears in , as well as in A Link Between Worlds.|$|E
5|$|O'Farrell's {{replacement}} {{was to be}} Scotland coach, Tommy Docherty. Docherty {{left the}} Scotland job and his first task at United {{was to keep the}} club in the top flight. He managed it once, but he was unable to pull it off again and the club was relegated in 1973–74. They bounced straight back up the following season, though, and in their first season back in the top flight, the team cruised to a third-place finish <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>another</b> FA Cup final. The next year, they went one better, beating Liverpool in the final to claim his first and only trophy at Old Trafford. It was soon discovered, however, that Docherty {{was having an affair with}} the wife of the club's physiotherapist, and he was immediately fired, replaced by Queens Park Rangers' manager Dave Sexton.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a northern origin for the chestnut-shouldered fairywren group {{due to the}} variety of forms in north and their absence in the southeast of the continent. Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm wetter period around 2 million {{years ago at the}} end of the Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene. Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations. Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the red-winged fairywren, while those in the northwest of the continent became the variegated fairywren <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>another</b> isolated in the northeast became the lovely fairywren. Further warmer, humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards, this group occupying central southern Australia east to the Eyre Peninsula became the blue-breasted fairywren. Cooler climate after this resulted in this being isolated as well and evolving into a separate species. Finally, after the end of the last glacial period 12,000–13,000years ago, the northern variegated forms have again spread southwards, resulting in the purple-backed subspecies assimilis. This has resulted in the variegated fairywren's range to overlap with all three other species. Schodde also proposed that the blue-grey coloured females of the lavender-flanked subspecies were ancestral, while the browner coloration of females of southern forms was an adaptation to dry climates. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinals {{began their}} second drive {{of the quarter}} at their own 25-yard line. In fits and starts, the Louisville offense {{advanced}} down the field. Kolby Smith ran for a yard, Michael Bush for two, then six yards, and Cantwell completed two passes of seven yards each. The Cardinals were also helped by a defensive pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech, which gave Louisville a first down by penalty. As Louisville began to enter Tech territory in earnest, however, the Cardinals suffered their first turnover of the game. Facing third down and three yards from the Virginia Tech 40-yard line, Cantwell was sacked and fumbled the ball. Tech defender Xavier Adibi scooped up the loose ball, and Tech gained the initiative. Following the fumble, the Hokies began a drive at their 47-yard line. On the first play, Tech was aided by a pass interference penalty on Louisville. The penalty {{was followed by a}} three-yard Cedric Humes rush <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>another</b> pass interference penalty against Louisville. Humes rushed twice more for five yards, and Vick completed a 16-yard pass to David Clowney before Vick completed a five-yard touchdown pass to Jeff King. The score and subsequent extra point gave Virginia Tech a 28–24 lead—its first of the game—with 6:03 remaining.|$|E
