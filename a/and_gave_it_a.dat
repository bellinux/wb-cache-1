However, book thirteen includes a line about ending the series with a history of the Roman emperors. It is possible that the last books have been lost over time, though it is also likely that Fulgentius simply lost interest in the work <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> hurried anticlimactic finish, as he did with other works such as the Content of Virgil.|$|E
