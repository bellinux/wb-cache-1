5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, <b>a</b> <b>tangled</b> network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} of E.frostii is olive brown. The spores are thick walled, smooth, and spindle shaped, with {{dimensions}} of 11–15 by 4–5µm. Longer spores up to 18µm long {{may also be}} present. The cap cuticle, or pileipellis, is made of <b>a</b> <b>tangled</b> layer of gelatinized hyphae that are 3–6µm wide. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four spored and measure 26–35 by 10.5–11.5µm. Cystidia are non-fertile cells interspersed among the basidia, and they are prevalent in the hymenial tissue of E.frostii. These hyaline (translucent) cells measure 30–53 long by 7.5–14µm wide, and range in shape from somewhat like a spindle (tapering at each end, but with one end typically rounded) to subampullaceous—shaped somewhat like a swollen bottle.|$|E
5|$|Uttar Pradesh, with a {{total area}} of , is India’s fourth-largest state in terms of land area. It is {{situated}} on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, but the plains that cover {{most of the state}} are distinctly different from those high mountains. The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai. The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region is in the south. It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through <b>a</b> <b>tangled</b> mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip. The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganges, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism.|$|E

25|$|The 18th {{century was}} a time of {{enlightenment}} progression occurring in all intellectual fields. However, the English language was deteriorating into <b>a</b> <b>tangled</b> mess. A group of London booksellers commissioned well-known essayist Samuel Johnson to compile a set of rules governing the English Language. After nine years and the help of six assistants the first edition of A Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1755. Johnson's great knowledge of letters, words and literature brought uniqueness to his dictionary. Each word defined in detail, with descriptions of their various uses and numerous literary quotes as illustrations. This was the first dictionary of its kind, containing 40,000 words and nearly 114,000 quotes packed together with Johnson's personal touch. A warm reception greeted Johnson's Dictionary as it was the first dictionary that could be read with pleasure. The definitions full of wit and depth of thought supported by passages from beloved poets and philosophers, which a reader could be content spending an evening poring over its pages. Johnson's choice of structure and format has certainly shaped future English dictionaries and lexicons and the role they play in language development.|$|E

500|$|Trophic {{levels are}} part of the {{holistic}} or complex systems view of ecosystems. Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions, giving a macroscopic view of the system. While the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and top-down control within food webs, it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems. This has led some ecologists to [...] "reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete, homogeneous trophic levels is fiction." [...] Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that real trophic levels do exist, but [...] "above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as <b>a</b> <b>tangled</b> web of omnivores." ...|$|E

40|$|Branch decomposition-based {{algorithms}} {{have been}} used in practical settings to solve some NP-hard problems like the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and general minor containment. The notions of branch decompositions and branchwidth were introduced by Robertson and Seymour to assist in proving the Graph Minors Theorem. Given a connected graph G and a branch decomposition of G of width k where k is at least 3, a practical branch decomposition-based algorithm to test whether a graph has branchwidth at most k − 1 is given. The algorithm either constructs a branch decomposition of G of width at most k − 1 or constructs <b>a</b> <b>tangle</b> basis of order k, which offers a lower bound on the branchwidth of G. The algorithm is utilized repeatedly in a practical setting to find an optimal branch decomposition of a connected graph, whose branchwidth is at least 2, given an input branch decomposition of the graph from a heuristic. This is the first algorithm for the optimal branch decomposition problem for general graphs that {{has been shown to be}} practical. Computational results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of finding optimal branch decompositions. <b>A</b> <b>tangle</b> basis is related to <b>a</b> <b>tangle,</b> <b>a</b> notion also introduced by Robertson and Seymour; however, <b>a</b> <b>tangle</b> basis is more constructive in nature.

2500|$|The {{trophic level}} concept was {{introduced}} in a historical landmark paper on trophic dynamics in 1942 by Raymond L. Lindeman.

The trophic dynamic concept has served as a useful quantitative heuristic, but it has several major limitations including the precision by which an organism can be allocated to a specific trophic level. Omnivores, for example, are not restricted to any single level.
