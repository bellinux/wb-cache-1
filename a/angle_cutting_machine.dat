In this work, the formation mechanism of the surface topography and the machining defects of CFRPs are proposed, {{and the influence of}} milling parameters and fiber <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> on the surface quality of CFRPs is obtained, which can provide a reference for extended tool life and good surface quality. Trimming and slot milling tests of unidirectional CFRP laminates are performed. The surface roughness of the machined surface is measured, and the influence of milling parameters on the surface roughness is analyzed. A regression model for the surface roughness of CFRP milling is established. A significance test of the regression model is conducted. The machined surface topography of milling CFRP unidirectional laminates with different fiber orientations is analyzed, and the effect of fiber <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> on the surface topography of the machined surface is presented by using a digital super depth-of-field microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). To study the influence of fiber <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> on <b>machining</b> defects, the machined topography under different fiber orientations is analyzed. The slot milling defects and their formation mechanism under different fiber <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> are investigated...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> is {{affected}} by several factors that can be directly or indirectly influenced by manufacturers, technicians and users of machine tools. The most critical qualitative evaluation parameters of machine tools include accuracy and stability. Investigations of accuracy and repeatable positioning accuracy were essential for the research presented in this paper. The aim was to develop and experimentally verify {{the design of a}} methodology for cutting centers aimed at achieving the desired working precision. Before working on the topic described here, it was necessary to make several scientific analyses, which are summarized in this paper. We can build on the initial working hypothesis that by improving the technological parameters (e. g. by increasing the working speed of the machine, or by improving the precision of the positioning) the quality of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> will also be improved. For the purposes of our study, several investigated parameters were set affecting positioning accuracy, such as rigidity, positioning speed, etc. First, the stiffness of the portal structure of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was analyzed. FEM analysis was used to investigate several alternative structures of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine,</b> and also an innovative solution for beam mounting. The second step was to integrate two types of drives into the design of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine.</b> The first drive is a classic rack and pinion drive for <b>cutting</b> <b>machines.</b> To increase (improve) the working speed of the machine, linear motors were designed as an alternative drive. The portal of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was designed for a working speed of 260 mmin− 1 and acceleration of 25 m. s− 2. The third step was {{based on the results of}} the analysis. In collaboration with Microstep, an experimental <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> in a portal version was produced using linear synchronous motors driving the portal on both sides, and with direct linear metering of its position. In the fourth step, an experiment was designed and conducted to explore the positioning accuracy and the repeatable positioning accuracy...|$|R
