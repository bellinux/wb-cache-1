Some large airplanes have a fuel system that allows the flight crew to jettison or dump the fuel. When operated, the boost pumps in the fuel tanks pump the fuel to the dump chutes or jettison nozzles and overboard to atmosphere.|$|R

These are a second oil pump {{that continues to}} run after the engine has stopped, providing cooling oil to the hot bearings of a turbocharger for some minutes, whilst it cools down. These are supplementary pumps and do not replace the main, mechanical, oil pump.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{refrigerant}} system for submersible <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b> This study aims {{to improve the}} existing cooling system of these <b>electric</b> <b>pumps</b> when they work partially or totally not immersed in the service fluid. Note that inefficient cooling systems cannot prevent the rise in temperature of the electric engine, and the consequent breaking of the <b>electric</b> <b>pump.</b> We propose a preliminary study of this system, where a two-dimensional model is {{used to describe the}} heat transfer among the engine of the <b>electric</b> <b>pump,</b> the refrigerant system and the external environment. This model is discretized by an explicit finite difference scheme, and the resulting algorithm has been implemented in MATLAB. We show some preliminary results obtained by this code, and the com- parison of these results with experimental data...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUsually {{in order}} to balance the load demand at high peak hours, hydro <b>electric</b> <b>pumped</b> storage power plant is utilized. In this project a novel design, (CFPID) Cascaded Fuzzy PID (Proportional - Integral - Derivative) {{controller}} scheme using B&R (Bernecker & Rainer) Industrial Automation PLC - HMI (Programmable Logic Control - Human Machine Interface) for Efficient Energy management and storage in real time performance of a hydro <b>electric</b> <b>pumped</b> storage power plant is proposed. In this scheme, Fuzzy Level is cascaded with PID Flow for improvement in performance. A prototype model of a hydro <b>electric</b> <b>pumped</b> storage power plant with 22 digital inputs and 14 potential free outputs is fabricated with an objective of controlling the process variables, flow and level is done by using conventional PLC and the proposed CFPID control. There are two tanks in the prototype, lower tank with 2 stages of level and upper tank with 5 stages of level. HMI is used to monitor and operate the process in online - real time, for easy control of the operations. In this paper, the proposed PLC- HMI automation based CFPID control scheme is performed and finally compared with the conventional PLC by experimental results and validated by using real time statistics obtained from the hydro <b>electric</b> <b>pumped</b> storage power plant...|$|R

50|$|Beginning in the 19th century, fountains {{ceased to}} be used for {{drinking}} water and became purely ornamental. By the beginning of the 20th century, cities began using steam <b>pumps</b> and later <b>electric</b> <b>pumps</b> to send water to the city fountains. Later in the 20th century, urban fountains began to recycle their water through a closed recirculating system. An <b>electric</b> <b>pump,</b> often placed under the water, pushes the water through the pipes. The water must be regularly topped up to offset water lost to evaporation, and allowance must be made to handle overflow after heavy rain.|$|R
