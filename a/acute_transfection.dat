40|$|We have {{previously}} described several helper independent vector constructions (S. Hughes and E. Kosik, Virology 136 : 89 - 99, 1984; J. Sorge and S. H. Hughes, J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1 : 547 - 599, 1982; J. Sorge, B. Ricci, and S. Hughes, J. Virol. 48 : 667 - 675, 1983), {{all of which}} derive from Rous sarcoma virus. In this report we describe three improvements in the earlier constructions. First, the vectors have been restructured as proviruses, which considerably improves the efficiency of virus production following <b>acute</b> <b>transfection.</b> Second, a series of miniplasmids have been developed, which we call adaptors, and these miniplasmids {{can be used to}} convert virtually any DNA segment into a ClaI fragment suitable for insertion into the retroviral (or other) vectors. Adaptors have been developed that supply regions of functional significance, including a splice acceptor and an initiator ATG. Finally, the region of env defining subgroup specificity, A in the original vectors, has been substituted by the corresponding regions of subgroup B and D viruses, giving vectors with additional subgroup specificities and increased host ranges...|$|E
40|$|Addition of the {{transcriptional}} enhancers {{present in}} the U 3 region of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus (HaMuSV) long terminal repeat (LTR) to recombinant chimeras in which the HaMuSV transforming gene (Ha-v-ras) is expressed from the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter increases {{the ability of the}} MMTV v-ras chimeras to transform mouse fibroblasts in culture 50 - to 100 -fold. Significant stimulation of transfection efficiency occurs only when glucocorticoids are {{present in the}} culture medium. Glucocorticoids also elevate the steady-state concentration of MMTV-initiated v-ras mRNA in cell lines isolated from these transfections, and MMTV-v-ras fusion transcripts are initiated at the normal MMTV cap site; potential cryptic initiation events associated with the enhancer could not be detected. The ability of the enhancer to increase the transcriptional activity of the MMTV promoter was also studied in <b>acute</b> <b>transfection</b> assays where expression of the chloramphenical acetyl transferase (CAT) gene is driven by the MMTV promoter. In this system the strong positive effect on MMTV transcription is again obtained only when the cells are hormone treated. These experiments indicate that the hormone-regulatory region is capable of modulating the function of an exogenously introduced enhancer element...|$|E
40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{are compatible with}} the hypothesis that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA- 2) or leader protein (EBNA-LP) affects expression of the EBV latent infection membrane protein LMP 1. We now demonstrate the following. (i) <b>Acute</b> <b>transfection</b> and expression of EBNA- 2 under control of simian virus 40 or Moloney murine leukemia virus promoters resulted in increased LMP 1 expression in P 3 HR- 1 -infected Burkitt's lymphoma cells and the P 3 HR- 1 or Daudi cell line. (ii) Transfection and expression of EBNA-LP alone {{had no effect on}} LMP 1 expression and did not act synergistically with EBNA- 2 to affect LMP 1 expression. (iii) LMP 1 expression in Daudi and P 3 HR- 1 -infected cells was controlled at the mRNA level, and EBNA- 2 expression in Daudi cells increased LMP 1 mRNA. (iv) No other EBV genes were required for EBNA- 2 transactivation of LMP 1 since cotransfection of recombinant EBNA- 2 expression vectors and genomic LMP 1 DNA fragments enhanced LMP 1 expression in the EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell lines BJAB, Louckes, and BL 30. (v) An EBNA- 2 -responsive element was found within the - 512 to + 40 LMP 1 DNA since this DNA linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was transactivated by cotransfection with an EBNA- 2 expression vector. (vi) The EBV type 2 EBNA- 2 transactivated LMP 1 as well as the EBV type 1 EBNA- 2. (vii) Two deletions within the EBNA- 2 gene which rendered EBV transformation incompetent did not transactivate LMP 1, whereas a transformation-competent EBNA- 2 deletion mutant did transactivate LMP 1. LMP 1 is a potent effector of B-lymphocyte activation and can act synergistically with EBNA- 2 to induce cellular CD 23 gene expression. Thus, EBNA- 2 transactivation of LMP 1 amplifies the biological impact of EBNA- 2 and underscores its central role in EBV-induced growth transformation...|$|E
40|$|The long {{control region}} (LCR) of the bovine {{papillomavirus}} type 1 genome can {{function as a}} conditional transcriptional enhancer which can be specifically trans-activated by the viral E 2 gene product. To precisely map the target(s) of this trans-activation, BAL 31 exonuclease was used to generate two overlapping series of deleted DNA segments through the LCR. These fragments were assayed {{for their ability to}} activate transcription from the enhancer-deleted simian virus 40 early promoter of pA 10 CAT in {{the presence or absence of}} the viral E 2 gene product. Two different E 2 -responsive elements were localized within the LCR. The major target for E 2 trans-activation (E 2 -responsive element 1) was mapped to a 196 -base-pair fragment between nucleotides 7611 and 7806, just upstream from promoters P 7940 and P 89. Further deletions which destroyed or impaired enhancer function revealed that the ACCN 6 GGT sequence motifs at each end of E 2 -responsive element 1 are critical components of this element. Primer extension analysis of RNA extracted from <b>acute</b> <b>transfections</b> with plasmids containing the bovine papillomavirus type 1 LCR driving the CAT gene revealed that each of the P 7940 and P 89 promoters is responsive to E 2 trans-activation...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of neurons and neuronal circuits in brain tissue requires the genetic manipulation, labeling, and tracking of single cells. However, current methods for manipulating cells in brain tissue {{are limited to}} either bulk techniques, lacking single-cell accuracy, or manual methods that provide single-cell accuracy but at significantly lower throughputs and repeatability. Here, we demonstrate high-throughput, efficient, reliable, and combinatorial delivery of multiple genetic vectors and reagents into targeted cells within the same tissue sample with single-cell accuracy. Our system automatically loads nanoliter-scale volumes of reagents into a micropipette from multiwell plates, targets and transfects single cells in brain tissues using a robust electroporation technique, and finally preps the micropipette by automated cleaning for repeating the transfection cycle. We demonstrate multi-colored labeling of adjacent cells, both in organotypic and <b>acute</b> slices, and <b>transfection</b> of plasmids encoding different protein isoforms into neurons within the same brain tissue for analysis of their effects on linear dendritic spine density. Our platform {{could also be used}} to rapidly deliver, both ex vivo and in vivo, a variety of genetic vectors, including optogenetic and cell-type specific agents, as well as fast-acting reagents such as labeling dyes, calcium sensors, and voltage sensors to manipulate and track neuronal circuit activity at single-cel...|$|R
40|$|The {{somatostatin}} (SS) gene is transcriptionally regulated via the cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element (CRE), {{located in}} the proximal promoter (- 41 to - 48 bp). We have previously reported that glucocorticoids induce dose-dependent cell-specific alterations in the steady-state SS mRNA level. Here we have investigated direct transcriptional control of the SS gene by glucocorticoids. We have examined transcriptional interaction between glucocorticoids and the cAMP signalling pathway and mapped the 5 ' upstream regulatory region of the SS gene involved in glucocorticoid transactivation. Transcriptional regulation was determined by analysis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in PC 12 rat pheochromocytoma cells and A 126 - 1 B 2 (protein kinase A-deficient mutant PC 12) cells, by <b>acute</b> <b>transfection</b> of 5 ' flanking SS DNA (- 750, - 250 and - 71 bp) ligated to the reporter (CAT) gene. Dexamethasone (DEX) induced a dose-dependent 2. 2 -fold stimulation of SS gene transcription in PC 12 cells, but not in A 126 - 1 B 2 cells. Other steroid and thyroid hormones tested, and retinoic acid, were ineffective, while cAMP and forskolin stimulated gene transcription 4 - 5 -fold in PC 12 cells but not in A 126 - 1 B 2 cells. DEX exerted an additive effect on cAMP-induced gene transcription. Deletion of the promoter from - 750 to - 71 bp (but not from - 750 to - 250 bp) abolished all stimulatory effects of DEX without affecting cAMP responsiveness. Mutation of the CRE abrogated both DEX- and cAMP-dependent gene enhancement. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that the - 250 to - 71 bp region of the SS promoter (but not the - 71 to + 55 bp domain) binds specifically to a glucocorticoid response element-sensitive nuclear protein(s) from PC 12 cells, suggesting a putative glucocorticoid receptor interaction with SS promoter DNA. We conclude that glucocorticoids regulate SS gene transcription positively. Glucocorticoid-induced transactivation shows dependence on protein kinase. A activity, and may be mediated via protein-protein interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and the CRE binding protein. DNA sequences upstream from the CRE between - 250 and - 71 bp in the SS promoter {{appear to be the}} target of glucocorticoid action...|$|E
