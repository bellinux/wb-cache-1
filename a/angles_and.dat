5|$|According to the East Anglian tally {{from the}} Textus Roffensis, Wehha {{was the son}} of Wilhelm. The 9th century History of the Britons lists both Wehha, who is named as 'Guillem Guercha', as the first king of the East <b>Angles,</b> <b>and</b> his son and {{successor}} Wuffa, after whom the dynasty was named. It has been claimed that the name Wehha was a hypocoristic version of Wihstān, from the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, which, along with evidence such as the finds discovered at Sutton Hoo in 1939, suggests a connection between the Wuffingas and a Swedish dynasty, the Scylfings.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{kinematic}} {{model is}} used to analyze basketball shooting arm motions in the vertical plane that produce desired ball release speed, <b>angle</b> <b>and</b> backspin. The release conditions are related to arm motions using general kinematic equations. The paper compares three types of shooting arm motions: pure hand shots, hand-forearm shots, and general shots controlled by hand, forearm and upper arm motions. In pure hand shots, release speed, <b>angle</b> <b>and</b> backspin are severely limited. All hand-forearm shot configurations are able to produce desired release speed, <b>angle</b> <b>and</b> backspin. General shots redundantly provide shooters with any desired ball release speed, <b>angle</b> <b>and</b> backspin, and {{they are required to}} suitably control each joint angular velocity and acceleration...|$|R
5|$|After {{handling}} the marketing for Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh, 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance starring Ratna Asmara. Academia {{was critical of}} the film, believing it to lack educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, a tragedy based in Bali, for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie Karsito describes as a dialogue coach. Camera <b>angles</b> <b>and</b> locations were chosen by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer.|$|E

5|$|Nine years later, he {{defeated}} {{and killed}} Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald, at the Battle of Maserfield; {{from this point}} he {{was probably the most}} powerful of the Anglo-Saxon rulers of the time, laying the foundations for the Mercian supremacy over the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. He repeatedly defeated the East <b>Angles</b> <b>and</b> drove Cenwalh the king of Wessex into exile for three years. He continued to wage war against the Bernicians of Northumbria. Thirteen years after Maserfield, he suffered a crushing defeat by Oswald's successor and brother Oswiu, and was killed at the Battle of the Winwaed {{in the course of a}} final campaign against the Bernicians.|$|E
5|$|Shot on {{location}} in Rome and at Elios Studios, Tenebrae utilized mostly modern-looking locations and sets to help Argento realize his intent that the film reflect a near-future with a diminished population; the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome. Employing director of photography Luciano Tovoli, Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark, realistic lighting featured in television police shows at the time; production designer Giuseppe Bassa created supporting environments that were cold and austere, with sharp <b>angles</b> <b>and</b> modernistic spaces. Several former members of Italian rock band Goblin provided Tenebraes music, a synth-heavy score inspired by rock and disco music.|$|E

After receiving the director's approval, ADI began to create small sculptures, sketches, paintings, and life-size models.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to previous installments, focusing on combo-based combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Exile—and secondary weapons acquired during the game. It uses quick time events, where the player acts in a timed sequence to defeat strong enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared with previous installments, God of War III offers a revamped magic system, more onscreen enemies, new camera <b>angles,</b> <b>and</b> downloadable content.|$|E
5|$|The {{survival}} horror genre is {{also known}} for other non-combat challenges, such as solving puzzles at certain locations in the game world, and collecting and managing an inventory of items. Areas of the game world will be off limits until the player gains certain items. Occasionally, levels are designed with alternative routes. Levels also challenge players with maze-like environments, which test the player's navigational skills. Levels are often designed as dark and claustrophobic (often making use of dim or shadowy light conditions and camera <b>angles</b> <b>and</b> sightlines which restrict visibility) to challenge the player and provide suspense, although games in the genre also make use of enormous spatial environments.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTemperature-independent strain <b>and</b> <b>angle</b> {{measurements}} are achieved resorting to a taper fabricated on a Bragg fiber using a CO 2 laser. The characteristic bimodal interference of an untapered Bragg fiber is rendered multimode after taper fabrication {{and the resulting}} transmission spectra are analyzed {{as a function of}} strain, applied <b>angle,</b> <b>and</b> temperature variations. The intrinsic strain sensitivity exhibited by the Bragg fiber is increased 15 fold after tapering and reaches 22. 68 pm/με.

5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{a technique}} used for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions.

From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, {{as well as their}} chemical bonds, their disorder, and various other information.|$|E
5|$|An English {{cultural}} identity first {{emerged from the}} interaction of the Germanic immigrants of the 5th and 6th centuries and the indigenous Romano-British inhabitants. Although early medieval chroniclers described the immigrants as <b>Angles</b> <b>and</b> Saxons, they came from a much wider area across Northern Europe, and represented a range of different ethnic groups. Over the 6th century, however, these different groups began to coalesce into stratified societies across England, roughly corresponding to the later Angle and Saxon kingdoms recorded by Bede in the 8th century. By the 9th century, the term the Angelcynn was being officially used to refer to a single English people, and promoted for propaganda purposes by chroniclers and kings to inspire resistance to the Danish invasions.|$|E
