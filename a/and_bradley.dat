5|$|A {{slightly}} broader definition {{used by the}} Office for National Statistics (ONS) includes developed areas adjoining Bristol {{but outside}} the city-council boundary, such as Whitchurch village, Filton, Patchway <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> Stoke, but excludes undeveloped areas within that boundary. The ONS has defined a Bristol Urban Area, which includes Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford, Winterbourne, Frampton Cotterell, Almondsbury and Easton in Gordano. The North Fringe of Bristol, a developed area in South Gloucestershire between the Bristol city boundary and the M4 and M5 motorways, was so named {{as part of a}} 1987 plan prepared by the Northavon District Council.|$|E

5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns {{to the idea that}} {{theology}} and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of Vedanta, Spinoza, Hegel, <b>and</b> <b>Bradley)</b> will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E

5|$|The Indians rehired Peckinpaugh {{as their}} manager in 1941, signing {{him to a}} two-year contract; team {{president}} Alva Bradley, who fired Peckinpaugh in 1933, promised Peckinpaugh full cooperation and minimal interference. After the 1941 season, {{he was promoted to}} vice president, later serving as Cleveland's general manager (GM) and president. When Bill Veeck bought the Indians in July 1946, he brought Harry Grabiner and Joseph C. Hostetler with him to serve in the front office. Peckinpaugh <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> resigned.|$|E

5|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} call a special session to repeal the law, <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> {{was in favor of}} the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify the call. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} {{into the}} town of East Windsor, the roadway becomes two lanes wide with auxiliary left turn lanes and is known as South Main Street. It intersects with Route 191 (Phelps Street), {{which leads to the}} East Windsor town center. About half a mile (0.8km) north of this junction, US 5 leaves Main Street to go on Prospect Hill Road, bypassing the Warehouse Point area. There is also a partial interchange with I-91 in this area (at exit 44). Just south of the Enfield town line, US 5 intersects with Route 140, which crosses the Connecticut River {{into the town}} of Windsor Locks <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{did much}} to {{advance the cause of}} blacks in Kentucky. He denounced racially {{motivated}} lynchings and demanded that county officials prosecute racial violence. He called a special legislative session in March 1897 to consider an anti-lynching bill that imposed penalties including a fine of up to $500 and removal from office for any peace officer who did not prevent a lynching or mob violence. It further empowered peace officers to recruit able-bodied men to help protect prisoners and fined them for failing to do so, if necessary. Despite the politically divided legislature, the bill quickly passed both houses of the General Assembly <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> signed it on May 11, 1897. In January 1898, Bradley accepted an invitation to speak before the Anti-Mob and Lynch Law Association in Springfield, Ohio. During Bradley's four-year term, twenty-five lynchings were committed in the state, down from fifty-six during the term of his predecessor.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of this Congressional {{schedule}} <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> Robinson had not been seated when the Vermont House of Representatives convened in early October, 1791. At this legislative session, some members suggested that the January election of <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> Robinson had been premature, since Vermont had not yet been admitted to the union. <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> Robinson volunteered to resign the credentials of their January elections; on October 17, the Governor and Council voted again, <b>and</b> selected <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> Robinson. The House of Representatives then voted a second time, <b>and</b> also selected <b>Bradley</b> <b>and</b> Robinson. No vote totals were recorded.|$|R
5|$|By 14 August, large {{forces from}} the NK 5th and 12th Divisions, as well was the 766th Independent Regiment were focused entirely on taking P'ohang-dong. However {{they were unable to}} hold it because of U.S. air superiority and naval {{bombardment}} on the town. More importantly, the supply chain had completely broken down for the division, and more food, ammunition and supplies were not available. Captured North Korean prisoners claimed the units received no food after 12 August and had been so exhausted that they were completely unable to fight. Opposing them, the ROK Capital Division and Task forces P'ohang <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> which had joined forces to prepare for a final offensive to push the North Koreans out of the region.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{attended}} the summer workshop at the San Francisco Ballet School in 1998. She <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> selected the workshop over offers from the Joffrey Ballet, ABT and Dance Theater of Harlem, among others. Of the programs she auditioned for, only New York City Ballet declined {{to make her}} an offer. San Francisco Ballet, ABT and New York City Ballet are regarded as the three preeminent classical ballet companies in the US. During the six-week workshop at San Francisco, Copeland {{was placed in the}} most advanced classes and was under a full tuition plus expenses scholarship. At the end of the workshop, she received one of the few offers to continue as a full-time student at the school. She declined the offer because of the encouragement from her mother to return home, the prospect of continuing personal training from the Bradley family and dreams of a subsequent summer with ABT.|$|E
5|$|James Vanderbilt {{had read}} Robert Graysmith's book Zodiac in 1986 while in high school. Years later, after {{becoming}} a screenwriter, {{he got the}} opportunity to meet Graysmith, and became fascinated by the folklore surrounding the Zodiac Killer. He then decided to try to translate the story into a script. Vanderbilt had endured bad experiences in the past, in which the endings of his scripts had been changed, and wanted to have more control over the material this time. He pitched his adaptation of Zodiac to Mike Medavoy <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> J. Fischer from Phoenix Pictures, by agreeing to write a spec script if he could have more creative control over it.|$|E

5|$|Major Arabian importations to the United States {{included}} {{those of}} Davenport <b>and</b> <b>Bradley,</b> who {{teamed up to}} purchase several stallions and mares directly from the Bedouin in 1906. Spencer Borden of the Interlachen Stud made several importations between 1898 and 1911; and W.R. Brown of the Maynesboro Stud, interested in the Arabian as a cavalry mount, imported many Arabians {{over a period of}} years, starting in 1918. Another wave of imports came in the 1920s and 30s when breeders such as W.K. Kellogg, Henry Babson, Roger Selby, James Draper, and others imported Arabian bloodstock from Crabbet Park Stud in England, as well as from Poland, Spain and Egypt. The breeding of Arabians was fostered by the U. S. Army Remount Service, which stood purebred stallions at public stud for a reduced rate.|$|E
5|$|NY12E {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of West Main <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> (NY12) streets in the city of Watertown. It initially proceeds northwest on West Main Street as a four-lane residential and commercial street; however, it becomes a two-lane divided highway at a CSX Transportation railroad overpass just six blocks from NY12. Past the crossing, the road follows the Black River across the city line and into the town of Pamelia, where it becomes co-designated as CR190. The highway soon passes under Interstate81 and narrows to a two-lane undivided road before turning westward into the riverside village of Glen Park. It retains its Main Street name through the community, following a two-lane residential street through the village center and eventually into the adjacent village of Brownville.|$|E
5|$|On a joint ballot of the General Assembly in 1900, Bradley was {{defeated}} {{for a seat}} in the U.S. Senate by a vote of 75–54. After the unseating of Taylor, the state Republican party split into factions, with Godfrey Hunter at the head of one <b>and</b> <b>Bradley</b> {{at the head of the}} other. The two factions formed a tentative alliance to nominate Danville law professor John W. Yerkes in the special election called after Goebel's assassination, but Yerkes lost to Democratic nominee J. C. W. Beckham. At the 1904 Republican National Convention, Bradley was chosen to second the nomination of Theodore Roosevelt for president.|$|E
