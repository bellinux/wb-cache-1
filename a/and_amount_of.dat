5|$|At only 5,000 {{years of}} age, the Everglades {{is a young}} region in {{geological}} terms. Its ecosystems are in constant flux {{as a result of}} the interplay of three factors: the type <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water present, the geology of the region, and the frequency and severity of fires.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction. The concentration <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> uranium-235 needed to achieve {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E
5|$|The ornatus {{morphotype}} is most reliably {{distinguished by}} its longer fur, averaging 26.8mm compared to 22.4mm in javanicus. Other distinguishing characteristics include overall color (generally light brown in ornatus compared with brown to reddish in javanicus), <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> brown coloring in the fur (ornatus has less brown than javanicus, {{resulting in a}} lighter-colored ventral region).|$|E
5|$|Yu Yu Hakusho {{has been}} well received, with the manga selling over 50 million copies in Japan alone and winning the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen manga in 1993. The {{animated}} series won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize for best anime in 1994 and 1995. Yu Yu Hakusho has been watched by {{a large number of}} television viewers in Japan and a wide range of age groups in the United States. The anime has been given mostly positive reviews by critics in North America, complimenting its writing, characters, <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> action.|$|E

5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|All baleen {{whales are}} carnivorous; however a 2015 study {{revealed}} they house gut flora {{similar to that}} of terrestrial herbivores. Different kinds of prey are found in different abundances depending on location, and each type of whale is adapted to a specialized way of foraging. There are two types of feeding behaviors: skim-feeding and lunge-feeding, but some species do both depending on the type <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> food. For example, Antarctic whales mostly feed on euphausiids; however, this is mainly effective for lunge-feeders, whereas skim-feeders, like the right whales, feed primarily on copepods. They feed alone or in small groups. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food, and their kidneys excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E

50|$|Each {{character}} has five basic attributes. Strength (Red) increases {{the chance of}} a Critical hit from a weapon <b>and</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> bonus damage that matching Skulls does. Agility (Yellow) increases the chance of blocking an attack <b>and</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> bonus points gained from matching action gems. Intelligence (Blue) increases the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> extra moves that {{character has}} when playing mini-games <b>and</b> the maximum <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> mana a character can store. Stamina (Green) increases the chance of Critical Blocking <b>and</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> life points a player has. And Morale (Purple) increases the chance to resist an opponent's spell <b>and</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> damage a weapon does. Different types of characters can earn attributes faster than others. Increasing an attribute will increase that color's utilization in combat. For example, increasing Strength increases the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> Red mana a player can hold, start with, and collect.|$|R
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player missions, The World Is Not Enough features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} different game types, ranging from the traditional deathmatch to objective-based games such as capture the flag or king of the hill. Other game types include Last Agent Standing, where players begin the game with a finite number of lives and must survive until the opposing players exhaust their lives, and Uplink, in which players must find and touch uplink units scattered in key locations of the map to score points. Multiplayer games can be played on 14 different maps and can also include bots. Bots' appearance <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> health can be changed to match player preference.|$|E
5|$|Melkhior the wizard's castle {{consists}} {{of a series of}} 128 rooms, each displayed on a single, non-scrolling screen. Sabreman must navigate the 3D maze of stone blocks in each room, usually to retrieve a collectible object, whilst avoiding spikes and enemies, which kill him on contact. The player begins with four lives, and loses one for each death; running out of lives ends the game. Stone blocks serve as platforms for the player to jump between; some fall under the player's weight, some move of their own accord, and some can be pushed by ghosts. Sabreman jumps higher when in werewolf form, which helps in specific puzzles. The player often needs to move blocks to reach distant objects, which are then used as platforms to reach areas in other puzzles. To complete the game, the player must return 14 sequential objects from throughout the castle to the wizard's cauldron room. At the end of the game, the player receives a final score based on the remaining time <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the quest completed.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU solicits {{donations}} to its charitable foundation. The ACLU is accredited by the Better Business Bureau, and the Charity Navigator has ranked the ACLU with a four-star rating. The local affiliates solicit their own funding; however, some also receive {{funds from the}} national ACLU, with the distribution <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> such assistance varying from state to state. At its discretion, the national organization provides subsidies to smaller affiliates that lack sufficient resources to be self-sustaining; for example, the Wyoming ACLU chapter received such subsidies until April 2015, when, {{as part of a}} round of layoffs at the national ACLU, the Wyoming office was closed.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{zoologist}} Carl Linnaeus {{first described}} the genus Elephas and an elephant from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) under the binomial Elephas maximus in 1758. In 1798, Georges Cuvier classified the Indian elephant under the binomial Elephas indicus. Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck described the Sumatran elephant in 1847 under the binomial Elephas sumatranus. English zoologist Frederick Nutter Chasen classified all three as subspecies of the Asian elephant in 1940. Asian elephants vary geographically in their colour <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> depigmentation. The Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus) inhabits Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant (E.m.indicus) {{is native to}} mainland Asia (on the Indian subcontinent and Indochina), and the Sumatran elephant (E.m.sumatranus) is found in Sumatra. One disputed subspecies, the Borneo elephant, lives in northern Borneo and is smaller {{than all the other}} subspecies. It has larger ears, a longer tail, and straighter tusks than the typical elephant. Sri Lankan zoologist Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala described it in 1950 under the trinomial Elephas maximus borneensis, taking as his type an illustration in National Geographic. It was subsequently subsumed under either E.m.indicus or E.m.sumatranus. Results of a 2003 genetic analysis indicate its ancestors separated from the mainland population about 300,000years ago. A 2008 study found that Borneo elephants are not indigenous to the island but were brought there before 1521 by the Sultan of Sulu from Java, where elephants are now extinct.|$|E

5|$|The Florida {{peninsula}} appeared {{above sea}} level between 100,000 and 150,000years ago. As sea levels rose {{at the end of}} the Wisconsin ice age, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from the northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone shelf appears to be flat, but there are slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried periphyton, or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water present.|$|E
