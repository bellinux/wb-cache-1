5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{was caused}} by a vigorous upper-level trough that moved into the Southern Plains states on April 25. An extratropical cyclone developed ahead of this upper-level trough between northeastern Oklahoma and western Missouri, which moved northeast. Conditions were similar on April 26, with a predicted likelihood of severe thunderstorms, including an extended threat of strong to violent long-track tornadoes during the <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> evening hours; mixed-layer CAPE values were forecast to be around 3000–4000 J/kg, around east Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. The storm mode on April 26 was predicted to consist of mostly discrete supercells during the <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> early evening, shifting over to a mesoscale convective complex, with more of a threat of damaging winds and hail during the nighttime hours.|$|E
5|$|They are diurnal, {{preferring to}} hunt during the day, {{particularly}} {{in the early morning}} and mid to late <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> will occasionally hunt in pairs. Their hunting patterns, outside breeding periods and periods of abundant prey, have distinct crepuscular peaks, perhaps corresponding to mouse activity.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> evening sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> lasted an hour. The first practice session was initially held on a wet track with a clear sky after rainstorms {{earlier in the day}} left standing water on parts of the circuit, and high humidity slowed the drying process. These conditions meant drivers used intermediate tyres first before dry tyres were utilised in the session's closing minutes. Webber set the fastest time of the first session with a late lap of 1 minute and 54.589 seconds, one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher in second who was briefly quickest before Webber set his lap. Adrian Sutil, with a lap of 1:58.827, was third fastest, ahead of Vettel and Jaime Alguersuari. Button, Vitantonio Liuzzi, Sébastien Buemi, Kubica, and Vitaly Petrov rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} area {{of severe}} weather also developed that <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> evening along the Interstate 81 corridor from central and northern Virginia northward through Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York, continuing into early April 28. Many tornadoes touched {{down in this}} area as well. Most of these tornadoes were weak, though an EF2 tornado touched down {{near the town of}} Halifax, Virginia, and caused severe damage to homes in the area, resulting in one death. Tornado alerts were issued for Southern Ontario as far north as Ottawa as well; one tornado was later confirmed in Fergus, Ontario.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, two tank {{companies}} and mechanized infantry attacked Nefisha, supported with close air support. The Egyptian commando battalion {{in charge of}} Nefisha managed to repel the attack after prolonged, heavy fighting that closed to very short distances. The Israelis lost three tanks, two half-tracks, {{and a large number}} of men. For their part the Sa'iqa at Nefisha lost 24 commandos, including four officers, and 42 wounded, including three officers. Edgar O'Ballance mentions a counterattack by the Sa'iqa which took place during the <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> pushed some of Sharon's troops back along the Sweetwater Canal. The Israeli attack had been thoroughly routed.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} {{team for the}} Second Test at Lord's and elected to bat first after winning the toss. Johnson came in at 5/216 on the first <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> struggled to score, making only four of the 30 runs added during his stay at the crease before falling at 7/246, caught behind from the bowling of Bill Edrich. However, Australia's lower order wagged and they eventually took the score to 350 on the second morning.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E

5|$|During {{the morning}} of July 5, deep {{convection}} rapidly increased and banding features formed despite strong easterly wind shear. The convection persisted into the <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> the low was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five-E accordingly. Weak steering currents persisted as the depression moved towards the northwest at 4mph (6km/h) to 5mph (8km/h). Following the storm's upgrade, further development did not occur as the system tracked steadily towards the north-northwest. Early on July7, the depression made landfall near Lazaro Cardenas with winds of 35mph (55km/h). Rapid weakening followed shortly after landfall and the storm dissipated several hours later over the mountains of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates {{did not know that}} the Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E
5|$|In May 1800 Napoleon, by {{then the}} undisputed leader of France, brought his troops across the Alps to Italy once again. On 14June his army met the Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo (near Alessandria). Austrian troops were {{initially}} successful; by mid-morning they were {{in control of the}} field of battle. Their commander, Michael von Melas, sent this news south towards Rome. However, fresh French troops arrived in late <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> Napoleon attacked the tired Austrians. As Melas retreated in disarray with the remains of his army, he sent a second courier south with the revised message. The Neapolitans abandoned Rome, and the city spent the next fourteen years under French domination.|$|E
