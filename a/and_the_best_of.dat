5|$|For {{the first}} time in three seasons, Hextall was not traded during the off-season, and {{remained}} with the Flyers for the 1995–96 season. During the regular season, Hextall improved on his figures from the previous year, passing 30wins for {{the first time}} since 1988–89. His GAA of2.17 was both the best in the NHL that year, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> Hextall's career. In the playoffs, Hextall played in all twelve of the Flyers' games, a 4–2 first round victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning followed by a 4–2 defeat to the Florida Panthers. His GAA of2.13 was his lowest recorded in any post-season. He continued to perform well over the next two seasons, passing 30wins again in 1996–97, and adding another nine shutouts to the four he had made in 1995–96. Over his first five seasons in the NHL, Hextall only made one shutout, while in his final six seasons, he achieved the feat on nineteen occasions. The Flyers progressed to the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals, though Hextall only appeared in eight playoff games, finishing seven of them. Throughout the season and the playoffs, the uncertainty in goal resulted in Hextall and Garth Snow swapping places regularly. Snow started nine of the ten games during the first two rounds, but Hextall replaced him in game two of the Conference Final, and remained the starting goaltender for the remainder of the series. A loss against the Detroit Red Wings in the first game of the Stanley Cup finals resulted in coach Murray switching back to Snow for the second game. Hextall returned for games three and four, but the Flyers were swept 4–0 by the Red Wings.|$|E

25|$|After {{suppressing the}} Bar Kochba revolt, the Romans exiled the Jews of Judea, {{but not of}} Galilee and {{permitted}} a hereditary Rabbinical Patriarch (from the House of Hillel, based in Galilee) to represent the Jews in dealings with the Romans. The most famous of these was Judah haNasi who is credited with compiling {{the final version of}} the Mishnah (a massive body of Jewish religious texts interpreting the Bible) and with strengthening the educational demands of Judaism by requiring that illiterate Jews be treated as outcasts. As a result, many illiterate Jews may have converted to Christianity. Jewish seminaries, such as those at Shefaram and Bet Shearim continued to produce scholars <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> these became members of the Sanhedrin, which was located first at Tzippori and later at Tiberias. Before the Bar-Kochba uprising, an estimated 2/3 of the population of Gallilee and 1/3 of the coastal region were Jewish. In the Galillee, many Synagogues have been found dating from this period. However, persecution and the economic crisis that affected the Roman empire in the 3rd century led to further Jewish migration from Syria Palaestina to the more tolerant Persian Sassanid Empire, where a prosperous Jewish community with extensive seminaries existed in the area of Babylon.|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} 1961 - 91 {{a total of}} 567, 635 strains of Staphylococcus aureus from hospitalized {{patients}} in Denmark have been characterized according to their antibiotic resistance, site of isolation and phage type. Strains of phage group II (typed by the phages 3 A, 3 C, 55 and 71) have been analysed further. The occurrence of group II strains was relatively constant (approximately 16 %) from 1961 until 1983. Since then the frequency of group II strains increased; in 1991 they accounted for 22. 7 % of all S. aureus strains isolated. Strains of group II can, {{on the basis of}} their phage types, be divided in four subgroups: 3 A, 71, 71 + <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>'rest</b> <b>of</b> group II'. Furthermore, within these groups strains may differ from one another in respect to their sensitivity to phages. The increased isolation of group II strains during recent years was because of an increase in strains of subgroups 71 + <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>'rest</b> <b>of</b> group II strains'. In 1991 these two subgroups accounted for 89. 7 % of all group II strains. Furthermore, an increasing number of group II strains, 71. 4 % in 1991, was typable only at RTD x 100. The increase in the number of group II strains was even throughout Denmark. All four subgroups of group II have, during the observation period, become more frequently resistant to penicillin and/or tetracycline. Strains typed at 100 x RTD of subgroup 71 + <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>'rest</b> <b>of</b> group II' are more frequently antibiotic resistant than the rest of the group II strains. Strains of the increasing subgroups occurred most often in abscesses...|$|R
