50|$|The unit {{itself is}} {{designed}} to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two independent clutches like tooth or dog clutches which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving. The vehicle needs to be stationary for operation therefore.On 4x4 vehicles only the rear drive shaft {{is used by the}} split shaft PTO gearbox requiring the vehicles 4x4 drive scheme to be of the selectable 4WD type to keep the front <b>axle</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> completely decoupled during PTO operation.It is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO for example, fire truck pumps.|$|E
40|$|The portal axle is an {{off-road}} technology {{which is}} designed to provide higher ground clearance and increased torque at the wheels. The portal axle is typically mounted on the knuckle of the vehicle, allowing both the axle tubing and differential casing to be mounted higher under the vehicle. The usage of the portal axle system brings about two distinctive drawbacks; compromised ride comfort and increased torsional loadings on the drive shaft. In this study, an experimental test was carried out to determine the torsional strength and failure mode of the portal <b>axle</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> The experimental results were then verified using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Results from both experimental and FEA methods indicate that shaft failure occurs at the gear spline. However, there is a big discrepancy in the torsional stress values, in which the FEA results are significantly higher than the measured experimental values. This is reasonable considering that the shaft simulation analysis is conducted in a static structural manner, in which the flanged side of the shaft is fixed (zero displacement). On the other hand, this study also describes the influence of portal axles on passenger ride comfort. Here, the on road experiment is conducted by placing an accelerometer in the cabin of a portal axle equipped vehicle. The ride comfort experiments are conducted using two vehicles. The first being a normal pickup truck and the second being a pickup truck with the portal axles equipped. Both vehicles are of the same make, model and age. All measurements are performed on normal highways and over regular speed humps. The results from the ride comfort experiment indicate that the use of the portal axles result in significant deterioration of ride comfort. In order to validate the experimental results, a quarter car model representing the portal axle vehicle is simulated using Matlab’s Simulink function. Simulation results also indicate that the use of the portal axles adversely affects the ride comfort. However, when comparing the simulation to the experimental results, there is an 18 % discrepancy in the results. This is primarily attributed {{to the fact that the}} quarter car model does not take into account the suspension bushings, suspension joints and chassis bending (flex) of the vehicle...|$|E

2500|$|When {{used in this}} way, a {{differential}} couples {{the longitudinal}} input shaft (or prop shaft) to the pinion, which in turn drives the transverse ring gear of the differential. This also works as reduction gearing. On rear wheel drive vehicles the differential may connect to half-shafts inside an <b>axle</b> housing, or <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> that connect to the rear driving wheels. Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have the engine crankshaft and the gearbox shafts transverse, and with the pinion {{on the end of}} the main-shaft of the gearbox and the differential enclosed in the same housing as the gearbox. There are individual drive-shafts to each wheel. A differential consists of one input, the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft,</b> and two outputs which are the two drive wheels, however the rotation of the drive wheels are coupled to each other by their connection to the roadway. [...] Under normal conditions, with small tire slip, the ratio of the speeds of the two driving wheels is defined by the ratio of the radii of the paths around which the two wheels are rolling, which in turn is determined by the track-width of the vehicle (the distance between the driving wheels) and the radius of the turn.|$|R
50|$|Tatra {{differentials}} are {{a unique}} design that uses two opposing {{spiral bevel gears}} {{instead of the usual}} single set. The differential gears are part of the input <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> rather than between the output axles as in a conventional differential. All versions of the Tatra differential have locking pins that can force the differential gears to rotate together, “locking” the differential. This arrangement had two distinct advantages. The first is that the dual output bevel gears allow the axles to swing around the <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> without the need for universal couplings. The second is that the input <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> goes essentially straight through the differential housing, allowing simple coupling to a second set of swing axles. This modular design enables configurations of 2, 3, 4, 5, or even 6 axles with all <b>axles</b> <b>driven.</b> The whole assembly is part of the backbone frame.|$|R

In general, each <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> on a locomotive is free to move about one inch (2.5 cm) vertically relative to the frame, with the locomotive weight carried on springs.
