500|$|Because {{the output}} of {{forecast}} models based on <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dynamics</b> requires corrections near ground level, model output statistics (MOS) were developed in the 1970s and 1980s for individual forecast points (locations). The MOS apply statistical techniques to post-process {{the output of}} dynamical models with the most recent surface observations and the forecast point's climatology. [...] This technique can correct for model resolution as well as model biases. [...] Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the forecast skill of numerical weather models only extends to about two weeks into the future, since the density and quality of observationstogether with the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations {{used to calculate the}} forecastintroduce errors which double every five days.

In 1966, West Germany and the United States began producing operational forecasts based on primitive-equation models, followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977. Later additions to primitive equation models allowed additional insight into different weather phenomena. In the United States, solar radiation effects {{were added to the}} primitive equation model in 1967; moisture effects and latent heat were added in 1968; and feedback effects from rain on convection were incorporated in 1971. [...] Three years later, the first global forecast model was introduced. [...] Sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971.
