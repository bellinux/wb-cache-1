5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk.

5|$|However, not all inhibitors {{are based}} on the {{structures}} of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the left. This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate.

5|$|Some plants {{mimic the}} {{presence}} of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to lay their eggs on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius butterflies on their leaves, which discourage oviposition by butterflies.|$|E
5|$|Viruses (particularly rotavirus) and the {{bacteria}} Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species {{are the primary}} causes of gastroenteritis. There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but they <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E

Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E
5|$|According to writer Devin Grayson, {{the amount}} of {{creative}} freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change their sexuality <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be shown as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, fans are often disgruntled, particularly when sexuality is involved, and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable.|$|E

5|$|Corrective rape is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated rats are physiologically {{and psychologically}} {{different}} from their wild relatives, and—when acquired from reputable breeders and shops—pose no more of a health risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, while exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like Salmonella into the home. Fancy rats experience different health risks from their wild counterparts, and thus <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to succumb {{to many of the}} same illnesses as wild rats.|$|E
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, the average lifespan {{for a male}} Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity was 278 days and for a female was 356 days.

Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is not always possible in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the life expectancy of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters.|$|E

30|$|The longer {{travel time}} of the most {{frequent}} trips <b>is,</b> the <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> the respondents <b>are</b> {{to be satisfied with}} the travel time.

Two congestion indicators are also significant in the model. If the road is full of vehicles, then respondents will <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to feel satisfied with travel time. And if respondents need to wait for two green lights to go through the intersection, it means the travel time is longer than usual, so they will <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to feel satisfied with the travel time.|$|R
5|$|In {{areas where}} the least weasel is {{sympatric}} with the stoat, the two species {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the freedom offered by the genres, gay {{characters}} often remain contrived and stereotypical, and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions. Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically, or by including LGBT characters {{in such a way}} as to not contradict mainstream society's assumptions about gender roles. Works that feature gay characters are more likely to be written by women writers, and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to explore gay themes.|$|E
