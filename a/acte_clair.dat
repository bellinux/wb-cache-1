In the UK, for example, Lord Denning MR considered it appropriate to refer if {{the outcome of a}} case depended on a correct answer, and the Civil Procedure Rules entitle the High Court to refer at any stage of proceedings. The view of the Court of Justice in the leading case, CILFIT v Ministry of Health is that a national court has no duty to refer if the law is <b>acte</b> <b>clair</b> (a clear rule), or [...] "so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt as to {{the manner in which the}} question raised is to be resolved". In Kenny Roland Lyckeskog the Court of Justice held that the duty to refer existed for the Swedish Court of Appeal, the hovrätt, since Sweden's Supreme Court (Högsta domstol) had to give permission for appeals to continue. The practical difficulty is that judges differ on their views of whether or not the law is clear. In a significant case, Three Rivers DC v Governor of the Bank of England the UK House of Lords felt confident that it was clear under the First Banking Directive that depositors did not have direct rights to sue the Bank of England for alleged failure to carry out adequate prudential regulation. Their Lordships highlighted that while some uncertainty might exist, the costs of delay in making a reference outweighed the benefits from total certainty. By contrast, in ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis, a majority of the Supreme Court apparently felt able to declare that the law under Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive was <b>acte</b> <b>clair,</b> and decline to make a reference, even though a senior Law Lord delivered a powerfully reasoned dissent. However, in addition to a reluctance to make references, a general scepticism has grown among senior member state judiciaries of the mode of reasoning used by the Court of Justice. The UK Supreme Court in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport devoted large parts of its judgment to criticism, in its view, an unpredictable 'teleological' mode of reasoning which, could decrease confidence in maintaining a dialogue within a plural and transnational judicial system. It added that it might not interpret the European Communities Act 1972 to abridge basic principles and understanding of constitutional functioning – in effect implying that it might decline to follow unreasonable Court of Justice judgments on important issues. Similarly, the German Constitutional Court in the Outright Monetary Transactions case referred a question for preliminary ruling on whether the European Central Bank's plan to buy Greek and other government bonds on secondary markets, despite the Treaty prohibition on buying them directly, was unlawful. In a highly unusual move, the two most senior judges dissented that the ECB's plan could be lawful, while the majority closely guided the Court of Justice on the appropriate mode of reasoning.|$|E
50|$|The <b>acte</b> <b>clair</b> {{doctrine}} has {{its roots}} in the Cilfit judgement delivered in 1982, which developed what was called 'Cilfit criteria'. Though at the beginning it was believed that the Court of Justice of the European Union would be very strict as to its application, recent scholarly papers claim that Cilfit criteria, although often quoted in judgments and doctrine, have been applied neither consistently nor truly rigidly by the Court. Instead, a more flexible approach to <b>acte</b> <b>clair</b> requirements is taking shape.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acte</b> <b>clair</b> is a {{doctrine}} of EU law, which states that if a judgment or {{rule of law is}} clear enough, then a member state has no duty to refer a question for preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice of the European Union.|$|E
50|$|The Court of Justice {{held that}} a {{national}} court of last instance is {{under no obligation to}} refer when the issue is <b>acte</b> <b>clair</b> or when the ECJ has already ruled on the question of interpretation referred by the national court.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the issues {{concerning}} the communication between the national courts of the European Union Member States and the Court of Justice of the European Union via the preliminary ruling procedure. The doctrines of <b>acte</b> <b>clair</b> and acte éclairé are described briefly in the article. The authors explicitly investigate the national court’s right {{to apply to the}} Court of Justice of the European Union and the obligation to apply to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis are CILFIT criterions. These criterions were {{established}} by the Court of Justice of the European Union as conditions for application of the <b>acte</b> <b>clair</b> doctrine by national courts of last resort. The conditions determine situations in which such a court {{does not have an}} obligation under Article 267 / 3 to bring a matter before the Court of Justice. First of all, thesis describes the historical circumstances, which gave rise to the CILFIT case as well as the facts of that issue. Then it analyses one by one CILFIT criterions and also current procedure of submitting preliminary questions as a whole. As a part of the analysis, it focuses on the practical application of the abovementioned conditions by the courts of the Member States. It targets purely theoretical ideas too. The thesis, further, identifies certain problematic aspects of the CILFIT conditions. Subsequently, some possible solutions are being suggested and their effectiveness and appropriateness are being examined...|$|E
40|$|Article 158 (3) of Hong Kong’s post-handover {{constitution}} stipulates {{a preliminary}} reference procedure that was modelled upon article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”). In the first 16 {{years of its}} life, Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal (“CFA”) has through four judgments laid down some principles for implementing the reference procedure. Yet the jurisprudence is unclear and pertinent aspects of the procedure remain undefined. Notwithstanding calls by jurists for the CFA to draw on principles developed by the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) under article 267 TFEU, there has hitherto been no discussion on how meaningful transposition can take place, given the vast differences in institutional, constitutional and political landscapes between the EU and Chinese contexts. This paper seeks to plug this gap by sketching a set of criteria for evaluating the transposability of article 267 principles to Hong Kong, and applying such criteria to examine how the CFA can borrow from the ECJ’s resources in resolving key issues it faces in implementing article 158 (3). This paper will make two points. First, the CFA may borrow a juridical doctrine developed under article 267 TFEU only if the doctrine {{is in line with}} the text and purposes of article 158 (3) as well as the institutional and constitutional role of the CFA. Secondly, applying such criteria, while some of the ECJ’s principles can assist the CFA in rationalising existing jurisprudence and answering unresolved questions, others, including the <b>acte</b> <b>clair</b> doctrine, are not transposable. postprin...|$|E

40|$|In CILFIT (case 283 / 81), the European Court of Justice (ECJ) {{endorsed}} {{the use of}} the <b>acte</b> <b>clair</b> doctrine – the notion that national courts of “last resort” may decide to refrain from seeking a preliminary ruling under Article 234 (3) EC. The Court also stipulated a list of factors – the CILFIT criteria – that should be satisfied before the doctrine may be properly invoked. One criterion is that the national court “must be convinced that the matter is equally obvious to the courts of the other Member States” (emphasis added). In 1982, there were nine “other” Member States; in 2008, there are 26. Another criterion requires courts to bear in mind that Community legislation is “drafted in several languages”. There were seven official languages in 1982; there are now 22 (23 if Irish is included). The CILFIT criteria were difficult to satisfy in 1982; they have become increasingly more difficult as EU membership has expanded; they are, it is submitted, practically impossible to satisfy in any meaningful sense in 2008. The CILFIT criteria should therefore be re-written. As EU membership has expanded (and looks set for further expansion in the not too distant future), various reform proposals concerning the preliminary rulings procedure have been formulated, the central idea being to change the “judicial architecture” to allow the ECJ to cope with its ever increasing workload. The most notable of these is (by default, given that it {{is the only one that}} has actually been implemented) : the insertion of the present Article 225 (3) EC by the Treaty of Amsterdam, conferring limited jurisdiction for dealing with preliminary rulings on the Court of First Instance (CFI). More specifically, the CFI is authorised to deal with preliminary rulings in as yet unspecified ‘specific areas’. The time has come to bring Article 225 (3) EC into effect, with the free movement of goods being selected as the first ‘specific area’...|$|E
