5|$|Despite its {{abundance}} in certain areas, the Caribbean reef shark {{is one of}} the least-studied large requiem sharks.

Juveniles tend to remain in a localized area throughout the year, while adults range over a wider area.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors are {{molecules}} that reduce or abolish enzyme activity, while enzyme activators are {{molecules that}} increase the catalytic rate of enzymes.

5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive <b>activity,</b> <b>or</b> difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present {{for more than six}} months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E
5|$|During an {{encounter}} with Jupiter in 1992, the Ulysses spacecraft detected a stream of dust-sized particles being ejected from the Jovian system. The dust in these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter at speeds upwards of several hundred kilometres per second, has an average particle size of 10μm, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by Galileo showed that these dust streams originate from Io, but exactly how these form, whether from Io's volcanic <b>activity</b> <b>or</b> material removed from the surface, is unknown.|$|E

A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, but held shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E
5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual <b>activity</b> <b>or</b> its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction. Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell. Many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell, which may have enzymatic <b>activity</b> <b>or</b> may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell.|$|E

5|$|Polyphenols, {{which often}} have {{antioxidant}} properties in vitro, {{are not necessarily}} antioxidants in vivo due to extensive metabolism. In many polyphenols, the catechol group acts as electron acceptor and is therefore responsible for the antioxidant activity. However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake in the human body, for example by catechol-O-methyl transferase, and is therefore {{no longer able to}} act as electron acceptor. Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect cell-to-cell signaling, receptor sensitivity, inflammatory enzyme <b>activity</b> <b>or</b> gene regulation.|$|E
5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual <b>activity</b> <b>or</b> engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied.|$|E
5|$|The average {{salinity}} of Earth's oceans {{is about}} 35grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).

The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential {{for the survival of}} many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.|$|E

5|$|The {{central nervous}} system {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The {{central nervous system}} is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak <b>activity</b> <b>or</b> when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E
5|$|The crew of EO-19 {{conducted}} {{their first}} Extra-vehicular <b>activity,</b> <b>or</b> spacewalk, on July 14. Before the mission, {{the crew had}} trained to use special tools in order to release a stuck solar array on {{the exterior of the}} Spektr module. During the spacewalk, the pair cut a problematic restraint from the solar array. All but one section of the array deployed successfully. They then proceeded to inspect a docking mechanism in preparation for the relocation of the Kristall module. The final task of the spacewalk was to inspect a solar array on Kristall that was not tracking the Sun properly. The excursion ended after five hours and thirty-four minutes outside the station.|$|E
5|$|The great {{northern}} tilefish has {{a unique}} burrowing behavior and habitat preference. In addition to their unique habitat choice, golden tilefish display sexually dimorphic growth with males growing to larger sizes and are behaviorally dominant over their female counterparts. The {{great northern tilefish}} is not a migratory fish; it stays in one local area that fits its needs all year round. Seasonal migration may occur with changes in the water temperatures around the Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank during the winter or spring, but this theory has no definitive evidence. A competing theory suggests that tilefish may instead reduce their <b>activity</b> <b>or</b> hibernate within their burrows during times of cold temperatures.|$|E
