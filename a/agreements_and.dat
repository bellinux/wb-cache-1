40|$|This paper {{aimed at}} {{studying}} provisions in TRIPs <b>Agreement</b> <b>and</b> Law Number 14 of 2001 regarding Patent, particularly provisions reflecting criteria of public interest. The approach used is statutory and conceptual approaches by analyzing TRIPs <b>Agreement</b> <b>and</b> Law Number 14 of 2001. It is concluded that public interest has been stipulated generally in TRIPs <b>Agreement</b> <b>and</b> Law Number 14 of 2001 in their provisions regarding kind {{and scope of}} the use of limitation and exception of patent holder???s exclusive rights. Law Number 14 of 2001 basically has implemented limitation and exception provisions stipulated in TRIPs Agreement. However, unfortunately it does not provide further and clearer elaborations on some provisions that need to be elaborated further. In addition, both TRIPs <b>Agreement</b> <b>and</b> Law Number 14 of 2001 do not provide criteria as to public interest...|$|R

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the European Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. These frequently hold pre-meetings of their European Council members, prior to its meetings. However, the European Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and decisions are generally made on these lines, though ideological alignment can colour their political <b>agreements</b> <b>and</b> their choice of appointments (such as their president).|$|E
5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as <b>agreements</b> <b>and</b> bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{signing the}} accords, Arafat—as Chairman of the PLO and its {{official}} representative—signed two letters renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel. In return, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, {{on behalf of}} Israel, officially recognized the PLO. The following year, Arafat and Rabin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Shimon Peres. The Palestinian reaction was mixed. The Rejectionist Front of the PLO allied itself with Islamists in a common opposition against the agreements. It was rejected also by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan {{as well as by}} many Palestinian intellectuals and the local leadership of the Palestinian territories. However, the inhabitants of the territories generally accepted the <b>agreements</b> <b>and</b> Arafat's promise for peace and economic well-being.|$|E
5|$|That the negotiations, {{acceptance}} of the assignment and <b>agreements</b> <b>and</b> understandings in respect thereof were within the competence of the President may not be doubted. Governmental power over external affairs is not distributed, but is vested exclusively in the national government. And in respect of what was done here, the Executive had authority to speak as the sole organ of that government. The assignment and the agreements in connection therewith did not, {{as in the case}} of treaties, as that term is used in the treaty making clause of the Constitution (article 2, 2), require the advice and consent of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 war {{convinced}} the Israelis {{of the necessity}} of negotiations with the Arabs.

The negotiations ultimately resulted in the 1978 Camp David <b>Agreements,</b> <b>and</b> the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979. Thus, without resorting to another major war, Sadat had been able to regain the Sinai through diplomatic means.|$|E
