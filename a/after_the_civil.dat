5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, Goodrich Castle {{remained}} with the Earls of Kent until 1740, {{when it was}} sold by Henry Grey to Admiral Thomas Griffin. Griffin undertook some restoration of the castle but retained it as a ruin.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, Powell {{was made}} a baronet by Charles II. Although it is {{unrecorded}} when Bodiam Castle was dismantled (slighted), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, many castles were slighted {{to prevent them from}} being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the barbican, the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.|$|E

5|$|During the Civil War {{the largest}} {{substantial}} {{conflict in the}} area was the Battle of Naseby in 1645, although a minor skirmish in the town resulted {{in the killing of}} a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer. Severe reprisals followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest, Thomas Jones, and 40 prisoners by a group of Roundheads. However, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War Wellingborough was home to a colony of Diggers. Little is known about this period.|$|E

5|$|During {{the decades}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, St. Louis grew {{to become the}} nation's fourth largest city, after New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago.

5|$|Federal Reconstruction in Mobile began <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War and {{effectively}} ended in 1874 {{when the local}} Democrats gained control of the city government. The {{last quarter of the}} 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile. One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3million in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.|$|E

5|$|When the war ended, the state's Democrats {{were upset}} about their wartime {{treatment}} by the Republicans, but they staged a quick comeback. Indiana {{became the first}} state <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War to elect a Democratic governor, Thomas Hendricks.

5|$|After {{living in}} his new house for three years, Big Jim died of {{tuberculosis}} on October14, 1858. His widow, Elizabeth, {{lived in the house}} until <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War. In 1867 or 1869, she sold the house, the Collins Tract and the remainder of Lot Number20 to Charles Harmison (1823–1896) for $8,500, moving with her remaining children to Missouri (where she died in 1883). The cost of building the house financially strained the Parsons family; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house as a result of additional, war-related financial stress from which the family could not recover.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War {{and until}} his {{transfer}} back East in 1887, he served {{primarily on the}} western frontier. He engaged many Native American tribes, dealt with many types of renegades and explored vast areas of uncharted territory from Texas to Arizona. During the Spanish–American War, he commanded an occupation force {{and became the first}} military governor of Puerto Principe, Cuba. After 38 continuous years of service to his country, he retired from the Army on October 19, 1899, as a brigadier general. After his retirement, he became a speaker and a writer.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, Oxford Castle served {{primarily}} {{as the local}} prison. As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging. The prison also had a gallows to execute prisoners, such as Mary Blandy in 1752. For most of the 18th century, the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including {{the extent to which}} vermin infested the prison. Partly {{as a result of this}} criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison.|$|E
