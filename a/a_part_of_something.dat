500|$|The Hornets {{completed}} the 2005–06 season by winning 38 games, tenth in the Western Conference. They {{became the first}} team since the 1974–75 Boston Celtics to play home games at four separate venues: the Ford Center in Oklahoma City, the New Orleans Arena in New Orleans, the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge, and the Lloyd Noble Center in Norman, Oklahoma. The Hornets had finished last in attendance in the previous season in New Orleans, but playing in Ford Center, they averaged 18,168 fans, a 78% increase. Referring to the fan support in Oklahoma City, Hornets star Chris Paul said that [...] "You get a feeling you're <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> special"; mayor Mick Cornett said, [...] "My expectations were lofty, but we've exceeded them." ...|$|E

Hayes said: [...] "I'm proud of being <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> in history and I'm proud to {{have been given a}} {{platform}} to make people laugh." [...] McCormack added, [...] "We have never taken ourselves or this show too seriously but now that it's over I take our collective achievement very, very seriously." [...] The actors were satisfied with the episode and thought the viewers would find it satisfying as well. [...] "It's daring and ambitious and more far-reaching than most finales go. I think people will be quite surprised," [...] McCormack said. Messing added: [...] "I think Will & Grace fans will be satisfied.

[...] Kurt has twice been portrayed as a child: in the episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus", a series of flashback scenes show Kurt at the age of eight, in which the character is played by Adam Kolkin. Although Kolkin was thirteen {{at the time of the}} audition, which called for an eight-year-old, he was chosen in part because his resemblance to Colfer was [...] "so uncanny even the casting directors were taken aback". Kurt has also been shown even younger—in the episode [...] "The Substitute", club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) comes down with the flu and has a hallucination of the students as preschoolers; all twelve glee club members, including Kurt, are played by very young children.|$|E

50|$|Synecdoche, {{in which}} <b>a</b> {{specific}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> {{is used to}} refer to the whole, is usually understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Sometimes an absolute distinction is made between a metonymy and a synecdoche, treating metonymy as different from, rather than inclusive of, synecdoche. There is a similar problem with the terms simile and metaphor.|$|R

500|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza, Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening, and Ushkowitz, from the Broadway revival of The King and I. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele. Colfer had no previous professional experience, but reminded Ryan {{of the character of}} Kurt from The Sound of Music, and was thus cast as Kurt Hummel. He originally auditioned for Artie with the song [...] "Mr. Cellophane", however Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. Colfer commented on his casting: [...] "I'm so happy to be <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> that is so new and different and so needed at this time. It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, like myself, who need a little pick-me-up.

500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E

50|$|Belongingness is {{the human}} {{emotional}} need to be an accepted member of a group. Whether it is family, friends, co-workers, a religion, or something else, people tend to have an 'inherent' desire to belong and be <b>an</b> important <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> greater than themselves. This implies a relationship that is greater than simple acquaintance or familiarity. The need to belong {{is the need to}} give, and receive attention to, and from, others.|$|R

'It is easy for me to admit that I am wrong,' ... these positive traits could very well be the outcome or the results of spirituality. However, should they be part of the definition itself?... completely secular persons and atheists may experience these things as frequently or more frequently than so called 'spiritual persons" [...] (p.352). Others have empirically tested this issue for the BMMRSs Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale finding that it is composed of two factors - theism and civility — with many people who eschew religion and spirituality scoring highly on civility.|$|E

This relies on the experience that man, handing himself down through signs, simulates a kind of sense-wholeness.

After {{a century and a half}} of labor-saving machinery, we work about as hard as ever. With a power over nature multiplied a hundred fold, nature still conquers us. And more than this. There are many senses in which the machine age seems to leave the great bulk of civilized humanity, the working part of it, worse off instead of better. The nature of our work has changed. No man now makes anything. He makes only <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>something,</b> feeding and tending a machine that moves with relentless monotony in the routine of which both the machine and its tender are only a fractional part.|$|E

[...] "It is, of course, <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else," [...] he amplified. He was writing a book, [...] "an enormous sort of book." [...] He laughed with a touch of shyness. It was about [...] "everything," [...] about how to live and how not to live. And [...] "aristocracy, and all sorts of things." [...] White was always curious about other people's books. Benham became earnest and more explicit under encouragement, and to talk about his book was soon to talk about himself. In various ways, intentionally and inadvertently, he told White much. These chance encounters, these intimacies of the train and hotel, will lead men at times to a stark frankness of statement they would never permit themselves with habitual friends.|$|E

5000|$|Mason was {{a leading}} {{advocate}} of comparative studies in fascism and in the 1980s strongly criticised the German philosopher Ernst Nolte for comparing the Holocaust to events that Mason regarded as totally unrelated to Nazi Germany such as the Armenian genocide and the Khmer Rouge genocides. By contrast, Mason argued that there was much to learn by comparing Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy to produce a theory of generic fascism. In Mason's view, Nazism was only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wider fascist phenomenon.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the term 'context' and the aim has been to reason about the term {{in order to see}} whether it is {{possible}} to reach a satisfactory understanding of the concept.

It aims to synthesise results of studies within psychology, cognitive science, anthropology, and human-computer interaction. My understanding is that context is not <b>something</b> we are <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of,</b> but rather <b>something</b> we create mentally in relation a specific goal. Determination <b>of</b> <b>something</b> ambiguous thus comes from top-down processes related to a goal.
