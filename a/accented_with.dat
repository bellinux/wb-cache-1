50|$|Black Africans {{generally}} speak English as {{a second}} language, and accent is strongly influenced by mother-tongue (particularly Bantu languages).

[...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] is a contemporary ballad that contains a sound reflecting influences from minimalist music.

The track [...] "Wake Up America" [...] has a [...] "cheeky riff-rock backdrop" [...] as its, while its lyrical content concerns environmentalism, where Cyrus mainly pleads for audiences to give the Earth [...] "just a little attention".

Her look is one part police officer and two parts jailbait." [...] Another piece designed by Diesel was an outfit consisting of jean-shorts and a leather jacket embroiled with the word [...] "Texas". Biker gangs that developed in the United States after World War II served as an inspiration for the outfit; Beyoncé's was meant as a tribute to her hometown and a reminder of her roots. It took 4–5 hours to add the word Texas to the leather jacket. The bondage bodysuit was described as [...] "a riff off of an urban bomber hoodie jacket that was cropped to expose a bondage bodysuit underneath that has graphic cutouts. When worn up, the oversized hood covers the face, adding an incognito element reminiscent of the On The Run theme." [...] It also contained snakeskin seamed into the sleeves of the outfit. One of the more controversial pieces worn by Beyoncé during the On the Run Tour was a black, thong leotard that [...] "put her bare rear end on display in a kind of cage-like cutout".

During the performance of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", Beyoncé revisited a leotard from the song's music video in a black and gold lace bodysuit designed by Michael Costello who wanted [...] "Beyoncé to feel beautiful, strong, super sexy and ventilated" [...] with the outfit.
