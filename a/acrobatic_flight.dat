40|$|Male blowflies {{chase and}} catch other flies in fast <b>acrobatic</b> <b>flights.</b> To unravel the {{underlying}} control system, we presented a black moving sphere {{instead of a}} real fly as a pursuit target. By varying the size and speed of the target, {{we were able to}} systematically analyse the decisive visual determinants that guide chasing behaviour. Flies pursue targets {{of a wide range of}} sizes and velocities. The percentage of pursuits resulting in target capture decreases with increasing target size and speed. Chasing male flies adjust their forward velocity depending on the retinal size of the target, indicating that retinal size is a relevant input variable of the control system. The chasing fly focuses the target with great accuracy in the frontal part of its visual field by means of a smooth pursuit control system using the retinal position of the target to determine the flight direction. We conclude that for a comprehensive understanding of chasing control different time lags in the control systems of angular and forward velocity together with the impact of inertia on fly movements need to be taken into account...|$|R

40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in size {{is common}} in birds. Males are usually larger than females, although in some taxa reversed size dimorphism (RSD) predominates. Whilst direct dimorphism is attributed to sexual selection in males giving greater reproductive access to females, the evolutionary causes of RSD are still unclear. Four different hypotheses could explain the evolution of RSD in monogamous birds: (1) The ‘energy storing’ hypothesis suggests that larger females could accumulate more reserves at wintering or refuelling areas to enable an earlier start to egg laying. (2) According to the ‘incubation ability’ hypothesis, RSD has evolved because large females can incubate more efficiently than small ones. (3) The ‘parental role division’ hypothesis suggests that RSD in monogamous waders has evolved in species with parental role division and uniparental male care of the chicks. It {{is based on the}} assumption that small male size facilitates food acquisition in terrestrial habitats where chick rearing takes place and that larger females can accumulate more reserves for egg laying in coastal sites. (3) The ‘display agility’ hypothesis suggests that small males perform better in acrobatic displays presumably involved in mate choice and so RSD may have evolved due to female preference for agile males. I tested these hypotheses in monogamous waders using several comparative methods. Given the current knowledge of the phylogeny of this group, the evolutionary history of waders seems only compatible with the hypothesis that RSD has evolved as an adaptation for increasing display performance in males. In addition, the analysis of wing shape showed that males of species with <b>acrobatic</b> <b>flight</b> displays had wings with higher aspect ratio (wing span/ 2 wing area) than non-acrobatic species, which probably increases flight manoeuvrability during acrobatic displays. In species with acrobatic displays males also had a higher aspect ratio than females although no sexual difference was found in non-acrobatic species. These results suggest that <b>acrobatic</b> <b>flight</b> displays could have produced changes in the morphology of some species and suggest the existence of selection favouring higher manoeuvrability in species with <b>acrobatic</b> <b>flight</b> displays. This supports the validity of the mechanisms proposed by the ‘display agility’ hypothesis to explain the evolution of RSD in wadersPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Insect {{hovering}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fascinating <b>acrobatic</b> <b>flight</b> modes in nature, and its aerodynamics has been intensively studied, mainly through computational approaches. While the numerical analyses have revealed detailed vortical structures around flapping wings and resulting forces for specific hovering conditions, theoretical understanding of a simple unified mechanism enabling the insects to be airborne is still incomplete. Here, we construct a scaling law for the lift of hovering insects through relatively simple scaling arguments of the strength of the leading edge vortex and the momentum induced by the vortical structure. Comparison of our theory with the measurement data of 35 species of insects confirms that the scaling law captures the essential physics of lift generation of hovering insects. Our results offer a simple yet powerful guideline for biologists who seek the evolutionary direction of the shape and kinematics of insect wings, and for engineers who design flapping-based micro air vehicles.

It has also been analysed the horizontal tail load, acting on the inverted fly and caused by both gusts and brutal control.

The focus is on static analysis of longitudinal balance of the airplane under normal inverted flight.

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of the sensory world is encoded by neurons in sequences of discrete, identical pulses termed action potentials or spikes. There is persistent controversy {{about the extent to}} which the precise timing of these spikes is relevant to the function of the brain. We revisit this issue, using the motion-sensitive neurons of the fly visual system as a test case. New experimental methods allow us to deliver more nearly natural visual stimuli, comparable to those which flies encounter in free, <b>acrobatic</b> <b>flight,</b> and new mathematical methods allow us to draw more reliable conclusions about the information content of neural responses even when the set of possible responses is very large. We find that significant amounts of visual information are represented by details of the spike train at millisecond and sub-millisecond precision, even though the sensory input has a correlation time of ~ 60 ms; different patterns of spike timing represent distinct motion trajectories, and the absolute timing of spikes points to particular features of these trajectories with high precision. Under these naturalistic conditions, the system continues to transmit more information at higher photon flux, even though individual photoreceptors are counting more than one million photons per second, and removes redundancy in the stimulus to generate a more efficient neural code.

40|$|Abstract. Charadrii (shorebirds, gulls, and alcids) have {{an unusual}} {{diversity}} in their sexual size dimorphism, ranging from monomorphism to either male-biased or female-biased dimorphism. We use comparative analyses {{to investigate whether}} this variation relates to sexual selection through competition for mates or natural selection through different use of resources by males and females. As predicted by sexual selection theory, we found that in taxa with socially polygynous mating systems, males were relatively larger than females compared with less polygynous species. Fur-thermore, evolution toward socially polyandrous mating systems was correlated with decreases in relative male size. These patterns depend on the kinds of courtship displays performed by males. In taxa with <b>acrobatic</b> <b>flight</b> displays, males are relatively smaller than in taxa in which courtship involves simple flights or displays from the ground. This result remains significant when the relationship with mating system is controlled statistically, thereby explaining the enigma of why males are often smaller than females in socially monogamous species. We did not find evidence that evolutionary changes in sexual dimorphism relate to niche division on the breeding grounds. In particular, biparental species did not have greater dimorphism in bill lengths than uniparental species, contrary to the hypothesis that selection for ecological divergence on the breeding grounds has been important as a general explanation for patterns of bill dimorphism. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that sexual selection has had {{a major influence on}} sexual size dimorphism in Charadrii, whereas divergence in the use of feeding resources while breeding was no...|$|E

Finally, the efficiency of our entropy estimator makes it possible to uncover features of neural coding relevant for natural visual stimuli: first, the system's information transmission rate varies with natural fluctuations in light intensity, resulting from varying cloud cover, such that marginal increases in information rate thus occur even when the individual photoreceptors are counting on the order of one million photons per second. Secondly, we see that the system exploits the relatively slow dynamics of the stimulus to remove coding redundancy and so generate a more efficient neural code...|$|E
40|$|Raffaello D'Andrea, {{committee}} chair; Mark Campbell; Ephrahim GarciaPotential {{applications of}} autonomous vehicles range from unmanned surveillance to {{search and rescue}} applications dangerous to human beings. Vehicles specifically designed for hover flight have their own possible applications, including the formation of high gain airborne phased antenna arrays. With this specific application in mind, the Cornell Autonomous Flying Vehicle (AFV) team sought to produce a four rotor hovering vehicle capable of eventual untethered acrobatic autonomous flights. The mechanical design of the AFV included both {{the selection of a}} battery-motor-gearing-prop combination for efficient thrust production and the design of a lightweight yet sufficiently stiff vehicle structure. The components chosen were selected from the variety of brushless motors, battery technologies and cell configurations, and fixed pitch propellers suited to use in a four rotor hovering vehicle. The vehicle structure settled upon achieved a high degree of stiffness with minimal weight through the use of thin walled aluminum compression members supported by stranded steel cable. In addition to an efficient mechanical design, the vehicle also required onboard control and inertial navigation. In order to evaluate a variety of potential vehicle sensor, actuator, estimation, and control scenarios, a fully configurable nonlinear simulation of vehicle and sensor dynamics was also constructed. For the current iteration of the vehicle, a square root implementation of a Sigma Point Filter was used for estimation while a simple Linear Quadratic Regulator based on the nonlinear vehicle dynamics linearized about hover provided vehicle control. Sensory feedback on the current vehicle included an onboard inertial measurement unit and a human observer, to be eventually replaced by GPS or an indoor equivalent. While a hardware failure prevented the completion of a full range of tests, the team was able to complete a hands-free hover test that demonstrated the capabilities of the vehicle. Supplemented with various other final hardware tests, the vehicle demonstrated stable hover flight, potential vehicle endurance in the range of 10 - 15 minutes, and possible vertical acceleration of 0. 8 g beyond hover thrust. The final vehicle represented a significant achievement in terms of overall design and vehicle capability while future improvements will demonstrate more advanced nonlinear control algorithms and <b>acrobatic</b> <b>flight</b> maneuvers.
