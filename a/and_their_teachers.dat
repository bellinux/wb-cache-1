5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century, many {{critics of the}} {{examination}} system and government-run schools initiated a movement to revive private academies. During {{the course of the}} Southern Song, the academy became a viable alternative to the state school system. Even those that were semi-private or state-sponsored were still seen as independent of the state's influence <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> uninterested in larger, nationwide issues. One of the earliest academic institutions established in the Song period was the Yuelu Academy, founded in 976 during the reign of Emperor Taizu (r. 960–976). The Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was once the head chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, established during the Tang dynasty. The Neo-Confucian Donglin Academy, established in 1111, was founded upon the staunch teaching that adulterant influences of other ideologies such as Buddhism should not influence the teaching of their purely Confucian school. This belief hearkened back to the writings of the Tang essayist, prose stylist, and poet Han Yu (768–824), who was certainly a critic of Buddhism and its influence upon Confucian values. Although the White Deer Grotto Academy of the Southern Tang (937–976) had fallen out of use during the early half of the Song, the Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200) reinvigorated it.|$|E

25|$|Women {{seeking an}} {{education}} {{were forced to}} attend underground schools, where they <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> risked execution if caught. They {{were not allowed to}} be treated by male doctors unless accompanied by a male chaperone, which led to illnesses remaining untreated. They faced public flogging and execution for violations of the Taliban's laws. The Taliban allowed and in some cases encouraged marriage for girls under the age of 16. Amnesty International reported that 80% of Afghan marriages were forced.|$|E

25|$|To {{the public}} {{ordinances}} {{of the church}} he scrupulously conformed. But, unfortunately, there were many things both in the teaching {{and the practice of}} the ecclesiastics of that day, which were calculated to repel men of sober judgment and high principle. These evil tendencies in the popular presentation of Christianity undoubtedly begot in Shaftesbury's mind a certain amount of repugnance and contempt to some of the doctrines of Christianity itself; and, cultivating, almost of set purpose, his sense of the ridiculous, he was too apt to assume towards such doctrines <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> a tone of raillery.|$|E
25|$|From {{this time}} on, Edmund Rice spent an {{increasing}} proportion {{of his time}} at Mount Sion and the adjoining school, showing a continued interest in the pupils <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers.</b> He would also take a short walk each day on the slope of Mount Sion, but his increasingly painful arthritis led the community superior, Brother Joseph Murphy, to purchase a wheelchair for his benefit. At Christmas time, 1841, Rice's health took {{a turn for the}} worse, and even though expectations of his imminent death did not turn out to be justified, he was increasingly confined to his room.|$|E
25|$|As {{an acronym}} of Science and Technology Academies Reinforcing Basic Aviation and Space Education, this youth program is {{intended}} to help students from 4th–12th grade to improve their math and science skills through aviation. The program starts in elementary school to attract and prepare students {{at an early age}} for careers in engineering and other science-related fields of study. The program principally exposes at-risk children <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> to real-world applications of math and science; it includes experiential learning, simulations, and experiments in aviation and space-related fields. The program also addresses drug use prevention, health, self esteem and life skills within a math-and science-based program. Founded in 1995 by SSgt Elaine Montgomery, the program celebrates its 15th anniversary in May, 2010.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, the Penrhos College {{site was}} taken over by the {{government}} for Ministry of Food use. The Duke of Devonshire, anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, offered Chatsworth House {{for the use of the}} school. The contents of the house were packed away in eleven days and 300 girls <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> moved in for a six-year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.|$|E

Hilda Kean writes that the Swedish activists were young and female, anti-establishment and progressive, and viewed the scientists as remnants of a previous age.

It has drawn comparisons to the Germans' destruction of the Czechoslovak village of Lidice in June 1942 and the massacre of the inhabitants of Oradour-sur-Glane, in France, in June 1944. To commemorate {{the victims of the}} Kragujevac massacre, the whole of Šumarice, where the killings took place, was designated a memorial park in 1953. It is now known as the October in Kragujevac Memorial Park, and covers [...] encompassing the area that contains the mass graves. The 21stOctober Museum was founded within the park on 15February 1976. There are also several monuments within the park, including the Interrupted Flight monument to the murdered high school students <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers,</b> and the monuments Pain and Defiance, One Hundred for One, and Resistance and Freedom. The Memorial Park website notes that the victims of the massacre included Serbs, Jews, Romani people, Muslims, Macedonians, Slovenes and members of other nationalities. The memorial was damaged during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999.|$|E

2500|$|Leo {{then goes}} on to note that, [...] "the {{majority}} of the students receiving assistance under the act are Black and Brown." [...] There have been various other Acts enacted to try and aid impoverished youth with the chance to succeed. One of these Acts includes the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This Act was meant to increase the accountability of public schools <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> by creating standardized testing which would give an overview {{of the success of the}} school's ability to educate their students. Schools which repeatedly performed poorly would have increased attention and assistance from the federal government. One of the intended outcomes of the Act was to narrow the class and racial achievement gap in the United States by instituting common expectations for all students. Test scores have shown to be improving for minority populations, however, they are improving at the same rate for Caucasian children as well. This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.|$|E
