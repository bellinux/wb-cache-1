5|$|Microorganisms {{and plants}} can {{synthesize}} many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make 2-aminoisobutyric acid and lanthionine, {{which is a}} sulfide-bridged derivative of <b>alanine.</b> Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic lantibiotics such as alamethicin. However, in plants, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate {{in the production of}} the plant hormone ethylene.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparative}} study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom. This total includes {{a full complement of}} 20 essential and nonessential amino acids. Analysis of the free amino acids (that is, those not bound up in protein) revealed glutamine and <b>alanine</b> to be the principal amino acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E
5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated <b>alanine</b> into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
40|$|Eight diseases, {{exemplified}} by Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, {{are caused by}} CAG-repeat expansion mutations. The CAG repeats are translated into expanded polyglutamine tracts, which are associated with deleterious novel functions. While these diseases are characterized by intraneuronal aggregate formation, {{it is unclear whether}} the aggregates cause disease. We have addressed this debate by generating intracellular aggregates with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to 19 - 37 <b>alanines.</b> No aggregates were seen in cells expressing native GFP or GFP fused to seven <b>alanines.</b> Aggregate-containing cells expressing GFP fused to 19 - 37 polyalanines show high rates of nuclear fragmentation compared with cells expressing the same constructs without aggregates, or cells expressing GFP fused to seven <b>alanines.</b> This suggests an association between aggregate formation and cell death...|$|R

40|$|SER {{virus is}} closely related to the {{paramyxovirus}} simian virus 5 (SV 5) but is defective in syncytium formation. The SER virus F protein has a long cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain that has been shown to inhibit membrane fusion, and this inhibitory effect could be eliminated by truncation of the C-terminal sequence (S. Tong, M. Li, A. Vincent, R. W. Compans, E. Fritsch, R. Beier, C. Klenk, M. Ohuchi, and H. -D. Klenk, Virology 301 : 322 - 333, 2002). To study the sequence requirements for regulation of fusion, codons for SER virus F protein residues spanning amino acids 535 to 542 and 548 were mutated singly to <b>alanines,</b> and the two leucine residues at positions 539 and 548 were mutated doubly to <b>alanines.</b> We found that leu- 539 and leu- 548 in the CT domain {{played a critical role in}} the inhibition of fusion, as mutation of the two leucines singly to <b>alanines</b> partially rescued fusion, and the double mutation L 539, 548 A completely rescued syncytium formation. Mutation of charged residues to <b>alanines</b> had little effect on the suppression of fusion activity, whereas the mutation of serine residues to <b>alanines</b> enhanced fusion activity significantly. The L 539, 548 A mutant also showed extensive syncytium formation when expressed without the SER virus HN protein. By constructing a chimeric SV 5 -SER virus F CT protein, we also found that the inhibitory effect of the long CT of the SER virus F protein could be partially transferred to the SV 5 F protein. These results demonstrate that an elongated CT of a paramyxovirus F protein interferes with membrane fusion in a sequence-dependent manner...|$|R
5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised {{white blood cell}} count and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in <b>alanine</b> transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E
5|$|Some non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are {{not found in}} proteins. Examples include 2-aminoisobutyric acid and the {{neurotransmitter}} gamma-aminobutyric acid. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids– for example, ornithine and citrulline occur in the urea cycle, part of amino acid catabolism (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid beta <b>alanine</b> (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), a component of coenzyme A.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general, but somewhat {{dependent on the}} amino acid sequence. Long sequences of alternating glycine and <b>alanine</b> {{have been shown to}} inhibit substrate unfolding, decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts, possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps. Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in silk fibroin; in particular, certain Epstein–Barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the major histocompatibility complex.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of linoleic acid, with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid. Pyrazine compounds might {{be responsible for the}} characteristic odour of the dried mushroom. The predominant sterol present in the fruit bodies is ergosterol, with smaller amounts of closely related derivative compounds. The main fatty acids of the mushroom include linoleic acid (53.4% of total fatty acids), oleic acid (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%). Arginine is the free amino acid found in the highest concentration (96.9μM per gram of dry weight), followed by glutamine (9.7) and <b>alanine</b> (8.2).|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and <b>alanine)</b> fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in <b>alanine</b> transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

25|$|There exists no theory elucidating {{correlations}} among L-amino acids. If one takes, for example, <b>alanine,</b> {{which has a}} small methyl group, and phenylalanine, which has a larger benzyl group, a simple question is in what aspect, L-alanine resembles L-phenylalanine more than D-phenylalanine, {{and what kind of}} mechanism causes the selection of all L-amino acids.

The ClgR regulon also includes the clgR gene itself. It is shown here that the degradation of ClgR and Lon is ClpP 1 /P 2 -dependent and that the two C-terminal <b>alanines</b> of these new substrates are involved in their stability. The ClpC 1 protein, which does not end with two <b>alanines,</b> is also accumulated in a clpP 1 P 2 mutant.

25|$|Chemicals {{produce a}} wide variety of {{clinical}} and pathological hepatic injury. Biochemical markers (e.g. <b>alanine</b> transferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin) are often used to indicate liver damage. Liver injury is defined as a rise in either (a) ALT level more than three times of upper limit of normal (ULN), (b) ALP level more than twice ULN, or (c) total bilirubin level more than twice ULN when associated with increased ALT or ALP. Liver damage is further characterized into hepatocellular (predominantly initial <b>Alanine</b> transferase elevation) and cholestatic (initial alkaline phosphatase rise) types.

50|$|Mutations in PABPN1 {{that cause}} this disorder, result when the protein has an {{extended}} polyalanine tract (12-17 <b>alanines</b> long vs. the expected amount of 10). The extra <b>alanines</b> cause PABPN1 to aggregate and form clumps within muscles {{because they are}} not able to be broken down. These clumps are believed to disrupt the normal function of muscle cells which eventually lead to cell death. This progressive loss of muscle cells most likely causes the weakness in muscles seen in patients with OPMD. It is still not known why this disorder only affects certain muscles like the upper leg and hip. In recent studies on OPMD within drosophila flies, {{it has been shown that}} the degeneration of muscles within those who are affected may not solely be due to the expanded polyalanine tract. It may actually be due to the RNA-binding domain and its function in binding.|$|R

40|$|Tropomyosin is a two-chain α-helical coiled coil whose {{periodic}} {{interactions with}} the F-actin helix are critical for thin filament stabilization and the regulation of muscle contraction. Here we deduce the mechanical and chemical basis of these interactions from the 2. 3 -Å-resolution crystal structure of the middle three of tropomyosin's seven periods. Geometrically specific bends of the coiled coil, produced by clusters of core <b>alanines,</b> and variable bends about gaps in the core, produced by isolated <b>alanines,</b> occur along the molecule.
