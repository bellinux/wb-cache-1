5|$|The album {{contains}} less {{anger and}} profanity than their previous self-titled album, {{as they had}} mellowed out and matured <b>as</b> <b>men</b> and as a band. More of the songs dealt with real-life issues, to the praise of fans and critics.|$|E

5|$|A 1994 {{community-based}} {{study indicated}} that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women {{were found to be}} twice as likely to be affected <b>as</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E

5|$|Artillery and {{long-range}} {{machine gun}} fire continued to riddle the wrecks and the combined crews {{were ordered to}} evacuate as the officers set the scuttling charges which would sink the blockships in their current, useless locations. <b>As</b> <b>men</b> scrambled {{down the side of}} the cruisers into Coastal Motor Boats which would relay them to the Offshore Squadron, destroyers moved closer to Ostend to cover the retreat and the monitors continued their heavy fire. Godsal was the last to leave, picked up by launch ML276 commanded by Lieutenant Rowley Bourke. With the main assault a complete failure, the blockading forces returned to Dover and Dunkirk to assess the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Both the St. Louis German and Irish {{communities}} urged neutrality at the 1914 {{outbreak of}} World War I, which {{contributed to a}} resurgent nativism after U.S. entry into the war in 1917. As a result, German St. Louisans suffered some discrimination during the war, and St. Louisans repressed elements of German culture. Commerce was not dramatically affected by the war. However, leading up to and before World War I, the population started to decrease <b>as</b> <b>men</b> were needed {{to work at the}} artillery plants and factories that were closer to the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Fraternity {{growth was}} {{interrupted}} by the Civil War, <b>as</b> <b>men</b> from many Southern colleges halted their studies to join the Confederate army. Many fraternity chapters ceased to exist during this time, but some students made efforts to preserve their fraternities as the war continued. Harry St. John Dixon, a member of Sigma Chi from the University of Virginia, joined with four other Sigma Chi brothers from other universities to form the Constantine Chapter of the fraternity. Created in 1864, this chapter was meant to preserve the bonds of the fraternity during the war, promote ties between the North and South, and ensure the fraternity's continued existence.|$|E

5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, {{women have been}} relegated to a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just <b>as</b> <b>men</b> redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E
5|$|It was a multi-target success, with an {{audience}} {{not limited to}} viewers in their forties as the focus on 1980s nostalgia might have indicated. This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic. The plots include characters and situations for all ages, and the series' general tone is family-friendly. Although it includes a number of flashbacks, the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint; according to consultant Mariela Mociulsky, the show reflects more modern realities (such <b>as</b> <b>men</b> showing their emotions and women having greater autonomy in their lives) than TV shows of the 1980s did.|$|E
5|$|Militant {{action was}} not a {{hallmark}} of the movements in Wales and Welsh members, who more often identified themselves as suffragists, sought Parliamentary and public support through political and peaceful means. In 1918, across the United Kingdom, women over the age of 30 gained the right to vote, followed by the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 which saw women gain the same rights to vote <b>as</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E

5|$|Outside Europe, {{women were}} able to dress <b>as</b> <b>men</b> and go undetected. Deborah Sampson fought in the American Revolution as a man named Robert Shurtlieff, and pursued {{relationships}} with women. Edward De Lacy Evans was born female in Ireland, but took a male name during the voyage to Australia and lived as a man for 23 years in Victoria, marrying three times. Percy Redwood created a scandal in New Zealand in 1909 when he {{was found to be}} Amy Bock, who had married a woman from Port Molyneaux; newspapers argued whether it was a sign of insanity or an inherent character flaw.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women are twice as likely <b>as</b> <b>men</b> to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians, {{under heavy}} and {{effective}} {{fire from the}} Israelis inside the bunkers, ceased entering the fort. The Sa'iqa company to the east, under concentrated Israeli tank fire and aerial bombardment, was finally overwhelmed by the Israeli reinforcements, which proceeded towards the fort, opening fire on the main force. Consequently, all Egyptian forces east of the fort attempted to retreat through the marshes. The Israelis attempted to hamper the retreat by dropping smoke capsules over the area from four A-4 Skyhawks. The lack of visibility caused injuries <b>as</b> <b>men</b> tripped and were trampled during the retreat through the marshes.|$|E

The women begin spraying each other with bottles of water, before Stevens returns to the sewer.

5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often <b>as</b> <b>men.</b> The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|As the division's assault units {{began their}} {{approach}} march towards {{the line of}} departure late {{on the evening of}} 6 June, the German artillery opened up with a gas bombardment that severely hindered the march, breaking up the assaulting units <b>as</b> <b>men</b> became lost. Suffering over 2,000 casualties before the battle even began, many of the division's assault units reached their assembly points with less than 200 men, nevertheless they arrived on time and at the appointed hour, after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines had destroyed {{a large part of the}} German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome by the division's lead battalions—the 33rd, 34th, 38th and 39th—and by 5am, the division had gained the crest of the Messines ridge and began digging in to defend against a possible counter-attack. In the engagements that followed the division largely played only a supporting role.|$|E
