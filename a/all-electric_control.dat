By using analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we show that the transition temperature of such a device can be controlled by electric gating which alters the ratio of Rashba to Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. The results offer a new pathway to control superconductivity in spintronic devices. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures; added a new Methods section, and added reference...|$|E
40|$|Battery {{degradation}} strongly {{depends on}} temperature, and many plug-in electric vehicle applications employ thermal management strategies to extend battery life. The effectiveness of thermal management {{depends on the}} design of the thermal management system as well as the battery chemistry, cell and pack design, vehicle system characteristics, and operating conditions. We model a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with an air-cooled battery pack composed of cylindrical LiFePO 4 /graphite cells and simulate the effect of thermal management, driving conditions, regional climate, and vehicle system design on battery life. We estimate that in the absence of thermal management, aggressive driving can cut battery life by two thirds; a blended gas/electric-operation control strategy can quadruple battery life relative to an <b>all-electric</b> <b>control</b> strategy; larger battery packs can extend life by an order of magnitude relative to small packs used for all-electric operation; and batteries last 73 – 94 % longer in mild-weather San Francisco than in hot Phoenix. Air cooling can increase battery life by a factor of 1. 5 – 6, depending on regional climate and driving patterns. End of life criteria has a substantial effect on battery life estimates...|$|E

40|$|The {{wind power}} {{research}} at the division of Electricity at Uppsala University is aimed towards increased understanding of vertical axis wind turbines. The considered type of wind turbine is an H-rotor with a directly driven synchronous generator operating at variable speed. The experimental work presented in this thesis comprises investigation of three vertical axis wind turbines of different design and size. The electrical, control and measurement systems for the first 12 kW wind turbine have been designed and implemented. The second was a 10 kW wind turbine adapted to a telecom application. Both the 12 kW and the 10 kW were operated against dump loads. The third turbine was a 200 kW grid-connected wind turbine, where control and measurement systems have been implemented. Experimental results have shown that an <b>all-electric</b> <b>control,</b> substituting mechanical systems such as blade-pitch, is possible {{for this type of}} turbine. By controlling the rectified generator voltage, the rotational speed of the turbine is also controlled. An electrical start-up system has been built and verified. The power coefficient has been measured and the stall behaviour of this type of turbine has been examined. An optimum tip speed ratio control has been implemented and tested, with promising results. Use of the turbine to estimate the wind speed has been demonstrated. This has been used to get a faster regulation of the turbine compared to if an anemometer had been used. ...|$|E
40|$|When {{looking at}} a time line from the {{earliest}} days of offshore oil and gas production developments, present day development projects and field layouts have changed tremendously. Within the offshore oil and gas industry technology industry, there has been a high level of innovation with regards to many aspects. Some of the most radical differences over time have been in the design of surface facility and platforms shown in the diversity of structures. The idea for this thesis was born out of an interest in systems and their functionality. Through research into offshore and subsea production systems, common goals in research and development projects regarding these systems identified certain trends. Examples of these are •	to increase automation of production systems and controls •	to reduce production system components •	to reduce dependency on external supply of power •	to increase production system response capabilities •	to increase reliability of the production system With <b>all-electric</b> <b>control</b> systems, an attempt appears to have been made to satisfy the above goals. Electric actuators could enable an overall reduction in system weight and number of components. The implications of increases in water depth and wellhead offset distances could be reduced with respect to network complexity and control capabilities. Currently, the majority of subsea production systems operate using electro-hydraulic multiplexed power and controls. Increases in hydrostatic pressure and hydraulic transmission distances require increased system complexity due to depth-compensation of hydraulics (accumulators) and control response delays. This thesis is proposed in order to establish {{the current state of the}} art level of all-electric production control systems, address their weaknesses and influencing factors and suggest system improvements...|$|E

The vehicle would be prepared in a horizontal position, and its large exterior access panels permit easy access to subsystems, allowing easy servicing or replacement. The selection and design of these subsystems would emphasize simplicity and reduce maintenance requirements: for example, hydraulic systems would be replaced by <b>all-electric</b> <b>controls.</b> Moreover, unlike the Space Shuttle, the HL-20 {{would not have a}} payload bay or main engine propulsion, and its thermal protection system, while similar to the Space Shuttle's combination of tiles and ablative coatings, would be far quicker to inspect and maintain due to the HL-20's much smaller size. These design changes and subsystem simplifications, along with the adoption of aircraft maintenance philosophies, could reduce the HL-20 preparation man-hours to less than 10 percent of the Space Shuttle Orbiter's requirement.|$|R

40|$|Donor-based spin qubits in silicon are {{promising}} candidates for solid-state quantum computation {{as they have}} exceptionally long coherence time. Single donor and few-donor quantum dots can be patterned by scanning tunneling microscopy based lithography technique in silicon with atomic precision, making them propitious for building a scalable quantum computer. Compared to single donors, few-donor quantum dots have more nuclear spins and extra quantum confinement, leading to additional degrees of freedom to engineer single and multi-qubit operations, while retaining long coherence times. Combined, they can be utilized to obtain outstanding performance or novel approaches for qubit operation. ^ In this work, approaches for design and optimization of donor-based spin qubits in silicon are proposed based on atomistic simulations, focusing on qubit characterization, manipulation and readout. For few-donor qubits, we put forward a metrology technique to obtain their atomic scale information, needed for single qubit manipulation. Also, a new design is introduced for two-qubit gates to gain flexibility in device fabrication and tuning the exchange coupling, in which theoretical guidance to the realization of two-qubit logic is provided. In addition, an <b>all-electric</b> spin <b>control</b> scheme is proposed, giving rise to a promisingly scalable architecture of a donor-based quantum computer. We also explore the electrical and opto-electric hybrid spin readout under realistic electrostatics and device geometry, providing guidance for optimizing device parameters in experiments. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{systems with}} broken {{inversion}} symmetry spin-orbit coupling (SOC) yields a Rashba-type spin splitting of electronic states, manifested in a k-dependent splitting of the bands. While most research had previously focused on 2 D electron systems, recently a three-dimensional (3 D) form of such Rashba-effect {{was found in}} a series of bismuth tellurohalides. Whereas these materials exhibit a very large spin-splitting, they lack an important property concerning functionalization, namely the possibility to switch or tune the spin texture. This limitation can be overcome in a new class of functional materials displaying Rashba-splitting coupled to ferroelectricity: the ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors (FERS). Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) we show that GeTe(111) forms a prime member of this class, displaying a complex spin-texture for the Rashba-split surface and bulk bands arising from the intrinsic inversion symmetry breaking caused by the ferroelectric polarization of the bulk (FE). Apart from pure surface and bulk states we find surface-bulk resonant states (SBR) whose wavefunctions entangle the spinors from the bulk and surface contributions. At the Fermi level their hybridization results in unconventional spin topologies with cochiral helicities and concomitant gap opening. The GeTe(111) surface and SBR states make the semiconductor surface conducting. At the same time our SARPES data confirm that GeTe is a narrow-gap semiconductor, suggesting that GeTe(111) electronic states are endowed with spin properties that are theoretically challenging to anticipate. As the helicity of the spins in Rashba bands is connected to the direction of the FE polarization, this work paves the way to <b>all-electric</b> non-volatile <b>control</b> of spin-transport properties in semiconductors...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} and nuclear spin {{degrees of freedom}} of donor impurities in silicon form ultra-coherent two-level systems that are potentially useful for applications in quantum information and are intrinsically compatible with industrial semiconductor processing. However, because of their smaller gyromagnetic ratios, nuclear spins {{are more difficult to}} manipulate than electron spins and are often considered too slow for quantum information processing. Moreover, although alternating current magnetic fields are the most natural choice to drive spin transitions and implement quantum gates, they are difficult to confine spatially {{to the level of a}} single donor, thus requiring alternative approaches. In recent years, schemes for all-electrical control of donor spin qubits have been proposed but no experimental demonstrations have been reported yet. Here, we demonstrate a scalable <b>all-electric</b> method for <b>controlling</b> neutral 31 P and 75 As donor nuclear spins in silicon. Using coplanar photonic bandgap resonators, we drive Rabi oscillations on nuclear spins exclusively using electric fields by employing the donor-bound electron as a quantum transducer, much in the spirit of recent works with single-molecule magnets. The electric field confinement leads to major advantages such as low power requirements, higher qubit densities and faster gate times. Additionally, this approach makes it possible to drive nuclear spin qubits either at their resonance frequency or at its first subharmonic, thus reducing device bandwidth requirements. Double quantum transitions can be driven as well, providing easy access to the full computational manifold of our system and making it convenient to implement nuclear spin-based qudits using 75 As donors...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{design and}} control is an {{attractive}} area of research in that it embodies a convergence of societal need, technical limitation, and emerging capability. Environmental, political, and monetary concerns are driving the automotive industry towards sustainable transportation, manifested as increasing powertrain electrification in a gradual transition to fossil-free energy vectors. From an electrochemical degradation and control systems perspective, this transition introduces significant technical uncertainty. Initial indications are that the initial battery designs will have twice the required capacity due to degradation concerns. As the battery is {{a major contributor to}} the cost of these vehicles the over-sizing represents a significant threat to the ability of OEMs to produce cost-competitive vehicles. This potential barrier is further amplified when the combustion engine is removed and battery-electric or fuel-cell hybrid vehicles are considered. This thesis researches the application of model-based design for optimal design of fuel cell hybrid powertrains considering power source degradation. The intent is to develop and evaluate tools that can determine the optimal sizing and control of the powertrain; reducing the amount of over-sizing by numerically optimization rather than a sub-optimal heuristic design. A baseline hybrid fuel cell vehicle model is developed and validated to a hybrid fuel cell SUV designed and built at the University of Waterloo. Lithium-ion battery degradation models are developed and validated to data captured off a hybrid powertrain test stand built as part of this research. A fuel cell degradation model is developed and integrated into the vehicle model. Lifetime performance is modeled for four hybrid control strategies, demonstrating a significant impact of the hybrid control strategy on powertrain degradation. A plug-in variation of the architecture is developed. The capacity degradation of the battery is found to be more significant than the power degradation. Blended and <b>All-electric</b> charge-depleting hybrid <b>control</b> strategies are integrated and lifetime performance is simulated. The blended charge-depleting control strategy demonstrated significantly less degradation than the all-electric strategy. An oversized battery is integrated into the vehicle model and the benefit of oversizing on reducing the battery degradation rate is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Flywheel {{systems are}} {{attractive}} in hybrid and electric vehicles {{due to their}} ability to handle power during acceleration and braking. The combination of a flywheel device with a battery source has several advantages such as high peak power capacity, high energy density and {{reduction in the number of}} charge/discharge cycles of the battery. A flywheel based all-electric driveline is investigated in this thesis. The novelty of the system consists in the use of a double wound flywheel machine, which divides the system in two different power levels. Due to this configuration, the system becomes efficient and can handle the power developed during fast dynamical processes. The complete driveline consists of three main components: the battery, the flywheel machine and the wheel motor. The High-Power (HP) side of the driveline connects the flywheel machine to the wheel motor, whereas the Low-Power (LP) side connects the flywheel machine to the battery. The connections of different components of the system are made electrically through power converter devices. The present thesis focuses on the electrical converters and control strategies used in the flywheel based <b>all-electric</b> driveline. The <b>control</b> of power converters is responsible for the logic and functionality of the driveline, being a challenging step within this project. Different power converter topologies have been investigated: a DC/DC plus a DC/AC converter on the LP side, and an AC/DC/AC converter on the HP side. The design and assembly of the power electronics and their control scheme have been successfully implemented. Different control strategies have been suggested and a complete scaled driveline has been assembled and tested based on previous simulation results. Results have confirmed the functionality of the driveline, where smoothed output power has been obtained from the battery, whereas the flywheel handles power transients on the traction side. An average efficiency of about 87 % (battery to wheels) has been obtained. The power converter systems have been shown to be efficient and robust, with control strategies able to handle the peak energy flow in the system. A regenerative braking strategy has been simulated and a wheel-to-wheel efficiency of about 80 % has been estimated...|$|R
40|$|The work {{relates to}} the design of an <b>All-Electric</b> {{attitude}} and <b>control</b> system (AOCS) for a Small-GEO (SGEO) class spacecraft. Such system would rely on a limited number of electric thrusters in order to perform all maneuvers required for the orbital movements of the vehicle among which are the following: • LEO-GEO low thrust transfer using Electric Propulsion, • North-South Station Keeping (NSSK) and East-West Station Keeping (EWSK), • Attitude Control System (ACS), • Intermediate repositioning (if needed), • Transfer to graveyard orbit at the end of mission (if needed). In particular, we have focused on the design of a propulsion system for North-South and East-West station keeping and attitude control. The first part of the work is devoted to determining the thruster requirements and thrust strategies for the various functions of the mission. First, the problem of orbit raising with low thrust has been assessed and different strategies for reaching a geostationary orbit with Electric Propulsion have be investigated. Once the orbit configuration and parameters have been established, especially regarding the transfer phase, we determined orbit perturbation torques values in order to estimate the delta-V budgets and total impulses needed for Station-Keeping maneuvers. Then, we developed an attitude dynamics model for the S/C and studied the vehicle’s motion around its center of mass, to evaluate how the Euler angles will vary during the mission. Different thrust strategies for attitude control have been investigated. In {{the second part of the}} work several propulsion system layouts have been proposed and evaluated. With respect to the attitude control system, three options were explored: a solution in which the ACS is integrated with the orbit control system (the same sets of thrusters perform both function), a separated ACS and a solution implying the use of reaction wheels. Some considerations were made also about the Euler angles’ variations during the orbit transfer phase and the means to control them. Finally, in the last chapter we proceeded to an evaluation of the possible candidate thrusters for the different tasks and to an estimation of the power levels needed. Furthermore, some considerations regarding the state-of-the-art in Electric Propulsion and possible developments were made...|$|R
