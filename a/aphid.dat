5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain <b>aphid,</b> rosy apple <b>aphid,</b> apple <b>aphid,</b> spirea <b>aphid</b> and the woolly apple <b>aphid.</b> The <b>aphid</b> species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{infestation}} by this <b>aphid,</b> leaves of sugar beet become swollen, roll, and cease developing. The roots grow poorly and the sugar content is reduced. In some other plants the leaves do not become distorted but growth is affected and flowers abort due to {{the action of the}} toxic saliva injected by the <b>aphid</b> to improve the flow of sap.|$|E

5|$|The {{black bean}} <b>aphid</b> (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean <b>aphid</b> and beet leaf <b>aphid.</b> In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This <b>aphid</b> also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} <b>aphid</b> {{is a major}} pest of sugar beet, bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} of the plants. Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. The plants are stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and <b>aphid</b> residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E

While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption. Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates. Without predators to keep them in check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.|$|E

5|$|The {{black bean}} <b>aphid</b> is a small, soft-bodied insect that has {{specialised}} {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts which are used to suck the juice from plants. This <b>aphid</b> is usually seen in large numbers and is a tiny, plump insect about two millimetres long with a small head and bulbous abdomen. The body is blackish or dark green in colour. Many adults are devoid of wings, a state known as aptery. Winged forms, known as alates, are longer and more slender than aptates and have shiny black heads and thoraxes. The membranous wings of the alates are held angled over the body. The antennae are less {{than two-thirds of the}} length of the body and both they and the legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips. The tibiae of the hind legs are swollen in egg-laying females. Near the rear of the abdomen are a pair of slender, elongated tubes known as cornicles or siphunculi. Their function is the production of a defensive waxy secretion. They are twice as long as the finger-like tail and both are brownish-black.|$|E

40|$|General EcologyAnt-aphid {{mutualism}} is seen {{among many}} species of plants and throughout the world however only two species of <b>aphids</b> specialize on the common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). For {{the purpose of this}} study we focused on the relationship between green <b>aphids</b> (Aphis asclepiadis), several ant species, and milkweed at The University of Michigan Biological Station. We observed the ants and <b>aphids</b> on 20 different milkweeds for four days and recorded any interspecific competition between ants over novel <b>aphids.</b> Additionally we analyzed plant chemistry before the transfer of <b>aphids</b> on the original and novel plants, also, after the transfer and tending of <b>aphids</b> on the novel plant. In order to find the effect of ant-aphid mutualism on the plant’s C:N and to find an underlying difference for the presence or absence of <b>aphids</b> we ran plant chemistry. This experiment found no significant differences in interspecific competition or plant chemistry. Although we found no significant differences in plant chemistry we did find that plants with <b>aphids</b> and plants with the mutualism had a smaller increase in Nitrogen than the plants with no <b>aphids</b> present.

5|$|The {{black bean}} <b>aphid</b> may have {{originated}} in Europe and Asia {{but it is}} now one of the most widely distributed species of aphids. It is found throughout temperate areas of Western Europe, Asia and North America and in the cooler parts of Africa, the Middle East and South America. In the warmer parts of its range, apterous individuals can survive the winter and they may continue to reproduce asexually all year round.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and <b>aphid</b> species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, {{and this is how}} the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the <b>aphid</b> did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E

5|$|How the Phylloxera <b>aphid</b> was {{introduced}} to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration {{of the possibility of}} the introduction of pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the Phylloxera, to survive the trip.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{enemies are}} already {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found {{to be present in}} tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling <b>aphid</b> predators to overwinter there.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{parasitic}} wasp, {{especially in the}} Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. For example, in Brazil, farmers control sugarcane borers with the parasitic wasp Trichogramma galloi. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid {{of a range of}} species of whitefly. It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control whitefly pests of tomato and cucumber, {{and to a lesser extent}} of aubergine (eggplant), flowers such as marigold, and strawberry. Several species of parasitic wasp are natural predators of aphids and can help to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach-potato <b>aphid.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} ants farm <b>aphids,</b> {{protecting}} {{them on the}} plants they eat, eating the honeydew the <b>aphids</b> release from the terminations of their alimentary canals.

50|$|Wooly <b>aphids</b> (Eriosomatinae) {{and other}} sucking insects are often vectors of {{transmission}} for powdery mildew, and other infectious diseases. Typically wooly <b>aphids</b> in sub temperate climates precede and are {{an indicator of}} various infections, including Powdery mildew. <b>Aphids</b> penetrate plant surfaces where they often reside and provide a host of potential inoculants through physical, digestive or fecal secretions. <b>Aphids</b> are often an indicator of other potential plant problems.|$|R
40|$|Grain <b>aphids</b> (Sitobion avenae L.) were {{harvested}} from wheat plants {{that had been}} grown in soil amended with sewage sludge at rates equivalent to 0, 10 or 100 t (dry solids) ha- 1. Harvested <b>aphids</b> were stored frozen for subsequent feeding to ladybirds. Thirty 7 -spot ladybirds (Coccinella septempunctata L.) were isolated individually in 9 cm Petri dishes placed in a controlled environment cabinet. The ladybirds were allowed to acclimatise for 72 hrs, during which time no food was given. Groups of 10 Ladybirds {{were randomly assigned to}} a diet of <b>aphids</b> {{harvested from}} one of the three sludge treatments. Each ladybird was fed a known weight of defrosted <b>aphids.</b> After 24 hrs, uneaten <b>aphids</b> were removed and weighed to determine the mass of <b>aphids</b> eaten. This was repeated for 6 days, with freshly thawed <b>aphids</b> given to the ladybirds at the start of each 24 hr period. Samples of soil, plants and <b>aphids</b> taken from each pot were digested in HNO 3 and analysed for Cd and Zn content by AAS {{at the end of the}} experiment...|$|R
5|$|The <b>aphid</b> {{that was}} the central source of the damage in France was first noted {{following}} the growing of the European vine Vitis vinifera by French colonists in Florida, in the 16th century. These plantations were a failure, and later experiments with related species of vine also failed, although the reason for these failures {{appears to have been}} a mystery to the French colonists. It is known today that it was a species of North American grape phylloxera that caused these early vineyards to fail; the venom injected by the Phylloxera causes a disease that is quickly fatal to the European varieties of vine. The aphids initially went unnoticed by the colonists, despite their great numbers, and the pressure to successfully start a vineyard in America at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} <b>aphid</b> has both sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts {{at different times}} of year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by winged females in the autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through parthenogenesis. The lifespan of a parthenogenetic female is about 50 days and during this period, each can produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually winged forms. These migrate to their secondary host plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E
5|$|Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of {{mammalian}} chymotrypsin-like serine proteases in vitro, the best-studied example being barley serpin Zx (BSZx), {{which is}} able to inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin {{as well as several}} blood coagulation factors. However, close relatives of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases are absent in plants. The RCL of several serpins from wheat grain and rye contain poly-Q repeat sequences similar to those present in the prolamin storage proteins of the endosperm. It has therefore been suggested that plant serpins may function to inhibit proteases from insects or microbes that would otherwise digest grain storage proteins. In support of this hypothesis, specific plant serpins have been identified in the phloem sap of pumpkin (CmPS-1) and cucumber plants. Although an inverse correlation between up-regulation of CmPS-1 expression and <b>aphid</b> survival was observed, in vitro feeding experiments revealed that recombinant CmPS-1 did not appear to affect insect survival.|$|E
