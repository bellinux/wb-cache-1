40|$|We {{propose that}} intuitions about modern mass-level {{criminal}} justice emerge from evolved mechanisms designed {{to operate in}} ancestral small-scale societies. By hypothesis, individuals confronted with a crime compute two distinct psychological magnitudes: one that reflects the crime's seriousness and another that reflects the criminal's long-term value as an associate. These magnitudes are computed based on different sets of cues and are fed into motivational mechanisms regulating different aspects of sanctioning. The seriousness variable regulates how much to react (e. g., how severely we want to punish); the variable indexing the criminal's association value regulates the more fundamental decision of how to react (i. e., whether we want to punish or repair). Using experimental designs embedded in surveys, we validate this theory across several types of crime and two countries.

40|$|This article {{examines}} what {{changes to the}} law regarding the crime of Trafficking in Persons has meant for judicial practice. Before the 2002 reform, this criminal offence was described simply {{as a sort of}} procuring. The reform moved the crime to a different chapter of the Penal Code: from the chapter on crimes against sexual freedom to the chapter on crimes against personal autonomy and individual freedom. This legislative change means that the crime is not only limited to cases of forced prostitution but also applies to cases <b>of</b> consensual sexual <b>exploitation.</b> Based on a case study, the aim {{of this article is to}} analyze how the legislative change has altered judicial practice. The findings presented here indicate that there is a tendency in the criminal justice system to continue operating under the previous logic <b>of</b> permitting the <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> sex workers during <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> prostitution, thus undermining the legal effort to criminalize all <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>exploitation,</b> whether consensual or not...|$|R
40|$|It is the {{standard}} view in the United States that U. S. antitrust law does not reach <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> by a monopolist, particularly monopoly pricing (“rent extraction”). Even more so for intellectual property, where U. S. courts have emphasized the right of an intellectual property right holder to raise prices and exploit its rights to the fullest, constrained only by market demand. Competition law {{in the rest of}} the world appears to be otherwise, however, with many countries generally condemning excessive high prices by dominant firms, even if often reluctant to invoke such provisions in practice. Despite apparent differences in legal approaches, current enforcement practice worldwide with regard to price-raising <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> intellectual property rights by monopolists shows a uniform willingness to condemn such conduct as anticompetitive. This paper describes this concern for exploitation, focusing on competition law enforcement in the United States, China, Europe, Japan, and Korea in three substantive areas: patents subject to FRAND licensing obligations, disclosure requirements imposed on patent holders with monopoly power to prevent them from exploiting licensees or potential licensees, and post-expiration royalties. This paper argues that this concern for exploitative behavior is consistent with sound competition policy. Preventing the undue <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> intellectual property rights is an important aspect of economizing on the reward we give to incentivize innovation. Antitrust has traditionally favored placing some limits on intellectual property rights and placing greater reliance on the incentives for innovation that competitive markets can provide...|$|R

5000|$|Social {{historian}} Karl Polanyi {{wrote that}} in 19th-century Britain, the new middle class turned against their fellow commoners by seizing political {{power from the}} upper classes via the Reform Act 1832. Early industrialisation had been causing economic distress to large numbers of working class commoners, leaving them unable to earn a living. The upper classes had provided protection such as workhouses where inmates could happily [...] "doss" [...] about and also a system of [...] "outdoor" [...] relief both for the unemployed and those on low income. Though early middle class opposition to the Poor Law reform of William Pitt the Younger had prevented {{the emergence of a}} coherent and generous nationwide provision, the resulting Speenhamland system did generally save working class commoners from starvation. In 1834 outdoor relief was abolished, and workhouses were deliberately made into places so dehumanising that folk would often prefer to starve rather than enter them. For Polanyi this related to the economic doctrine prevalent at the time which held that only the spur of hunger could make workers flexible enough for the proper functioning of the free market. Later the same Laissez-faire free market doctrine led to British officials turning {{a blind eye to the}} suffering in the Irish potato famine and various Indian famines and <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> in colonial adventures. By the late 19th century, at least in mainland Britain, economic progress has been sufficient that even the working class were generally able to earn a good living, so working and middle class interests began to converge, lessening the division within the ranks of common people. Polanyi writes that on continental Europe middle and working class interests did not diverge anywhere near as markedly as they had in Britain.|$|R

40|$|Award date: 24 March 2014 Supervisor: Professor Giovanni Sartor, European University InstituteAt the moment, no {{copyright}} statute {{refers to}} news aggregation. It {{is not surprising}} then that news aggregators present a challenge for any court {{having to deal with}} any aspect of their activity. Indeed, with any particular form of aggregation {{there are a number of}} competing interests at play: the copyright holder, the aggregator, the reader and the public at large. So far, there were only two suits against Google Inc. based on copyright infringement concerns from Google News, one in the US and one in Europe, but they revealed a lot of problems that existing copyright law may have with news aggregators. The first claim (brought in 2005 in the United States) where the claimant Agence France Press claimed that Google Inc. was reproducing and publicly displaying AFP’s photographs, headlines, and story leads on Google’s news aggregation website without AFP’s permission, resulted in a settlement (after 2 years in court). But the case brought against Google in Europe in 2006 by Copiepresse (the collective management organization for Belgian newspaper publishers in French and German languages) found that Google had infringed copyright law. Interestingly, after the court door was broken down, a new practice regarding Google News appeared: in Germany, France and Belgium leading newspaper publishers had called on their governments to adopt a law to force internet search engines like Google to pay for displaying their content on services such as Google News. Consequently, agreements with Belgian and French governments were concluded by Google. In Germany, a new law passed granting news publishers a new neighbouring right pushing Google to pay a licensing fee even for the snippets of content used to display search results (in force as of 1 st of August 2013). The main issue both courts and legislators have to address when dealing with Google News is the question whether short fragments of news works along with their headlines and titles (so-called snippets) are protected by copyright or not. This touches one of the basic concepts of copyright law, i. e. copyright originality, not understood identically within copyright jurisdictions over the world, and challenged additionally, at least in the EU, with recent decision of the ECJ in Infopaq where the court found that a fragment of news article consisting of 11 words may be protected as an independent work. The impact of the Infopaq ruling should not be underestimated: even in the UK, where short forms of creative activity like titles or headlines, have not been traditionally protected under copyright, a recent ruling in NLA v. Meltwater concluded that news headlines may be copyrighted. Assuming that Google News is involved in <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> copyrighted works, the other important question arises that is whether any limitation / exception provided by copyright law is applicable to this service. What can come into play in this regard are (1) the exception of quotation, (2) the exception for report on news events, and (3) the fair use defences...|$|R

40|$|Introduction [...] . ] The {{ability to}} {{successfully}} drive disruptive innovations {{from within the}} organization will be analyzed {{through the lens of}} organizational ambidexterity. Ambidexterity is the ability of organizations to successfully balance exploration and <b>exploitation.</b> The manifestation <b>of</b> this <b>act</b> <b>of</b> balancing <b>exploitation</b> and exploration is the companies' ability to initiate multiple innovation streams, in this case sustaining innovations and disruptive innovations (Danneels, 2004; Tushman, et al., 2010). Key proponents of organizational ambidexterity, O'Reilly and Tushman, consider it a 'solution to the innovator's dilemma' (O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008, pg. 202), however present their thesis only conceptually. This is a general gap in the research of organizational ambidexterity, as noted by scholars of organizational ambidexterity where consensus exists on the need for ambidexterity, but the underlying mechanisms and the 'how' remain undertheorized (Gupta, et al., 2006). This work will look at the mechanisms of ambidexterity at GE Healthcare to help explain its ability in successfully hosting sustaining and disruptive innovations from within its boundaries. The next section will focus on the theoretical background of this research, explaining in greater detail the concept of disruptive innovation and BOP research.

5000|$|Many {{people are}} {{involved}} in the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> child sexual <b>exploitation.</b> It takes quite a few people to run a brothel and procure the children. Four parties are identified as being involved in a transaction in the child sex market: the perpetrator, the vendor, the facilitator, and the child. Perpetrators are those who partake in sex tourism and trafficking. The perpetrators are most often men who try to “rationalize their sexual involvement with children." [...] The vendors are the procurers and pimps of the children. Under their reign profit is maximized and trafficking itself is made possible. The facilitators are those who allow for child sex trafficking to occur. Parents who sell their daughters to vendors fall into this category. The child is the most essential figure in this process. The term child, however, poses problems. Due to varying definitions across the globe it is difficult to differentiate between sexual abuse of a child and child prostitution. Also, every country and culture has its own way of determining when a child is no longer considered a minor.|$|R
