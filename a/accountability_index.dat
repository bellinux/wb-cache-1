40|$|This paper {{examines}} accountability {{outcomes of}} Tennessee school districts, comparing rural versus urban districts and litigant versus nonlitigant districts from a 1993 fiscal equity lawsuit. School districts were assigned {{a measure of}} rurality using the Cleland Rurality Index, and comparisons were made among the 29 low-rurality districts, 66 moderate-rurality districts, and 43 high-rurality districts. The variables examined were drawn from the Tennessee <b>Accountability</b> <b>Index</b> and included per pupil expenditures, property taxes collected, local-option tax revenues, regular teacher salaries {{as a percentage of}} total instructional expenses, average daily membership, and K- 5 district achievement in reading and math and value-added achievement. The most-rural districts consistently performed worst on most variables examined.

40|$|A serious {{challenge}} for many schools and districts {{across the nation}} is that significant numbers of students enter the next grade level with performance levels well below proficiency. Traditional status and improvement <b>indices</b> used in <b>accountability</b> systems established by states {{to meet the requirements}} of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) typically do not reflect achievement growth among those students (Choi, Seltzer, Herman, & Yamashiro, 2007; Goldschmidt, Roschewski, Choi, Auty, Hebbler, Blank, & Williams, 2005) even when some growth has been made. The goal of improving programs and instruction so that all students are challenged to achieve high learning standards is certainly a critical one for education. If <b>accountability</b> <b>indices</b> fail to reflect the progress of students at the lowest performance levels, however, not only will that progress not be recognized but indices will fail to identify effective programs and instructional interventions for those students. Furthermore, educators in schools who are successfully promoting growth among the lowest achieving students may lose their sense of efficacy—a factor that has been empirically shown to be critical to improving student learning in schools with high populations of at-risk students (Northeast and Islands Regional Educationa...|$|R
40|$|Unequal {{quality of}} {{fundamental}} institutions induces different patterns of international capital flows {{in terms of}} both direction and magnitude. This dissertation examines, theoretically and empirically, the link between the financial intermediation sector and capital flows by highlighting the role of institutions and the technological level that financial intermediaries have access to. The theoretical section employs a model with endogenous labour input in monitoring loans by the financial intermediary. Numerical exercises reveal that this modification improves the traditional exogenous model by replicating the stylized facts, in particular, the model is able to replicate and explain the non-monotonic relationship between institutional quality and international net bank flows. Furthermore, contrary to the exogenous model, the model with endogenous labour input is able to reproduce a loan interest rate profile which decreases as institutional quality improves. The empirical section uses a panel of 56 rich and middle-income countries and cross-border bank flows and reveals that, firstly, institutional quality matters slightly more for the mid-income countries in explaining the net bank flows, while for high-income countries it is the market fundamentals which are significant explanatory forces. Secondly, while for both income groups {{the rule of law and}} voice & <b>accountability</b> <b>indices</b> are significant, for mid-income countries government effectiveness is also of significance...|$|R

40|$|Kentucky’s {{system of}} high-stakes {{accountability}} raises the question: Should {{teachers and school}} administrators {{be held accountable for}} student test results if the scores are influenced by external factors over which these educators have no control? The goal of the present study is to investigate if such external factors, or “contextual effects, ” bias the <b>accountability</b> <b>index</b> scores. The issue is important because school districts, schools, and educators should be assessed in a fair manner. The focus of the study is on the Kentucky school district <b>accountability</b> <b>index</b> scores for the 1992 - 94 and 1994 - 96 biennia. District scores, rather than school scores, were chosen as the focus because more suitable measures of contextual effects are available for school districts than for schools. Three contextual effects are considered: (1) median household income in the district, (2) teen birth rate, and (3) rural-metropolitan differences among districts. Two ways of determining the influence of contextual effects on the test scores are dealt with. First, contextual effects might retard or promote a school district’s ability to improve its scores. A confirmation of this tendency would pose a serious problem for the current accountability system. Second, contextual effects might only influence the differences in score...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{reporting}} practice of leading museums in New Zealand (NZ) and the UK to develop a museums' performance <b>accountability</b> disclosure <b>index.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper reports a study of annual reporting by 16 museums in NZ and the UK. Because of the unique nature of the industry the disclosure index uses a framework which draws on the balanced scorecard (BSC). The BSC provides a link between internal reporting of key performance issues and the need of a community organisation to report to the public. Findings – Overall, the quality of reporting in each country is found to be of a similar standard. The strongest parts of reports are those dealing with internal processes and objectives, and the weakest are those reporting on learning and growth.

Second it created a drug registration transparency index {{in the form of a}} survey instrument whose questions were guided by three key dimensions of accessibility, clarity and <b>accountability.</b> This <b>index</b> was used to compare the perceived transparency of certain regulatory agencies in South Korea, China and India by surveying the views and experiences of regulatory professionals who have specialized in these global registration processes.

The survey instrument appeared to provide results consistent with the way that transparency in these countries was rank-ordered by the same respondents. Results suggested that the survey instrument was a useful tool with which to study regulatory transparency. Although further study is needed to validate this approach, the survey provides a first-of-its-kind index of drug-approval transparency based upon the three key aspects of transparency, clarity, accessibility and accountability.

40|$|The report {{examines}} {{the development of}} school report cards (SRCs) in selected countries around the world, with a particular emphasis on developing countries. It is intended to assist policy-makers and programme implementers in making informed decisions about how to use SRCs. The report includes: {{a review of the}} existing literature, interviews with 22 individuals at various levels of government covering different areas of responsibility connected with implementing countries, a descriptive summary of 14 countries, a summary of structures that can help review efforts undertaken to date, a set of newly developed indicators that integrate issues of accountability and anti-corruption effectiveness in the interpretation of SRCs, selected summaries and suggestions for improvement. The document builds on a USAID Working Paper developed in 2006 for the EQUIP  2 Project (Cameron, Moses, and Gillies, 2006) and examines cases in which report cards have proven especially successful in helping to improve transparency and accountability in education systems. It presents interview and survey findings from 14 countries where SRCs have been implemented in recent years, and compares their design and implementation. It gauges the settings for SRCs through an <b>accountability</b> and transparency <b>index</b> based on the authors’ observations, and examines whether and how SRCs can be used as part of the toolkit in the fight against corruption in the education sector. Finally, it proposes an implementation framework to help improve the delivery of education services and reduce corrupt practices. Some key highlights are: School report cards can be powerful tools to engage communities and hold schools accountable for providing students with a high-quality education. If the process is inclusive and participatory, SRCs can serve as a unique channel allowing education stakeholders to make more informed decisions based on school-level data. Reporting in SRCs appears to be more comprehensive than before. More comprehensive models include measuring outputs – a key factor in accountability – and parent perception. Most countries that appear to be less successful in SRC implementation lack a good understanding of SRC standards and what consequences can be expected based on SRC results. Most SRCs are missing clear, effective accountability measures, as well as clear links to those capable of making changes. More systematic efforts to employ SRCs to identify corruption often focus on specific areas, such as corruption in finance, teacher behaviour, and information systems. The exact relationship between implementation of SRCs and a country’s perceived level of education corruption is unclear. A number of countries with higher levels of perceived corruption in education are among those using more sophisticated SRC approaches. Accountability is a key element in the fight against corruption, and is led, in part, by transparency. Three case study areas, namely Indonesia, Brazil, and the state of Virginia in the United States, employ a combination of transparency and measurable consequences, which increase the accountability of schools...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Nearly 40 {{million people}} in Africa suffer from HIV/AIDS. African governments and {{international}} aid agencies have been working to combat this epidemic by vigorously promoting Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) programs. Despite the enormous subsidies offered by governments along with free Anti-RetroViral (ARV) drugs supplied by agencies, the introduction and implementation of HAART programs {{on a large scale}} has been limited by two fundamental problems: (a) lack of adherence to the ARV therapy regimen; (b) lack of accountability in drug distribution due to theft, corruption and counterfeit medication. In this paper, we motivate the case for SmartTrack, a telehealth project which aims to address these two problems facing HAART programs. The goal of SmartTrack is to create a highly reliable, secure and ultra low-cost cellphone-based distributed drug information system {{that can be used for}} tracking the flow and consumption of ARV drugs in HAART programs.

40|$|Purpose: We {{investigate}} {{the extent of}} voluntary disclosures in UK higher education institutions’ (HEIs) annual reports and examine whether internal governance structures influence disclosure in the period following major reform and funding constraints. Design/methodology/approach: We adopt {{a modified version of}} Coy and Dixon’s (2004) public <b>accountability</b> <b>index,</b> referred to in this paper as a public accountability and transparency index (PATI), to measure the extent of voluntary disclosures in 130 UK HEIs’ annual reports. Informed by a multi-theoretical framework drawn from public accountability, legitimacy, resource dependence and stakeholder perspectives, we propose that the characteristics of governing and executive structures in UK universities influence the extent of their voluntary disclosures. Findings: We find a large degree of variability in the level of voluntary disclosures by universities and an overall relatively low level of PATI (44 %), particularly with regards to the disclosure of teaching/research outcomes. We also find that audit committee quality, governing board diversity, governor independence, and the presence of a governance committee are associated with the level of disclosure. Finally, we find that the interaction between executive team characteristics and governance variables enhances the level of voluntary disclosures, thereby providing support for the continued relevance of a ‘shared’ leadership in the HEIs’ sector towards enhancing accountability and transparency in HEIs. Research limitations/implications: In spite of significant funding cuts, regulatory reforms and competitive challenges, the level of voluntary disclosure by UK HEIs remains low. Whilst the role of selected governance mechanisms and ‘shared leadership’ in improving disclosure, is asserted, the varying level and selective basis of the disclosures across the surveyed HEIs suggest that the public accountability motive is weaker relative to the other motives underpinned by stakeholder, legitimacy and resource dependence perspectives. Originality/value: This is the first study which explores the association between HEI governance structures, managerial characteristics and the level of disclosure in UK HEIs. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presented {{research by}} the author {{in the development of}} a computer Decision Support System (DSS) for assisting in providing equal educational opportunity in a public school district. The research process consisted of five major phases: (1) The support of a local school district was obtained, and, with the assistance of the superintendent, a task group of concerned administrators was assembled to assist in defining the needs and goals for the DSS. (2) A list of key variables was developed for inclusion in the support system. Data were gathered and stored for a preliminary version of the DSS. (3) A thorough literature review was undertaken in order to reach an understanding of the concepts involved in Equality of Educational Opportunity (EEO) sufficient to provide a model to be included in the DSS. The literature review led to the development of four conceptual (subjective) EEO models. (4) Analytical techniques were undertaken to determine which model, if any, best represented reality (as defined by the data gathered in Phase 2.) The analytical techniques used were: correlation analysis, subgroup analysis, graphic analysis, and phenomena explanation. The results showed that one model, identified as the EEO Achievement Aspects Subjective Model, best fit the data examined. (5) The model was incorporated into a DSS in such a way that a single value, termed an EEO <b>Accountability</b> <b>Index,</b> was calculated for a given set of data. The potential uses of such an index and of such a DSS were then explained. The expected use of the DSS is in providing analyses based on a statistically-derived model of reality. The process of building the statistically-derived model is expected to add new insights into the concepts of EEO. Accordingly, this research is anticipated to be of particular use to (1) information specialists, (2) school district board members, superintendents, and decisionmakers, and (3) other academicians interested in developing a better understanding of the concepts of EEO and the implications those concepts have for educational decisionmaking...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{healthcare}} environment {{have led to the}} expectation that healthcare professionals be accountable for their practice. Accountability, as a concept, has been defined as responsibility and answerability for one 2 ̆ 7 s actions. Numerous authors have described varying levels of accountability within different care delivery models; however, to date, the specific relationship between multiple care delivery models and accountability has not been studied. ^ Employing Donabedian 2 ̆ 7 s conceptualization of structure, process, and outcome as a theoretical framework, this study used a comparative survey design to describe and compare relationships between perceived nurse accountability and three different nursing care delivery models—team nursing, primary nursing and patient-focused care. Data were collected from surveys administered to staff nurses in twenty-one medical and/or surgical patient care units at five acute care hospital sites in New England. The hospitals selected represented two groups: (a) three hospitals where nurses consistently practiced according to a single care delivery model across all medical and/or surgical units and (b) two hospitals where nurses practiced according to varying care delivery models. Data for each nursing care delivery model were collected from at least two sites. ^ The dependent variable, nurse accountability, was measured, on individual and group levels, using the Specht and Ramler <b>Accountability</b> <b>Index.</b> The independent variable, nursing care delivery model, was measured with a researcher-designed nursing care delivery checklist. Nurse demographic data were also collected. ^ Overall group and individual accountability scores were presented. Mean group accountability scores were significantly lower than mean individual accountability scores. Significant relationships were detected between group accountability scores and years in current position, and between individual accountability scores and hours worked per week. A weak relationship between group accountability scores and nursing care delivery model was detected with registered nurses who practice in a team nursing care delivery model demonstrating lower group accountability scores than registered nurses who practiced in primary and patient-focused care environments. Both group accountability and individual accountability scores for each nursing care delivery model remained relatively unchanged when controlling for each of the significant demographic variables. Implications for nursing administration, education, practice and research were presented. ...|$|E

(b) Is there a relationship between School Culture Triage Survey scores and Commonwealth Accountability Testing scores? (c) Is there a relationship between the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form scores and the Commonwealth Accountability Testing scores? (d) Is there a relationship between attendance and Commonwealth Accountability Testing scores? (e) Is there a relationship between School Culture Triage Survey scores and attendance rates? and (f) Is there a relationship between Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form scores and attendance? The results of the Pearson r showed that there was a positive correlation between the SCTS and MSQ scores, the variables of the School Culture Triage Survey scores and the Commonwealth Accountability Testing scores, as well as, a positive relationship between attendance and CATS. No other positive correlations were found. Notably, in Model 1 of a multiple regression analysis, School Culture Triage Scores were a significant predictor of CATS scores. However, once attendance and teacher job satisfaction scores were added in Model 2 of the regression analysis, the researcher determined that the relationship between School Culture Triage Scores and CATS were spurious at best. The only variable which maintained a significant positive relationship was attendance.
