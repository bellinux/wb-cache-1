5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius {{problem that is}} simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> to other points, circles <b>and</b> <b>lines,</b> and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E
5|$|Points <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> may {{be viewed}} as special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> {{may be viewed}} as limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> the shell, and encloses {{the internal}} organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The rest of the space is lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E
40|$|Research on size {{structure}} of skipjack captured by pole <b>and</b> <b>line</b> fishermen inside <b>and</b> outside of fish aggregation device {{area has been}} done from January until June 2016 in Gulf of Bone waters.

5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets <b>and</b> <b>lines,</b> it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E

5|$|Several {{clusters}} of thunderstorms {{developed during the}} morning from eastern Nebraska across Iowa into Illinois, taking place along a warm front. The front remained over the same areas during the day, as daytime heating and southwesterly surface winds brought warm and unstable air northward, resulting in severe weather development. The presence of strong winds aloft aided in development of multiple clusters <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> of thunderstorms that produced damaging wind, hail and tornadoes across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.|$|E

5|$|Tennyson is not {{the only}} one that uses the image; John Everett Millais's {{painting}} Mariana is based on Tennyson's version of Mariana, <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> 9 through 12 of Tennyson's poem were used for the catalogue description of the painting. Similarly, Millais's version served as the inspiration for Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, Mariana. Tennyson's Mariana and Gaskell's main character, Ruth, are sensitive to the sounds around them and are constantly looking out of their window in image that represents their imprisonment within their homes. The image of Mariana used by Tennyson and the later works are equally of a woman who is weary.|$|E
5|$|The album title {{derives from}} the Dutch art {{movement}} of the same name; common elements of the De Stijl aesthetic are demonstrated on the album cover, which sets the band members against an abstract background of rectangles <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> in red, black and white. The White Stripes have cited the minimalist and deconstructionist aspects of De Stijl design {{as a source of}} inspiration for their own musical image and presentation. The album was dedicated to furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld of the De Stijl movement, {{as well as to the}} influential Georgia bluesman Blind Willie McTell.|$|E
5|$|The player guides Agent 47, {{protagonist of}} the Hitman franchise, {{through a series}} of grid-based levels.

5|$|The {{shell of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate, slender, acute, and of {{moderate}} thickness. The shell suture is deep. The spire is gently convex, laterally compressed, with 3¼ whorls. The spire is long, {{slightly less than}} half the shell length, and the aperture is very oblique. The shell color is subtranslucent, calcareous pale yellow to white. The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth wrinkles <b>and</b> <b>lines.</b> The size varies somewhat, but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20.9millimeters (mm) in shell length. Various adult specimens measured during the summer of 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24mm.|$|E
5|$|The {{system is}} {{split into two}} parts, with lines north of Boston having a {{terminus}} at North Station <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> south of Boston having a terminus at South Station. There is no direct {{connection between the two}} stations, but travel is made possible by transferring to the MBTA's subway system (although this requires an intermediate transfer at either Park Street or Downtown Crossing) or the 4 bus. This lack of direct connection could be alleviated by the proposed (but currently shelved) North–South Rail Link, which would build a tunnel connecting the two terminals.|$|E

5|$|Active {{resistance}} in Belgium {{took the form}} of sabotaging railways <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> of communication as well as hiding Jews and Allied airmen. The resistance produced large numbers of illegal newspapers in both French and Dutch, distributed to the public to provide news about the war not available in officially approved, censored newspapers. Some such publications achieved considerable success, such as La Libre Belgique, which reached a circulation of 70,000. Attacks on German soldiers were comparatively rare as the German administration made a practice of executing at least five Belgian hostages for each German soldier killed. At great personal risk, Belgian civilians also hid large numbers of Jews and political dissenters hunted by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2015, Square Enix Montreal {{announced}} Lara Croft Go, {{a successor}} to Hitman Go set within the Tomb Raider universe. It was released on 27 August 2015. In the game, players use touchscreen controls to move Lara Croft around a level composed of nodes <b>and</b> <b>lines.</b> While the core mechanics and design are similar to Hitman Go, the developers did not want Lara Croft Go {{to feel like a}} re-skin, so an emphasis has been placed on the puzzle-driven exploration and gameplay elements of the Tomb Raider brand. The following year, Square Enix Montreal announced a similar title Deus Ex Go, based on the Deus Ex series.|$|E
5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E

5|$|Groups <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> {{of flowers}} {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|In 1963 Richard Beeching {{published}} his report The Reshaping of British Railways, which recommended closing the network's least used stations <b>and</b> <b>lines.</b> This included the remaining former S lines {{except for the}} line between Darlington and Saltburn via Stockton and Middlesbrough. Passenger service between Nunthrope and Guisborough was withdrawn in 1964; the service between Middlesbrough and Nunthrope was retained. The line between Darlington and Barnard Castle and the branch to Middleton-in-Teesdale were closed to passengers on 30 November 1964. Trains were withdrawn north of Bishop Auckland on 8 March 1965, but the passenger service to Bishop Auckland was saved because of regional development concerns.|$|E
5|$|Musker and Clements {{created the}} Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though Katzenberg {{suggested}} actors such as John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy, Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role. Williams came for voice recording sessions during {{breaks in the}} shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time, Hook and Toys. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> that his crew would create character animation to match.|$|E
