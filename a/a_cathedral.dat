5|$|During the Great Irish Famine (1845–1852) the Catholic {{population}} of Liverpool increased dramatically. About {{half a million}} Irish, who were predominantly Catholic, fled to England to escape the famine; many embarked from Liverpool to travel to North America while others remained in the city. Because {{of the increase in}} the Catholic population, the co-adjutor Bishop of Liverpool, Alexander Goss (18141872), saw the need for <b>a</b> <b>cathedral.</b> The location he chose was the grounds of St. Edward's College on St.Domingo Road, Everton.|$|E

5|$|In another project, {{the village}} of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam, {{was the scene of}} a female {{apparition}} in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (also known as Kuanyin; Vietnamese: Quan Âm) performed the miracle. Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime. Thục declared that the apparition was the Virgin Mary, and ordered that <b>a</b> <b>cathedral</b> be built in place of the makeshift Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site.

5|$|Issued {{four months}} into the king's accession, the charter {{expressly}} implemented an arrangement designed by Henry VIII and was confirmed by Edward Seymour, Lord Protector. Unusually for <b>a</b> <b>cathedral</b> city Norwich did not receive <b>a</b> <b>cathedral</b> school following the Reformation, but an endowed city grammar school. Norwich Cathedral {{was the first of}} the eight cathedral priories to surrender to the Crown, formally being re-established as a secular cathedral with a dean and chapter on 2 May 1538. Consequently, negotiations over the refoundation charter were between the city, rather than the cathedral, and the Crown. Known as the Great Hospital Charter, it granted the city possession of St Giles' hospital, also called the Great Hospital, and merged the school with it in the hope of achieving an integrated system of education and poor relief. These plans were never realised, however, as the Great Hospital was partially stripped for building materials and later sacked during Kett's Rebellion in 1549. The school temporarily occupied St Luke's House, a building north-west of the cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Pope Innocent IV {{supported}} Mindaugas, {{hoping that}} a new Christian state could stem the inroads being made by the Golden Horde, {{a state of the}} Mongol Empire. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One of them ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and to build <b>a</b> <b>cathedral.</b> The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the pope. This was a welcome development to the Lithuanians, since they were concerned that their long-standing antagonists, the Livonian Order, would exert too much control over the new state.|$|E
