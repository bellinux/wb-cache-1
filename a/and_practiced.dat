This descriptive study was limited by examining the decisions and applications related to connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in pre-service teacher education since 1998. Results are organized by concerning the factors like durations and semesters of field experiences, efficiencies of the stakeholders of teacher education programs. In conclusion connecting theoy <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in pre-service teacher education is considered important in Turkey. However the policies on this issue in Turkey can be criticized; and the stakeholders of teacher education programs are not efficiacy on connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> <b>And</b> the study presents recommendations for enhancing connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in pre-service teacher education as follows: University-School Cooperation Protocol should include methods courses, directors of universities <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> schools should promote other stakeholders for connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice,</b> faculties should indigenize connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in teacher education and, cooperating teachers should be good models for teacher candidates in terms of connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|R
