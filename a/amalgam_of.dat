40|$|Many of {{standard}} practical techniques of solving constraint satisfaction problems use various decomposition methods {{to represent a}} problem as a combination of smaller ones. We study a general method of decomposing constraint satisfaction problems in which every constraint is represented as a disjunction {{of two or more}} simpler constraints defined, possibly, on smaller sets of values. We call a problem an amalgam if it can be decomposed in this way. Some particular cases of this construction have been considered in [Cohen et a/., 1997; 2000 b; 2000 al including <b>amalgams</b> <b>of</b> problems with disjoint sets <b>of</b> values, and <b>amalgams</b> <b>of</b> independent problems. In this paper, we concentrate on constraint classes determined by relational clones, and study <b>amalgams</b> <b>of</b> such classes in the general case of arbitrary finite sets of values. We completely characterise <b>amalgams</b> <b>of</b> this form solvable in polynomial time and provide efficient algorithms. ...|$|R

Schützenberger automata, in the case <b>of</b> <b>amalgams</b> <b>of</b> finite inverse semigroups, are automata with special structure possessing finite subgraphs that contain all the essential information about the automaton. Using this crucial fact, and Bass–Serre theory, we show that the maximal subgroups of an amalgamated free product are either isomorphic to certain subgroups of the original semigroups or can be described as fundamental groups of particular finite graphs of groups built from the maximal subgroups of the original semigroups...|$|R
40|$|A {{permutation}} {{group is}} called semiprimitive if {{each of its}} normal subgroups is either transitive or semiregular.

5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as an improbable <b>amalgam</b> <b>of</b> genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} historian R.C. Dhere, {{winner of}} the Sahitya Akademi Award for his book Sri Vitthal: Ek Mahasamanvaya, opines that Vithoba worship may be even older—"Vedic or pre-Vedic", hence pre-dating the worship of Krishna. According to this theory, Vithoba is an <b>amalgam</b> <b>of</b> various local heroes, who gave their lives to save their cattle. He was first worshipped by the Dhangar, the cattle-owning caste of Maharashtra. The rise of the Yadava dynasty, which had cowherd ancestry, could {{have led to the}} glorification of Vithoba as Krishna, who is often depicted as a cowherd. This Vaishnavization of Vithoba also led to conversion of the Shaiva Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik, who—according to legend—brought Vithoba to Pandharpur. There may have been an attempt to assimilate Vithoba into Buddhism; today, both are viewed as a form of Vishnu in Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|Under Antemoro Zafikasimambo leadership, the commoners' {{freedom was}} {{significantly}} reduced and religion became a central feature {{of social and}} political life. The conflict between the Antemoro and Zafiraminia nobles and the resulting Zafikasimambo rule also established a tradition of emigration from this part of the island. Unlike the majority of Malagasy who generally seek to return to their ancestral land, the Antemoro initially felt no such call to remain linked to a geographic area. As a result, the ombiasy of the Antemoro traveled widely, some moving from place to place and others settling permanently at royal courts and elsewhere. Their arcane knowledge of writing, medicine, technology and other areas both established their reputation as indispensable advisers to nobles and commoners alike, and instilled the island-wide feature of the community astrologer who shapes daily life. The ombiasy of Matitana were According to historian Bethwell Ogot, the network of stationary and itinerant Antemoro ombiasy were key in transforming the societies of Madagascar from an <b>amalgam</b> <b>of</b> insular clans to outward looking communities with greater awareness of others, leading to territorial expansion and larger, more complex kingdoms. In addition, oral histories suggest that sovereigns among the Merina, Tanala and Antanosy may have had ancestors who migrated away from Antemoro country.|$|E

5|$|Spanish, Dutch, and English traders brought {{guinea pigs}} to Europe, where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among {{the upper classes}} and royalty, {{including}} Queen Elizabeth I. The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in {{a description of the}} animal from Santo Domingo; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola, the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers. However, based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands, the animal must have been introduced by ceramic-making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC, and it was present in the Ostionoid period, for example, on Puerto Rico, long before the advent of the Spaniards. The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner. Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777; it is an <b>amalgam</b> <b>of</b> Pallas' generic designation (1766) and Linnaeus' specific conferral (1758). The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting (artist unknown) {{in the collection of the}} National Portrait Gallery in London, dated to 1580, which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise-shell guinea pig in her hands; she is flanked by her two brothers, one of whom holds a pet bird.
