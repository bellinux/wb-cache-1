50|$|Alaska Airlines' {{extension}} of its lubrication interval for its McDonnell Douglas MD-80 horizontal stabilizer components, and the FAA's approval of that extension, {{the last of}} {{which was based on}} McDonnell Douglas's {{extension of}} the recommended lubrication interval increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in the near complete deterioration of the jackscrew <b>assembly</b> acme <b>nut</b> threads and, therefore, was a direct cause of the excessive wear and contributed to the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 accident.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board determined that inadequate maintenance led to excessive wear and eventual failure of a critical flight control system during flight. The probable cause was stated to be [...] "a loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew <b>assembly's</b> acme <b>nut</b> threads. The thread failure was caused by excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly".|$|R
5000|$|Basic Erector parts {{included}} various metal beams with regularly-spaced {{holes for}} <b>assembly</b> using <b>nuts</b> and bolts. A frequently-promoted feature was {{the ability to}} fabricate a strong but hollow lightweight structural girder from four long flat pieces of stamped sheet steel, held together by bolts and nuts. Flat or curved pieces of sheet metal in various shapes and colors could {{be added to the}} structural skeleton. Hardened steel rods and screw clamps allowed the construction of hinges and the transmission of mechanical power via rotating parts such as pulleys, gears, wheels, and levers.|$|R
50|$|A split <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is often}} used in {{positioning}} systems, for example in the leadscrew of a lathe. It {{is one of the}} machine elements that makes single-point threading practical on manual (non-CNC) lathes. The very earliest screw-cutting lathes (in the late 18th and early 19th centuries) did not have them, but within a few decades, split nuts were common on lathes.|$|R
50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one lead of thread after completing an orbit around the screw. The <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> typically includes a slotted cage and cam rings. The cage captivates the rollers in elongated slots, equally spacing the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the rollers. The cam rings have opposing cams aligned with an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw). Returned to its starting position, and reengaged to nut and screw, the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986 Oliver Saari {{was awarded}} a patent for a bearing ring roller screw, {{commonly}} referred to by its trademark, Spiracon. [...] This type matches the orbit of the rollers to {{the rotation of the}} <b>nut</b> <b>assembly.</b> The actuator contains more load transfer elements than the other types, a bearing ring and thrust bearings, but manufacture of component parts is relatively simple (e.g. gearing teeth may be eliminated).|$|R

50|$|The screw has a multi-start thread. The rollers and {{encapsulating}} {{rotating ring}} are identically grooved, not threaded, {{so there is}} no axial movement between the two. The <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> includes a cylindrical housing capped by non-rotating spacer rings. The spacer rings have equidistant holes that act as rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. Roller-type thrust bearings between the spacer rings and bearing ring permit free rotation of the bearing ring while transferring the axial load between the two.|$|R
5000|$|Flare {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} {{compression fitting}} used with metal tubing, usually soft steel, ductile (soft) copper and aluminum, though other materials are also used. Tube flaring {{is considered to be}} a type of forging operation, and is usually a cold working procedure. During <b>assembly,</b> a flare <b>nut</b> is used to secure the flared tubing's tapered end to the also tapered fitting, producing a pressure-resistant, leak-tight seal. Flared connections offer a high degree of long-term reliability and for this reason are often used in mission-critical and inaccessible locations.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a single 7 / 8 ” nominal diameter stud bolt and <b>nuts</b> <b>assembly</b> would fail to perform its required function in a flange <b>assembly</b> when the <b>nut</b> was corroded. This work was undertaken to form a basis for further work in development of a Fitness-For-Service (FFS) assessment for corroded nuts. No current quantitative assessments exist for this area. A failure criterion was defined as a minimum 206. 8 MPa stress in the stud, based on the bolting requirements stated in ASME B 16. 5 - 2003 Pipe Flanges and Flanges Fittings. A simple test rig was manufactured for testing the compliance of the corroded nuts subjected to the 206. 8 MPa stress level and the corrosion was simulated by removing uniform layers of material from the surface of the nut. Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS 12. 0) was also performed to evaluate the test rig and to consider the interaction between the nut and stud at the thread roots. It was found that no failure occurred in the threading and that failure of the assembly only occurred when there was a > 60 % material loss from the nut. The failure mode experienced was deformation of the flange plate. This analysis proved that a nut can experience significant effective material loss without damaging the flange integrity...|$|R

A tri-layered motion controller is designed for the two cooperative robots. The RMRC control method is adopted to adjust the master robot to the desired position.

5000|$|A bolt is an {{externally}} threaded fastener designed for insertion through holes in assembled parts, and is normally intended to be tightened or released by torquing a nut.

The ball screw is configured, upon receipt of the drive force, to selectively translate between a stow position and a deploy position.

50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> includes spacer rings and ring gears that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the ring gears, have equidistant holes {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). The {{majority}} of the structural failures of mechanical structures and systems are found in joints rather than continuous material. Joints have historically consisted of <b>assemblies</b> involving <b>nuts,</b> bolts, screws, etc. and the design and analysis of these joints can be quite challenging. This work provides two baselines on the finite element modeling (PEM) methods and analysis of a nut and bolt joint. The first baseline involves a basic modeling method using linear calculation of 2 D plates and bar elements, and the second baseline involves {{one of the more}} complex methods using non-linear calculation of 3 D solids. The two methods are described for modeling of a joint for two test conditions, namely the double shear joint in tension with two different bolt sizes and two plate thicknesses. First, the simplified method of rigid elements and equivalent strength beam elements is considered. This technique lacks the simulation of bearing stresses, stress concentration at the bolt hole location, and bending stiffness of the bolt. The second method, uses 3 D models that provides the actual nut and bolt surfaces, bearing stresses are introduced in the joint modeling. Classical hand calculations are carried out on the static tests and compared with the FEM results. Additionally, the effects of element mesh refinement on the nut and bolt contact surfaces, and types of contacts are analyzed for the 3 D models. A parametric study is carried out on the stresses developed and stress concentration factors...|$|R
40|$|Multidisciplinary design {{optimization}} {{has been widely}} applied in the optimization of large-scale complex system {{and also in the}} design and optimization of components, which are involved in multidisciplinary behaviors. The wear and fatigue life of lead screw actuators is a typical multidisciplinary problem. The wear behaviors of actuators closely relate to many factors such as loads, lubrications, materials properties, surface properties, pressures, and temperature. Therefore, the wear and fatigue life of actuators cannot be modeled without a simultaneous consideration of solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, contact mechanics, and thermal dynamics. In this paper, the wear and fatigue life of a lead screw actuator is modeled and validated. Firstly, the theory of asperity contact and Archard’s model of sliding wear are applied to estimate the amount of wear under certain circumstances. Secondly, a test platform is developed based on a standard ASTM test protocol, and the wear phenomenon at the ball-on-flat sliding is measured to validate the developed wear model. Thirdly, finite element analysis is conducted using Nastran to assess the contact stresses in the lead screw and <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> model. The estimated data from the three sources are finally merged to formulate a mathematical model in predicting the wear and fatigue life for the optimization of lead screw actuators...|$|R

The friction, wear and resulting fatigue life behaviors in this type of actuators closely relates to many factors such as load, velocity, lubrication, material properties, surface properties, pressure, and temperature. Therefore, the wear and fatigue life of lead screw actuators cannot be modeled without a simultaneous consideration of solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, contact mechanics, and thermal dynamics. ^ A great deal of research has been conducted in the past fifty years in the estimation of sliding wear involving metal and polymer interfaces. In this thesis, the wear and fatigue life of a lead screw actuator are modeled and validated. ^ First, the asperity contact theory and Archard 2 ̆ 7 s model of sliding wear are applied to estimate the amount of wear under given conditions. Then, a test platform is developed based on a standard ASTM test protocol and the wear in ball-on-flat sliding is measured to validate the developed wear model. Simultaneously, fatigue life testing of the lead screw actuators is performed in order to verify the experimental life against the theoretical life. Next, finite element analysis is carried out using Nei-Nastran Software in order to assess the contact stresses in the lead screw and <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> model.

40|$|ESDA (Electrostatic Discharge Association) ESD STM 13. 1 - 2000 {{requires}} frequent {{testing of}} the voltage leakage {{from the tip of}} a soldering iron and the resistance from the tip of the soldering iron to the common point ground. Without this test apparatus, the process is time-consuming and requires several wires, alligator clips, or test probes, as well as additional equipment. Soldering iron tips must be tested for electrostatic discharge risks frequently, and this typically {{takes a lot of time}} in setup and testing. This device enables the operator to execute the full test in one minute or less. This innovation is a simple apparatus that plugs into a digital multimeter (DMM) and the Common Point Ground (CPG) reference. It enables the user to perform two of the electrostatic discharge tests required in ESD STM 13. 1 - 2000. The device consists of a small black box with two prongs sticking out of one end, two inputs on the opposite end (one of the inputs is used to connect the reference CPG to the DMM), and a metal tab on one side. Inside the box are wires, several washers of various materials, and <b>assembly</b> hardware (<b>nuts</b> and screws/bolts). The device is a passive electronic component that is plugged into a DMM. The operator sets the DMM to read voltage. The operator places the heated tip of the soldering iron onto the metal tab with a small amount of solder to ensure a complete connection. The voltage is read and recorded. The operator switches the DMM to read resistance. The operator places the heated tip of the soldering iron onto the metal tab with a small amount of solder to ensure a complete connection. The resistance is recorded. If the recorded voltage and resistance are below a number stated in ESDA ESD STM 13. 1 - 2000, the test is considered to pass. The device includes all the necessary wiring internal to its body so the operator does not need to do any independent wiring, except for grounding. It uses a stack of high-thermal-resistance washers to minimize the heat transfer from the soldering iron to the wiring used to measure the resistance and voltages. This minimizes thermal error. The device allows very rapid execution of a test that is performed frequently...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted steel connections subjected to tension. Quasi-static conditions have been considered. By performing laboratory tests on single bolts and simple T-stub connections the failure modes of the bolts have been examined. Finite element models are created and validated to represent the behaviour observed in the laboratory. Different grip length configurations have been tested for a single bolt and <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> subjected to pure tension. Both partially and fully threaded bolts have been considered. It was found that partially threaded bolts with three threads between the unthreaded part of the shank and the bearing surface of the nut experienced thread stripping. This is inconsistent with the recommendations given in NS-EN 1090 - 2, which states that one full thread is sufficient to avoid thread stripping. Finite element models are able to recreate the behaviour of all configurations tested with acceptable accuracy. In addition to the grip length, the material properties and geometry of the threads are identified as the crucial factors for the failure modes of the bolts. Simple T-stub connections with one bolt in each flange have been tested to examine the behaviour of the bolts when they are subjected {{to a combination of}} tension and bending. The center distance between the bolts was varied to examine the behaviour when subjected to increased bending effects. Connections with partially threaded bolts all failed due to thread stripping. The fully threaded bolts experienced both thread stripping and bolt failure. The complexity of the stress distribution when large bending effects are present was difficult to recreate with a simplified finite element model. Acceptable accuracy up to maximum force was possible to achieve for the smallest bolt center distance. The response of the finite element model was very mesh sensitive, and difficult to recreate with limited computational capacity when applying an explicit solution algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} {{of the connection between}} the guardrail and post in a steel road safety barrier subject to tensile, shear and combined loading conditions. This is accomplished by performing laboratory tests on a special-built test rig. Finite element models of the connection are created and validated in order to form a basis for large scale numerical simulations of road safety barriers. The laboratory tests all failed by thread stripping of the bolt in the connection. The ultimate failure load decreased by 15. 9 and 17. 3 percent when loading in 15 and 30 from pure tension respectively. A two-step finite element model was created to simulate the behaviour of the threaded bolt and <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> in question. The relative displacement between the bolt and the nut in an initial model of the guard rail and post with an unthreaded connection was enforced on a separate model of the bolt and nut with threads. A full model including the threaded connection was created and compared to the two-step model. The results indicate that the behaviour prior to failure is controlled by deformations in the guardrail, post and washers. Failure is controlled by the threaded bolt, and the ultimate load is highly dependent on the bolt material. It is possible to model the bolted connection, subject to combined tension and shear loading conditions, with an acceptable degree of accuracy. A consistent failure mode can be achieved with both the two-step model and the full model. The ultimate loads experienced in the two-step model were in close proximity to the experimental results in some load combinations. The full model was close to the laboratory results in most load combinations, where the deviation from the average failure load in pure tension was 1. 1 - 2. 7 percent. </p...|$|R
