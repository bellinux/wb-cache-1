60|$|For {{the most}} part, the House of the Afternoon {{was but a}} wing built against a mansion wrought by the hand of Nature herself; a grotto running {{into the side of}} the mountain. From high over the mouth of this grotto, sloped a long <b>arbor,</b> <b>supported</b> by great blocks of stone, rudely chiseled into the {{likeness}} of idols, each bearing a carved lizard on its chest: a sergeant's guard of the gods condescendingly doing duty as posts.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, she hired William Lawrence Bottomley {{to create a}} unique {{addition}} known as the Finger Bowl, an outdoor dining area consisting of a raised pool surrounded by a flat ledge. Chairs were {{pulled up to the}} ledge and food was served from bowls floating on the water. It was sheltered by a wisteria-covered <b>arbor</b> <b>supported</b> by 12 stone piers. In the late 1930s, Gifford Pinchot started the White Pine Plantation to reforest some old farmland near the mansion. He was particularly interested in that species since it was the dominant tree in the forests of Pike County and had been heavily harvested during the previous century.|$|R

40|$|Decades of {{research}} {{have demonstrated that}} rapid alterations in protein abundance are required for synaptic plasticity, a cellular correlate for learning and memory. Control of protein abundance, known as proteostasis, is achieved across a complex neuronal morphology that includes a tortuous axon {{as well as an}} extensive dendritic <b>arbor</b> <b>supporting</b> thousands of individual synaptic compartments. To regulate the spatiotemporal synthesis of proteins, neurons must efficiently coordinate the transport and metabolism of mRNAs. Among multiple levels of regulation, transacting RNA binding proteins (RBPs) control proteostasis by binding to mRNAs and mediating their transport and translation in response to synaptic activity. In addition to synthesis, protein degradation must be carefully balanced for optimal proteostasis, as deviations resulting in excess or insufficient abundance of key synaptic factors produce pathologies. As such, mutations in components of the proteasomal or translational machinery, including RBPs, have been linked to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In this review, we summarize recent scientific findings, highlight ongoing questions, and link basic molecular mechanisms to the pathogenesis of common neuropsychiatric disorders...|$|R

50|$|The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a {{longitudinal}} survey of {{a representative sample}} of Americans over age 50 conducted by the Survey Research Center (SCR) at the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan in Ann <b>Arbor</b> and <b>supported</b> by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). The study interviews approximately 20,000 respondents every two years on subjects like health care, housing, assets, pensions, employment and disability. The study is managed through a cooperative agreement (NIA U01AG009740) between the NIA, which provides primary funding, and the ISR, which administers and conducts the survey. Beginning in 2012, HRS began adding genetic information from consenting participants to its database.|$|R

40|$|An auto-adjusting {{pin tool}} for {{friction}} stir welding is presented wherein the pin tool automatically adjusts for welding materials of varying thicknesses, and the pin can be incrementally withdrawn from the workpieces thus eliminating any crater or keyhole in the weld. The inventive apparatus is comprised of a welding head housing a motor connected to a controller instrument package and an <b>arbor</b> <b>supported</b> by bearings. The arbor forms an interior cylinder and is encircled by a stationary slip ring though which are ported hydraulic passageways into the interior cylinder of the arbor such that a piston housed therein may be moved axially. Coupled to the piston is a pin tool which is treaded on its lower end and which is moveably seated in, and extending through, a shoulder housing having concave lower face. When welding, the rotating treaded end of the pin enters and stirs the workpieces while the lower face of the shoulder housing compacts the workpieces. As the welding head traverses the shoulder housing the controller senses any rising pressure on the lower face of the shoulder housing and withdraws the arbor to keep the pressure constant. At the same time, the piston moves towards the workpieces thus extending the pin further from the shoulder. This keeps the pin at a proper depth in the workpieces regardless of their thicknesses. As the weld terminates this same operation {{can be used to}} incrementally withdraw the pin during the final part of the traverse, thus eliminating any keyhole or crater that would otherwise be created...|$|R

50|$|Dynamic morphometrics {{and other}} imaging {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to observe both dendrite growth and synaptogenesis—two processes between which the relationship is not well understood. Non-spiny dendritic arbors expressing a fluorescent postsynaptic marker protein were imaged as they arborized (in the zebrafish larvae), and this confirmed the role of newly extended dendritic filopodia in synaptogenesis, their maturation into dendritic branches, and the result, namely, growth and branching of the dendritic <b>arbor.</b> These findings <b>support</b> the model wherein synapse formation can direct dendrite arborization, a basic tenet of the synaptotropic hypothesis.|$|R
5000|$|A home {{recording}} of [...] "Sisters, O Sisters" [...] {{was made by}} the couple as early as Fall 1971. [...] The couple performed the song, along with three other songs that would appear on Some Time in New York City - [...] "Attica State," [...] "The Luck of the Irish" [...] and [...] "John Sinclair" [...] - at a rally in Ann <b>Arbor,</b> Michigan <b>supporting</b> freeing John Sinclair from prison on December 10, 1971. [...] At the time, they claimed that it had been [...] "written the day before yesterday." [...] It also received several television performances in early 1972. The couple performed it on The David Frost Show, along with the other songs performed at the John Sinclair rally, in a broadcast recorded on December 16, 1971 and broadcast on January 13, 1972. [...] It was then performed on the Mike Douglas Show in a performance that was recorded on January 20, 1972 and broadcast on February 16, 1972. [...] This was the same episode in which Lennon and Ono later joined Chuck Berry in performances of [...] "Memphis, Tennessee" [...] and [...] "Johnny B. Goode."

60|$|But more near, on {{the mild}} lake's hither shore, where it formed a long {{semi-circular}} and scooped acclivity of corn-fields, there {{the small and}} low red farm-house lay; its ancient roof a bed of brightest mosses; its north front (from the north the moss-wind blows), also moss-incrusted, like {{the north side of}} any vast-trunked maple in the groves. At one gabled end, a tangled <b>arbor</b> claimed <b>support,</b> and paid for it by generous gratuities of broad-flung verdure, one viny shaft of which pointed itself upright against the chimney-bricks, as if a waving lightning-rod. Against the other gable, you saw the lowly dairy-shed; its sides close netted with traced Madeira vines; and had you been close enough, peeping through that imprisoning tracery, and through the light slats barring the little embrasure of a window, you might have seen the gentle and contented captives--the pans of milk, and the snow-white Dutch cheeses in a row, and the molds of golden butter, and the jars of lily cream. In front, three straight gigantic lindens stood guardians of this verdant spot. A long way up, almost to the ridge-pole of the house, they showed little foliage; but then, suddenly, as three huge green balloons, they poised their three vast, inverted, rounded cones of verdure in the air.|$|R
40|$|Pyramidal neurons {{in layer}} 2 / 3 of the neocortex {{are central to}} {{cortical}} circuitry, but the intrinsic properties of their dendrites are poorly understood. Here we study layer 2 / 3 apical dendrites in parallel experiments in acute brain slices and in anesthetized rats using whole-cell recordings and Ca 2 + imaging. We find that backpropagation of action potentials into the dendritic <b>arbor</b> is actively <b>supported</b> by Na+ channels both in vitro and in vivo. Single action potentials evoke substantial Ca 2 + influx in the apical trunk but little or none in the dendritic tuft. Supralinear Ca 2 + influx is produced in the tuft, however, when an action potential is paired with synaptic input. This dendritic supralinearity enables layer 2 / 3 neurons to integrate ascending sensory input from layer 4 and associative input to layer 1...|$|R
