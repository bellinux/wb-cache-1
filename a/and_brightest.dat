5|$|Located near Alpha is R Muscae, a Classical Cepheid {{variable}} {{ranging from}} apparent magnitude 5.93 to 6.73 over 7.5days. It is a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F7Ib and G2Ib, located around 2037light-years away. S Muscae is likewise a Classical Cepheid, a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F6Ib and G0Ib and magnitudes 5.89 to 6.49 {{over a period}} of 9.66days. A luminous star around 5.9times as massive as the Sun, it is a binary star with a blue-white main sequence star companion likely to be of spectral type B3V to B5V with a mass of just over 5solar masses, one of the hottest <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> companions of a Cepheid known. The two stars orbit each other every 505days.|$|E
5|$|Six {{clusters}} were imaged in 2007: the Abell clusters 1689, 1995, 2142, 2163, 2261 and 2390, {{which have}} redshifts between 0.091 and 0.322. For the largest <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> four of these—Abell 1689, 2261, 2142 and 2390—comparisons {{were made with}} X-ray and Subaru weak lensing data to study the cluster layout and radial properties, specifically of the mass profiles and baryon content.

25|$|Caltech in Pasadena {{provided}} an ideal {{situation for the}} development and manufacture of aircraft. In 1925, aircraft builder Donald Douglas and Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler worked together with Caltech president Robert Millikan to bring a state-of-the-art aeronautical research laboratory to the Pasadena college. Douglas recruited some of Caltech's best <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> students for his company. Douglas utilized the lab's wind tunnel and research staff while designing his DC-1, 2, and 3. In this way, the DC-3, undoubtedly {{one of the most}} successful aircraft designs ever built, represented more than just a single designer's project. It was a regional product, the result of an alliance of business and science created over the preceding five decades.|$|E
25|$|The most {{distinctive}} <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> are the curtain-like auroral arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each {{lined up with}} the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. In-situ particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or 'break-up' into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the 'discrete' auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night. and can display rapid sub-second variations in intensity.|$|E

25|$|Anne Catherine Emmerich {{said that}} as a child she had visions in which she talked with Jesus, saw the souls in Purgatory and {{witnessed}} {{the core of the}} Holy Trinity in the form of three concentric interpenetrating full spheres. The largest but dimmest of the spheres represented the Father core, the medium sphere the Son core and the smallest <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> sphere the Holy Spirit core. Each sphere of omnipresent God is extended toward infinity beyond God's core placed in heaven. The Brentano compilation tells that during an illness in Emmerich's childhood, she was visited by a child (suggested as being Jesus), who told her of plants she should ingest in order to heal; among these was morning glory, a plant containing LSA, a weaker analog of LSD, which can induce visions of phosphenes and cause delusions or hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|The Carroll Brothers {{were also}} {{consultants}} {{to the many}} record companies who {{had no idea how}} to market hip hop music. Vincent Carroll, the magazine's creator-publisher, went on to become a huge source for marketing and promoting the culture of hip hop, starting Blow-Up Media, the first hip hop marketing firm with offices in NYC's Tribeca district. At the age of 21, Vincent employed a staff of 15 and assisted in launching some of the culture's biggest <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> stars (the Fugees, Nelly, the Outzidaz, feat. Eminem and many more). Later other publications spawned up including: Hip Hop Connection, XXL, Scratch, The Source and Vibe. Many individual cities have also produced their own local hip hop newsletters, while hip hop magazines with national distribution are found in a few other countries. The 21st century also ushered in the rise of online media, and hip hop fan sites now offer comprehensive hip hop coverage on a daily basis.|$|E
25|$|Overseas Indians file more patents {{in their}} country of {{residence}} than in India. Thomas Friedman, in his recent book, The World is Flat, explains this trend in terms of brain drain, whereby the best <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> elements in India emigrate to the U.S. in order to seek better financial opportunities. A joint study by Duke University and UC Berkeley revealed that Indian immigrants to the US have founded more engineering and technology companies from 1995 to 2005 than immigrants from the UK, China, Taiwan and Japan combined. A 1999 study by AnnaLee Saxenian reported {{that a third of}} Silicon Valley scientists and engineers were immigrants and that Indians are the second largest group of Asian-born engineers (23%) following the Chinese (51%). Her research showed that in 1998, seven percent of high-technology firms in Silicon Valley were led by Indian CEOs. A recent study shows that 23% of Indian business school graduates take a job in United States.|$|E

25|$|Warrior Nun Areala is a manga-style American {{comic book}} {{character}} created by Ben Dunn {{and published by}} Antarctic Press, first appearing in Warrior Nun Areala Vol. 1 #1 in December 1994. The story revolves around Sister Shannon Masters, a Joan of Arc like heroine of the Order of the Cruciform Sword, a fictional military order of Warrior Nuns and Magic Priests in service of the Catholic Church. The order was created in 1066 when a Valkyrie named Auria renounced her pagan ways and turned to Jesus Christ for salvation; ever since then, Auria, now Areala, has chosen an avatar every generation {{to carry on the}} mission. In modern times, this has grown to a world spanning organization {{in the service of the}} Catholic Church with the current Areala, Sister Shannon Masters as the best <b>and</b> <b>brightest.</b> With her friends beside her, Sister Shannon has led the forces of good against those of evil, ever serving the Lord with faith and humility. Appearing on and off for twenty years since her first appearance, Warrior Nun Areala is creator Ben Dunn's favorite character.|$|E

500|$|Though the {{influence}} of Hazlitt's only full-length treatment of Shakespeare somewhat receded, it did not completely die out. Hazlitt's son and grandson brought out editions of Hazlitt's works later in the century. His miscellaneous and familiar essays were read, and Hazlitt was commended as a stylist by a discerning few. As a critic, though he had passed {{out of the public}} eye, an even more select few understood how high a place he deserved in the ranking of literary critics. William Makepeace Thackeray, for example, praised Hazlitt in 1844 as [...] "one of the keenest <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> critics that ever lived." [...] Another rare exception was the Scottish journalist Alexander Ireland, who in a brief memoir of Hazlitt in 1889 wrote that Hazlitt's book on Shakespeare, [...] "although it professes to be dramatic criticism, is in reality a discourse on the philosophy of life and human nature, more suggestive than many approved treatises expressly devoted to that subject." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2002, NCMP Steve Chia {{supported}} a motion by the Minister for Education stating that [...] "this House ...

[...] He suggested {{that there should be}} a focus on [...] "creative spontaneity", expressing the view that the education system in 2002 was one that focused on churning out a production line of workers, managers and instruction takers. Given that Singapore had reached the standards of a First World economy, Singapore should focus on instilling an inquisitive spirit within students, to encourage students to ask questions. He placed most emphasis on the importance of ensuring that the focus of education should be character building, stating: [...] "It will be failure of our education system if we are to train our best <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> with our best resources only to be told that they are going to be the quitters of our society; or that they lack the compassion for the weak and the down; or that they behave in a snobbish class of their own; or behave condescendingly to their peers and followers; or that the elites only care about their own self-interests." ...|$|E
