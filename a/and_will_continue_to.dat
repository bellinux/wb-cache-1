5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is stable once formed <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> cool almost indefinitely, {{eventually}} {{to become a}} black dwarf. Assuming that the Universe continues to expand, {{it is thought that}} in 1019 to 1020 years, the galaxies will evaporate as their stars escape into intergalactic space.,§IIIA. White dwarfs should generally survive galactic dispersion, although an occasional collision between white dwarfs may produce a new fusing star or a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf which will explode in a Type Ia supernova.,§IIIC,IV. The subsequent lifetime of white dwarfs is thought to be on the order of the lifetime of the proton, known to be at least 1034–1035 years. Some grand unified theories predict a proton lifetime between 1030 and 1036 years. If these theories are not valid, the proton may decay by complicated nuclear reactions or through quantum gravitational processes involving a virtual black hole; in these cases, the lifetime is estimated to be no more than 10200 years. If protons do decay, the mass of a white dwarf will decrease very slowly with time as its nuclei decay, until it loses enough mass to become a nondegenerate lump of matter, and finally disappears completely.,§IV.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 b {{currently}} {{lies beyond}} {{the outer edge}} of the habitable zone but because Gliese 876 is a slowly evolving main-sequence red dwarf its habitable zone is very slowly moving outwards <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> do so for trillions of years. Therefore, Gliese 876 b will, in trillions of years time, lie inside Gliese 876's habitable zone, as defined by the ability of an Earth-mass planet to retain liquid water at its surface, and remain there for at least 4.6 billion years. While the prospects for life on a gas giant are unknown, large moons may be able to support a habitable environment. Models of tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet and the star suggest that large moons should be able to survive in orbit around Gliese 876 b for the lifetime of the system. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place. However, the large mass of the gas giant may make it more likely for larger moons to form.|$|E
5|$|The F/A-18 Hornets are modern {{all-weather}} strike fighter jets, {{designed to}} attack both ground and aerial targets. Australia's F/A-18s were built during the 1980s and early 1990s and {{are currently being}} upgraded to improve their capabilities and extend their service lives. ACG operates a total of 71 F/A-18A and F/A-18B Hornets. The F/A-18A is a single-seat fighter and the F/A-18B is a two-seat variant which is mainly used for pilot training. The Australian Government is planning to replace the F/A-18A and Bs with the F-35A Lightning II from 2013 onwards. The F/A-18F Super Hornet is a dedicated strike aircraft in RAAF service and are considered superior to the F-22 Raptor {{in their ability to}} acquire and track moving ground targets, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> be upgraded until the F-35s are delivered.|$|E
