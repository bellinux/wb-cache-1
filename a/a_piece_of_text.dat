5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E

500|$|Shen Kuo {{wrote that}} during the Qingli reign period (1041–1048), under Emperor Renzong of Song (1022–1063), an obscure {{commoner}} and artisan known as Bi Sheng (990–1051) invented ceramic movable type printing. Although the use of assembling individual characters to compose <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> had its origins in antiquity, Bi Sheng's methodical innovation was something completely revolutionary for his time. Shen Kuo noted that the process was tedious if one only wanted to print a few copies of a book, but if one desired to make {{hundreds or thousands of}} copies, the process was incredibly fast and efficient. Beyond Shen Kuo's writing, however, nothing is known of Bi Sheng's life or the influence of movable type in his lifetime.

50|$|Aboutness is a {{term used}} in library and {{information}} science (LIS), linguistics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind. In LIS, it is often considered synonymous with subject (documents). In the philosophy of mind it has been often considered synonymous with intentionality, perhaps since John Searle (1983). In the philosophy of logic and language it is understood as the way <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> relates to a subject matter or topic.|$|E

50|$|In {{a typical}} round, Plomley read out <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> {{prepared}} by Messiter, and contestants buzzed in if they detected an error. Correctly identifying an error scored one point and supplying a correction {{was worth a}} second; if a contestant buzzed in {{when there was no}} error, two points were awarded to the opposing team. Occasionally a third point was awarded when a contestant spotted a mistake Messiter had not intended.|$|E

Hypertext databases are particularly useful for organizing large amounts of disparate information. For example, they are useful for organizing online encyclopedias, where users can conveniently jump around the text. The World Wide Web is thus a large distributed hypertext database.|$|E

A more comprehensive parallel harmony appears in a section below.Unlike the example above, a textual approach to harmony does not use tables and columns but combines the verses in the gospels into a merged narrative, producing <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> longer than any individual gospel.|$|E
40|$|Inter_Sim, an {{interactive}} tool for developing and running discrete simulation models by interpreting a descriptive language, is presented.

40|$|Regular {{expressions}} (REs) are a {{very powerful}} and popular tool to manipu-late string data {{in a variety of}} applications. They are used as search templates to look for the occurrences <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> in <b>a</b> document, or to define how <b>a</b> given <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> should be formatted in order to be valid (e. g., to check that the value entered in an email field of a Web form is correctly formatted), or even to help solving more complex NLP tasks [NS 07]. Their popularity in those various application domains arises from several reasons. First, they are easy to understand and manipulate for common usages, despite their wide ex-pressiveness and power of abstraction. Second, they are natively usable within a large variety of programming languages, hence making them suitable to be integrated into every project addressing text processing tasks. Their usage of-ten relies on a very limited amount of hand-crafted REs. It is indeed dicult to automatically obtain the REs matching with a given set of strings for which no a priori knowledge about their underlying formatting rules is given. Such an automatic discovery of REs would nonetheless o↵er some very interestin...|$|R
