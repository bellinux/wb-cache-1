On a geographical basis, consumption of total and saturated fats is strongly and positively correlated with the death rates, while consumption of complex carbohydrates is negatively correlated. No correlations were found with temporal changes in death rates or with differences within one country. These findings {{are discussed in the}} light of the works of many other investigators. It is concluded that the relation of diet to AHD is still controversial, and that the development and severity of the disease cannot be confidently attributed to any single dietary factor nor to blood cholesterol. The contributing effects of other factors, such as physical activity, mental stress, and affluence, are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Ischaemic <b>Heart</b> <b>Disease</b> is a {{condition}} that affects the supply of blood to the heart. The blood vessels are blocked due to the deposition of cholesterol plaques on their walls. This reduces the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart musculature, which is essential for proper functioning of the heart. This may eventually result in {{a portion of the}} heart being suddenly deprived of its blood supply leading to the death of that area of heart tissue, resulting in heart attack. In 1963 the Ministry of Railways carried out a survey with a view to ascertaining the number of deaths due to ischimic <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> among railway populations {{in different parts of the}} country. The method employed was to obtain data from all the railway zones on a proforma based on W. H.

First, several specific risk factors for IHD have been identified. Second, evidence that these factors are closely related to environmental and life-style changes implies that risk factors are potentially alterable. Third, these studies have stimulated further consideration and investigation of the basic mechanism of atherosclerosis.

40|$|We {{tried to}} make the {{relation}} between the state of nutritional intake and the life span of human beings clear by comparing them internationally. 1. Observing the correlation of nutrition and life span of both advanced and the other nations, the tendency is almost the same with that of the middle and low developed nations. It can be concluded that in any case the more the nutritional intake is, the more favorable influence is given upon the life span. Examining only about the advanced nations, however, it resulted that the correlations of the both are either very low or opposite to each other. It can be said that the people taking so much nutrition are having a bad influence upon the life span and death. It is especially true with the animal origin calorie and fats and oils. 2. Generally speaking, the influence of nutritional intakes upon the life span seems to change from the better or the worse at the following points. As for the total calorie it changes somewhere around 3000 kcal per capita a day, 35 - 40 % for the ratio of animal origin calorie, around 90 g for protein, 50 - 60 g for fats and oils. 3.

40|$|OBJECTIVE - To assess {{mortality}} and the psychological repercussions of the prolonged waiting time for candidates for heart surgery.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> {{has been the}} leading cause of death all over the world. However, it is among the most {{preventable}} and controllable diseases. The World Health Organization reported that early detection of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> reduces progression to severe and costly illness and complications. Early detection of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients helps in recovering the patientsâ health and decreasing the mortality rate from <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Although <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> can be detected by several tests, such as electrocardiogram, stress tests, and cardiac angiogram, these tests are expensive and cannot be used as community-level screening tests. The Framingham <b>Heart</b> <b>Disease</b> Risk Evaluation Tool and the Australian Absolute Cardiovascular Risk Calculator are two common <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> risk evaluation screening tests. However, both tests need prior blood sample investigations, an invasive and relatively costly process, which reduces their usability in other than medical settings. Motivated by the increasing mortality rates of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients, researchers have been applying different data mining techniques in the diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Research finds that the same data mining technique shows different results across different <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> datasets indicating that there can be significant attributes for <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> diagnosis. Furthermore, researchers suggest that hybrid data mining techniques show better performance in the diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients. This research seeks to help healthcare professionals in the early detection and risk evaluation of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients using data mining analysis. To achieve this objective, the significant attributes in the diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients are identified using a benchmark dataset and a new larger dataset, the reliability of non-invasive attributes in the diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> is investigated, the enhancement of applying hybrid data mining model to the non-invasive attributes is tested, and a <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> expert system risk evaluation tool (HD - ESRET) using hybrid data mining model on non-invasive data attributes is constructed.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Heart</b> <b>disease</b> {{diagnosis}} is a challenging task which can offer automated prediction about the <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> of patient so that further treatment {{can be made}} easy. Due to this fact, <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> diagnosis has received immense interest globally among medical community. Here, artificial intelligence {{played an important role}} in diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> with improved effectiveness. Based on this perspective, several researches have been conducted in the literature recently. So, analyzing those diagnosis techniques can lead to new development in this area. Accordingly, we present a detailed survey of 47 articles published in the standard journals from the year 2005 to 2013. The survey of the papers related to <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and also the survey of many categories of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> such as coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> coronary artery <b>disease,</b> <b>heart</b> failure, ischemic <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> cardiovascular <b>disease,</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and hypoplastic left heart syndrome are presented in this paper.

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} firstly to estimate the healthcare costs attributable to <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in Denmark using recently available data for 2002 – 05. Secondly, to estimate the attributable healthcare costs of lifestyle risk factors among heart patients, in order to inform decision making about prevention programmes specifically targeting patients with <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Methods: For a cohort consisting of participants in a national representative health interview survey, register-based information about hospital diagnosis was used to identify patients with <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Healthcare consumption during 2002 – 05 among individuals developing <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> during 2002 – 05 was compared with individuals free of <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Healthcare costs attributable to <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> were estimated by linear regression with adjustment for confounding factors. The attributable costs of excess drinking, physical inactivity and smoking among future heart patients were estimated with the same method. Results: Individuals with <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> cost the healthcare system on average J 3195 (pv 0. 0001) per person-year more than individuals without <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> The attributable cost of unhealthy lifestyle factors among individuals at risk of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> was about 11 %– 16 % of the attributable cost of <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Conclusions: <b>Heart</b> <b>disease</b> incurs significant additional costs to the healthcare sector, and more so if heart patients have a history of leading an unhealthy life.
