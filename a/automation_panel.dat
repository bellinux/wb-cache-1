40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} smart house automation, the {{application}} of products in this field, and their use. It also describes a specific solution developed in this work for smart house automation and its hardware and software properties. The developed smart house <b>automation</b> <b>panel</b> is a compact device designed primarily for non-commercial use. It is a multipurpose device whose specific function is set by the user by selecting control instructions. This work contains a description of these instructions, the software for building them, and examples of practical applications...|$|E
40|$|Automated systems, {{ranging from}} robots to {{intelligent}} planning aids, are increasingly {{part of the}} cognitive landscape. A pressing question facing the human factors community is how to design the automation to foster effective collaboration between the human and automated agents. This panel brings together leading researchers actively engaged in design of decision-support systems that involve some element of ‘cognitive work ’ automation. They represent a variety of domains {{and a variety of}} approaches to design of collaborative <b>automation.</b> <b>Panel</b> members will discuss unique challenges of their respective domains, including differences in temporal rhythm, and how these have shaped their perspective on ‘collaborative aiding’...|$|E
40|$|This master‘s thesis {{deals with}} the design of modern process control {{algorithms}} suitable for SISO industrial control equipments. In this thesis {{the analysis of the}} controller design methodology using Mixed-sensitivity function is described. This method consists in shaping frequency characteristics of the sensitivity function and complementary sensitivity fiction using the weighting functions. The proposed H controllers are compared with the classical structure of a discrete PID controller with filtered derivative part. The proposed controllers are compared in terms of robustness, performance, complexity of the design and requirements necessary for their practical application (anti-windup, smooth switchover). Robustness of the controller is evaluated on the basis of modulus stability margin. Estimation of model´s parameters is solved least-square method. The proposed control system consists of an industrial PC and <b>Automation</b> <b>Panel</b> from the company B&R, decentralized system I/O and the real plant. Visualization for control workplace was created in the program Automation studio. This visualization is used to the easy transfer of information from a controlled process...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor’s thesis was {{to acquaint}} with {{techniques}} and technologies used in the control and visualization of technologic processes. The industrial PC, PLC and <b>Automation</b> <b>Panels</b> from the company B&R was used on control of the technologic process in laboratory E 541. Designed and implemented control algorithm contains three discrete controllers. The standard OPC is used for communication. Visualization for control workplace is created in the Program Control Web. Visualizations for operator workstations are created in the program Automation Studio. These visualizations are used to transfer information from the technological process...|$|R
50|$|H-Sphere is a {{web hosting}} <b>Automation</b> Control <b>Panel</b> for shared web hosting {{services}} that was developed by Positive Software and acquired by Parallels, Inc. in September 2007. It is available for Linux, Unix and Windows environments and works with MySQL, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server databases. H-Sphere has been written in Java and works with any SQL-compliant database.|$|R
40|$|The current Project {{consists}} on {{the implementation}} of an <b>automation</b> training <b>panel</b> for the electronics and automation engineering students at ESPOL University, with the purpose to provide a didactic tool so that the power electronics laboratory’s students could develop any other applications using the equipment and electrical machinery currently available at the laboratory. Also, an auger filling system, consisting of a small conveyor belt and a hopper, was automated as a demonstrative application for the panel. This training panel was designed to have a HMI and a PLC with its digital inputs and outputs wired to terminals on its front face. The same digital inputs on the front face, are represented as two position switches in case it {{is needed to simulate}} an external signal, and the digital outputs have pilot lights that work as state indicators. The same principle was applied to the PLC’s analog inputs and outputs, using a variable DC voltage power source to simulate an external signal if desired. The actuators of the filling system were two AC servomotors with their respective AC drives. The control of the devices was made through a PROFIBUS link between the PLC and the drives...|$|R
40|$|Small {{satellites}} used in satellite constellations require high-performance, reliable solar power. Even with constellation redundancy, {{the risk}} to mission performance of solar panel failure is significant, and so extensive qualification and acceptance testing is normally implemented to assure reliability of customized solar panel designs To minimize these costs and risks, a modular, laminated solar panel design has been developed that combines highefficiency solar cells and space-qualified materials with design standardization and <b>automation</b> to allow <b>panels</b> to be manufactured in a production environment. The modularity of this technology supports a variety of Smallsat footprints {{without the need for}} customization. Advanced modules have been developed, including ones that incorporate a multi-cell transparent coverglass replacement layer, insulating substrate, interconnects, diodes and wiring, that enables the solar cell pick-and-place, auto-bonding, and panel laminating that characterize lower cost robust terrestrial solar panels. This significantly reduces the cost by eliminating the most expensive labor- and schedule-intensive elements of solar panel assembly, as well as eliminating the non-recurring engineering and qualification costs of each customized solar panels...|$|R

The mission of the ICE on Automation is to (1) share knowledge and experience of automated systems for coding mortality information, (2) develop and improve existing automated systems through international collaboration, (3) facilitate the transition to ICD- 10 for mortality, and (4) establish mechanisms for technical support of automated systems.
