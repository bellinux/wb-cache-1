5|$|The Varaha, in the 83 {{verses of}} Chapter 2, {{explains}} to Ribhu {{how to achieve}} the most exalted knowledge of Brahmavidya, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> it is. He tells Ribhu that the four means of this knowledge are to practice conduct of one's Varna (caste) and one's Ashrama (stage in life), from ascetic austerity {{and with the help}} of a Guru (spiritual teacher). The Varaha then states that the path to Brahmavidya is through the capacity to distinguish between the ephemeral and the eternal, detachment from the material world unto the spiritual world. A sincere longing for spiritual liberation and six virtuous qualities (shama) are essential in order to achieve Brahmavidya, asserts the Upanishad, these being tranquility, self-restraint, doing work without craving for rewards, endurance, faith, and meditation. Varaha states in verse 2.4 that the truly blessed are those who know Brahman and Atman and have thus become one with them.|$|E
25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, Royalist {{forces were}} {{significantly}} depleted by the battle at Bristol. Suffering over 1,000 men dead, and having exhausted their supplies, the armies {{were forced to}} regroup. Even considering this, the capture of Bristol is considered the high-water mark for the Royalist cause during the First English Civil War. With the city captured, however, an immediate dispute occurred over who was to govern it, and this led to Charles travelling there on 1 August to take personal command of the Royalist forces. Upon arriving he called his council of war together to discuss their next move, the primary questions at hand being [...] "first, whether the armies should be united, and march in one upon the next design. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> the design should be". The western army, although still strong, refused to advance further to the east due {{to the presence of}} Parliamentarian forces within Dorset and Cornwall; the army's commanders felt that, if they tried to push for such a move, their forces would either mutiny or simply desert.|$|E

[...] In {{an article published in}} 2004, Galtung predicted that the US empire will [...] "decline and fall" [...] by 2020.

2500|$|In November 2007, the BBC {{soap opera}} EastEnders caused {{controversy}} when the character Minty Peterson (played by Cliff Parisi) made {{a reference to}} the disaster. During the episode car mechanic Minty said: [...] "Five years out of Europe because of Heysel, because they penned you lot in to stop you fighting on the pitch <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> did we end up with? Hillsborough." [...] This prompted 380 complaints and the BBC apologised, saying that the character was simply reminding another character, former football hooligan Jase Dyer, that the actions of hooligans led to the fencing-in of football fans. Ofcom also received 177 complaints.|$|E
2500|$|In December {{outbreaks}} of violence were occurring in Ireland, and Fitzwilliam wrote to Grey on 12 December that [...] "one administration after another {{has lost the}} confidence of Ireland, and ours I fear will do so too; we shall do nothing till the hour of necessity is come, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> we shall do will be done too late for any advantageous effect". When the Cabinet unsuccessfully put forward proposals for Catholic Emancipation, the King demanded that they pledge never again propose Emancipation. They refused and the government fell. After Grey had suggested to Lord Grenville that Fitzwilliam be offered the Garter, Lord Grenville offered it to Fitzwilliam (who accepted) on 1 January 1807 but the King refused.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997 the Eels {{remained}} in the ARL’s competition and made the finals {{for the first time}} in 11 seasons by finishing third in the Australian Rugby League competition. Parramatta continued into the NRL era which began in 1998, surviving the reduction in teams at the end of the twentieth century. [...] In The 1998 season Parramatta finished 4th and defeated North Sydney in the first week of the finals 25-12. The following week Parramatta traveled to Brisbane in the major semi final and won the match 15-10 earning the week off. [...] In the 1998 preliminary final Parramatta were leading arch rivals Canterbury 18-2 with less than 10 minutes to play <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> can only be described as the greatest choke in Rugby League preliminary finals history occurred. Canterbury managed to fight their way back into the match and with a minute left on the scoreboard, winger Darryl Halligan kicked a conversion from out on the far touchline to send the game into extra time. Canterbury won in extra time 32-20. The loss was hard to take for Parramatta as they had beaten eventual premiers Brisbane twice during the season. [...] In 1999, Parramatta led Melbourne 16-0 at halftime in the preliminary final only to lose 18-16 at full time. Melbourne went on to win the premiership the following week. In the 2000 NRL season, Parramatta finished 7th and won both their sudden death finals matches to take on Brisbane in the preliminary final. In a game that they were not expected to win, Parramatta came close but lost the match against a much stronger Brisbane side. This was their 3rd preliminary final loss in a row.|$|E
2500|$|On the November 20, 2008 {{episode of}} Impact!, Kurt Angle {{threatened}} Mick Foley and wanted another match against Jarrett at Final Resolution after Foley {{announced that it}} was Angle vs. Rhino at the event. Angle continued to demand a match with Jarrett and he said if he couldn't get him at Final Resolution, he would wrestle Foley. Angle then slapped Foley causing Jarrett to come out and talk about what Angle wanted <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> Jarrett wanted (Angle to be fired). Because of Angle's contract clause, Jarrett could not fire him, so he made this stipulation: if Angle lost to Rhino, he would be fired from TNA; if Angle beat Rhino, he would get Jarrett at Genesis. Angle won, allowing him to face Jarrett at Genesis. The feud got even more personal when it started involving Jarrett's three daughters during the December 11, 2008 episode of Impact. Angle said that they would become orphans after Genesis and that [...] "Uncle Kurt" [...] may find it in his heart to adopt them and make them his. Jarrett came out to confront him but was held back by his longtime friend, BG James, TNA Personnel Terry Taylor, referee Earl Hebner, and Scott D'Amore. On January 11 at Genesis, Jarrett lost to Angle. Jarrett suffered some injuries, but able to compete on the TNA Maximum Impact Tour, by facing against Angle in two singles and a few tag team matches with A.J. Styles against Angle and Scott Steiner. Then on February 12, 2009, Jarrett returned to Impact! to stop Angle from forcing Sting to lay down and gain an easy championship victory. The next week, Jarrett allowed Angle to have another match against Sting, and on February 26, 2009 Jarrett announced Angle vs. Sting at Destination X for the TNA World Championship.|$|E
