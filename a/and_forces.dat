40|$|The rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> {{of manual}} chest {{percussion}} as applied by 35 physiotherapists was investigated. The influence of gender, body weight, {{body mass index}} (BMI), rate and frequency of usage on force were examined. Percussion was applied to a healthy male for 35 seconds and the rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> were measured using a force platform. The rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> varied among subjects. The mean (SD) rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> of percussion were 6. 60 (1. 00) Hertz and 58. 10 (15. 32) Newtons respectively. There was no relationship between <b>force</b> <b>and</b> 1) gender, 2) body weight, 3) BMI or 4) frequency of usage of percussion. A weak relationship was found between rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> (r = - 0. 358, p = 0. 034). Thirty-two subjects demonstrated a hand dominance...|$|R

40|$|Closed-loop {{systems of}} an {{electro-hydraulic}} servo system including position, acceleration, <b>and</b> <b>force</b> closed-loop systems <b>and</b> their closed-loop transfer functions based on parameter model are adaptive identified using a recursive extended least-squares algorithm. The position <b>and</b> <b>force</b> closed-loop tracking controllers are {{designed by a}} proportional–integral–derivative controller and are tuned by the position <b>and</b> <b>force</b> step signals. The acceleration closed-loop tracking controller is designed by a three-variable controller and the three states include position, velocity, and acceleration. Experimental results of the estimated position, acceleration, <b>and</b> <b>force</b> closed-loop transfer functions are performed on an actual electro-hydraulic servo system using xPC rapid prototyping technology, which clearly demonstrate {{the benefit of the}} adaptive identification method...|$|R

5|$|Catalysis is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon <b>and</b> <b>forces</b> the carbonyl oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E
