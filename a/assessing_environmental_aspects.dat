40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this thesis is how to account for environmental aspects when purchasing freight transports. This problem is addressed from a transport purchasing perspective. The result of the research is a model for how transport purchasers can incorporate environmental aspects when purchasing freight transports. This mode! is built on two tools and a work process. The first too! is a structural approach to enable transport purchasers to assess environmental performance of transport suppliers. The other too! is a method for <b>assessing</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of a specific transport relation. The second tool furthermore includes a method for how to allocate the environmental aspect of transports to the cargo transported and a method for how to determine environmental aspects of a specific transport relation. The aspects accounted for are the input of energy and the output of emissions of carbon dioxide, sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulate. The work process describes how the tools {{can be used in}} order to support continuous improvements. The work process is described according to the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. The research has been both case study inspired as well as action research oriented. The model was developed in a company where the researcher actively participated in its development. The company in the case study is a major European transport purchaser. The practical implication of the result is a method, which enables transport purchasers to account for environmental aspects in their purchasing work. The theoretical implication of this method can be a step towards developing general theory of accounting for the environment in transport purchasing...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns and {{the reliance on}} depleting fossil resources the conventional chemical industry is facing increasing pressure to alter their production methods towards a sustainable direction. Despite having also its disadvantages like the land-use issue, biomass is considered {{to have a major}} potential as a more sustainable feedstock for the future chemical production. Research in this area is increasing, but profitable business models for biobased products are still lacking. A good example for a biobased chemical product which already found its way to the markets is 1, 3 -propanediol (PDO), a platform-chemical {{with a wide range of}} possible uses and a rapidly growing market. It has been commercially implemented and environmentally assessed by DuPont, an American chemical company. While DuPont produces PDO from glucose based on corn, there is also the possibility to use glycerol as a biological feedstock. Glycerol is a by-product of the large biodiesel production and is thus currently facing an over-supply on the market which cannot be accommodated by the conventional uses of glycerol. As research has indicated, it could be an attractive solution to use it as a cheap feedstock for the production of PDO. However, so far no analysis of the environmental impacts of this production pathway has been conducted. This thesis therefore assesses what the environmental impacts of the glycerol-based PDO production are and indicates how they relate to impacts of other biobased and petrochemical alternatives of PDO-production. Hence, a cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment was conducted, assessing the greenhouse gas emissions and the non-renewable energy use of the glycerol-based PDO production. This assessment includes a contributional analysis and an extensive sensitivity analysis which develops three scenarios. The results of those scenarios are compared to results of other studies <b>assessing</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of alternative fossil- and biobased production pathways for PDO. This benchmarking between the different production pathways indicates that the glycerol-based production route is environmentally preferable compared to fossil alternatives and might be competitive with biobased PDO from glucose, if the production process is further optimized. The contributional analysis revealed that the process of PDO recovery and purification shows the biggest environmental impact, which is mainly due to its intensive steam use from fossil sources. Moreover, the study gave insight to the future development of the biodiesel market, which might negatively influence the prospects of a glycerol-based PDO production on long term...|$|E

5000|$|Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is a systematic, phased {{approach}} to <b>assessing</b> the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and potential impacts {{that are associated}} with a product, process or service. “Life cycle” “refers to the major activities {{in the course of the}} product’s life-span from its manufacture, use, and maintenance, to its final disposal, including the raw material acquisition required to manufacture the product”. [...] Thus a method for <b>assessing</b> the <b>environmental</b> impacts of freshwater consumption was developed. It specifically looks at the damage to three areas of protection: human health, ecosystem quality, and resources. The consideration of water consumption is crucial where water-intensive products (for example agricultural goods) are concerned and need to therefore undergo a life-cycle assessment. [...] In addition, regional assessments are equally as necessary as the impact of water use depends on its location. In short, LCA is important as it identifies the impact of water use in certain products, consumers, companies, nations, etc. which can help reduce the amount of water used.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSES: This study {{evaluated}} the field applicability and laboratory performance of warm-mix asphalt (WMA) {{as an alternative}} technology in asphalt pavement. METHODS: The pilot road using {{two different types of}} WMA mixture and one HMA mixture was constructed in Waegwan-Seokjeok road construction site and the mixtures were sampled at the asphalt plant for laboratory testings. The field applicability was <b>assessed</b> in <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects,</b> such as CO 2 emission, and in aspects of constructibility using the existing equipment and procedure, i. e., thickness and density measurement. The laboratory testings included the moisture susceptibility test by AASHTO T 283, dynamic modulus test, triaxial repeated load permanent deformation test, and the fatigue test. RESULTS: The temperatures for production and compaction of WMA were 20 ~ 30 ℃ lower than those for HMA and therefore, the noxious gas emission were significantly reduced. The field density of WMA pavements was similar or better than that of HMA pavement. From the laboratory testings, it was found that WMA mixtures exhibit comparable performance to HMA mixture in moisture susceptibility, permanent deformation, and fatigue performance.

40|$|All organisations {{make some}} {{contribution}} to the {{degradation of the environment}} through their use of resources and production of waste. Environmental management systems (EMS) standards can provide a tool for companies to systematically reduce their environmental impacts. ISO 14001 was published in 1996. This fitted in with plans of the case study company to take proactive action in this area, even though there was no legislative requirement for them to do so. As EMS implementation was a new area at the time, appropriate methodologies were developed to address different aspects of the implementation, and ISO 14001 was successfully implemented in the company. The results of the primary research included: ♦ Drawing up a methodology for identifying and interpreting the environmental legislation that may {{have an impact on the}} organisation and compiling a register of such regulations. ♦ Developing a robust methodology for <b>assessing</b> significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and impacts and applying this to the software company. ♦ Establishing objectives and targets for those aspects identified as significant and implementing environmental management programmes to meet these. ♦ Developing an internal environmental audit procedure based on auditing against the significant aspects. ♦ Integrating areas of the EMS with the existing quality management system in order to avoid duplication of effort. ♦ Undergoing an external assessment process in order to achieve certification of the system. The thesis concludes that the systematic approach defined in ISO 14001 provided a mechanism that the organisation was able to adopt to bring about improvement in its environmental performance. The system was based on a thorough evaluation of the organisation's significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> in order to bring about a reduction in its negative impacts.

30|$|Within the {{application}} of the Sustainability concept of the Helmholtz Association, LCA and LCC (besides other methods) are used as tools for <b>assessing</b> <b>environmental</b> and economic <b>aspects</b> of sustainability. In the IWRM project, LCA and LCC were used for analyzing alternative technology options for water supply (extraction); distribution and treatment within the area of investigation to identify which of the potential alternatives are “more” sustainable. A “more” sustainable option is here understood as the option, which shows a better environmental and economic performance compared to its alternatives. In addition, LCA and LCC were used to <b>assess</b> the <b>environmental</b> impacts and costs/benefits of the oldwater supply system which existed before the IWRM activities, and the projected new system after an implementation of selected technology options within the IWRM. Various LCA studies assessing different technologies for water supply, distribution, and treatment are already available (an overview is provided, e.g., by Lassaux et al. 2007). For LCC, only few studies are available (e.g., Barriosa et al. 2008; Ghimire et al. 2012; Ambrose et al. 2008). However, most of these LCA and LCC studies focus on urban systems in industrialized countries. Thus, the studies conducted within this IWRM project can be seen {{as one of the first}} cases focusing on rural regions in developing or emerging countries. Moreover, it was the first time that LCA and LCC were used within an IWRM project as part of a sustainability assessment of technologies.|$|R
40|$|Poly {{butylene}} succinate (PBS) is a {{biodegradable plastic}} polymer that has physical and mechanical properties similar to common petroleum plastics like polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). PBS may be produced from petroleum or bio-based feedstocks, or by a hybrid combination of petroleum and bio-based resources. Producers are reducing content of petroleum components {{used for the}} production of PBS, and by doing so are seeking potential environmental performance improvements. In this study, “hybrid” PBS refers to the production of PBS polymer from bio-based succinic acid (SAC) sourced from sorghum and petroleum-based 1, 4 -butanediol (BDO). Given its biodegradability, PBS is commercially used for compostable bags and agricultural mulching film applications. A recent study in Ontario identified composite materials made with PBS blended with natural fibres like switchgrass (SG) as promising for applications in automotive products. Such novel composite materials are touted as potential bio-based alternatives to conventional petroleum-based plastics. Of the few studies that have considered the environmental performance of PBS materials, none have <b>assessed</b> the potential <b>environmental</b> impacts of a hybrid PBS composite. Therefore, this study undertook a life cycle assessment (LCA) of SG reinforced hybrid PBS composite (hybrid composite). LCA is an environmental management technique that is used to <b>assess</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> (inputs and outputs) and potential environmental impacts of a product or service throughout its life cycle. The analysis considered a cradle-to-gate system boundary and evaluated eleven environmental performance indicators. The environmental performance of the hybrid composite was compared to a conventional glass fibre (GF) reinforced polypropylene (PP) composite (baseline composite), a material that is widely used in automotive components. Results showed that the production of the hybrid composite in comparison to the baseline composite decreased potential impact for most of the assessed indicators: cumulative energy demand by 40 %, waste heat by 23 %, global warming potential by 35 %, smog by 2 %, carcinogens by 54 %, non-carcinogens by 172 %, respiratory effects by 22 % and ecotoxicity by 45 %. Increases in the values of impact indicators were apparent for ozone depletion, acidification, and eutrophication by 43 %, 16 %, and 322 %, respectively. Analysis revealed that dominant influences on results were not related directly to the bio-based make-up. Rather, the biggest influence on the environmental performance of composite production were the sources of heat used in petroleum-based materials, the energy mix in electricity for bio-based materials, the type of reinforcing fibre and the co-product treatment methodology used. The study helps fill a gap in knowledge regarding bio-based chemicals and hybrid biodegradable plastic composites, and points to opportunities for future research on feedstocks for industrial composite materials. The importance {{of this study is that}} it helps to identify the environmental strengths and weaknesses associated with the production of the hybrid composite specifically, and bio-based materials more generally. It points to alternative material substitution options for use in the automotive industry. In this study, life cycle assessment exemplifies multidisciplinary methodologies, which seek to traverse the boundaries between the social and natural sciences and disciplines to support more sustainable policy decisions for a bio-economy. The systematic nature and the widely applicable consequences of this LCA study have the potential to contribute to industrial and business management, and reach the public policy arena in an effort to drive environmental and social change. 1 yea...|$|R

Moreover, professionals’ (architects’) self-rated opinions regarding use and knowledge of NBEATs and <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> are surveyed. Similarities and differences in NBEATs are found regarding: content, structure, weighting and indicators used. Indicators distinguished as procedure, performance and feature are used to varying extents to <b>assess</b> social, <b>environmental</b> and technical <b>aspects.</b> NBEATs relation to environmental sustainability has limitations due to: non-transparency, tradable indicators, relative measures, low criteria levels, limited life cycle perspective, and exclusion of relevant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects,</b> such as embedded toxic substances, nutrient cycles, land use change, and ecosystem services. Ratings and architecture are influenced by NBEATs in varying ways. Higher criteria levels would probably increase their impact on architecture. Thus more research regarding NBEATs and links to architectural design, theory and practice is welcomed. There is limited use of NBEATs as decision support in early design phases such as in architectural competitions. Architects rate the importance of <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> high, but few rate their skill in handling <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> high. This calls for increasing knowledge and know-how of environmental strategies and solutions among architects and adaptation of NBEATs to early design processes.
