40|$|Abstract: The {{globalization}} {{of the software}} market leads to crucial problems for software companies. More competition between software companies arises and leads to the force on companies to develop ever newer software products in ever shortened time interval. Therefore the time to market for software systems is shortened and obviously the product life cycle is shortened too. Thus software companies shortened the time interval for research and development. Due to the fact of competition between software companies software products have to develop low-priced and {{this leads to a}} smaller return on investment. A big challenge for software companies is the use of an effective research and development process to have these problems under control. A way to control these problems can be the reuse of existing software components and adapt those software components to new functionality or accommodate mismatched interfaces. Complete redevelopment of software products is more expensive and time consuming than to develop software components. The approach introduced here presents novel technique together with a supportive environment that enables developers to cope with the adaptability of black-box software components. A supportive environment will be designed that checks the compatibility of black-box software components with the assistance of their specifications. Generated <b>adapter</b> <b>software</b> components can take over the part of adaptation and advance the functionality. Besides, a pool of software components can be used to compose an application to satisfy customer needs. Certainly this pool of software components consists of black-box software components and <b>adapter</b> <b>software</b> components which can be connected on demand. ...|$|E

40|$|Server network {{performance}} is increasingly dominated by poorly scaling operations such as I/O bus crossings, cache misses and interrupts. Their overhead prevents performance from scaling even with increased CPU, link or I/O bus bandwidths. These operations {{can be reduced}} by redesigning the host/adapter interface to exploit additional processing on the adapter. Of oading processing to the adapter is bene cial {{not only because it}} allows more cycles to be applied but also of the changes it enables in the host/adapter interface. As opposed to other approaches such as RDMA, TCP of oad provides benets without requiring changes to either the transport protocol or API. We have designed a new host/adapter interface that exploits of oaded processing to reduce poorly scaling operations. We have implemented a prototype of the design including both host and <b>adapter</b> <b>software</b> components. Experimental evaluation with simple network benchmarks indicates our design signi cantly reduces I/O bus crossings and holds promise to reduce other poorly scaling operations as well. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of automatic-application code generation are widely accepted {{within the software}} engineering community. These benefits include raised abstraction level of application programming, shorter product development time, lower maintenance costs, and increased code quality and consistency. Surprisingly, code generation concepts have not yet found wide acceptance and use {{in the field of}} programmable logic controller (PLC) software development. Software engineers at Kennedy Space Center recognized the need for PLC code generation while developing the new ground checkout and launch processing system, called the Launch Control System (LCS). Engineers developed a process and a prototype software tool that automatically translates a high-level representation or specification of application software into ladder logic that executes on a PLC. All the computer hardware in the LCS is planned to be commercial off the shelf (COTS), including industrial controllers or PLCs that are connected to the sensors and end items out in the field. Most of the software in LCS is also planned to be COTS, with only small <b>adapter</b> <b>software</b> modules that must be developed in order to interface between the various COTS software products. A domain-specific language (DSL) is a programming language designed to perform tasks and to solve problems in a particular domain, such as ground processing of launch vehicles. The LCS engineers created a DSL for developing test sequences of ground checkout and launch operations of future launch vehicle and spacecraft elements, and they are developing a tabular specification format that uses the DSL keywords and functions familiar to the ground and flight system users. The tabular specification format, or tabular spec, allows most ground and flight system users to document how the application software is intended to function and requires little or no software programming knowledge or experience.

40|$|Part 2 : Challenges to Privacy, Security, and IdentityInternational audienceTo {{preserve}} {{data confidentiality}} in database outsourcing scenarios, various techniques {{have been proposed}} that preserve {{a certain degree of}} confidentiality while still allowing to efficiently execute certain queries. Typically, several of those techniques have to be combined to achieve a certain degree of confidentiality. However, finding an appropriate combination is not a trivial task, as expert knowledge is required and interdependencies between the techniques exist. Securus, an approach we previously proposed, addresses this problem. Securus allows users to model their requirements regarding the information in the outsourced dataset that has to be protected. Furthermore, queries that have to be efficiently executable on the outsourced data can be specified. Based on these requirements, Securus uses Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to find a suitable combination of confidentiality enhancing techniques and generates a <b>software</b> <b>adapter.</b> This <b>software</b> <b>adapter</b> transparently applies the techniques to fulfill the specified requirements and can be used to seamlessly outsource and query the data.

50|$|The ESB is {{implemented}} in software that operates between the business applications, and enables communication among them. Ideally, the ESB {{should be able}} to replace all direct contact with the applications on the bus, so that all communication takes place via the ESB. To achieve this objective, the ESB must encapsulate the functionality offered by its component applications in a meaningful way. This typically occurs through the use of an enterprise message model. The message model defines a standard set of messages that the ESB transmits and receives. When the ESB receives a message, it routes the message to the appropriate application. Often, because that application evolved without the same message model, the ESB has to transform the message into a format that the application can interpret. A <b>software</b> <b>adapter</b> fulfills the task of effecting these transformations, analogously to a physical adapter.|$|R
40|$|Separation of {{concerns}} and loose coupling {{of concerns}} are important issues in software engineering. In this paper we show how to separate traversal-related concerns from other concerns, how to loosely couple traversal-related concerns to the structural concern {{and how to}} efficiently implement traversal-related concerns. The stress is on the detailed description of our algorithms and the traversal specifications they operate on. Traversal of object structures is a ubiquitous routine in most types of information processing. Ad-hoc implementations of traversals lead to scattered and tangled code and {{in this paper we}} present a new approach, called traversal strategies, to succinctly modularize traversals. In our approach traversals are dened using a high-level directed graph description, which is compiled into a dynamic road map to assist run-time traversals. The complexity of the compilation algorithm is polynomial {{in the size of the}} traversal strategy graph and the class graph of the given application. Prototypes of the system have been developed and are being successfully used to implement traversals for Java and AspectJ [KHH+ 01] and for generating <b>adapters</b> for <b>software</b> components. Our previous approach, called traversal specifications [Lie 92, PXL 95], was less general, less succinct, and its compilation algorithm was of exponential complexity in some cases.
