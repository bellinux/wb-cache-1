5|$|The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} legume from the genus Vigna. Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall {{it is an}} important crop in the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name.|$|E
5|$|In early November 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy {{selected}} Critchfield to be {{head of the}} Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. McElroy {{hoped that}} Critchfield would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> the nation's trouble missile program, but Critchfield was reluctant to serve at the director's $19,000 salary. McElroy then offered to let Critchfield serve without pay, with the government paying only his expenses of $15 per day, while allowing Critchfield to continue to draw his Convair salary of around $40,000. Critchfield accepted this offer, but ran into a storm of political and media criticism over the conflict of interest involved in heading an agency that did $4 million worth of business with Convair each year. Critchfield then withdrew his name from consideration.|$|E

500|$|... '458' {{was part}} of a {{cross-country}} flight of two aircraft when its radio failed while landing at Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwest Idaho. The aircraft was ordered to effect repairs at Mountain Home AFB and then return to MCAS El Toro. Diagnostic tests at Mountain Home revealed that the aircraft had an inoperative radio, inoperative transponder, oxygen system leak, and a degraded radar system. Maintenance personnel were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> the radio and confirm the oxygen leak, but the base did not have the necessary personnel to repair either the transponder or the radar.|$|E
500|$|By noon, she was 140 {{miles off}} the {{southwest}} coast of England. This section of the English coast was hazardous, due to shallow waters, sharp rocks, and often-dense fog, so it was normally avoided by ships. By the afternoon Suevic had entered a typically dense fog bank. By 10 pm, the ship's officers were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> their position using stellar navigation, so they intended to use instead the Lizard lighthouse on Lizard Point, Cornwall (known simply as [...] "The Lizard"), which they soon spotted. Upon seeing the light, they calculated that {{it was at least}} 10 miles away, and thus thought themselves safe. Despite the fog, they pressed ahead at full speed, without using the sounding line to ensure they were not approaching the shore.|$|E

2500|$|When foresting {{companies}} {{cut down}} trees, more are planted in their place. Most paper comes from pulp forests grown specifically for paper production. Many environmentalists point out, however, that [...] "farmed" [...] forests are inferior to virgin forests in several ways. Farmed forests are not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> the soil {{as quickly as}} virgin forests, causing widespread soil erosion and often requiring large amounts of fertilizer to maintain while containing little tree and wild-life biodiversity compared to virgin forests. Also, the new trees planted are {{not as big as}} the trees that were cut down, and the argument that there will be [...] "more trees" [...] is not compelling to forestry advocates when they are counting saplings.|$|E
2500|$|In short, Netscape {{focused on}} {{creating}} software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing {{it to the}} end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with Google, a company that did not at the time focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data such as the links Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web search based on reputation through its [...] "PageRank" [...] algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called [...] "the perpetual beta". A similar difference can be seen between the Encyclopædia Britannica Online and Wikipedia: while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and releases them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in the subjects in which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the open source software adage [...] "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". This maxim is stating that if enough users are able to look at a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> any [...] "bugs" [...] or other problems. Wikipedia's volunteer editor community produces, edits and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting entrepreneurs, representatives from large companies, tech experts and technology reporters.|$|E
