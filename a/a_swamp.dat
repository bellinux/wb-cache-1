5|$|Historically, {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> at the {{headwaters}} of Black Creek. As late as the 1910s, {{the waters of the}} creek were described as coming from mountain springs and <b>a</b> <b>swamp.</b>|$|E
5|$|American {{alligator}} predation on Florida panthers is rare, but {{has been}} documented. Such incidents usually involve a panther trying to cross a waterway or coming down to <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> or river to get a drink. The American alligator is the only known natural predator of the panther. American alligator predation on black bears has also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in Yosemite Valley {{and access}} to the park {{steadily}} improved. In 1878, Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional moraine in the valley to drain <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> behind it. Tourism significantly increased after a Sacramento to Stockton extension of the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 and the Central Pacific Railroad reached Merced in 1872.|$|E

5|$|Around 01:00 on August 27, the British {{approached}} {{the vicinity of}} the Red Lion with 200–300 troops. The American troops fired upon the British; after approximately two fusillades, they fled up the Gowanus Road toward the Vechte-Cortelyou House. Major Edward Burd had been in command, but he was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates. This first engagement was fought in the vicinity of 38th and 39th streets between 2nd and 3rd avenues near <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> located adjacent to the Gowanus Road.|$|E
5|$|Artist Christopher Still {{created an}} {{oil on linen}} {{painting}} named The Okeehumkee on the Oklawaha River that hangs in the Florida House of Representatives. It {{is one of a}} series of images that encompass symbols of cultural and historical significance to Florida that were commissioned by the State of Florida in 1999 and completed in 2002. Palmetto Leaves is shown lying next to a large alligator and hollowed tree trunk in front of a riverboat passing through <b>a</b> <b>swamp.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chat Moss may {{be named}} after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, {{but as it}} was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as {{evidenced}} by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> male <b>Swamp</b> Dragon {{is called}} a pewmet between {{hatching}} and eight months, a cock between eight and fourteen months, a snood between fourteen months and two years, and a cobb between two years and death. <b>A</b> female <b>Swamp</b> Dragon {{is called a}} hen until her third clutch, and a dam thereafter. <b>A</b> dead <b>Swamp</b> Dragon of either sex is called a crater. <b>A</b> group of <b>swamp</b> dragons is called either a slump or an embarrassment. During mating season, male Swamp Dragons will compete when they see each other by attempting to inflate themselves as large as possible (hopefully without exploding). Because of this, dragon owners are discouraged from keeping mirrors.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} aerial {{application}} of agricultural materials was by John Chaytor, who in 1906 spread seed over <b>a</b> <b>swamped</b> valley floor in Wairoa, New Zealand, using a hot air balloon with mobile tethers.

50|$|The swamp lies on {{the upper}} surface of the Rock and Pillar Range (the Rock and Pillars are a horst range, and thus have a very flat top). Originally <b>an</b> actual <b>swamp,</b> <b>a</b> dam to store water for {{irrigation}} and hydroelectricity has turned the 'swamp' into <b>a</b> lake. The <b>swamp</b> is drained by the Logan Burn, which feeds into the Taieri River at Paerau.|$|R
5|$|No. 6 Commando led {{the brigade}} from the beach. Moving through <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> that briefly slowed their progress, the commandos {{began to come}} up against the German defences {{that had not been}} {{destroyed}} by the naval bombardment. Where possible they attempted an indirect approach, penetrating the defences using infiltration tactics. However, as they advanced towards bridges that had been captured by the paratroopers earlier in the day, they assaulted four pillboxes as well as an artillery battery that had been firing on the landing beaches.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the ancient}} sources detail plots that Galerius made on Constantine's life in the months {{following}} Diocletian's abdication. They assert that Galerius assigned Constantine to lead an advance unit in a cavalry charge through <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> on the middle Danube, made him enter into single combat with a lion, and attempted to kill him in hunts and wars. Constantine always emerged victorious: the lion emerged from the contest in a poorer condition than Constantine; Constantine returned to Nicomedia from the Danube with a Sarmatian captive to drop at Galerius' feet. It is uncertain how much these tales can be trusted.|$|E
5|$|The Green was not {{maintained}} at first; after being cleared, it was unkempt and ragged, sloping sharply towards <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> {{in the southwest}} corner. As early as 1807, the College was debating as {{to the future of}} the plot, considering using it for a variety of purposes. In 1828, the Board of Trustees finally voted to plow, seed, level, and fence the area. Lack of funding would delay this plan from being carried out immediately; the Green was leveled in 1831 and finally fenced in 1836. The main road from Hanover to the northward Lyme, New Hampshire had previously led diagonally across the Green, and due to the new fences, had to be diverted around it.|$|E

5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask {{is set in}} Termina, a land {{parallel}} to Hyrule, the latter being the main setting of most games in the series. According to legend, Termina was split into four areas by four magical giants that live in four regions of the land. At the center of Termina lies Clock Town, which features a large clock tower that counts down {{the days before the}} Carnival of Time—a major festival where the people of Termina pray for good luck and harvests. Termina Field surrounds Clock Town; beyond lie <b>a</b> <b>swamp,</b> mountain range, bay, and canyon {{in each of the four}} cardinal directions.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossing}} of the Saint Lawrence by the American troops was observed by Quebec militia, who alerted British troops at Trois-Rivières. A local farmer led the Americans into <b>a</b> <b>swamp,</b> enabling the British to land additional forces in the village, and to establish positions behind the American army. After a brief exchange between an established British line and American troops emerging from the swamp, the Americans broke into a somewhat disorganized retreat. As some avenues of retreat were cut off, the British took a sizable number of prisoners, including General Thompson and much of his staff.|$|E
5|$|The three {{travel to}} Florida, but {{find that the}} Lake has dried up and is now <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> filled with gold from the sunken {{treasure}} fleet last seen in Act I. There, they destroy a Circle base in the swamp. Cooper finds and attempts to capture Beaumont, but Beaumont commands two wolves to attack him. Cooper shoots one of them with his pistol, but the other kills him. Amelia, now wanting to avenge Cooper, learns from the local Seminoles {{that there is an}} Inca city in Pacamayo Valley where several barrels of the Fountain's water have been stored.|$|E

5|$|Edward and Karl find {{a fork in}} {{the road}} and travel down {{separate}} paths. Edward follows a path through <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> and discovers the secret town of Spectre, the cheery locals claiming he was expected. There, he befriends Ashton poet Norther Winslow and the mayor’s daughter Jenny. However, Edward leaves Spectre, unwilling to settle down but promises Jenny he will return. In the present day, Joséphine speaks to the bed-ridden Edward and asks him to tell her the story of how he met his wife Sandra, with Will listening outside the door. Returning to his reminisces, Edward reunites with Karl and they visit the Calloway Circus, where Edward {{falls in love with a}} beautiful woman. Karl and Edward get jobs in the circus where the ringmaster Amos Calloway reveals to Edward one detail about the woman at the end of every month.|$|E
5|$|The player fights through monsters and bandits {{in crystal}} caves, a forest, <b>a</b> <b>swamp,</b> and an {{underground}} Goblin fortress filled with mechanical war machines. After recovering the Staff from the Goblins, the player character meets {{a division of}} the 10th Legion and is pointed towards Fortress Kroth, which has been overrun with undead. After clearing the fortress and fighting monsters and a dragon in the Cliffs of Fire, they march on Castle Ehb. The player characters then storm the castle and fight through the Seck forces to rescue King Konreid. He informs the party that the Seck's leader, Gom, is seeking the magical weapons from the Empire of Stars stored in the Chamber of Stars, and that the characters must secure the weapons and then defeat the remaining Seck. The player character collects the weapons and fights through lava caves and the Vault of Eternity where the Seck had been imprisoned. The player character kills Gom, defeating the Seck and saving the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The process {{involves}} procedurally-generated {{basic elements}} like elevation, rainfall, mineral distribution, drainage and temperature. For example, a high-rainfall and low-drainage area would make <b>a</b> <b>swamp.</b> Areas are thus categorized into biomes, which have two variables: savagery and alignment. They {{have their own}} specific type {{of plant and animal}} populations. The next phase is erosion—which the drainage simulates. Rivers are created by tracing their paths from the mountains (which get eroded) to its end which is usually an ocean; some form into lakes. The salinity field defines oceans, mangroves or alluvial plains. Names are generated for the biomes and rivers. The names depend on the area's good/evil variable (the alignment) and though in English, they are originally in one of the four in-game languages of dwarves, elves, humans and goblins; these are the four main races in any generated world.|$|E

5|$|There {{are very}} few {{material}} remains of the medieval town today. The city wall that surrounded the settlement has largely disappeared and is difficult to trace today, but from the remains of its foundations {{it does not appear}} to have been a substantial fortification. It was lightly built, with a thickness of perhaps , reinforced by rectangular towers. The three gates have left far more substantial remains. The eastern, southeastern and southern sides were fronted by a ditch of some , with the excavated soil dumped on the inner side and used to elevate the city wall. A small citadel was located in the southwestern corner of the town. The port was separated from the main town by a wall, and was situated in an excavated basin (today <b>a</b> <b>swamp)</b> and probably separated from the sea by an artificial mole and protected by extensions of the city walls. The entrance to the harbour was from the west, offering protection from both the wind and the coast's shoals.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a numerically superior, {{but less}} {{experienced}} enemy, the Company assumed a defensive position, {{taking care to}} select a battleground that favoured them. They chose a naturally strong position, protected by <b>a</b> <b>swamp</b> which, according to Gregoras, they further enhanced by digging trenches and inundating them with water diverted from the nearby river. The Catalans themselves took up positions on dry ground behind the swamp, arranging themselves in a solid line, but the sources give no further details as to their exact disposition. The Athenian army {{on the other hand}} assembled at Lamia. On 10 March 1311, Walter of Brienne composed his testament there and led his army forth. On the eve of battle, the 500 Catalans in the Duke's service, stricken by conscience, went to him and asked for leave to rejoin their old comrades-in-arms, saying that they would rather die than fight against them. Walter reportedly gave them permission to leave, replying that they were welcome to die with the others. At the same time, however, the Catalans' Turkish auxiliaries took up a separate position nearby, thinking the quarrel was a pretext arranged by the Company and the Duke of Athens to exterminate them.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through <b>a</b> <b>swamp,</b> accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E
