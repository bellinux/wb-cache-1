Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure <b>activities,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> profound. The type of leisure activity also depends on the individual's current place in the life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter {{in which}} players control Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark {{through a series}} of levels {{collected}} together into missions. The general gameplay {{is similar to that of}} its predecessor GoldenEye 007, with features such as stealth sections and objectives determined by difficulty settings carried over. Players can crouch, duck, lean, and drop from most ledges, but there is no jump ability. A number of tutorials and training <b>activities</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> taken at the Carrington Institute, which acts as the game's central hub. The Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is needed to access the game's campaign and most of the multiplayer features, although a limited subset of the Combat Simulator options are available without the device; around 35% of the game is playable without an Expansion Pak, as estimated on the game's box and Instruction Booklet.|$|E

The MAUP maintains that their <b>activities</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> classified only as anti-Zionism, but its {{critics in the}} ADL point out traditional antisemitic propaganda traits that have no connection to Zionism, such as religious antisemitism or solely blaming the Jews for the Russian October Revolution or the Holodomor of 1932–1933 (as {{a part of the}} Judeo-Bolshevist antisemitic conspiracy theory).|$|E

The pain may remain static, e.g., {{in one place}} such as {{the front of the}} pelvis, producing the feeling of having been kicked; in other cases it may start in one area and move to other areas.

Interested newcomers are usually encouraged to switch their modern transceivers to AM mode, introduce themselves, and join the conversation.|$|R
25|$|A bank is a {{financial}} institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit. Lending <b>activities</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> performed {{either directly or indirectly}} through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.|$|E
25|$|Outdoor <b>activities</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{done through}} Achill Outdoor Education Centre. Achill Island's rugged {{landscape}} {{and the surrounding}} ocean offers multiple locations for outdoor adventure activities, like surfing, kite-surfing and sea kayaking. Fishing and watersports are also popular. Sailing regattas featuring a local vessel type, the Achill Yawl, have been popular since the 19th century, though most present-day yawls, unlike their traditional working boat ancestors, have been structurally modified to promote greater speed under sail. The island's waters and underwater sites are occasionally visited by scuba divers, though Achill's unpredictable weather generally has precluded a commercially successful recreational diving industry.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows that}} any {{equilibrium}} {{of this kind}} can be characterized either by the standard free energy change or by the equilibrium constant. In practice concentrations are more useful than activities. <b>Activities</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> calculated from concentrations if the activity coefficient are known, but this is rarely the case. Sometimes activity coefficients can be calculated using, for example, Pitzer equations or Specific ion interaction theory. Otherwise conditions must be adjusted so that activity coefficients do not vary much. For ionic solutions this is achieved by using a background ionic medium at a high concentration relative to the concentrations of the species in equilibrium.|$|E

Food and beverage processing, glassware manufacturing, software and data processing, printing and publishing, insurance underwriting, music and recording, and advanced education <b>activities</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in the larger urban areas.

25|$|One of Gillberg's {{research}} projects, the Gothenburg study, {{has become}} {{the center of a}} heated controversy. The controversy concerns the question to what extent the Principle of Public Access, which in Sweden supports transparency in publicly funded <b>activities,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> applied to sensitive data collected in medical studies involving human subjects. In 2003, Gothenburg University was ordered by the court to release medical records and other sensitive data about a group of children who had participated in a longitudinal psychiatric study done by Gillberg and other researchers, to two individuals under the Freedom of Information Act; this was done despite the researchers' assertion that anonymization was not considered feasible due to the nature and length of the study (a small group of participants had been followed for a period of 16 years and the data included a combination of taped interviews, medical records, criminal records, school records, and psychiatric evaluations). The court ordered the University to set conditions for the access so that the interests of the children and the families would be protected.|$|E

500|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, very many seals {{were killed by}} whalers and sealers for meat, oil and skin. U.S. {{military}} forces hunted them during World War II, while occupying Laysan Island and Midway Island. Human disturbances have had immense effects on the populations of the Hawaiian monk seal. Monk seals tend to avoid beaches where they are disturbed; after continual disturbance the seal may completely abandon the beach, thus reducing its habitat size, subsequently limiting population growth. [...] For instance, large beach crowds and beach structures limit the seal’s habitat. The WWII military bases in the northwestern islands were closed, but minimal human <b>activities</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> enough to disturb the species.
