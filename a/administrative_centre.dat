5|$|Before Miri was founded, Marudi was the <b>administrative</b> <b>centre</b> of the {{northern}} region of Sarawak.

During World War II, the Miri oil fields were destroyed by the Brooke government to sabotage Japanese operations in Southeast Asia but to no avail; Miri town was the first landing point of Japanese troops in Borneo.
