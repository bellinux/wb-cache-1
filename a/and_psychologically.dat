5|$|Domesticated rats are physiologically <b>and</b> <b>psychologically</b> {{different}} from their wild relatives, and—when acquired from reputable breeders and shops—pose no more of a health risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, while exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like Salmonella into the home. Fancy rats experience different health risks from their wild counterparts, and thus {{are less likely to}} succumb to many of the same illnesses as wild rats.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{and some}} of his {{siblings}} said they had been physically <b>and</b> <b>psychologically</b> abused by their father, Joseph Jackson. In 2003, Joseph admitted to whipping them as children, but has emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations. The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and may have led to the onset of further health issues later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} {{claimed that}} it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 might choose to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria. The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those it called repatriates to partly reimburse them for property losses. The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees in order to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, <b>and,</b> <b>psychologically</b> at least, many of the Pieds-Noirs were alienated from both Algeria and France.|$|E

50|$|Results {{from the}} {{experiment}} showed drastic differences. It {{was found that}} children raised in the orphanage, whom had received minimal care, had less developmental progress than children raised in the prison. Only 26 kids could walk, {{and only a few}} could talk. Some of the orphanage kids had signs of mental retardation <b>and</b> were <b>psychologically</b> <b>and</b> socially underdeveloped for their age. Whereas in the prison group, most all the children had reached the point of full development for their age division.|$|R
5|$|The {{first few}} naval battles were {{disasters}} for Rome. However, after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine, a Roman naval force {{was able to}} defeat a Carthaginian fleet, and further naval victories followed. The Carthaginians then hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a Spartan mercenary general, to reorganise and lead their army. He cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy. The Romans then again defeated the Carthaginians in naval battle at the Battle of the Aegates Islands and left Carthage with neither a fleet nor sufficient financial means to raise one. For a maritime power {{the loss of their}} access to the Mediterranean stung financially <b>and</b> <b>psychologically,</b> and the Carthaginians sued for peace.|$|E
5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically <b>and</b> <b>psychologically</b> stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, <b>and</b> <b>psychologically</b> made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
50|$|The women's movement, he claims, {{has led to}} the re-socialization {{of girls}} to become women who balance {{survival}} with fulfillment, but that no one has similarly re-socialized boys to become men who pursue that balance once they take on the responsibility of children. Thus, Farrell believes, boys and men are decades behind girls <b>and</b> women <b>psychologically</b> <b>and</b> socially, and increasingly behind women academically and economically.In Farrell's recent presentations on this topic, he estimates that women are in 2011 where men were in 1961.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "temperature" [...] of a color {{also affects}} its {{perceived}} depth. Warm colors have red or yellow tones (including orange and yellow-green) <b>and</b> are associated <b>psychologically</b> with warmth <b>and</b> energy. Cool colors have more bluish undertones (including purples, aquas and greens) <b>and</b> are associated <b>psychologically</b> with serene, calm personalities. Warm colors tend to advance relative to cool colors, when both are presented simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Three {{students}} of an Austrian boarding school, Reiting, Beineberg and Törless, catch their classmate Basini stealing money {{from one of}} the three and decide to punish him themselves instead of turning him in to the school authorities. They start abusing him, first physically <b>and</b> then <b>psychologically</b> <b>and</b> sexually, while also blackmailing him by threatening to denounce him. Their abusive treatment of Basini becomes openly sexual and increasingly sadistic; nevertheless, he endures all the torture even when, after being deprived of any dignity, he is discredited by the entire class.|$|R

25|$|Problems {{caused by}} stress {{have become a}} major concern to both {{employers}} and employees. Symptoms of stress are manifested both physiologically <b>and</b> <b>psychologically.</b> Persistent stress can result in cardiovascular disease, sexual health problems, a weaker immune system and frequent headaches, stiff muscles, or backache. It can also result in poor coping skills, irritability, jumpiness, insecurity, exhaustion, and difficulty concentrating. Stress may also perpetuate or lead to binge eating, smoking, and alcohol consumption.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{period of}} {{residency}} in India {{can be very}} demanding, both physically <b>and</b> <b>psychologically.</b> The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (Mard) had filed a compliant with the Maharashtra Human Rights Commission (MHRC) regarding resident doctors being made to work for more than 30 hours at a stretch. There have been instances of doctor suicides due to stress and burnout. Premier Institutes have been criticised for lack of hygienic food supply to resident doctors and their shabby living conditions.|$|E

In Mr. Shandy's character,--the {{essence of}} which is a craving for sympathy in exact {{proportion}} to the oddity and unsympathizability of what he proposes;--this coupled with an instinctive desire to be at least disputed with, or rather both in one, to dispute and yet to agree--and holding as worst of all--to acquiesce without either resistance or sympathy. This is charmingly, indeed, profoundly conceived, <b>and</b> is <b>psychologically</b> <b>and</b> ethically true of all Mr. Shandies. Note, too, how the contrasts of character, which are always either balanced or remedied, increase the love between the brothers.|$|R

25|$|The {{first edition}} of The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce was {{published}} on 1 August 1643, and a revised edition followed on 2 February 1644. A second revision was published in 1645.

Although he originally sought only a legal separation from his wife, his research convinced {{him that he could}} convince the government to legalise divorce.|$|E
25|$|This affair instigated public {{discussion}} and was {{often referred to}} as 'scandalous'. Whether Lokhvitskaya and Balmont had ever been physically close, remained unclear. Some suggested they might have had a short affair in the early days; in the later years even in the geographical terms both were wide apart, with Balmont spending much of his time abroad. In his autobiography At the Dawn (На заре) he described their relationship as 'poetic friendship'. Modern literary historians consider their relationship to have been truly platonic affair, albeit violently passionate, frustrating <b>and</b> <b>psychologically</b> detrimental for both.|$|E

25|$|Only {{one of the}} crew, the Jesuit priest Emilio Sandoz, survives {{to return}} to Earth, and he is damaged {{physically}} <b>and</b> <b>psychologically.</b> The story is told in framed flashback, with chapters alternating between {{the story of the}} expedition and the story of Father Sandoz's interrogation by the Jesuit order's inquest, organized in 2059 to find the truth. Sandoz' return has sparked great controversy – not just because the Jesuits sent the mission independent of United Nations oversight, but also because the mission ended disastrously. Contact with the UN mission, which sent Sandoz back to Earth alone in the Jesuit ship, has since been lost.|$|E
25|$|The al-Fashir raid was {{a turning}} point, both militarily <b>and</b> <b>psychologically.</b> The armed forces had been humiliated by the raid, placing the {{government}} in a difficult strategic situation. The incompetent armed forces needed to be retrained and redeployed amid concerns about the loyalty of the many Darfurian non-commissioned officers and soldiers. Responsibility for prosecuting the war was given to Sudanese military intelligence. Nevertheless, in the middle months of 2003, rebels won 34 of 38 engagements. In May, the SLA destroyed a battalion at Kutum, killing 500 and taking 300 prisoners; in mid-July, 250 {{were killed in a}} second attack on Tine.

50|$|The {{conceptual}} {{beginnings of}} hegemonic masculinity represented the culturally idealized form of manhood that was socially and hierarchically exclusive and concerned with bread-winning; that was anxiety-provoking and differentiated (internally and hierarchically); that was brutal and violent, pseudo-natural <b>and</b> tough, <b>psychologically</b> contradictory, <b>and</b> thus crisis-prone; economically rich and socially sustained.|$|R

Despite these allegations, Rose stated she had loved her daughter, and held no knowledge of her murder. Further questioned as to the contradictory explanations she and Fred had given as to Heather's disappearance, Rose claimed these discrepancies had stemmed from telephone conversations she had had with Heather after the girl had left home.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of winning players {{is not to}} win every individual hand, but rather to make mathematically <b>and</b> <b>psychologically</b> better decisions regarding when {{and how much to}} bet, raise, call—or fold. By making such decisions to place influential bets, one can non-verbally represent or suggest holding or not-holding a certain or possible hand by either betting or not-betting pre-flop, and by venturing smaller or larger bets or raises at possibly more advantageous times, throughout the stages of the hand being dealt. One's pattern of betting may encourage opponents to bet or to fold (in this complex process, called bluffing), without verbalizing a discouraging or dishonest word. The winning poker players know how to enhance their opponents' betting and maximize their own expected gain on each round of betting, to thereby increase their long-term winnings.|$|E
25|$|Radakovich's {{style is}} a {{combination}} of Appropriation, Neo-Expressionism and Neo-Surrealism. In his paintings, he uses cryptic relationships, sexual scenarios <b>and</b> <b>psychologically</b> charged tableaux. His Surrealistic atmospheres, cartoon like drawing and appropriated Modigliani-like heads are painted in a linear but expressionist technique. The paintings are frontal and highly colored often evoking the space of Indian miniatures. The sculptural works often incorporate totem structures that stack body parts and biomorphic elements. Although inspired by primitive cultural forms, the totems are modern urban signposts containing the dramas of city life. Disrupted narratives beg the viewer to unravel the tale that is set before them. His paintings are filled with urban dramas where the participants struggle with the problems of modern life, often with comical results. The figures in his work are posed in psychologically ambiguous terms. The elongated heads are Icons of humans in a mechanized society grappling with the questions of desire and nature.|$|E
