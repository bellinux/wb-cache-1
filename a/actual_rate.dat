25|$|The rate {{of cooling}} {{has been shown to}} {{influence}} the frost resistance of tissues, but the <b>actual</b> <b>rate</b> of freezing will depend not only on the cooling rate, but also on the degree of supercooling and the properties of the tissue. Sakai (1979a) demonstrated ice segregation in shoot primordia of Alaskan white and black spruces when cooled slowly to 30nbsp&°C to -40nbsp&°C. These freeze-dehydrated buds survived immersion in liquid nitrogen when slowly rewarmed. Floral primordia responded similarly. Extraorgan freezing in the primordia accounts for the ability of the hardiest of the boreal conifers to survive winters in regions when air temperatures often fall to -50nbsp&°C or lower. The hardiness of the winter buds of such conifers is enhanced by the smallness of the buds, by the evolution of faster translocation of water, and an ability to tolerate intensive freeze dehydration. In boreal species of Picea and Pinus, the frost resistance of 1-year-old seedlings is on a par with mature plants, given similar states of dormancy.|$|E

The Corporate Travel Index survey, which is conducted annually by Corporate Travel Magazine {{in conjunction with}} Rochester Institute of Technology, is analyzed from an accuracy stand point. Forecasts in the hotel industry are important to many people. Business people and meeting planners must somehow be able to predict the coming hotel rates. Among other forecasts in the industry, Corporate Travel Index is helpful to use when setting travel policies and spending guidelines for the corning year. The Corporate Travel Index asked for predicted rates in the 1992 survey and in the 1993 survey the <b>actual</b> <b>rates</b> were asked for. This study identifies the gaps between predicted and <b>actual</b> <b>rates.</b> Differences are calculated and analyzed in Excel 4. 0 and SPSS. In order to see how significant the differences are and to decide if the Corporate Travel Index survey {{can be considered as}} accurate several t- tests were run in Minitab 8. 0 between the predicted and <b>actual</b> corporate <b>rates.</b> It can be concluded from the results of the statistical analysis that there is no significant differences (10 % or less) between the two rates. Therefore, it is concluded that the Corporate Travel Index can be considered as an accurate forecasting tool in the hotel industry...|$|R

[...] The unusual number of diagnoses after 1980, clustered around a small number of clinicians, and the suggestibility characteristic of those with DID, support the hypothesis that DID is therapist-induced. The unusual clustering of diagnoses has also been explained as due to a lack of awareness and training among clinicians to recognize cases of DID.|$|E
