In October 2007, Winehouse and Fielder-Civil were arrested in Bergen, Norway, for possession of seven grams of cannabis. The couple were later released and fined 3850 kroner (around £350). Winehouse first appealed the fines, but later dropped the appeal.|$|E
5|$|The two {{versions}} of Ernoul's chronicle tell different stories about John's ascent to the throne of Jerusalem. According to one version, the leading lords of Jerusalem sent envoys to France in 1208 asking Philip II to select a French nobleman <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> for their queen Maria. Taking {{advantage of the opportunity}} to rid himself of John, Philip II suggested him. In the other version an unnamed knight encouraged the Jerusalemite lords to select John, who accepted their offer with Philip's consent. John visited Pope Innocent III in Rome. The pope donated 40,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land, stipulating that John could spend the money only with the consent of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and the grand masters of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E

25|$|As {{the product}} of a morganatic marriage, and without {{succession}} rights to the throne, Francis was not acceptable <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> for princesses in most of the European royal houses. He further had little income in comparison with other European princes. He thus married into a richer family, by marrying his father's third cousin (in descent from King George II of Great Britain) Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, the younger daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, and a granddaughter of George III, who was known as 'Fat Mary' because of her wide girth. That, together with {{the fact that she was}} (by 1866) already in her thirties, meant that Mary Adelaide was also short of choices for marriage.|$|E

500|$|In 1563 Elizabeth {{proposed}} her own suitor, Robert Dudley, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> for Mary, {{without asking}} {{either of the}} two people concerned.

The marriage was {{the first of a series}} of errors of judgement by Mary that handed the victory to the Scottish Protestants and to Elizabeth. Darnley quickly became unpopular in Scotland and then infamous for presiding over the murder of Mary's Italian secretary David Rizzio. In February 1567, Darnley was murdered by conspirators almost certainly led by James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. Shortly afterwards, on 15 May 1567, Mary married Bothwell, arousing suspicions that she had been party to the murder of her husband. Elizabeth wrote to her: ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the thirteenth}} century, several {{offences}} against either one's lord, or one's king, were treasonable. [...] High treason, defined as transgressions against the sovereign, was first codified during King Edward III's reign by the Treason Act 1351. [...] It clarified exactly what crimes constituted treason, following earlier, somewhat [...] "over zealous" [...] interpretations of England's legal codes. [...] For instance, high treason could be committed by anyone found to be compassing the king's death or counterfeiting his coin. [...] High treason remained distinct though, from what became known as petty treason: the killing of a lawful superior, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> by his wife. [...] Though twelfth century contemporary authors made few attempts to differentiate between high treason and petty treason, enhanced punishments may indicate that the latter was treated more seriously than an ordinary felony.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Nimrod touches upon more {{reflective}} themes not present on earlier Green Day albums.

[...] On [...] "Walking Alone", he reflects on old friends from his childhood, and notes that he is [...] "too drunk to figure out they're fading away." [...] Armstrong discusses the struggle to stay sober on [...] "Hitchin' a Ride". [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] was inspired by Armstrong's failed relationship with a woman that ended when she joined the Peace Corps in 1990.

500|$|Madhavan's first {{release of}} 2001, Gautham Menon's directorial debut Minnale, opened to {{critical}} and commercial acclaim. Featuring a popular soundtrack by Harris Jayaraj and marketed as a Valentine's Day release, Minnale further {{built on the}} actor's image as a romantic hero and was later listed as a [...] "classic romantic film" [...] from the Tamil film industry. He then collaborated with Mani Ratnam {{for the second time}} by appearing in the director's production venture, the romantic comedy Dumm Dumm Dumm (2001), alongside Jyothika. Appearing as an unhappy groom trying to halt his wedding, the film won positive acclaim and became a commercial success, with Madhavan establishing himself as a bankable actor in South India. Madhavan then again appeared <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> in a tumultuous marriage in Parthale Paravasam (2001), the hundredth venture of veteran director K. Balachander. Despite featuring amongst an ensemble cast and being highly anticipated prior to release, the film failed at the box-office, with critics citing that Madhavan looked [...] "rather bored" [...] with the proceedings. Similarly his first lead role in a Hindi film, Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein (2001), a remake of his Minnale, was also unsuccessful at the box office, with the film and Madhavan's performance receiving mixed reviews. However, the film belatedly gained popularity through screenings on television and subsequently developed a cult following amongst young audiences.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year Affleck played a romantic lead in Terrence Malick's experimental drama To the Wonder. Malick, {{a close friend}} of Affleck's godfather, had first met with the actor in the 1990s to offer advice about the plot of Good Will Hunting. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian enjoyed [...] "a performance of dignity and sensitivity," [...] while The New Yorker 's Richard Brody described Affleck as [...] "a solid and muscular performer" [...] who [...] "conveys a sense of thoughtful and willful individuality". Affleck's performance as a poker boss was considered a highlight of the poorly-reviewed thriller Runner Runner (2013). Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times remarked that it was [...] "one killer of a character, and Affleck plays him like a Bach concerto—every note perfectly played." [...] Also in 2013, Affleck hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live for the fifth time since 2000, becoming a member of the Five Timers Club. He then pushed back production on his own directorial project to star <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> accused of murder in David Fincher's psychological thriller Gone Girl (2014). Fincher cast him partly because he understood {{what it felt like to}} be misrepresented by tabloid media: [...] "What many people don’t know is that he's crazy smart, but since he doesn’t want that to get awkward, he downplays it. I think he learned how to skate on charm." [...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine noted that Fincher's controlled style of directing had a [...] "remarkable" [...] effect on Affleck's acting: [...] "I never thought I’d write these words, but he carries the movie. He's terrific." [...] Justin Chang of Variety found Affleck [...] "perfectly cast": [...] "It's a tricky turn, requiring a measure of careful underplaying and emotional aloofness, and he nails it completely." [...] In 2015, Affleck and Damon's Project Greenlight was resurrected by HBO for one season.|$|E
500|$|Living {{more than}} one hundred years after Ivan Vladislav, the {{historian}} known as the Priest of Duklja, who wrote from a Dukljan perspective, was outraged by the murder of Jovan Vladimir, and wrote that after the Tsar died, he was [...] "forever connected with the angels of Satan". Many modern Bulgarian historians, including Vasil Zlatarski, also criticize the emperor, claiming that his actions hastened the fall of Bulgaria and that instead of raising the morale of the nation he turned into a murderer and was unable to cope with the intrigues and the corruption in court. Steven Runciman is also critical of the emperor, noting that his assassination of Gavril Radomir unleashed a general confusion where each noble started looking out for his own personal interests, but nevertheless credits him with [...] "a considerable ruthless energy". Jordan Andreev is more favourable to Ivan Vladislav, noting that he had reasons for his acts—he had to revenge the murder of his family according to the old Bulgarian pagan beliefs, but he only killed Gavril Radomir and his wife without harming the rest of Gavril Radomir's family. He had to cope with Jovan Vladimir who, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> of one of Samuel's daughters, was a threat to his position, and had also attempted a compromise with the Byzantines. According to Andreev, Ivan Vladislav's struggle to defend the Bulgarian state and his heroic death serve to mitigate his ill deeds. He cites a Byzantine historian who claimed that during Ivan Vladislav's reign the Byzantine state [...] "hanged in the balance, because that barbarian like Goliath resisted the Romans and they were all despaired by that invincible foe." [...] The Polish historian Kazimierz Zakrzewski also writes with sympathy for the last ruler of the First Empire, {{in light of the fact}} that Ivan Vladislav managed to sustain a guerilla war which he skilfully ran until his death.|$|E
