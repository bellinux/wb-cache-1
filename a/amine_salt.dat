5000|$|... 2,4-D is a {{synthetic}} auxin, {{which is a}} class of plant hormones. It is absorbed through the leaves and is translocated to the meristems of the plant. Uncontrolled, unsustainable growth ensues, causing stem curl-over, leaf withering, and eventual plant death. 2,4-D is typically applied as an <b>amine</b> <b>salt,</b> but more potent ester versions exist as well.|$|E
50|$|When 2,4-D was commercially {{released}} in 1946, it triggered a worldwide revolution in agricultural output {{and became the}} first successful selective herbicide. It allowed for greatly enhanced weed control in wheat, maize (corn), rice, and similar cereal grass crops, because it kills dicots (broadleaf plants), but not most monocots (grasses). The low cost of 2,4-D has led to continued usage today, and it {{remains one of the most}} commonly used herbicides in the world.

40|$|Polymeric {{electrolyte}} membranes that do {{not depend}} on water for conduction of protons are undergoing development for use in fuel cells. Prior polymeric electrolyte fuel-cell membranes (e. g., those that contain perfluorosulfonic acid) depend on water and must be limited to operation below a temperature of 125 C because they retain water poorly at higher temperatures. In contrast, the present developmental anhydrous membranes are expected to function well at temperatures up to 200 C. The developmental membranes exploit a hopping-and-reorganization proton- conduction process that can occur in the solid state in organic <b>amine</b> <b>salts</b> and {{is similar to a}} proton-conduction process in a liquid.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to design a {{compound}} transdermal patch containing diclofenac (DA) and teriflunomide (TEF) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The various organic <b>amines</b> <b>salts</b> of DA were prepared and their forming was confirmed using DSC and FTIR. The percutaneous permeation of organic <b>amines</b> <b>salt</b> of DA was investigated in vitro using a two-chamber diffusion cell with excised rabbit skin as transdermal barrier. The formulation of the patch was optimized in terms of the concentration of percutaneous permeation enhancer and the loading dose of drugs. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the optimal formulation was studies in rabbits and the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of the optimal patch were evaluated with the adjuvant arthritis model in rats and the pain model in mice, respectively. The result showed that skin penetration of diclofenac-triethylamine (DA-TEtA) salt was better than other organic <b>amine</b> <b>salts.</b> Based on previous study of our laboratory, teriflunomide-triethylamine (TEF-TEtA) significantly enhanced the skin permeation of TEF. 10 % of azone (AZ) was the best enhancer for the two drugs. The optimal patch formulation was composed of 2 % of TEF-TEtA, 6 % of DA-TEtA and 10 % of AZ. The cumulative permeated amount of DA-TEtA in vitro was comparable with that of the commercial diclofenac-diethylamine (DA-DEtA) patch. The absolute bioavailability of TEF-TEtA was 42 %, which could achieve the therapeutic drug levels. In animal study, the optimized compound patch containing DA-TEtA and TEF-TEtA displayed significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect, which indicated the potential of the compound patch...|$|R
50|$|In {{the basic}} reaction, 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic {{anhydride}} (MNBA) is primarily {{used as a}} dehydration condensation agent. First, the nucleophilic catalyst acts on the MNBA to produce activated acyl carboxylate. The reaction of carboxyl group in the carboxylic acid with the activated acyl carboxylate produces the corresponding MA, {{in the same manner}} as in the acidic reaction. Then, the nucleophilic catalyst acts selectively on a carbonyl group derived from the carboxylic acid in MA to again produce activated acyl carboxylate. The hydroxyl group in alcohol attacks its host molecule through intermolecular nucleophilic substitution, and at the same time, carboxylate anion, derived from 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic acid, acts as a deprotonation agent, promoting the progression of the esterification and producing the desired carboxylic ester. To balance the reaction, each MNBA accepts the atoms of one water molecule from its starting materials, changing itself into two molecules of the <b>amine</b> <b>salt</b> of 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic acid, and thus, terminating the reaction. Because the nucleophilic catalyst is reproduced at the end of the reaction, only small stoichiometric quantities are required.|$|E

40|$|Co-mixtures of {{chitosan}} (CS) and {{cellulose acetate}} (CA) were electrospun into fibrous webs from a binary co-solvent containing 70 : 30 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) : methylene chloride (DCM). Fibrous webs were produced from CS/CA in ratios (wt%) of 20 : 80, 40 : 60, 50 : 50 and 60 : 40. As determined by SEM analysis, 12 % polymer solutions of CS/CA 60 : 40 produced structures with uniform bead free fibre morphologies {{with an average}} fibre diameter of 458 nm.

40|$|Exfoliation {{through an}} ionic {{exchange}} reaction of layered silicate clays, including synthetic fluorinated mica (Mica) and natural montmorillonite (MMT), were achieved by using polyvalent <b>amine</b> <b>salts</b> as the intercalating agents. The requisite polyamine was synthesized from the epoxy/amine coupling reaction, involving a trifunctional poly(oxypropylene) -triamine (ca. 440 g/mol M(W)) and diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A. The polyamine was {{a mixture of}} oligomeric adducts consisting of multiple amine functionalities and a branched backbone. Partial acidification by HCl addition generated a series of <b>amine</b> <b>salts</b> that affected the intercalation and the expansion of the silicate interlayer in the range of 15. 2 - 60. 0 angstrom XRD d spacing. At the specific acidified ratio (H(+) /amine = 1 / 3 equiv ratio), the polyamine salts rendered the clay's layered structure into randomization. The result was confirmed by using XRD and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). The hybrids of polyamines and Mica or MMT were blended into epoxy resins and cured into nanocomposites, which exhibited the improvements of thermal stability and hardness. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The {{development of a}} chemical control measure to help {{prevent the spread of}} and eliminate these perennial weeds would be of inestimable value to the farmers of this state. The results reported in this study were obtained from an experiment designed to determine under field conditions the rapidity of breakdown of high rates of 2, 4 -D, with and without boron additions, applied to the soil at four intervals before planting a crop. The rapidity of breakdown of three herbicides applied to the soil at four intervals before planting a crop was studied. The activity of the herbicides in the soil was determined by the effect on stand, degree of stunting, height, and yield of corn. Studies to determine the necessary time lapse between the time of chemical application and safe planting date were conducted. Soil temperatures at three depths were recorded in an attempt to establish a relationship between breakdown of herbicides, soil temperatures, and biological activity.

40|$|Layer-by-layer (LbL) {{assembly}} is {{a promising}} technique for depositing multi-functional thin films from dilute aqueous solutions. These films have found use as environmentally-benign flame retardants, replacing halogenated flame retardants, and as flexible gas barrier thin films, replacing vacuum-deposited inorganic oxide thin films. Unfortunately, LbL assembly has drawbacks {{that have not}} been adequately addressed, such as stiffening of coated substrates and the high number of deposition steps required. Thin films of chitosan and poly(sodium phosphate) were deposited on cotton fabric via LbL assembly to reduce flammability. The fabric was rinsed in an ultrasonication bath between deposition steps to improve the softness (i. e., hand) of the coated fabric.
