5|$|In 1985, {{almost no}} {{country in the}} world had a women's {{national}} football team. Djibouti was no exception: women's football was not officially organised in the country until 2002 and then, only for players sixteen years and older. As of 2009, there were only eight women's clubs for these players in the country. There is a regional and national women's competition, which was established in 2007. The league provided the first opportunity for women outside the capital and major cities to play football. The country has a women's national team but has no youth teams, meaning no U17 or U20 teams. 12% of the money from the FIFA Financial <b>Assistance</b> <b>Programme</b> (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This compares to 11% specifically set aside for men's competitions and 10% set aside for youth football. Between 1991 and 2010, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching. A FUTURO III regional course men's coaching workshop was hosted in 2008. In 2007, there was a women's football seminar held in the country. In 2007, there was a FIFA MA course held for women/youth football.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few days}} after the {{hurricane}} passed, the Grenada Emergency Operations Center temporarily prevented relief supplies from entering the country to ensure the safety of the incoming items; the decision was reversed shortly thereafter, and planes flew supplies during daylight hours into the reopened airport. Severe looting occurred in the immediate aftermath of Ivan, prompting police officials to enact a curfew for the night hours. In the first week following the hurricane, aid was slow to the affected residents, due to the lack of an efficient aid distribution system. 30official shelters and 17prepared ones housed over 5,000people in the aftermath of the storm. Thousands of people lost their jobs due to the hurricane, with all businesses shut down following the hurricane. By two months after the hurricane struck, 65schools were opened, some of which serving as shelters; water and power were gradually restored to the island. By a year after the storm's passage, all schools were reopened, and most buildings enacted provisional repairs. Officials determined around 10,000houses on the island required complete reconstruction, while a further 22,000 needed repairs. The government of Grenada initially planned to rebuild 1,000houses in the year after the hurricane struck; by June 2005, 260families were provided houses, with a further 85under construction. The government also established a Material <b>Assistance</b> <b>Programme,</b> which provided $5,000 (2004XCD) of free materials to more than 5,000families, as well as a total of $4.3million (2004XCD) in low interest loans to 148families. Several indirect fatalities occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane, primarily senior citizens.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, the Government of Indonesia has {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> intended {{to improve the lives of}} the poor and help them escape poverty. Many of these programmes are now operating at a national scale and cover millions of Indonesians. Using a new household survey dataset that covers the eastern areas of Indonesia (Indonesian Family Life Survey East 2012), this paper investigates the household-level determinants of access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> The analysis reveals that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> are relatively more available in poorer provinces and that poorer households—all things being equal—are more likely to access social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> than nonpoor households, which suggests that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in eastern Indonesia are successful in their efforts to target the poor (poverty targeting), both across regions and households. However, poverty targeting still has scope for improvement in terms of accuracy. Besides the poverty status (as measured in per capita consumption expenditures), the authors found that several other factors infl uence programme access. Having a disabled household member or having a household head who is a widow(er) appears to increase the likelihood of receiving social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Likewise, the level of trust and confl ict in a community affects access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Particularly in the case of Raskin, we found that the programme is distributed more widely among those communities that are characterized by higher levels of confl ict and lower levels of trust. The authors did not fi nd that poor access to infrastructure and remoteness infl uences household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> once they controlled for province fi xed effects in the regression framework. Furthermore, the fi ndings suggest that possession of a local ‘poverty letter’ strongly improves household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> even after controlling for a wide set of socioeconomic characteristics. In general, determinants of programme access differ signifi cantly among provinces and between rural and urban areas...|$|R

25|$|To assist young farmers, {{the role}} of the SAFER (Societe d'Amenagemcnt Foncier et d'Etablissement Rural) was {{extended}} in 1982 to give preferential aid to this group to enlarge their holdings. Various measures were also introduced that helped to boost farmers’ incomes. A partial price freeze instituted in June 1982 helped to limit the increase in production costs, while an income <b>assistance</b> <b>programme</b> (introduced in 1982 to compensate for a decline in farmers’ incomes in 1981) contributed to a reduction in sectoral inequalities. In addition, an EEC price hike which the government negotiated in May 1982 represented an improvement over that of the previous year (11.2% compared with 10.3%). Consultative channels between farmers and government were also widened beyond the Federation Nationale des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles (or FNSEA, the chief farming syndicat). In addition, the Mauroy Government had helped in the establishment of 12,000 farms with young farmers by mid-1983.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the army}} has been poorly trained; however Australia has {{recently}} made this {{the focus of the}} Enhanced Defence Partnership programme, supplying training, advisors and equipment. New Zealand is also contributing training assistance under its Mutual <b>Assistance</b> <b>Programme.</b> Equally army personnel have in the past trained with the French in New Caledonia, while US Special Forces have occasionally undertaken joint exercises in PNG. At present, however, over 90 per cent of the budget is dedicated to pay and retrenchments, and as a consequence there is little left to fund training exercises. While most soldiers are not currently formally qualified for their rank, there are determined moves to professionalise the army after the restructure is complete. Indeed, {{the army has}} an officer training academy and a small trade training capacity, which is being boosted by Australian personnel. A small number of officer candidates also undertake training at the Royal Military College – Duntroon, in Canberra. Australian procedures are followed as a matter of course, and their influence is increasing as more joint training exercises are held.|$|E

40|$|Social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been}} noted {{as one of the}} {{important}} keys to determining the success of the recovery process in the aftermath a disaster. It has also been shown that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster, significantly contribute to the recovery phase of disaster management, by utilizing the communities? capacity to facilitate community recovery from a disaster. Through the community recovery framework, social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> with active collaboration and interaction between the community and the social assistants, can speed up community recovery efforts; contributing to the disaster recovery management. The Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2009 and Regulation of the Ministry of Social of the Republic of Indonesia Number 82 of 2006 set out and guide the social assistance delivery to the community. However, most of the literature addressing social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> following a disaster in Indonesia, is from the government?s perspective, the legislation outlook and the social assistants? point of view. Little is known about the benefit and practice of the social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> from the perspectives of the affected community. Therefore, the current study sought to address this gap by exploring the experiences of social assistance within the affected community following a disaster. With this knowledge, the government, NGOs, private sectors and other parties would gain insights, inputs and recommendations from the affected community, to whom the programmes were delivered, so that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster may be made more effective. A qualitative study was conducted in Kinahrejo hamlet, the most affected community from the 2010 Mount Merapi eruption. Data was analysed using qualitative descriptive methodology via open-ended and close-ended questions with 10 participants. The study explored whether the lived experiences of the Kinahrejo community was congruent with Indonesian regulation regarding social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> This study has contributed to the field of research on social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster by providing findings on the importance of the mentioned programmes toward the affected community from the community?s experiences and perspectives...|$|R

Commonwealth membership was held to have lapsed until 1997, after discriminatory provisions in the republican constitution were repealed and reapplication for membership made. Fiji has since been suspended twice, with the first imposed from 6 June 2000 to 20 December 2001 after another coup. Fiji was suspended yet again in December 2006, following the most recent coup.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effects of {{government}} <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> on internationalization of SMEs from an Asian developing nation. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data from a sample of 203 SMEs in three export-oriented industries in Bangladesh were analyzed using structural equations model to examine both direct and indirect causal effects of government assistance on their internationalization. Findings - Results suggest that the usage of market development-related government assistance significantly influence internationalization directly as well as indirectly via other determinants, whereas finance- and guarantee-related assistance has only indirect effect. Practical implications - Government export <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> play an important role in the SMEs' internationalization process by contributing to a number of firm- and management-related factors that determine international marketing performance of a firm. The study provides a guideline for SME managers as to how they can benefit from both categories of export <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in improving their positive attitudes towards the export market environment, building their knowledge and enhancing commitment to exporting for better success in their international operations. Originality/value - The importance of export <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> is well recognized in the literature but its causal effect on internationalization of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is low. The paper tries to fill this gap by reporting the results of an empirical study examining effects of government <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> on internationalization of SMEs from an Asian developing nation, where there is a gross dearth of research.
