40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the flow of}} information within financial conglomerates by focusing on the effect that the lending behavior of <b>affiliated</b> <b>banks</b> has on the portfolio choice of the mutual funds belonging to the same conglomerate. We entertain two alternative hypotheses: either mutual funds are used to help the overall policy of the conglomerate of which they are part or they exploit the privileged inside information available to the <b>affiliated</b> <b>bank.</b> We find evidence for the latter. We show that the funds of the conglomerate increase their stakes in the firms that borrow from the <b>affiliated</b> <b>banks</b> in the period following the deal. No analogous finding is there for the unaffiliated funds. Using net-of-style returns, we show that this strategy enhances fund performance, on average, by 15 bps per month (1. 8 % per year) relative to that of unaffiliated funds in the post-deal era. Funds increase (decrease) their portfolio weights in those borrowing stocks which subsequently provide positive (negative) abnormal returns, suggesting that they exploit inside information not available to the market...|$|R

40|$|I {{document}} {{evidence that}} a <b>bank</b> <b>affiliated</b> with a multi-bank holding company (MBHC) is significantly safer than either a stand-alone bank or a <b>bank</b> <b>affiliated</b> with a one-bank holding company. Not only does MBHC affiliation reduce the probability of future financial distress, but distressed <b>affiliated</b> <b>banks</b> {{are also more likely}} to receive capital injections, recover more quickly, and are less likely to fail over the next year. Moreover, the measured benefits of affiliation are much larger than those that existed before recent reforms of bank holding company regulation, suggesting that much of the observed benefit can be attributed to regulation and not the market.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} whether Japanese <b>banks</b> <b>affiliated</b> with <b>bank</b> holding companies are {{more efficient and}} profitable than independent banks. The present paper tests this hypothesis by using both a stochastic frontier approach and a market valuation approach. First, our results suggest that <b>banks</b> <b>affiliated</b> with <b>bank</b> holding companies are not more cost-efficient than are independent banks. Because of the brief history of Japanese BHCs, {{it is fair to}} conclude that the formation of regional bank holding companies has not achieved efficiency gains so far. Second, we find that <b>banks</b> <b>affiliated</b> with <b>bank</b> holding companies are more profit-efficient than are independent banks. This is particularly apparent when the establishment of the bank holding companies increases market power in regional markets. This supports the Financial Services Agency’s policy to increase the profitability of regional banks through bank consolidation. Finally, based on standard event study methodology, we find that the market did not regard news about the establishment of bank holding companies as significant events.

40|$|I present {{evidence}} that the cross-guarantee authority granted to the FDIC by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 has unexpectedly strengthened the Federal Reserve's source-of-strength doctrine. In particular, I find that a <b>bank</b> <b>affiliated</b> with a multi-bank holding company is significantly safer than either a stand-alone bank or a <b>bank</b> <b>affiliated</b> with a one-bank holding company. Not only does affiliation reduce the probability of future financial distress, but distressed <b>affiliated</b> <b>banks</b> {{are more likely to}} receive capital injections and recover more quickly than other banks. Moreover, the effects of affiliation are strengthened for an expanding bank holding company. However, the effects of affiliation are weakened when the parent has less than full ownership of the subsidiary. Most interestingly, my results show that these differences in behavior across affiliation did not exist before 1989, when the cross-guarantee authority was introduced.

40|$|We {{study how}} {{information}} flows within financial conglomerates {{by analyzing the}} relations between mutual funds and banks that {{belong to the same}} financial group. We investigate the effect that the lending behavior of <b>affiliated</b> <b>banks</b> has on the portfolio choice of the mutual funds {{that are part of the}} same group. We show that funds (fund families) increase their stakes in the firms that borrow from their <b>affiliated</b> <b>banks</b> in the period following the deal by far greater amounts than other unaffiliated funds (fund families). We provide evidence that this strategy is information-driven. The performance of the positions of affiliated funds in the stocks of borrowing firms exceeds that of their other positions in nonborrowing stocks located in the same industry as well as that of other stocks having similar characteristics by up to 1. 6 % per month. Funds increase (decrease) their stock holdings in those borrowing stocks that subsequently provide positive (negative) abnormal returns, suggesting that they exploit privileged inside information not available to other market participants. This behavior is prevalent largely in funds located in close geographic proximity to their lending banks. Furthermore, it is exhibited mostly by young, small, and poorly performing fund families. Our evidence points to information flows within conglomerates through informal channels such as personal acquaintances. ...|$|R
