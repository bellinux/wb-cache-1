500|$|Consistent with Bolkovac's account, The Whistleblower portrays DynCorp International {{employees}} {{as participants in}} the postwar Bosnian sex trade with the UN turning a blind eye. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This {{is not going to}} be simple or a quick fix." [...] She said that in addition to Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would [...] "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", she worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact: [...] "I know we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." [...] Following the theatrical release of The Whistleblower, The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E

60|$|There {{was once}} a fine gentleman whose entire worldly {{possessions}} consisted of a boot-jack and a hair-brush; {{but he had the}} most beautiful shirt-collar in the world, and it is about this that we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a story.|$|E

Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] Richard {{declared}} exultantly. [...] "She {{knows what}} my duty is, and, Hunterleys, I {{am going to}} try and do it. The people over there may need a lot of convincing, but they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the truth from me and have it drummed into them. It's going to be 'Wake up, America!' as well as 'Wake up, England!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite! Now listen," [...] I said. [...] "To-night we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Isobel's history. We {{are going}} to know who she is, and all about her. Stay with us, and you shall share the knowledge. As for the rest, you have been talking like a fool. We {{do not wish to}} take you seriously. We took up the charge of Isobel jointly. If the time has come now for us to give her up, I should like us all to be in agreement. It is very likely that the time has come. I, too, think that in many ways it would be for her benefit. We are {{prepared}} to give her up when we know the proper people to undertake the care of her--but never, Arthur, to Lady Delahaye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Anne gently. She did {{not know}} who [...] "lost Margaret" [...] was, but {{she felt that she}} <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the romance of Captain Jim's life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{what she}} says to him," [...] said Peggy resolutely.

Come on, Mary." ...|$|R
6000|$|John Gayther {{smiled with}} approbation. He felt sure he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a story <b>to</b> his liking. The captain smoked steadily. As {{he had been}} advised, he would wait until he felt firm ground beneath him before he made any further remarks. As for the Mistress of the House, {{she looked at her}} daughter, and wondered. The story continued: ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{they went}} {{together}} to a castle {{which was about}} a league from the city, accompanied by all their particular friends, to whom they gave a grand banquet, and the three brothers promised to be friends always, to share whatever good fortune befell them, {{and not to be}} parted by any envy or jealousy; and so they set out, agreeing to meet at the same castle at the appointed time, to present themselves before the King together. Each one took a different road, and the two eldest met with many adventures; but it is about the youngest that you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> He was young, and gay, and handsome, and knew everything that a prince ought to know; and as for his courage, there was simply no end to it.|$|E
60|$|Of course, I {{know that}} the man who never made a mistake in poor Arthur's time {{is not likely to be}} always making {{mistakes}} now. But I have written by this post to Wills, to go to him and investigate. I have also detached Berry from here, and have sent him on by train at a few minutes' notice to Edinburgh, and then to Glasgow (where I have no doubt everything is wrong too). Glasgow we may save; Edinburgh I hold to be irretrievably damaged. If it can be picked up at all, it can only be at the loss of the two first nights, and by the expenditure of no end of spirits and force. And this is the harder, because it is impossible not to see that the last readings polished and prepared the audiences in general, and that I have not to work them up in any place where I have been before, but that they start with a London intelligence, and with a respect and preparation for what they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b>|$|E
60|$|After this {{there was}} a pause of a few minutes, the stage was cleared and Baroni, in a loose great-coat, {{appeared}} at its side with a violin. He played a few bars, then turning to the audience, said with the same contemptuous expression, which always distinguished him when he addressed them, 'Now you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a scene from a tragedy of the great Racine, one of the greatest tragedy writers that ever existed, if you may never have heard him; but if you were at Paris, and went to the great theatre, you would find that what I am telling you is true.' And Josephine advanced, warmly cheered by the spectators, who thought {{that they were going to}} have some more tumbling. She advanced, however, as Andromache. It seemed to Sidonia that he had never listened to a voice more rich and passionate, to an elocution more complete; he gazed with admiration on her lightning glance and all the tumult of her noble brow. As she finished, he applauded her with vehemence. He was standing near to her father leaning against the wall.|$|E
5000|$|With {{his wife}} Sharon, George Runner founded the Desert Christian Schools."We wanted {{a school for}} not only {{everyone}} else's children, but for our own children, where we knew they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about God in an exciting way; a place where their faith was not just some parallel subject matter, but was integrated effectively throughout history, math, science and English." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 9th Wonder didn't {{create the}} mix {{with a view}} to {{generate}} a buzz or promote his skills saying, [...] "I didn't even think anybody <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it". When asked by HitQuarters what inspired the remix he said: [...] "I think all of us at one point want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Nas on something different.

5000|$|Atria also {{launched}} Enliven Books in 2015, {{an imprint}} launched from author and tea entrepreneur, Zhena Muzyka, {{and focused on}} publishing spiritual and wellness books. Muzyka runs the publishing imprint from a yurt in Ojai, California. Muzkya reported to Publisher's Weekly that the name for the imprint {{was the result of}} a phone call with her mother. Her mother told her, [...] "As soon as you hang up the phone you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a word in your head." [...] Muzkya said that the first word she heard was Enliven which means [...] "to add color, to uplift." ...|$|E
60|$|Bradley walked {{straight}} {{away into the}} country. He wanted to be alone. It seemed so strange and sweet to be thus shaken by the coming of a woman. In {{the first few minutes}} he gave himself up to the thought that she was near and that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her speak again. It made his hand shake and his heart beat quick.|$|R
60|$|She sat quite still, {{looking down}} upon the flaring lights. She {{was filled with a}} restless desire to escape, to start the motor herself and rush through the wet air into London and safety. And side by side with that desire she knew that {{there was nothing in the}} world she wanted so much as to stay just where she was, and <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> just the words she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} episode, the host {{instructed}} all outcasts {{to go to}} the isolation booth claiming that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a piece of information about one of the contestants. The Outcasts were Anna and Kamran. When in the isolation room they found that there was not actually any information and subsequently were given the choice by the host that they either told the contestants nothing or told them what had happened.|$|R
5000|$|Beam Me Up Scotty {{was well}} {{received}} by critics and fans alike receiving an average score of 78. MTV's Mixtape Daily chose Beam Me Up Scotty as its weekly pick on May 4, 2009, giving the album positive reviews: [...] "Yeah, you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{a bunch of}} more-than-just-friendly shout-outs to the ladies - Nicki says she loves the girls and has no problem surrounding herself with [...] "bad bitches." [...] Mixtape Daily favored tracks such as [...] "I Get Crazy (feat. Lil Wayne)", [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] & [...] "Envy". Beam Me Up Scotty is credited with helping distinguish Nicki Minaj as an excellent lyricist in a male-dominated genre.|$|E
5000|$|Fedorov's first record, Never Over, was {{released}} in July 2011. The initial release is an EP with six original songs, written or co-written by Fedorov. His single, which is called [...] "You’re Perfect" [...] {{was released}} on June 29, 2011. He said [...] "When people hear it they won’t expect to hear what they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> What people remember me doing on American Idol was ballads, {{but it has been}} 6 years and my voice has gotten deeper and has developed a lot of color and a lot of strength. I am really excited to introduce this part of myself. I would say my journey begins on June 29th when we release the single. My record will be released sometime in July, but we will start with the single first. I am really excited about it all." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2015, Wale {{spoke about}} how it is his most {{personal}} album, saying: [...] "It's super personal. It's like a journal that my whole lifestyle is based around. Before, with my music, I was like the point guard with all the handles. Now I'm just taking it straight to the cup. I'm not moon walking to get from point A to point B. I'm running from point A and through point B. You guys <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> what I'm saying. I'm {{going to be as}} transparent as I can be." [...] He also spoke about Jerry Seinfeld's role on the album, saying: [...] "He's the narrator. He's essentially like my conscience. You can look at him as kind of explaining what's happening if you get lost during the story. He'll come in and give you an update." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maybe he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the news. Maybe the Politburo {{had decided}} to throw in the sponge. Too bad it had taken so long. Six years.

The Soviet guided missiles, whistling through the air. The chain bombs. And now this, the robots, the claws-- ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{smiled a}} smile of joy, held up her hand, and thanked her brother. Her father {{scarcely}} lifted his head, her mother made a rigid curtsey, and with a grim look of sorrow coming over her features, laid {{her hand over the}} old Baron's shoulder. [...] "Come away, Herr Vater," [...] she said; [...] "he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her confession, and make her too holy for the like of us to touch." ...|$|R

5000|$|Some producers, like James Komack, however, {{followed}} Lear's approach. Komack, who {{was involved}} in the short-lived sitcom Hennesey starring Jackie Cooper, was a longtime critic of the Douglass laugh track, believing the laughs were too predictable and could hinder the effect of the sitcom's humor. Komack instead employed music to counteract the sweetened laughs. He experimented with this technique in The Courtship of Eddie's Father (ABC, 1969-72), which featured a subdued laugh track. Multi-camera shows produced by Komack, such as Chico and the Man (NBC, 1974-78) and Welcome Back, Kotter (ABC, 1975-79), utilized background music cues during scene transitions (obvious locations for sweetening) and made sure that Douglass' laugh track was used infrequently during post-production. Komack later commented, [...] "If you ever try to do a show without a laugh track, you'll see a huge difference...It flattens. The only way to get away from a laugh track is to use music, which can indicate when something is funny." [...] On sweetening, he continued, [...] "Then it's determined by the taste of the producers - by the morality of the producers...After a while, you learn that it is valueless. In the extremes, people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it and say, 'Why are they laughing?' and they'll turn off your program." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kesha {{has said}} the songs are {{inspired}} by her experiences during her tours. In contrast to her first record which featured music described by the singer as [...] "very brash and very sassy and very unapologetic and irreverent", she says the second album makes a lyrical departure and explores a more vulnerable side in its lyrics. She explained: [...] "I have learned {{over the past three}} years of doing this that being vulnerable doesn't mean you're weak. I very much want to be seen as a strong woman, but I realize that vulnerability can also be a strength. So on my next record, you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> probably a little more of that." [...] Kesha commented, in an interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "The first two records talked more about partying, which is a great, magical part of life, but some songs on the new record are more personal and vulnerable. And you can hear more of the music I listen to when I'm lying in my bed. I'm not claiming that it's a rock record - but as long as it's fucking good, you can call it whatever you want." [...] Co-written by her mother, Pebe Sebert, the song titled [...] "Gold Trans Am" [...] doubles as a metaphor for her vagina and alludes to her actual automobile. Of the song, Kesha said: [...] "It began as a song about my car, which is a gold Trans Am, and it works about 40 per cent of the time. I don't have another car because I love that one so much. But then like all great pop it became a metaphor for something else - my pussy." ...|$|E

And he saw an old room he knew well in England, and Persis Leigh in it, holding out her hands to him and looking glad and happy. So he knew he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> good news of her." ...|$|R
