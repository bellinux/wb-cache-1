5|$|Miranda's mom {{is invited}} {{to appear on the}} $20,000 Pyramid. In hopes of winning the money and having a better life, Miranda and her mom's boyfriend Richard prep her for the show. Miranda and Sal are friends again. While her mother is on-stage, Miranda reminisces about a {{conversation}} with Marcus about how no one would recognize a time-traveler from a different age. She suddenly realizes that the laughing man is an older incarnation of Marcus, who has come from the future to save Sal's life. He needed to deliver the notes to the young Marcus through Miranda. Later on Miranda goes to the mailbox the laughing man (Marcus) slept under, where she finds <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> older version of Julia smiling happily. The novel ends as Miranda reflects on the events in an epilogue.|$|E
5|$|Mulder is {{summoned to}} a meeting with Richard Matheson, a U.S. senator who is a patron for his work. Matheson directs Mulder to Arecibo, assuring the agent that {{he will try to}} hold off a Blue Beret UFO {{retrieval}} team said to be headed there in twenty-four hours. Mulder arrives at the Survey station, where he finds a frightened Puerto Rican man, Jorge, who draws <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alien that he claims to have seen. Meanwhile, Scully, unaware of Mulder's whereabouts, tries to find him. Reviewing a list of flights from Washington, Scully tracks Mulder down to Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot {{for the single}} by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, respectively. Hernandez's version opens with busy streets and the dawn of Los Angeles, California. Hamasaki begins singing the song {{on top of a}} skyscraper, whilst several intercut scenes of people walking around Los Angeles during a time lapse are shown. She is then seen {{painting}} <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unidentified man, who raps Verbal's part. It then shows intercut scenes of traffic, a carosuel and couple standing near a bridge. Several parts of these scenes are revised throughout the entire video, which ends with Hamasaki again on top of the skyscraper. For Yokoyama's video, only shots featuring Verbal were only filmed, alongside scenes of him walking through a city in Japan, and residing in a neon-lit club. Parts of Hernandez's version, with the scenes of Hamasaki painting a man and scenes of Los Angeles city and public, were removed in order to merge the first video and Verbal's appearance together. This version premiered one week before the album's release on July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} use of conscription, the compulsory recruitment of soldiers' sons, the relaxation of age and height requirements and the branding of recruits all add up to <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> army that had severe difficulties in finding, and retaining, sufficient recruits. Recruitment difficulties are confirmed in the legal code evidence: there are measures to deal with cases of self-mutilation to avoid military service (such as cutting off a thumb), including an extreme decree of 386 requiring such persons to be burnt alive. Desertion was clearly a serious problem, and was probably much worse than in {{the army of the}} Principate, since the latter was mainly a volunteer army. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} granting of leave of absence (commeatus) was more strictly regulated. While in the 2nd century, a soldier's leave was granted at the discretion of his regimental commander, in the 4th century, leave could only be granted by a far senior officer (dux, comes or magister militum). In addition, it appears that comitatus units were typically one-third understrength. The massive disparity between official and actual strength is powerful evidence of recruitment problems. Against this, Elton argues that the late army did not have serious recruitment problems, on the basis of the large numbers of exemptions from conscription that were granted.|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} in the carnivorous family Streptaxidae was undoubtedly raised by Dolf’s prolonged stay in South Africa, quite possibly inspired by Matthew William Kemble Connolly’s (1939) impressive monograph on the South African non-marine Mollusca, in which <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extremely diverse and aesthetically appealing streptaxid radiation was painted. In all, he described three new genera and 60 new species and subspecies of Streptaxidae, all but four from Africa.|$|E

25|$|In higher education, {{linguistic}} profiling {{has been found}} to impede student comprehension. In a 1992 study, D. Rubin found that undergraduate university students would comprehend material more poorly if they heard a non-accented lecture presented with <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Asian female. When the same non-accented lecture was presented with a European American teaching assistant, students had a greater ability to comprehend the material. This suggests that face identification may be enough to make students believe that language performance will be accented, which corresponded with a belief that comprehension would be reduced.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, {{when the}} club was founded, the emblem of Ajax was just <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Ajax player. The crest was {{slightly}} altered following the club's promotion to the top division in 1911 to match the club's new outfits. In 1928, the club logo was introduced {{with the head of}} the Greek hero Ajax. The logo was once again changed in 1990 into an abstract version of the previous one. The new logo still sports the portrait of Ajax, but drawn with just 11 lines, symbolizing the 11 players of a football team.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} legends, {{similar to those}} told of Alexander the Great, were told of Seleucus. It was said Antiochus told his son before he left to battle the Persians with Alexander that his real father was {{actually}} the god Apollo. The god had left a ring with <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anchor {{as a gift to}} Laodice. Seleucus had a birthmark shaped like an anchor. It was told that Seleucus' sons and grandsons also had similar birthmarks. The story is similar to the one told about Alexander. Most likely the story is merely propaganda by Seleucus, who presumably invented the story to present himself as the natural successor of Alexander.|$|E

500|$|Homer {{began to}} study music, and was allowed to help Timothy clerk at the store the elder Davenport {{purchased}} when he first moved to Silverton. Timothy required Homer to milk the cows, but otherwise Homer was to [...] "study faces and draw." [...] He was well-liked by the villagers, but they considered him shiftless—they did not consider drawing to be real work. He exhibited a love of animals, especially fast horses and fighting cocks. [...] Davenport later wrote that his fascination with Arabian horses was reawakened in his adolescent years with his admiration of <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Arabian-type horse found on an empty can of horse liniment. He carefully cleaned the can and kept it as his [...] "only piece of artistic furniture" [...] for many years until forced to leave it behind {{when he moved to}} San Francisco. [...] He also played in the community band in his formative years, and with that group young Davenport once traveled as far as Portland.|$|E
500|$|The Primitives renamed itself Uncle Tupelo after a {{character}} in a cartoon drawn by Chuck Wagner, a friend of the band's members. The name was created by combining two randomly chosen words from the dictionary; inspired by the name, Wagner drew <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old, fat Elvis. The trio recorded a four-song demo tape, which won them supporting roles at the concerts of artists such as Johnny Thunders and Warren Zevon. Tweedy met Tony Margherita while [...] as a record clerk in St. Louis. After attending a pair of the band's concerts, Margherita offered to become its manager. Uncle Tupelo began to play regular shows at Cicero's Basement—a bar close to the campus of Washington University. Bands playing in a similar style, including Brian Henneman's Chicken Truck, often played at the venue, which by late 1988 was considered to have been the origin of a new music scene. The band temporarily expanded to a four-piece with the addition of the guitarist Alex Mutrux, but soon reverted to a trio.|$|E
500|$|Foliot {{was well}} known as a letter writer, and his letters were later {{collected}} as a book. The main manuscript for this collection, now held at the Bodleian Library, {{is supposed to have}} originated in Foliot's own writing office. About 250 to 300examples of Foliot's letters have survived, which together with his surviving charters gives a total of almost 500items. The collection was printed in a modern edition edited by Adrian Morey and Christopher N. L. Brooke and published by the Cambridge University Press in 1967, under the title of The Letters and Charters of Gilbert Foliot. Some of the letters have appeared in volumes five through eight of Materials for the History of Thomas Becket, from the Rolls Series, published from 1875–1885. Older editions appeared in the Patres ecclesiae Anglicanae series from the 1840s, and in Migne's Patrologica from 1854. The letters cover most of the period of Foliot's public life, and are one of the main sources for the history of that period. The historian David Knowles said of the collection that [...] "owing to its wealth of personal and local detail [...] is of the greatest value for the church historian". According to Knowles, Foliot's letters paint <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> active bishop and ecclesiastical leader who supported the Gregorian church reforms but did not meddle in politics beyond those of the church. His letters are typical of the educated letter writer of his time, refined and polished to an art form.|$|E
