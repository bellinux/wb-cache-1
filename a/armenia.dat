For instance, Armenians from <b>Armenia</b> might know Russian, those from Lebanon and Syria may know Arabic and French, almost all Iranian Armenians speak Persian and Istanbul Armenians speak Turkish.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{two years}} after the Republic of <b>Armenia</b> was established, on 23 April 1920, the United States officially {{recognized}} it. Its frontiers were to be determined later. On 26 April 1920, the Supreme Council of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers in Paris (British Prime Minister Lloyd George, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and Italian Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti) requested that the United States accept the mandate over <b>Armenia</b> and to make an Arbitral Decision to determine the boundaries of <b>Armenia</b> with Turkey. President Woodrow Wilson agreed to act as arbitrator and draw a mutually acceptable border between the two nations. In July 1920, the US State Department founded the Committee upon the Arbitration of the Boundary between Turkey and <b>Armenia,</b> headed by William Westermann. The Treaty of Sèvres was signed on 10 August 1920. On 28 September 1920, the Committee submitted a report that defined the border between <b>Armenia</b> and Turkey. It guaranteed access to the Mediterranean sea for <b>Armenia</b> via Trebizond and proclaimed Turkey's border regions demilitarization frontier line.|$|E

President Serj Sargsyan announced the decision after talks with his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The treaty enlarging the EEU to <b>Armenia</b> was signed on 9 October 2014. <b>Armenia</b> {{is the only country}} of the EEU that has no common border with the other member states of the union. Georgia guaranteed a free transit corridor for exporting its goods to the Eurasian Economic Union, Armenian deputy economy minister Emil Tarasyan said.|$|E
5|$|<b>Armenia</b> {{declared}} its independence on September 21, 1991 after the unsuccessful coup attempt in Moscow by the CPSU hardliners. Greece {{became the first}} country to recognize the newly minted Armenian nation a few days later. Tensions between <b>Armenia</b> and Azerbaijan continued to escalate, ultimately leading to {{the outbreak of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh War. Despite a cease-fire in place since 1994, <b>Armenia</b> has yet to resolve its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. The Soviet Union itself ceased to exist on December 26, 1991 and <b>Armenia</b> became an sovereign independent state in the international stage. The United States recognized Armenia's independence a day before.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{collapse}} of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and Muslim leaders of the Caucasus united to create the Transcaucasian Federation in the winter of 1918. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had drastic consequences for the Armenians: Turkish forces reoccupied Western <b>Armenia.</b> The federation lasted for only three months, eventually leading to the proclamation of the Republics of <b>Armenia,</b> Georgia, and Azerbaijan.

5|$|By 1991, most Armenians from Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis from <b>Armenia</b> {{were forced}} to move to their {{respective}} countries, as remaining in their homes became nearly impossible. Although <b>Armenia</b> had proclaimed its independence from the Soviet Union on 23 August 1990, {{it was not until}} on 21 September 1991, a month after the failed August Coup in Moscow, when the overwhelming majority of Armenians voted for the independence in a nationwide referendum. Levon Ter-Petrosyan, the leader of the Karabakh Committee {{and the head of the}} Supreme Council since 1990, was elected president of <b>Armenia</b> in October.|$|E
5|$|Despite his mixed legacy, Sargsyan is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} as a national hero {{across the political spectrum}} and by the public. Given the honorific Sparapet, he made significant contributions to the establishment of <b>Armenia</b> as independent state and ensuring its security as the founder of the Armenian Army. He has also been criticized by human rights organizations for being undemocratic, especially for his role in elections. Sargsyan was awarded the highest titles of <b>Armenia</b> and Nagorno-Karabakh—National Hero of <b>Armenia</b> and Hero of Artsakh.|$|E

5|$|Experts {{estimate}} {{that with the}} accession of <b>Armenia,</b> the internationally unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic would not {{be integrated into the}} Eurasian Union. <b>Armenia</b> is a permanent political, military and economic ally of Russia, whereas Azerbaijan holds close ties with the west. The Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed concern in 2013 that no reliable customs border between <b>Armenia</b> and Nagorno-Karabakh could be drawn. However, Nazarbayev expressed that he holds all the existing disagreements preventing Armenia's integration into Eurasian Economic Union are surmountable. The Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Armenian Parliament, Artak Zakarian, announced on 14 May 2014 that <b>Armenia</b> will build no customs border including the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} stages of World War I, Andranik {{commanded}} the first Armenian volunteer battalion within the Russian Imperial army against the Ottoman Empire, capturing and later governing much of the traditional Armenian homeland. After the Revolution of 1917, the Russian army retreated and left the Armenian irregulars outnumbered against the Turks. Andranik led the defense of Erzurum in early 1918, but was forced to retreat eastward. By May 1918, Turkish forces stood near Yerevanthe future Armenian capitaland were halted at the Battle of Sardarabad. The Dashnak-dominated Armenian National Council declared the independence of <b>Armenia</b> and signed the Treaty of Batum with the Ottoman Empire, by which <b>Armenia</b> gave up its rights to Western <b>Armenia.</b> Andranik never accepted the existence of the First Republic of <b>Armenia</b> because it included {{only a small part of}} the area many Armenians hoped to make independent. Andranik, independently from the Republic of <b>Armenia,</b> fought in Zangezur against the Azerbaijani and Turkish armies and helped to keep it within <b>Armenia.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1828, Persian <b>Armenia</b> was {{annexed to}} the Russian Empire {{after the last}} Russo-Persian War, and became known as Russian <b>Armenia.</b> When the Russian Empire collapsed, Russian <b>Armenia</b> {{declared}} its independence and joined the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, together with Georgia and Azerbaijan. This unified state hardly lasted a year and was soon dissolved. Since the Republic was short-lived, it did not use any flags or symbols. Nevertheless, some historians consider a horizontal gold, black, and red tricolor, {{similar to that of}} the German flag but arranged differently, to have been the flag of Transcaucasia. The federation was dissolved on May 26, 1918, when Georgia declared its independence as the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Both <b>Armenia</b> and Azerbaijan declared their independence two days later, on May 28, 1918, as the First Republic of <b>Armenia</b> and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, respectively.|$|E
