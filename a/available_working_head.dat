40|$|Dynamics of {{vibration}} devices, which elements or units {{interact with}} {{liquid or air}} medium, is studied. Two types of vibration devices are considered. The first one is a vibration machine with constant air or liquid flow excitation.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the power and <b>working</b> <b>heads</b> of Kaplan turbines {{it is necessary to}} avoid any low local pressures round the blades. The problem is similar to that encountered in high-speed aerofoil design, and the possibility of using similar methods to evolve blade sections for Ihplan turbines is explored in the paper. A general survey for those unacquainted with recent developments in aerofoil design is given, which is intended to demonstrate the advantages of the use of profiles with specific velocity distributions and to illustrate the general methods by which they may be derived. A brief summary is made of methods of designing aerofoils in cascade to allow for blade interference and a few examples are quoted from British and American practice. Introduction. The last twenty years have seen such progress in the performance of Kaplan turbines that now the main field for improvement is no longer in increasing efficiency but rather in reducing the size of individual units and in raising the <b>working</b> <b>heads.</b> Already Kaplan turbines have ousted Franci...|$|R
