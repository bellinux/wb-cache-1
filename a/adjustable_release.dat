40|$|The {{delivery}} kinetics {{of growth}} factors {{has been suggested}} {{to play an important}} role in the regeneration of peripheral nerves following axotomy. In this context, we designed a nerve conduit (NC) with <b>adjustable</b> <b>release</b> kinetics of nerve growth factor (NGF). A multi-ply system was designed where NC consisting of a polyelectrolyte alginate/chitosan complex was coated with layers of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) to control the release of embedded NGF. Prior to assessing the in vitro NGF release from NC, various release test media, with and without stabilizers for NGF, were evaluated to ensure adequate quantification of NGF by ELISA. Citrate (pH 5. 0) and acetate (pH 5. 5) buffered saline solutions containing 0. 05 % Tween 20 yielded the most reliable results for ELISA active NGF. The in vitro release experiments revealed that the best results in terms of reproducibility and release control were achieved when the NGF was embedded between two PLGA layers and the ends of the NC tightly sealed by the PLGA coatings. The release kinetics could be efficiently adjusted by accommodating NGF at different radial locations within the NC. A sustained release of bioactive NGF in the low nanogram per day range was obtained for at least 15 days. In conclusion, the developed multi-ply NGF loaded NC is considered a suitable candidate for future implantation studies to gain insight into the relationship between local growth factor availability and nerve regeneration...|$|E

40|$|Biodegradable {{microspheres}} (MS) {{consisting of}} poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) represent a promising alternative to conventional adjuvants. The <b>adjustable</b> pulsatile <b>release</b> of encapsulated material from such MS {{offers the potential}} to mimic the priming and boosting injections of conventional immunization regimens. In this paper, we demonstrate that MS can serve as antigen reservoirs in antigen presenting cells (APC), so that antigen is presented for {{extended periods of time}} (up to 9 days). In particular, we could show by measurement of IFN-gamma production that encapsulated peptides were presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) by mouse and human macrophages as well as by human dendritic cells in vitro for a longer time period as compared to soluble peptides. The extended antigen presentation may thus improve the CTL response in vivo. These results may be of paramount importance in cancer vaccination therapy since MS may serve as antigen reservoirs to extend the presentation time by APC used to boost the patient's immune response to tumor antigens...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} laminar smoke points of candle flames is presented. A smoke {{point is the}} flame length just {{before the onset of}} visible smoke <b>release.</b> <b>Adjustable</b> wicks with diameters of 2 - 7. 6 mm were used to measure smoke points in quiescent air for 14 different waxes. The measured smoke points varied from 36 - 89 mm and increased with wick diameter. Smoke points fitted to a wick diameter of 4 mm increased from consumer-grade waxes (candelilla, carnauba, beeswax, paraffin) to alkanes (hexatriacontane, octacosane, tetracosane) to alcohols (octadecanol, docosanol, hexadecanol) to acids (stearic, palmitic, lauric, myristic). Within each wax family, a decrease in carbon number yielded an increased smoke point. Soot emission was not possible for any fuel when the wick diameter was below 1. 8 mm or when wick length was below 6 mm. The results suggest new ways of producing cleaner burning candles...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogels {{comprising}} natural {{extracellular matrix}} (ECM) components are very attractive as scaffolds for regenerative medicine applications {{due to their}} inherent biointeractive properties. Responsive materials that adapt to their surrounding environments and regulate transport of ions and bioactive molecules manifest significant advantages for biomedical applications. Although there are many exciting challenges, the opportunity to design, fabricate and engineer stimuli-responsive polymeric systems based on ECM components is particularly attractive for regenerative medicine. Here we describe a one-pot approach to fabricate in situ fast gellable intelligent ECM mimetic scaffolds, based on methacrylated collagen building blocks with mechanical properties that can be modulated in the kPa-MPa range and that are suitable for both soft and hard tissues. Physiochemical characterizations demonstrate their temperature and pH responsiveness, together with the structural and enzymatic resistance that make them suitable scaffolds for long-term use in regenerative medicine and biomedical applications. The multifunctionality of these hydrogels has been demonstrated as an in situ depot-forming delivery platform for the <b>adjustable</b> controlled <b>release</b> of proteins and small drug molecules under physiological conditions and as a structural support for adhesion, proliferation and metabolic activities of human cells. The results presented herein should be useful to the design and fabrication of tailor-made scaffolds with tunable properties that retain and exhibit sustained release of growth factors for promoting tissue regeneration.

40|$|Borneol, {{one of the}} {{commonly}} used Chinese medicines, {{can be used to}} treat many diseases. The main ingredient of natural borneol is d-borneol extracted from the volatile oil of dipterocarp trees. Numerous studies have proved the effectiveness of borneol. It has been widely used in relieving symptoms of anxiety, fatigue and insomnia; inducing anaesthesia and analgesia to alleviate abdominal pain, wounds and burns; relieving rheumatic pain, hemorrhoids, skin diseases and ulcerations of the mouth, ears, eyes or nose; treating sore throats and skin infections; and is mainly used to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Although borneol has a significant therapeutic effect, its easy sublimation and low water absorbability make it difficult to control the efficiency of delivery and decrease its function in connecting to various applications in the needs of modern society. Electrospun nanofiber has been commonly used as a delivery vehicle for various medicines for biomedical applications. Poly(L-lactic acid) and cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) nano-fibrous nonwoven membranes were electrospun and used as drug carriers for borneol. To load borneol into a PLLA/CAB composite membrane, borneol/acetone solution was sprayed on PLLA/CAB fibers. While part of the CAB was dissolved by acetone, borneol was combined with CAB by hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl and carbanyl groups. PLLA still kept a porous morphology of the whole drug-loaded membrane since it does dissolve in acetone. This structure provided a high quality and stable drug delivery system. With <b>adjustable</b> drug <b>release</b> properties, PLLA/CAB nano-fibrous composite nonwoven membranes can be alternative candidates for developing novel external medical textiles.

40|$|FDM 3 D {{printing}} {{has been}} recently attracted increasing research efforts towards {{the production of}} personalized solid oral formulations. However, commercially available FDM printers are extremely limited {{with regards to the}} materials that can be processed to few types of thermoplastic polymers, which often may not be pharmaceutically approved materials nor ideal for optimizing dosage form performance of poor soluble compounds. This study explored the use of polymer blends as a formulation strategy to overcome this processability issue and to provide <b>adjustable</b> drug <b>release</b> rates from the printed dispersions. Solid dispersions of felodipine, the model drug, were successfully fabricated using FDM 3 D printing with polymer blends of PEG, PEO and Tween 80 with either Eudragit E PO or Soluplus. As PVA is one of most widely used polymers in FDM 3 D printing, a PVA based solid dispersion was used as a benchmark to compare the polymer blend systems to in terms processability. The polymer blends exhibited excellent printability and were suitable for processing using a commercially available FDM 3 D printer. With 10 % drug loading, all characterization data indicated that the model drug was molecularly dispersed in the matrices. During in vitro dissolution testing, {{it was clear that the}} disintegration behavior of the formulations significantly influenced the rates of drug release. Eudragit EPO based blend dispersions showed bulk disintegration; whereas the Soluplus based blends showed the ‘peeling’ style disintegration of strip-by-strip. The results indicated that interplay of the miscibility between excipients in the blends, the solubility of the materials in the dissolution media and the degree of fusion between the printed strips during FDM process can be used to manipulate the drug release rate of the dispersions. This brings new insight into the design principles of controlled release formulations using FDM 3 D printing...|$|R
40|$|Enhanced bone tissue {{regeneration}} {{and improved}} osseointegration {{are among the}} most important goals in design of multifunctional orthopedic biomaterials. In this study, we used additive manufacturing (selective laser melting) to develop multifunctional porous nitinol that combines superelasticity with a rationally designed microarchitecture and biofunctionalized surface. The rational design based on triply periodic minimal surfaces aimed to properly adjust the pore size, increase the surface area (thereby amplifying the effects of surface biofunctionalization), and resemble the curvature characteristics of trabecular bone. The surface of additively manufactured (AM) porous nitinol was biofunctionalized using polydopamine-immobilized rhBMP 2 for better control of the release kinetics. The actual morphological properties of porous nitinol measured by microcomputed tomography (e. g., open/close porosity, and surface area) closely matched the design values. The superelasticity originated from the austenite phase formed in the nitinol porous structure at room temperature. Polydopamine and rhBMP 2 signature peaks were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy tests. The release of rhBMP 2 continued until 28 days. The early time and long-term release profiles were found to be adjustable independent of each other. In vitro cell culture showed improved cell attachment, cell proliferation, cell morphology (spreading, spindle-like shape), and cell coverage as well as elevated levels of ALP activity and increased calcium content for biofunctionalized surfaces as compared to as-manufactured specimens. The demonstrated functionalities of porous nitinol {{could be used as a}} basis for deployable orthopedic implants with rationally designed microarchitectures that maximize bone tissue regeneration performance by release of biomolecules with <b>adjustable</b> and well-controlled <b>release</b> profiles...|$|R
