5|$|Behind Volage and Danaé, the Venetian Corona {{had engaged}} Cerberus {{in a close}} range duel, during which Cerberus took heavy damage but inflicted similar {{injuries}} on the Italian ship. This exchange continued until the arrival of Active caused the Danaé, Corona and Carolina to sheer off and retreat to the east. To the rear, <b>Amphion</b> succeeded in closing with and raking Flore, and caused such damage that within five minutes the French ship's officers threw the French colours overboard in surrender. Captain Péridier had been seriously wounded in the action, and took no part in Flores later movements. <b>Amphion</b> then attacked Bellona and in an engagement that lasted until 12:00, forced the Italian ship's surrender. During this combat, the small ship Principessa Augusta fired on <b>Amphion</b> from a distance, until the frigate was able to turn a gun on them and drive them off. Hoste sent a punt to take possession of Bellona but due to the damage suffered was unable to launch a boat to seize Flore. Realising Amphion's difficulty, the officers of Flore, who had made hasty repairs during the conflict between <b>Amphion</b> and Bellona, immediately set sail for the French harbour on Lesina (Hvar), despite having already surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Ordered {{as part of}} the 1910 Naval Programme, <b>Amphion</b> {{was laid}} down at Pembroke Dockyard's No. 5 Slipway on 15 March 1911 and {{launched}} on 4 December by Mrs. Mundy, wife of the dockyard's Captain-Superintendent, Captain Geoffrey Mundy. She was completed in March 1913 and her first commander was Captain Frederic Dreyer with Lieutenant John Tovey as his First Lieutenant. <b>Amphion</b> was commissioned on 2 April and assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron of the First Fleet. A month later, the ship was assigned to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron by 18 May. She remained with the squadron for nearly a year and was serving as the flotilla leader of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla by 18 June 1914.|$|E
5|$|All three {{ships were}} {{initially}} assigned to various squadrons in the First Fleet {{and then became}} flotilla leaders in mid-1914. When the war began in August, <b>Amphion</b> and Fearless and their flotillas (the 3rd and 1st Destroyer Flotillas (DF), respectively) {{were part of the}} Harwich Force. The morning after Britain joined the war, the force sortied on a patrol to the Dutch coast. The 3rd DF encountered and sank a German minelayer, SMS Königin Luise, but not before she had laid many of her mines. While returning home the following morning, <b>Amphion</b> accidentally struck a mine on 6 August off the Thames Estuary and sank with the loss of 132 crewmen killed. She was the first ship of the Royal Navy to be sunk in the First World War. The wreck site is protected and may not be dived upon without permission from the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5|$|Thrown into further {{confusion}} by {{the loss}} of Favorite, the French and Venetian formation began to break up and the British squadron was able to pull ahead of their opponents; the leading French ships Flore and Bellona succeeded in only reaching <b>Amphion,</b> which was now {{at the rear of the}} British line. <b>Amphion</b> found herself caught between the two frigates and this slowed the British line enough that the French eastern division, led by Danaé, was able to strike at HMS Volage, now the leading British ship after overtaking Cerberus during the turn. Volage was much smaller than her opponent but was armed with 32-pounder carronades, short range guns that caused such damage to Danaé that the French ship was forced to haul off and reengage from a longer range. The strain of combat at this greater distance ruptured Volage's short-ranged carronades and left the ship much weakened, with only a single gun with which to engage the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} action, Sir Edward Pellew {{moved to the}} large frigate HMS Indefatigable while his brother was given command of the frigate HMS <b>Amphion.</b> Both served with distinction: Sir Edward {{captured}} several more frigates and destroyed the French ship of the line Droits de l'Homme at the Action of 13 January 1797, ending the war {{as commander in chief}} in the Mediterranean. Israel was most noted for capturing the French flagship Bucentaure at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 while in command of HMS Conqueror.|$|E
5|$|Between 1761 and 1790, 14-15 turumas were built, {{including}} <b>Amphion,</b> {{a modified}} version used by King Gustav III as both a pleasure craft and command ship. The turuma was among the heaviest in the arsenal of the archipelago fleet {{and a number of}} them served in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. It had three masts, two decks and was equipped with 16–22 pairs of oars along with a crew of about 220–260. Its length was 35–39m, width 9m and the draft 3,3m. The armament consisted of 24–28 heavy guns with up to 24 swivel guns for close-quarter combat.|$|E
5|$|The British {{presence}} in the Adriatic was greatly strengthened in 1809 {{with the arrival of}} the frigates HMS <b>Amphion</b> under William Hoste and HMS Belle Poule under James Brisbane. These reinforcements made an immediate impact with a series of raids in the Dalmatian and Ionian islands. In February Belle Poule captured the Var off Valona; the French responded by despatching the frigates Danaé and Flore from Toulon. HMS Topaze attacked these frigates as they arrived, but were able to reach Corfu before sailing north to augment French defences in the Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Dubourdieu, Captain Péridier on Flore ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The {{battered}} Favorite led with an attempt to round <b>Amphion</b> and rake her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention. The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers {{to bear on the}} British squadron. Hoste was prepared for this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to wear, turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised. Favorite, which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.|$|E
5|$|Hoste also {{remained}} at sea, cruising in the battered <b>Amphion</b> beyond {{the range of}} the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of Flore's officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender. In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of Flore had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which a ship that voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of life among its crew. Flore had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron only because she was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act. The French at Lesina did not respond to Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining a close line of battle, Hoste forced Dubourdieu {{to attack}} him directly, Dubourdieu {{attempting}} to personally board Hoste's <b>Amphion</b> {{at the head}} of the Italian soldiers carried aboard his flagship. Hoste responded to the attempt with fire at point blank range from a carronade containing over 750 musket balls. The first shot killed Dubourdieu and almost all of his officers, creating confusion in the French squadron that resulted in Favorite being wrecked on Lissa's coastline. Hoste then engaged the following Flore and Bellone, forcing them both to surrender. The head of the British line, led by the HMS Volage engaged the three remaining French and Italian ships, driving off Danaé and Carolina and capturing Corona. Flore too later escaped to the safety of French batteries off Lesina.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the year}} British attacks intensified, driven by Hoste's <b>Amphion</b> {{operating}} from Lissa. Raids on the Italian coastline seized dozens of coastal merchant vessels and gunboats while parties of marines and sailors landed at coastal towns, driving off the defenders and blowing up the fortifications {{before returning to}} their ships. These successes {{in the face of}} negligible French opposition encouraged the British commander in the Mediterranean, Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, to detail a force specifically to eliminate the French garrisons on the Ionian Islands. This expedition, led at sea by Brigadier-General John Oswald from HMS Warrior succeeded in landing on the island of Cefalonia on October 1 and forcing the Neapolitan garrison to surrender within hours. Within days the neighbouring islands of Zante and Ithaca had also surrendered and the detached frigate HMS Spartan under Jahleel Brenton effected a successful invasion of Cerigo shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In the Bibliotheca, the Arcadian genealogies are {{immediately}} {{followed by the}} Atlantids, and this progression is known to mirror {{the structure of the}} Catalogue because other fragments of the papyrus roll that transmits the Telephus myth cover families of Atlas' daughters: Taygete, Electra, Alcyone, Sterope, Celaeno, Maia and Merope. Maia bore Hermes to Zeus on Mount Cyllene. Taygete also slept with Zeus, becoming the mother of Lacedaemon, through whom much of the Spartan line was traced, including Tyndareos, the father of Helen, and Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. To Zeus yet again Electra bore Dardanus, the progenitor of the Trojan line, and Eetion, who was killed for sleeping with Demeter. Dardanus' sons were Erichthonius and Ilus. Hyrieus and Hyperes were Poseidon's children by Alcyone. Her section included the Ehoie of Hyrieus' daughter Antiope, who bore <b>Amphion</b> and Zethus to Zeus. Hyperes' daughter Arethusa slept with Poseidon and was changed to a spring in Euboea, but not before bearing Abas, the eponym of the Abantes. His line is traced down to Elephenor, leader of the Abantes in the Trojan War. Sterope lay with Ares and bore Oenomaus, but it is possible that this union was delayed to book four as part of the section treating the family of Pelops and Oenomaus' daughter Hippodameia.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of 1913, Tovey was posted to HMS Vivid (the naval barracks at Devonport) for trials of HMS <b>Amphion</b> and {{subsequently}} served on <b>Amphion</b> from 2 April 1913. He was promoted to lieutenant-commander on 15 July 1914.|$|E

25|$|Tovey {{continued}} {{to serve on}} <b>Amphion</b> as its first lieutenant until she was mined and sunk on 6 August 1914 (the first British warship to be sunk in the First World War). He was subsequently posted to the destroyer HMS Faulknor.|$|E
25|$|During her Royal Navy career, <b>Amphion</b> saw {{service in}} the Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean {{as part of the}} North America and West Indies Station. The cruiser also saw service as {{flagship}} of the Africa Station.|$|E
25|$|A Queen of Thebes {{and wife}} of <b>Amphion,</b> Niobe boasted of her superiority to Leto because {{while she had}} {{fourteen}} children (Niobids), seven boys and seven girls, Leto had only one of each. When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and Artemis shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl. <b>Amphion,</b> {{at the sight of}} his dead sons, killed himself. A devastated Niobe and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept. The gods themselves entombed them.|$|E
25|$|Sutton and the <b>Amphion</b> {{remained}} with Nelson's fleet into 1805, and {{took part in}} the Trafalgar Campaign, chasing Villeneuve's forces to the West Indies and back. Sutton was in poor health by the time the fleet returned to anchor off Lisbon in October, and Nelson sent Sutton ashore to recuperate, replacing him with William Hoste as commander of <b>Amphion.</b> Sutton was rich from the prize money of the captured Spanish ships, and appears to have retired ashore, never serving at sea again. He served as a magistrate and a deputy lieutenant for the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, and was promoted to rear-admiral on 19 July 1821. Samuel Sutton died at Ditchingham, Norfolk in June 1832 at the age of 72.|$|E
25|$|This cruiser {{was laid}} down as HMS <b>Amphion</b> for the Royal Navy at Portsmouth Dockyard on 26 June 1933. She was {{launched}} by the Marchioness of Titchfield on 27 July 1934, commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 June 1936, and completed on 6 July 1936.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, <b>Amphion</b> {{was sold}} to the RAN: she was renamed HMAS Perth on 10 July 1939 by Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, and was {{commissioned}} into service in the RAN on 29 June 1939. Perth was the last cruiser-type warship ever acquired by the RAN.|$|E
25|$|On 29 September 1810, {{the newly}} arrived French frigates Favorite, under Bernard Dubourdieu, and Uranie joined the Venetian {{squadron}} of Corona, Bellona, and Carolina. The force then sailed from Chiozzo to Ancona, arriving on 6 October, having sighted Hoste's <b>Amphion</b> {{in the distance}} during the passage.|$|E
25|$|On the 6th Stuart {{captured}} one-half {{battalion of}} Poles at Monteleone di Calabria. The next day, Captain Edward Fellowes of HMS Apollo (38) accepted {{the surrender of}} 370 Poles at Tropea Castle. On 9 July, 632 French troops at Reggio capitulated to General Broderick's 1,200 Anglo-Sicilians and Captain William Hoste in HMS <b>Amphion</b> (32). Broderick's force landed south of the town at 7:00 AM. Bombarded from the sea and attacked from the land, the garrison sent out a white flag that evening. Scilla Castle held out until 24 July when its 231-man garrison from the 23rd Light surrendered to Oswald's 2,600 soldiers. Oswald's command consisted of the 10th Foot, 21st Foot, and the Chasseurs Britanniques. On 28 July, Colonel Macleod's 78th Foot and Hoste's <b>Amphion</b> captured 500 men of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Polish-Italian Legion at Cotrone. Stuart's main body reached Reggio on 23 July. After placing garrisons in Reggio and Scilla, Stuart's troops quit the mainland as Smith's ships transported them to Sicily.|$|E
25|$|HMAS Perth was a {{modified}} Leander-class light cruiser {{operated by the}} Royal Australian Navy (RAN) during {{the early part of}} World War II. She was constructed for the Royal Navy, where she was commissioned as HMS <b>Amphion</b> in 1936. After several years on the North America and West Indies Station, the cruiser was transferred to the RAN in 1939 and recommissioned as HMAS Perth.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to {{lieutenant}} on 22 December 1842, Key {{was posted}} to the fifth-rate HMS Curacoa on the South America Station. In February 1844 {{he transferred to}} the steam frigate HMS Gorgon and was in acting command of the schooner HMS Fanny at the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado in November 1845 during the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata. Promoted to commander on 18 November 1845, he was given command of the paddle sloop HMS Bulldog in the Mediterranean Fleet in May 1847. Promoted to captain on 11 October 1850, he then took command of the steam frigate HMS <b>Amphion</b> in November 1853 and saw service in the Crimean War. In May 1854, HMS <b>Amphion</b> and the steam screw frigate HMS Conflict captured the town of Liepāja, a town of some 10,000 inhabitants, in Latvia without a shot being fired. He also took part at the Battle of Bomarsund in August 1854 and the Bombardment of Sveaborg in August 1855. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 5 July 1855.|$|E
25|$|Courland {{passed to}} {{the control of the}} Russian Empire in 1795 during the third Partition of Poland and was {{organized}} as the Courland Governorate of Russia. Growth during the nineteenth century was rapid. During the Crimean War, when the British Royal Navy was blockading Russian Baltic ports, the busy yet still unfortified port of Libau was briefly captured on 17 May 1854 without a shot being fired, by a landing party of 110 men from HMS Conflict and HMS <b>Amphion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Promoted to commodore, Bowles became Commander-in-Chief, South America Station, {{with his}} broad pennant in the fifth-rate HMS <b>Amphion,</b> in 1816 {{and then became}} {{commanding}} officer of the yacht HMY William & Mary early in 1822 {{before moving on to}} be Comptroller-General of the Coast Guard in July 1822. In a paper published in 1830 entitled Remarks on the Conduct of the Naval Administration of Great Britain he argued for the introduction of steam warships {{and the creation of a}} gunnery school: the latter ambition was realised with the formation of HMS Excellent later that year. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 12 April 1839.|$|E
25|$|With {{the success}} of the brewing {{industry}} and the presence of the els, another wave of European immigrants settled in the neighborhood. Also, parts of Bushwick became affluent. Brewery owners and doctors commissioned mansions along Bushwick and Irving Avenues {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. New York mayor John Francis Hylan kept a townhouse on Bushwick Avenue during this period. Bushwick homes were designed in the Italianate, Neo Greco, Romanesque Revival, and Queen Anne styles by well-known architects. Bushwick was a center of culture, with several Vaudeville-era playhouses, including the <b>Amphion</b> Theatre, the nation's first theatre with electric lighting. The wealth of the neighborhood peaked between World War I and World War II, even when events such as Prohibition and the Great Depression were taking place. After World War I, the German enclave was steadily replaced by a significant proportion of Italian Americans. By 1950, Bushwick was one of New York City's largest Italian American neighborhoods, although some German Americans remained.|$|E
25|$|Mary Lefkowitz has criticised this research. She {{suggests}} {{that some of the}} research was done not to determine the reliability of the dating method, as was suggested, but to back up an assumption of age and to make certain points about pyramids and Greek civilization. She notes that not only are the results not very precise, but that other structures mentioned in the research are not in fact pyramids, e.g. a tomb alleged to be the tomb of <b>Amphion</b> and Zethus near Thebes, a structure at Stylidha (Thessaly) which is just a long wall, etc. She also notes the possibility that the stones that were dated might have been recycled from earlier constructions. She also notes that earlier research from the 1930s, confirmed in the 1980s by Fracchia was ignored. She argues that they undertook their research using a novel and previously untested methodology in order to confirm a predetermined theory about the age of these structures.|$|E
500|$|In 1777, Chapman {{designed}} a special turuma, the royal yacht <b>Amphion.</b> It was 33.5m (110ft) long and 6.8m (22.25ft) wide and was schooner-rigged {{with only two}} masts (later changed to a brigantine rig). Chapman intended for the craft to carry a broadside armament {{similar to that of}} the regular turumas, but this was rejected by Gustav who ordered the craft to be built with an armament consisting of only light swivel guns. <b>Amphion</b> was decorated in the more stringent version of Rococo that in Sweden is defined as [...] "Gustavian", and was fitted with a great cabin with a skylight that was well-suited for royal audiences and conferences. <b>Amphion</b> served as Gustav III's staff ship in the war of 1788–90, but was such a poor sailer that the king and his retinue abandoned it during the dramatic escape from Vyborg Bay in 1790.|$|E
500|$|HMS <b>Amphion</b> was an [...] scout cruiser {{built for}} the Royal Navy before the First World War. Completed in 1913, she was {{initially}} assigned to the First Fleet and became a destroyer flotilla leader in mid-1914. When the war began, her flotilla {{was assigned to the}} Harwich Force. While patrolling on the first full day of the war, <b>Amphion</b> and her destroyers encountered and sank a German minelayer, SMS Königin Luise, but not before she had laid many of her mines. While returning from patrolling the following morning, <b>Amphion</b> accidentally struck a mine on 6 August 1914 off the Thames Estuary and sank with the loss of 132 crewmen killed. She was the first ship of the Royal Navy to be sunk in the First World War. The wreck site is protected and may not be dived upon without permission from the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
500|$|By {{the start}} of the First World War in August, <b>Amphion</b> and her {{flotilla}} was assigned to the Harwich Force, defending the eastern approaches to the English Channel, under the command of Captain Cecil H. Fox. In the morning of 5 August, <b>Amphion</b> and the 3rd Flotilla sortied into the North Sea to patrol the area between Harwich and the Dutch island of Terschelling for German activity. At 10:15 a ship in the black, buff, and yellow colours of the Great Eastern Railway's steamers that plied between Harwich and the Hook of Holland was spotted. Fox sent the destroyers [...] and [...] to investigate and shortly afterwards another destroyer reported that a trawler had seen a suspicious ship, 'throwing things overboard, presumably mines'. <b>Amphion</b> led the flotilla to investigate and observed that the fleeing ship was deploying mines even then. At 10:45, Lance opened fire at a range of [...]|$|E
500|$|At 06:35, <b>Amphion</b> {{struck a}} mine that detonated {{underneath}} her bridge. The explosion set her forecastle {{on fire and}} broke the ship's keel. The destroyer [...] attempted to tow the cruiser, but a deep crack across her upper deck showed that she was hogging badly and Fox ordered his crew to abandon ship. Shortly afterwards, her forward magazine exploded, throwing one 4-inch gun into the air that narrowly missed Linnet. One of Amphions shells burst {{on the deck of}} the destroyer , killing two of her men and the only German prisoner rescued from the cruiser. <b>Amphion</b> then rapidly sank within 15 minutes of the explosion losing 1 officer and 131 ratings killed in the sinking, plus an unknown number of the crew rescued from Königin Luise. The wreck is a protected site under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.|$|E
500|$|Fourteen {{or fifteen}} turumas were {{built for the}} Swedish {{archipelago}} fleet. All vessels except <b>Amphion</b> are listed below along with the basic information to the extent it has been recorded. Specifications that are identical to vessels listed directly abov are marked with a dash. Three [...] "shebecks" [...] were also built for the Russian Baltic fleet in 1788–89 that were based directly on the turumas rather than the Mediterranean xebecs.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} three hours the squadrons {{continued}} to close, light winds restricting them to a little over three knots. A protege of Nelson, Hoste recalled the inspirational effect of Nelson's signal before the Battle of Trafalgar and raised his own: [...] "Remember Nelson", which was greeted with wild cheering from the squadron. As he closed with Hoste's force, Dubourdieu realised {{that he would be}} unable to successfully cross Active's bow due to the British ship's speed, and would also be unable to break through their line due to the British ships' close proximity to one another. He instead sought to attack the second ship in the British line, Hoste's flagship HMS <b>Amphion.</b> Dubourdieu possessed not only a significant advantage in ships but also in men, the Italian soldiers aboard giving him the opportunity to overwhelm the British crews if he could board their frigates successfully. The first shots of the battle were fired at 09:00, as the British used their wider field of fire to attack the leading French ships, Favorite and Danaé, unopposed for several minutes. The French squadron held their fire, Dubourdieu gathering his troops and sailors into Favorites bow in order to maximise the effect of his initial attack once his flagship came into contact with <b>Amphion.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Active-class {{ships were}} the last class of turbine-powered scout cruisers ordered by the Admiralty. These ships were {{intended}} to work with destroyer flotillas, leading their torpedo attacks and backing them up when attacked by other destroyers, although they quickly became less useful as destroyer speeds increased before the First World War. <b>Amphion</b> had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of [...] and a draught of [...] She displaced [...] at normal load and [...] at deep load.
