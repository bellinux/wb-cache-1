5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever <b>and</b> <b>sore</b> throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

25|$|Scurvy is {{a disease}} {{resulting}} {{from a lack of}} vitamin C. Early symptoms include weakness, feeling tired, <b>and</b> <b>sore</b> arms and legs. Without treatment, decreased red blood cells, gum disease, changes to hair, and bleeding from the skin may occur. As scurvy worsens there can be poor wound healing, personality changes, and finally death from infection or bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Including fish as {{a regular}} part of a {{balanced}} diet has been shown to help the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis – a painful condition that causes joints to swell up, reducing strength and mobility. Studies also show that sufferers feel less stiff <b>and</b> <b>sore</b> in the morning if they keep their fish oil intake topped up. Recent research has also found a link between omega-3 fats and a slowing down in the wearing of cartilage that leads to osteoarthritis, opening the door for more research into whether eating more fish could help prevent the disease.|$|E
25|$|In 1845, Angell began {{studying}} at Brown, {{which at the}} time had a total of only seven instructors on the faculty. He graduated in 1849, and eventually obtained part-time jobs as an Assistant Librarian at the university and tutoring a boy whose eyesight prevented him from reading. In 1850, he came down with a cold <b>and</b> <b>sore</b> throat, but he refused to give his throat any rest from the daily exertion of reading aloud to his pupil. The resultant damage to his throat would last {{the rest of his life}} and make extended speaking difficult.|$|E

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} comes {{mostly from}} the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests (vitamin deficiency, anemia, leukemia, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV infection, diabetes) microbiological swabs (infection), or urinalysis (diabetes). A biopsy (minor procedure to cut out {{a small sample of}} the ulcer to look at under a microscope) with or without immunofluorescence may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a systemic disease is suspected. Ulcers caused by local trauma are painful to touch <b>and</b> <b>sore.</b> They usually have an irregular border with erythematous margins and the base is yellow. As healing progresses, a keratotic (thickened, white mucosa) halo may occur.|$|E
25|$|Epithelial {{surfaces}} may sustain {{damage from}} radiation therapy. Depending {{on the area}} being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink <b>and</b> <b>sore</b> several weeks into treatment. The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and {{for up to about}} one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this moist desquamation is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with another}} state side the MCC were again in trouble, this time under Colin Cowdrey's captaincy. John Snow was rested after {{damaging}} his toes in Melbourne and a stiff <b>and</b> <b>sore</b> Alan Ward strained a calf muscle during the game. In a rain affected match the New South Wales captain and wicket-keeper Brian Taber won the toss {{and decided to}} bat. They were 82/3 when Doug Walters came in and made 201 not out, adding 132 with Geoff Davies (57) and 145 with Kerry O'Keeffe (55 not out) before Taber declared at 410/5. Geoff Boycott (36) and Brian Luckhurst (42) added 54 for the first wicket and the MCC passed 100 with one wicket down. The leg-spinner O'Keeffe showed his all-round skills by taking 6/69 and they collapsed to 204 all out and were forced to follow on 206 runs behind. This kind of situation that brought {{out the best in}} Geoff Boycott (129 not out) and he added 228 for the first wicket with Brian Luckhurst (135) and 97 for the second with Keith Fletcher (51 not out) to ensure a draw.|$|E

25|$|As at 12 August 2009 {{the total}} of deaths {{reported}} raised to 44 with six more cases confirmed. A 60-year-old man who had histories of diabetes, hypertension and heart problems was warded on 6 August after showing symptoms of the flu. Throat swab and antiviral drugs were prescribed. However, he died {{on the next day}} due to severe pneumonia. Lab result confirmed the man as an Influenza A(H1N1) patient on 9 August. A 62-year-old man who was a diabetic was hospitalised on 6 August. He was then later dehydrated and given antiviral drug for precaution against the flu. Throat swab was taken on 7 August. However, he died on the same day due to pneumonia and possible cancer. A 20-year-old whom didn't have any history of underlying medical condition suffered from fever, coughing <b>and</b> <b>sore</b> throat. He sought for treatment at a hospital on 6 August and was later hospitalised due to suffocation. Antiviral drugs were later prescribed by the doctor. On the next day, he died due to severe pneumonia and septicaemia. A 10-year-old baby was among the death cases confirmed on 12 August. She showed symptoms but was warded six days later due to suffocation. Antiviral drugs were not given. On the next day, she died due to bronchopneumonia. An 18-year-old woman who was 26 weeks pregnant, and was also obese, showed symptoms on 3 August. Her condition deteriorate and was then later sent to ICU. Throat swab was done. She died due to severe pneumonia. A 1-year-old toddler who had congenital heart disease had a seizure and fever on 7 August. Antiviral drugs were not given to the toddler and he died on 9 August 2009 while undergoing a surgery.|$|E
25|$|McNabb's 2005 {{season began}} with turmoil and ended {{on the injured}} reserve list. While not {{speaking}} with his main target, Terrell Owens, and all the distractions {{that came with the}} Owens controversy, McNabb was named the NFC's Player of the Month for September. That month, McNabb threw for 964 yards, eight touchdowns and only two interceptions in three games, leading the Eagles to a 2-1 record. McNabb carried that momentum into October as he went 33-for-48 (68.8 completion percentage), threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns en route to leading the Eagles to a memorable come-from-behind victory at an unfriendly Arrowhead Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs. McNabb could not keep the momentum rolling, however, as the Eagles lost four straight games. Over that span, McNabb posted a quarterback rating higher than 72 only once, on November 6, at the Washington Redskins. After playing with a sports hernia <b>and</b> <b>sore</b> thumb, McNabb's season was finally over after a disastrous effort at home on November 14 on Monday night against the rival Dallas Cowboys. McNabb was intercepted by Roy Williams {{towards the end of the}} game, and tried to tackle the defender when Scott Shanle came in and tackled McNabb to the ground. McNabb had injured his groin on the play and was placed on the injured reserve list later that week. Mike McMahon replaced him at quarterback, and went 2–5 as a starter, with the Eagles finishing the season with a 6–10 record overall. Though low for his standards, McNabb put up respectable numbers in 2005. In nine games, he threw for 2,507 yards, 16 touchdowns and nine interceptions. To go along with that, he completed 59.1% (211-357) of his passes. Prior to his season-ending injury, McNabb was on pace to throw for 4,457 yards, which would have easily eclipsed his career high of 3,875, set in 2004.|$|E
500|$|As the {{symptoms}} of streptococcal pharyngitis overlap with other conditions, {{it can be difficult}} to make the diagnosis clinically.

[...] He was a regular tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.|$|E
500|$|Napalm Death's seismic impact {{inspired}} other British grindcore {{groups in}} the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass <b>and</b> <b>Sore</b> Throat. Extreme Noise Terror, from Ipswich, formed in 1984. With the goal of becoming [...] "the most extreme hardcore punk band of all time," [...] the group took Mick Harris from Napalm Death in 1987. Ian Glasper describes the group as [...] "pissed-off hateful noise with its roots somewhere between early Discharge and Disorder, with [...] Dean [...] and Phil [...] pushing their trademark vocal extremity to its absolute limit." [...] In 1991, the group collaborated with the acid house group The KLF, appearing onstage with the group at the Brit Awards in 1992. Carcass released Reek of Putrefaction in 1988, which John Peel declared his favorite {{album of the year}} despite its very poor production. The band's focus on gore and anatomical decay, lyrically and in sleeve artwork, inspired the goregrind subgenre. Sore Throat, said by Ian Glasper to have taken [...] "perhaps the most uncompromisingly anti-music stance" [...] were inspired by crust punk as well as industrial music. Some listeners, such as Digby Pearson, considered them to be simply an in-joke or parody of grindcore.|$|E

500|$|Poliovirus is an enterovirus. Infection occurs via the fecal–oral route, {{meaning that}} one ingests the virus and viral {{replication}} {{occurs in the}} alimentary tract. Virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals. In 95% of cases only a primary, transient presence of viremia (virus in the bloodstream) occurs, and the poliovirus infection is asymptomatic. In about 5% of cases, the virus spreads and replicates in other sites such as brown fat, reticuloendothelial tissue, and muscle. The sustained viral replication causes secondary viremia and leads {{to the development of}} minor symptoms such as fever, headache, <b>and</b> <b>sore</b> throat. Paralytic poliomyelitis occurs in less than 1% of poliovirus infections. Paralytic disease occurs when the virus enters the central nervous system (CNS) and replicates in motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex, resulting in the selective destruction of motor neurons leading to temporary or permanent paralysis. In rare cases, paralytic poliomyelitis leads to respiratory arrest and death. In cases of paralytic disease, muscle pain and spasms are frequently observed prior to onset of weakness and paralysis. Paralysis typically persists [...] from days to weeks prior to recovery.|$|E
