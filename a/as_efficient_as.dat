5|$|After {{the ship}} arrived in Invergordon, Baden was {{carefully}} examined by Royal Navy technicians. Naval engineers inspected the hull, including the screws, bilge keels, and rudders, {{to determine the}} water resistance of the hull form. The ship {{was found to have}} been approximately <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> the British s. The ship's armor system was extensively investigated; the British team concluded that the ship had not been modified to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland of 31 May– 1 June 1916.|$|E
5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{may have}} evolved {{initially}} for providing insulation. Scales on the thorax {{and other parts}} of the body may contribute to maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight. The 'solid' scales of basal moths are however not <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the insulation value. Scales also help increase the lift to drag ratio in gliding flight.|$|E

5|$|In 1997 {{there had}} been plans for a £130 million {{combined}} cycle gas turbine power station {{on the site of}} the Ever Ready battery factory to the West of the site of the North station. AES Electrical applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for permission to build the station, which would have been twice <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> the coal-fired Stella stations and the first major electricity generation site built in Tyne and Wear in over 40years. The station would have had a generating capacity of 350MW. It would have taken three years to build, and created 400construction jobs, as well as 40full-time jobs after construction. But the proposal was opposed by the coal mining industry and dropped.|$|E
5|$|Survivalism and {{disaster}} preparation are prevalent {{themes in the}} novel. Several interviews, especially those from the United States, focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving U.S. population to fight the zombies and rebuild the country. For example, when cities were made to be <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> possible in order to fight the zombies, the plumber could hold a higher status than the former CEO. The ultra-rich hid in their homes, which {{had been turned into}} fortified compounds, when they were overwhelmed by others trying to get in, it became a mass slaughter. Throughout the novel, characters demonstrate the physical and mental requirements needed to survive a disaster. Brooks described the large amount of research needed to find optimal methods for fighting a worldwide zombie outbreak. He also pointed out that the U.S. likes the zombie genre because it believes that it can survive anything with the right tools and talent.|$|E

5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E

25|$|While L-estimators are not <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> other statistics, {{they often}} have {{reasonably}} high relative efficiency, and show that a large fraction of the information used in estimation can be obtained using only a few points – as few as one, two, or three. Alternatively, they show that order statistics contain {{a significant amount of}} information.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, German {{physicist}} and chemist Walther Nernst developed the Nernst lamp, {{a form of}} incandescent lamp that used a ceramic globar and did not require enclosure in a vacuum or inert gas. Twice <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> carbon filament lamps, Nernst lamps were briefly popular until overtaken by lamps using metal filaments.|$|E
25|$|The {{midpoint}} of the distribution (a+b)/2 is both the mean and the median of the uniform distribution. Although both the sample mean and the sample median are unbiased estimators of the midpoint, neither is <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> the sample mid-range, i.e. the arithmetic mean of the sample maximum and the sample minimum, which is the UMVU estimator of the midpoint (and also the maximum likelihood estimate).|$|E

25|$|For generations, {{the disease}} was treated with an {{application}} of the antiseptic gentian violet. Today, topical or oral antibiotics are usually prescribed. Mild cases may be treated with bactericidal ointment, such as mupirocin. In 95% of cases, a single antibiotic course results in resolution in children. It has been advocated that topical disinfectants are not nearly <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> antibiotics, and therefore should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{reactions}} {{are central to}} chemical engineering where they are used for the synthesis of new compounds from natural raw materials such as petroleum and mineral ores. It is essential to make the reaction <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> possible, maximizing the yield and minimizing the amount of reagents, energy inputs and waste. Catalysts are especially helpful for reducing the energy required for the reaction and increasing its reaction rate.|$|E
25|$|Optical fiber {{can be used}} to {{transmit}} power using a photovoltaic cell to convert the light into electricity. While this method of power transmission is not <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> conventional ones, it is especially useful in situations where it is desirable not to have a metallic conductor {{as in the case of}} use near MRI machines, which produce strong magnetic fields. Other examples are for powering electronics in high-powered antenna elements and measurement devices used in high-voltage transmission equipment.|$|E

25|$|Battery {{life can}} be {{extended}} by storing the batteries at a low temperature, as in a refrigerator or freezer, which slows the side reactions. Such storage can {{extend the life of}} alkaline batteries by about 5%; rechargeable batteries can hold their charge much longer, depending upon type. To reach their maximum voltage, batteries must be returned to room temperature; discharging an alkaline battery at 250 mA at 0°C is only half <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> at 20°C. Alkaline battery manufacturers such as Duracell do not recommend refrigerating batteries.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} fuel is another alternative under development in various countries, alongside, hydrogen vehicles though hydrogen {{is actually an}} energy storage medium, not a primary energy source, and consequently {{the use of a}} non-petroleum source would be required to extract the hydrogen for use. Though hydrogen is currently outperformed in terms of cost and efficiency by battery powered vehicles, there are applications where it would come in useful. Short haul ferries and very cold climates are two examples. Hydrogen fuel cells are about a third <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> batteries and double the efficiency of gasoline vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{high-resolution}} gratings were ruled using high-quality ruling engines whose {{construction was}} a large undertaking. Henry Joseph Grayson designed a machine to make diffraction gratings, succeeding with one of 120,000 lines to the inch (approx. 4,724 lines per mm) in 1899. Later, photolithographic techniques allowed gratings to be created from a holographic interference pattern. Holographic gratings have sinusoidal grooves {{and may not be}} <b>as</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>as</b> ruled gratings, but are often preferred in monochromators because they lead to much less stray light. A copying technique allows high quality replicas to be made from master gratings of either type, thereby lowering fabrication costs.|$|E
