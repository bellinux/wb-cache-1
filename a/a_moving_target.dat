40|$|A {{wideband}} imaging architecture {{based on}} subbanding and Doppler filter bank using FFT is developed and its performance is analyzed in detail. The theoretical analysis shows that owing to Doppler dispersion, the target’s range profile will produce distortion {{with the increase}} in target velocity. The distortion includes range shift and amplitude deformation. At the same time, two related theoretical formulas are deduced for the calculation of the range shift value and evaluation of the amplitude deformation extent of <b>a</b> <b>moving</b> <b>target's</b> range profile formed by the proposed imaging architecture and thereby the maximum critical velocity is derived. When target velocity is less than the maximum critical velocity, <b>a</b> <b>moving</b> <b>target’s</b> range profile with acceptable distortion can be obtained. Specific conclusions are verified with some simulations...|$|R

25|$|The most {{effective}} clutter reduction technique is pulse-Doppler radar. Doppler separates clutter from {{aircraft and spacecraft}} using a frequency spectrum, so individual signals can be separated from multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences. This requires a coherent transmitter. Another technique uses <b>a</b> <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> indicator that subtracts the receive signal from two successive pulses using phase to reduce signals from slow moving objects. This can be adapted for systems that lack a coherent transmitter, such as time-domain pulse-amplitude radar.|$|E

25|$|The Doppler {{effect is}} used in some types of radar, to measure the {{velocity}} of detected objects. A radar beam is fired at <b>a</b> <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> — e.g. a motor car, as police use radar to detect speeding motorists — as it approaches or recedes from the radar source. Each successive radar wave has to travel farther to reach the car, before being reflected and re-detected near the source. As each wave has to move farther, the gap between each wave increases, increasing the wavelength. In some situations, the radar beam is fired at the moving car as it approaches, in which case each successive wave travels a lesser distance, decreasing the wavelength. In either situation, calculations from the Doppler effect accurately determine the car's velocity. Moreover, the proximity fuze, developed during World War II, relies upon Doppler radar to detonate explosives at the correct time, height, distance, etc.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{hours of}} the game, before the player started to acquire {{some of the more}} potent powers, were {{considered}} to be difficult and may be off-putting to some. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer noted the remainder of the game continues to have some difficult sections, such as sections where the player must defend <b>a</b> <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> against a large number of foes, and considered these to be [...] "repetitive and overlong". Bramwell further commented that the electrical powers in the game are simply electricity-based reimaginings of standard video game weapon archetypes, such as shotguns and sniper rifles, and, with this awareness, leaves the difficulty of the game up to the enemy placement during encounters. [...] The game is also considered to be rough around the edges in technical execution, with the lack of anti-aliasing and occasional [...] "pop-in" [...] rendering, as well as drops in frame rates when there was a significant amount of action on the screen.|$|E
500|$|As Agent 47, the {{standard}} hitman protagonist of the Hitman series, the player is led to assassinate several powerful figures who have assembled at three upscale, lakefront houses. The shooting gallery {{game is played}} through first-person vision of a sniper scope, such that Agent 47 is not vulnerable to counterattack but can fail the mission if the targets notice the scheme and leave the premises. The game becomes a puzzle of isolating targets such that others nearby will not be alerted and, in turn, alert others at the compound. The player experiments with alternative methods for killing the targets, such as shooting out glass and letting targets fall to their deaths rather than killing them directly. Other traps include setting off car alarms to distract guards, turning on fans to knock enemies off cliffs, and letting a target fall directly into a jacuzzi. The player pinches the device's touchscreen to zoom in with the rifle's scope and taps its reticle to fire. An on-screen [...] "reload" [...] button begins a quick time event in which the player swipes the screen to reload the weapon. Missions are constructed around killing one of ten important targets and a secondary objective, such as a stylized kill within a time limit, using a specific kind of trap, or landing a headshot on <b>a</b> <b>moving</b> <b>target.</b>|$|E

Despite its large variability, the mean transit RT accorded well with the actual time of stimulus transit. The observed high variability in transit RTs is conceived to reflect a competitive interplay between bottom-up mechanisms with topdown modulation (anticipative-attentive control) ...|$|R

In presence of ground clutter such techniques require <b>an</b> <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> indication (MTI) function including clutter suppression.

2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to predict the oil peak in any given region, {{due to the lack}} of knowledge and/or transparency in accounting of global oil reserves. [...] Based on available production data, proponents have previously predicted the peak for the world to be in years 1989, 1995, or 1995–2000. Some of these predictions date from before the recession of the early 1980s, and the consequent reduction in global consumption, the effect of which was to delay the date of any peak by several years. Just as the 1971 U.S. peak in oil production was only clearly recognized after the fact, a peak in world production will be difficult to discern until production clearly drops off.

2500|$|The {{advent of}} social {{networking}} platforms {{may also be}} impacting the way(s) in which learners engage with technology in general. For a number of years, Prensky's (2001) dichotomy between Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of {{the ease with which}} people of a certain age range—in particular those born before and after 1980—use technology. Prensky's theory has been largely disproved, however, and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as White and Le Cornu's [...] "Visitors" [...] and [...] "Residents" [...] (2011) are greater currency. The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users, as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries. Social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researchers. According to Livingstone and Brake (2010), [...] "Social networking sites, like much else on the Internet, represent <b>a</b> <b>moving</b> <b>target</b> for researchers and policy makers." [...] Pew Research Center project, called Pew Internet, did a USA-wide survey in 2009 and in 2010 February published that 47% of American adults use a social networking website. Same survey found that 73% of online teenagers use SNS, which is an increase from 65% in 2008, 55% in 2006. Recent studies have shown that social network services provide opportunities within professional education, curriculum education, and learning. However, there are constraints in this area. Researches, especially in Africa, have disclosed that the use of social networks among students have been known to negatively affect their academic life. This is buttressed by the fact that their use constitutes distractions, as well as that the students tend to invest {{a good deal of time}} in the use of such technologies.|$|E
