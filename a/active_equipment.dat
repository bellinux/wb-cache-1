2500|$|The ceasefire {{was broken}} {{multiple}} {{times on the}} night of 6–7 September, and into the day on 7 September. These violations resulted in the deaths of four Ukrainian soldiers, whilst twenty-nine were injured. Heavy shelling by the insurgents was reported on the eastern outskirts of Mariupol, and OSCE monitors said that the Ukrainian government had fired rockets from Donetsk International Airport. The OSCE said that these breaches of the agreement would not cause the ceasefire to collapse. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said on 10 September that [...] "70% of Russian troops have been moved back across the border", and also added that this action gave him [...] "hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects". Ceasefire violations continued, however. In line with the Minsk Protocol, OSCE monitors said that they observed a prisoner exchange near Avdiivka at 03:40 on 12 September. Ukrainian forces released 31 DPR insurgents, whilst DPR forces released 37 Ukrainian soldiers. OSCE monitors documented violations of the Minsk Protocol in numerous areas of Donetsk Oblast from 13–15 September. These areas included Makiivka, Telmanove, Debaltseve, Petrovske, near Mariupol, Yasynuvata, and Donetsk International Airport, all of which saw intense fighting. Two of the armoured vehicles that the monitors were travelling in were struck by shrapnel, rendering one of the vehicles inoperable and forcing the monitors to retreat. According to the monitors, troop and equipment movements were being carried out by both DPR and Ukrainian forces. They also said that there were [...] "command and control issues" [...] amongst both parties to the conflict. A visit by the monitors to Luhansk International Airport took place on 20 September. They said that the airport was [...] "completely destroyed", and entirely unusable. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said on 21 September that the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost between 60% and 65% of its total <b>active</b> <b>equipment</b> {{over the course of the}} war.|$|E

50|$|An {{active system}} can be {{deployed}} in large buildings and/or within a campus of buildings by converting and transporting the radio frequency over optical fiber. Many active systems have been deployed covering areas of 1000000 sq ft and larger. Active systems are best suited {{when there is a}} need to support multiple MNOs or large single buildings or campuses with multiple buildings. Expansion of an active system is usually in the form of adding more <b>active</b> <b>equipment</b> to increase the number of coverage antennas within the building, to increase the number of MNOs, or to increase the service offerings of an MNO such as adding 3G or 4G services. In a properly designed active system, no reengineering or rebalancing of the original system is required when the system is expanded. Optical fiber systems can provide coverage in areas up to 2 km from the signal source making them ideal for campus environments. An active system will always be more expensive than a passive system.|$|E
50|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Warsaw Pact {{and the end of the}} Cold war, Bulgaria could no longer support a vast military. A rapid reduction in personnel and <b>active</b> <b>equipment</b> was to be carried out in parallel with a general re-alignment of strategic interests. In 1990, Bulgaria had a total of more than 2,400 tanks, 2,000 armored vehicles, 2,500 large caliber artillery systems, 300 fighter and bomber aircraft, 100 trainer aircraft, more than 40 combat and 40 transport helicopters, 4 submarines, 6 fast missile craft, 2 frigates, 5 corvettes, 6 torpedo boats, 9 patrol craft, 30 minesweepers and 21 transport vessels. Due to the economic crisis that affected most former Eastern bloc countries, a steady reform in the military could not be carried out; much of the equipment fell into disrepair and some of it was smuggled and sold to the international black market. Inadequate payments, fuel and spare part shortages and the disbandment of many capable units led to an overall drop in combat readiness, morale and discipline.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Activity {{behaviours}} (physical activity, sedentary {{time and}} screen time) {{have been linked}} to health outcomes in childhood. Furthermore, socioeconomic disparities have been observed in both children’s activity behaviours and health outcomes. Children’s physical home environments {{may play a role in}} these relationships. This study aimed to examine the associations and interactions between children’s physical home environment, socioeconomic status and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, sedentary time and screen time. Methods Australian children (n[*]=[*] 528) aged 9 – 11 years from randomly selected schools participated in the cross-sectional International Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and the Environment. Children’s physical home environment (access to equipment), socioeconomic status (household income and parental education) and demographic variables (gender and family structure) were determined by parental questionnaire. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary time were measured objectively by 7 -day 24 -h accelerometry. Screen time was obtained from child survey. The associations between the physical home environment, socioeconomic status and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, sedentary time and screen time were examined for 427 children, using analysis of covariance, and linear and logistic regression, with adjustment for gender and family structure. Results The presence of TVs (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and video game consoles (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) in children’s bedrooms, and child possession of handheld video games (p[*]=[*] 0. 04), cell phones (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and music devices (p[*]=[*] 0. 04) was significantly and positively associated with screen time. Ownership of these devices (with the exception of music devices) was inversely related to socioeconomic status (parental education). Children’s moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (p[*]=[*] 0. 04) and possession of <b>active</b> play <b>equipment</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 04) were both positively associated with socioeconomic status (household income), but were not related to each other (with the exception of bicycle ownership). Conclusions Children with less electronic devices, particularly in their bedrooms, participated in less screen time, regardless of socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic disparities were identified in children’s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, however socioeconomic status was inconsistently related to possession of <b>active</b> play <b>equipment.</b> Home <b>active</b> play <b>equipment</b> was therefore not a clear contributor to the socioeconomic gradients in Australian children’s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity...|$|R

5000|$|After days {{of peace}} talks in Minsk {{under the auspices}} of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Ukraine, Russia, the DPR, and the LPR agreed to a ceasefire on 5 September. OSCE {{monitors}} said they would observe the ceasefire, and assist the Ukrainian government in implementing it. According to The New York Times, the agreement was an [...] "almost verbatim" [...] replication of Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko's failed June [...] "fifteen-point peace plan". It was agreed that there would be an exchange of all prisoners taken by both sides, and that heavy weaponry should be removed from the combat zone. Humanitarian corridors were meant to be maintained, so that civilians could leave affected areas. President Poroshenko said that Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts would be granted [...] "special status", and that use of the Russian language in these areas would be protected by law. DPR and LPR leaders said that they retained their desire for full independence from Ukraine, despite these concessions. Russian president Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Poroshenko discussed the ceasefire on 6 September. Both parties said that they were satisfied with the ceasefire, and that it was generally holding.The ceasefire was broken multiple times on the night of 6-7 September, and into the day on 7 September.

According to a statement released by the OSCE on the day after the conference, all parties agreed that the fighting had [...] "subsided in recent days", and that the [...] "situation along 70%" [...] of the buffer zone was [...] "calm". They also said that they would [...] "spare no efforts" [...] to strengthen the ceasefire. Scattered violations of the ceasefire continued, nonetheless. In the most significant incident since the start of the ceasefire, seven Ukrainian soldiers died on 29 September when a tank shell struck the armoured personnel carrier that they were travelling in near Donetsk International Airport. A skirmish ensued, leaving many soldiers wounded. Over the next few days, fighting continued around Donetsk International Airport, whilst Donetsk city itself came under heavy shelling. Amidst this renewed violence, OSCE chairman Didier Burkhalter issued a statement that [...] "urged all sides to immediately stop fighting", and also said that putting the ceasefire at risk of collapse would be [...] "irresponsible and deplorable".|$|E
