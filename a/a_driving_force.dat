5|$|While {{the early}} 19th century had seen rapid {{progress}} in electrical science, the late 19th century {{would see the}} greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life, becoming <b>a</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> of the Second Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{both the}} {{technological}} gap between civilisations and the centuries-long colonial era, Portugal was <b>a</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> {{in the development and}} shaping of all Portuguese Africa since the 15th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, to counter the increasing insurgency of FRELIMO forces and show to the Portuguese people and the world that the territory was totally under control, the Portuguese government accelerated its major development program to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of Portuguese Mozambique by creating new roads, railways, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, schools and hospitals to stimulate an even higher level of economic growth and support from the populace.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming <b>a</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E

5|$|The Documentary debuted {{at number}} one on the US Billboard 200, selling 586,000 units in the first week. In March 2005, the Recording Industry Association of America {{certified}} the album double Platinum, selling five million copies worldwide. The Documentary received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the album's production. Since the album's release, The Game was credited as <b>a</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> in reviving the West Coast hip hop scene that has been overshadowed by artists from the East, Midwest and South. The record remains as The Game's best-selling album to date. On June 16, 2014, the sequel to the album was announced, called The Documentary 2, which was released on October 9, 2015, followed by the release of The Documentary 2.5.|$|E
5|$|The {{first film}} has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, {{and the third}} 1,488 (2,730 in total). The total {{increases}} to 3,420 with the extended editions. 260 visual effect artists began work on the series, and the number doubled by The Two Towers. The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, worked long hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's active imagination was <b>a</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force.</b> For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within {{the last six weeks}} of post-production of The Two Towers, and the same happened again within the last six weeks on The Return of the King.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} creative industries (and especially design) in knowledge-intense industries is reflected {{not only in}} the policies and studies on EU levels, but has initiated design and creative policies and programmes in the most advanced economies. Furthermore, design and creativity has been recognised on a regional and local level as <b>a</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> for competitiveness, economic growth, job market, and citizen's satisfaction. The investment in creative and cultural industries are considered a significant component of EU growth in the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy; and designers are increasingly involved in innovation issues.|$|E

5|$|After Napoleon's total {{defeat in}} 1815, the Congress of Vienna merged the French {{territory}} in Belgium with the Netherlands {{to form the}} United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a buffer state against the French. It was ruled by William I of Orange. The synergy of combining the manufacturing centers in Belgium with the important exporting ports in the Netherlands encouraged growth of the industrial cloth manufacturing and metallurgic centers in Wallonia. Keen to promote the economic development of the southern provinces as well, William I founded the Société Générale des Pays-Bas in 1822 to provide businesses with capital to invest in machinery. The Société Générale served as <b>a</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind Belgian industrialization in the 19th century, and at its height controlled large swathes of the national economy. William I also encouraged the creation of educational facilities in the Southern Provinces, founding the State University of Leuven, the University of Liège and Ghent University in 1817.|$|E
5|$|Born in Newport, Delaware, Evans {{received}} little formal education {{and in his}} mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked {{for over a decade}} designing, building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and conveyor belts. In doing so Evans designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power, and built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who built the first in the world a year earlier. Evans was <b>a</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> in the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. Evans dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805. Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos, it was the first automobile in the country and the world's first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive to be a success as either.|$|E
5|$|Henry's empire quickly {{collapsed}} {{during the}} reign of his youngest son John. Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule, however, had long-term consequences. Henry's legal changes are generally considered to have laid the basis for the English Common Law, while his intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland shaped the development of their societies and governmental systems. Historical interpretations of Henry's reign have changed considerably over time. In the 18th century, scholars argued that Henry was <b>a</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> {{in the creation of a}} genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain. During the Victorian expansion of the British Empire, historians were keenly interested in the formation of Henry's own empire, but they also expressed concern over his private life and treatment of Becket. Late-20th-century historians have combined British and French historical accounts of Henry, challenging earlier Anglo-centric interpretations of his reign.|$|E

He also concluded that for every surface or interface in a crystalline medium, there exists <b>a</b> critical <b>driving</b> <b>force,</b> which, if exceeded, will enable the surface or interface to advance normal to itself, and, if not exceeded, will require the lateral growth mechanism.|$|R
5|$|Representation at the League {{was often}} a problem. Though it was {{intended}} to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been <b>a</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919. Ruth Henig has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the Nazi Party less likely. Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with international incidents. The structure of the US federal government might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the executive branch without having the prior approval of the legislative branch.|$|E
