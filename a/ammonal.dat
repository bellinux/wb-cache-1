5|$|Of the {{original}} British flame fougasse designs, {{there were three}} main variants: the safety fougasse, the demigasse and the hedge hopper. They all used metal barrels and similar pre-prepared explosive charges, although they varied {{in the details of}} construction and the amount of <b>ammonal</b> used for the propelling charge.|$|E
5|$|Near the Canadian {{side of the}} {{restored}} trenches is a small memorial plaque dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins MBE. Watkins was head of Explosive Ordnance Disposal at the Directorate of Land Service Ammunition, Royal Logistic Corps, and a leading British explosive ordnance disposal expert. In August 1998, he died in a roof collapse near a tunnel entrance while undertaking a detailed investigative survey of the British tunnel system {{on the grounds of}} the Canadian National Vimy Memorial site. Watkins was no stranger to the tunnel system at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated <b>ammonal</b> explosives located under a road intersection on the site.|$|E
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The <b>ammonal</b> used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
40|$|In the work, {{influence}} of a scale of experiment {{on the results of}} cylindrical test used todetermine the acceleration capabilities of explosives was analyzed. Explosives used in ammunition(TNT, hexogen) and explosives for civil purpose (<b>ammonals)</b> were selected for testing. Copper tubeswith different diameters and wall thickness were used. Conclusions are drawn regarding the advisabilityof increasing or decreasing the scale of the cylinder test. [b]Keywords[/b]: explosives, acceleration ability, cylinder tes...|$|R
50|$|The {{mixture is}} {{affected}} by humidity because ammonium nitrate is highly hygroscopic. <b>Ammonal's</b> ease of detonation depends on fuel and oxidizer ratios, 95:5 ammonium nitrate and aluminum being fairly sensitive, however not very oxygen balanced. Even copper metal traces are known to sensitize bulk amounts of ammonium nitrate and further increase danger of spontaneous detonation during a fire, most likely due {{to the formation of}} tetramines. More oxygen balanced mixtures are not easily detonated, requiring a fairly substantial shock, though it remains more sensitive than trinitrotoluene and C-4.|$|R

25|$|To keep quiet, the tunnellers used bayonets with spliced {{handles and}} worked barefoot on a floor covered with sandbags. Flints were {{carefully}} prised {{out of the}} chalk and laid on the floor; if the bayonet was manipulated two-handed, an assistant caught the dislodged material. Spoil was placed in sandbags, passed hand-to-hand along a row of miners {{sitting on the floor}} and stored {{along the side of the}} tunnel, later to be used to tamp the charge. Lochnagar and Y Sap mines were overcharged to ensure that large rims were formed from the disturbed ground and communication tunnels were also dug for use immediately after the first attack. The mines were laid without interference by German miners but while the <b>ammonal</b> was being placed, German troops of the 9th Company, RIR 110 could hear the British miners but not where they were; German miners could be heard by the British miners below Lochnagar and above Y Sap mine.|$|E
500|$|A flame fougasse {{comprised}} a 40-gallon light {{steel drum}} filled with petroleum mixture and a small, electrically detonated explosive. This was {{dug into the}} roadside with a substantial overburden and camouflaged. <b>Ammonal</b> provided the propellant charge, it was placed behind the barrel and, when triggered, caused the barrel to rupture and shoot a jet of flame [...] wide and [...] long. They were usually deployed in batteries of four barrels and would be placed at a location such as a corner, steep incline or roadblock where vehicles would be obliged to slow.|$|E
500|$|Another {{variant of}} the flame fougasse was the [...] "hedge hopper". This was a barrel of {{petroleum}} mixture placed upright with a cocoa tin charge containing two primers and just one <b>ammonal</b> cartridge buried in an [...] deep pit placed underneath and slightly off centre, but carefully aligned with the seam of the barrel. On firing, the barrel would be projected [...] {{into the air and}} [...] forwards, bounding over a hedge or wall behind which it had been hidden. It was difficult to get the hedge hopper's propelling charge right, but it had the great advantage of being quick to install and easy to conceal.|$|E
500|$|The {{propelling}} charge was prepared with an electrically triggered detonator in a primer bound with insulating tape {{to three or}} four cartridges of <b>ammonal</b> explosive. This assembly was placed in a small, waterproof rubber bag that was, in turn, placed inside a used cocoa tin. [...] of magnesium alloy turnings were added to ensure ignition of the fuel. The electrical wires were passed through a small hole in the lid of the tin which was then tightly fitted. The {{propelling charge}}s were kept in storage, only to be deployed when enemy action was imminent. To activate the device, the propelling charge was lowered down the pipe and tamped down with dry soil before being connected to a firing point about [...] away. Firing required the current delivered by a 120 V battery.|$|E
500|$|During the Second World War {{the route}} of the canal was {{employed}} as part of the Taunton Stop Line, a defensive line which followed the course of canals and railway embankments {{from the mouth of the}} Parrett to Seaton on the south coast. All permanent bridges were mined with demolition chambers. Hamp Bridge was prepared for demolition with four small charge chambers under the east side of the arch containing a total of [...] of the explosive, <b>ammonal.</b> Anti-tank obstacles were placed at bridge sites or locks to hinder bridging operations. [...] All of the swing bridges were removed, but were then replaced with fixed timber bridges at towpath level. Only essential maintenance was carried out, to ensure a water supply for fire-fighting and to prevent flooding. Although the physical structure of the canal was not damaged by enemy action, all of the Company records and traffic receipts, together with those of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, were destroyed during a bombing raid.|$|E
500|$|No further {{information}} was forthcoming until 2000, when during a Raidió Teilifís Éireann interview a former IRA member, Liam Sutcliffe {{claimed he had}} placed the bomb which detonated in the Pillar. In the 1950s [...] Sutcliffe {{was associated with a}} group of dissident volunteers led by Joe Christle (1927–98), who had been expelled from the IRA in 1956 for [...] "recklessness". [...] In early 1966 Sutcliffe learned that Christle's group was planning [...] "Operation Humpty Dumpty", an attack on the Pillar, and offered his services. According to Sutcliffe, on 28 February he placed a bomb within the Pillar, timed to go off {{in the early hours of}} the next morning. The explosive was a mixture of gelignite and <b>ammonal.</b> It failed to detonate; Sutcliffe says that he returned early the next morning, recovered the device and redesigned its timer. On 7 March, shortly before the Pillar closed for the day, he climbed the inner stairway and placed the refurbished bomb near to the top of the shaft before going home. [...] He learned of the success of his mission the next day, he says, having slept undisturbed through the night. Following his revelations, Sutcliffe was questioned by the police but not charged. He did not name [...] others involved in the action, apart from Christle and his brother.|$|E
500|$|The British {{had begun}} a mining {{offensive}} against the German-held [...] salient in 1916. Sub-surface conditions were especially complex and separate ground water tables made mining difficult. To overcome the technical difficulties, two military geologists assisted the miners from March 1916, including Edgeworth David, who planned {{the system of}} mines. Sappers dug the tunnels into a layer of [...] "blue clay" [...] below the surface, then drifted galleries for [...] to points deep underneath Group Wytschaete's front lines, despite German counter-mining. German tunnellers came within metres of several British mine chambers, found the mine at La Petite Douve Farm and wrecked the chamber with a camouflet. The British diverted the attention of German miners from their deepest galleries, by making many secondary attacks in the upper levels. Co-ordinated by tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and British miners laid 26 mines with [...] of <b>ammonal</b> explosive. The British knew of the importance the Germans placed on holding the [...] salient, after a captured corps order from [...] stating [...] "that the salient be held at all costs" [...] was received by Haig on 1 June.

2500|$|At High Wood, the 178th Tunnelling Company drove a mine at just [...] depth, [...] long, {{which they}} charged with [...] of <b>ammonal.</b> It was blown thirty seconds before Zero Hour on 3 September 1916. After {{advancing}} British infantry {{had failed to}} capture the crater permanently, 178th Tunnelling Company reopened the gallery, charged it with another [...] of <b>ammonal</b> and blew the mine again on 9 September. This time the crater was successfully held.|$|E
2500|$|The BEF miners {{eventually}} {{completed a}} line of deep mines under Messines Ridge that were charged with [...] of <b>ammonal</b> and gun cotton. Two mines were laid at [...] on the northern flank, one at St Eloi, three at Hollandscheschur Farm, two at Petit Bois, single mines at Maedelstede Farm, Peckham House and Spanbroekmolen, four at Kruisstraat, one at Ontario Farm and two each at Trenches [...] on the southern flank. A group of four mines was placed under the German strongpoint Birdcage at Le Pelerin, just outside Ploegsteert Wood. The large mines were at St Eloi, charged with [...] of <b>ammonal,</b> at Maedelstede Farm, which was charged with , and Spanbroekmolen {{on one of the}} highest points of the Messines Ridge, which was filled with [...] of <b>ammonal.</b> The mine at Spanbroekmolen was set [...] below ground, {{at the end of a}} gallery [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|At Bulgar Point, located east of Mametz in {{the front}} sector {{allocated}} to XV Corps, the German position was completely destroyed by the detonation of the No 12 mine with [...] of <b>ammonal.</b> Four other British mines in the already cratered area between Mametz and Fricourt also exploded successfully.|$|E
2500|$|The British effort {{over the}} winter {{gradually}} overtook the German mining operation and a plan was made to destroy the German galleries. Four mines were planted under the [...] Redoubt, to be exploded just before an attack on The Chord, which would leave the British in possession of the crater-field, counter the German advantage in observation from [...] and possibly lead {{to the destruction of}} the German gallery system. Chamber A was loaded with [...] of <b>ammonal,</b> Chamber B with [...] of blastine and [...] of <b>ammonal</b> and Chamber C with a charge of , the Germans being apparently taken unawares. While the 36th Brigade was out of the line resting and training, the 37th Brigade conducted preparatory work, dumping hand grenades close to the front line, preparing communication trenches, jumping-off places and arranging to carry hot soup to the raiding parties after the attack.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{detonation}} of the Hawthorn Ridge mine on 1 July, the Royal Engineers {{began work}} on a new mine, loaded with [...] of <b>ammonal,</b> which was placed beneath the crater of the first explosion. On 13 November 1916, two brigades of the 51st (Highland) Division attacked the first objective (green line) at Station road and Beaumont-Hamel, then the final objective (yellow line) at Frankfort Trench, with three battalions, the fourth providing carrying parties. Six minutes before zero, the leading battalion of the right brigade moved beyond the British wire and advanced when the new mine at Hawthorn Crater was blown.|$|E

Communication tunnels were also dug for use immediately after the first attack, [...] including a tunnel across no man's land to a point close to the Lochnagar mine, ready to extend to the crater after the detonation as a covered route. The mines were laid without interference by German miners but as the explosives were placed, German miners could be heard below Lochnagar and above the Y Sap mine.|$|E
2500|$|French mine {{workings}} were taken {{over as the}} British moved into the Somme front and great secrecy was maintained to prevent {{the discovery of the}} mines, since no continuous front line trench ran through the Glory Hole, which was defended by posts near the mine shafts. The 179th Tunnelling Company Royal Engineers dug the mines {{on either side of the}} salient around La Boisselle, to destroy German positions and create crater lips to block German enfilade fire along no man's land. The tunnellers used bayonets with spliced handles and worked barefoot on a floor covered with sandbags for silence. Flints were carefully prised out of the chalk and laid on the floor; when the bayonet was manipulated two-handed, an assistant caught the dislodged material. Spoil was placed in sandbags and passed hand-by-hand along a row of miners sitting on the floor, then stored along the side of the tunnel to be used to tamp the charge.

2500|$|In {{the north}} of the battlefield, after the {{detonation}} of the H3 mine at Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt on 1 July, 252nd Tunnelling Company on 4 July began work on a second mine, loaded with [...] of <b>ammonal,</b> which was placed beneath the crater of the first explosion. This new mine was fired to signal Zero Hour {{at the start of the}} Battle of the Ancre on 13 November 1916, [...] when a successful British attack took the village of Beaumont-Hamel. The crater visible on Hawthorn Ridge is therefore actually a double crater, lined today with trees and thick undergrowth, but not filled with water. The site affords good views of the location of the German positions.|$|E
2500|$|In January and February 1916, British raiding {{parties had}} {{discovered}} that the Blinddarm strongpoint (Y Sap to the British) was protected by a system of deep mines. Y Sap mine was dug underneath the Blinddarm strongpoint, which overlooked Mash Valley, just north of La Boisselle. [...] The mine consisted of a gallery dug from the British front line, near where it crossed the [...] road to a mine chamber under the Blinddarm.

2500|$|An {{elaborate}} trench {{network was}} dug around the St Eloi craters by the Germans, with a front line {{west of the}} craters and a reserve line to the east; the 46th Reserve Division held the new line until it was moved south to the Somme in August. In March 1916, 172nd Tunnelling Company handed its work at St Eloi over to the 1st Canadian Tunnelling Company and mining operations at St Eloi continued.

2500|$|The grenade was {{rectangular}} {{in shape}} and approximately [...] in length and [...] in width, and weighed about [...] Its explosive content consisted of around [...] of blasting explosive, which was usually either <b>ammonal</b> or TNT. On {{the top of the}} grenade was a plate, under which the user would insert a chemical igniter, which would act as the weapon's fuse. When a vehicle drove over the grenade, its weight crushed the plate, which in turn cracked the igniter; this then leaked acid onto a sensitive chemical which detonated the charge. The grenade was designed so that it could either be thrown at a vehicle like an ordinary anti-tank grenade, or placed at a location when used as an anti-tank mine. It was also fitted with areas where blasting caps or cordtex could be placed, so that it {{could be used as a}} demolition charge. When the grenade was used, it was recommended that the user be within a short distance of their target, ideally concealed within a trench; if the target were an armoured vehicle, then the best areas to target were the sides and rear, where the engine compartment was located and armour was generally thinner.|$|E
2500|$|The large H3 mine, located {{north of}} First Avenue and Mary, was placed by 252nd Tunnelling Company beneath Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, the German stronghold on the ridge. Work on H3 began in spring 1916.

2500|$|Livens {{continued}} {{to improve his}} projector and to design other weapons for trench warfare, {{some of which were}} useful, others not. For example, he experimented with attempts to cut barbed wire using large quantities of explosives. A witness to one trial described orange boxes filled with explosives and fired from {{a hole in the ground}} in the manner of a shell fougasse. This system failed because the explosives tended to detonate ineffectually in mid-air – a sight that was described as being: [...] "A most impressive picture of the Day of Judgement". A variation of the Livens Projector prototype was also tested with a view to cutting wire; Major-General Foulkes later recalled: [...] "After the shoot, as the spectators approached the target area to observe the effect that had been produced Livens noticed that one drum containing 100lb of <b>ammonal</b> had failed to explode, and he called out [...] "Back everybody" [...] as he led a hasty retreat.
