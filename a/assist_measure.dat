40|$|Identifying and {{managing}} students who experience difficulty with learning to {{program is a}} challenge for CS educators. In an attempt to answer the familiar question "What makes for success in CS 1 ?" we have investigated student approaches to learning using the <b>ASSIST</b> <b>measure</b> of learning approach. This measure considers three dimensions related to studying - deep (related to meaning), surface (reproducing) and strategic (achieving). Two cohorts of CS 1 students completed an online ASSIST questionnaire midway through their first semester. Their three ASSIST scores were analysed together with their CS 1 performance. The strongest relationships were a significant, negative correlation between a surface approach to learning and CS 1 performance and a significant positive correlation between a strategic approach to learning and CS 1 performance. Participants were classified via a cluster analysis according {{to the extent to}} which they showed deep, strategic, and surface learning profiles. Members of the cluster favouring a surface approach had the poorest performances, whereas members of the cluster favouring strategic or deep approaches rather than a surface approach had the best performances...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to focus}} on {{developing}} critical understanding in human resource management (HRM) students in Aston Business School, UK. The paper reveals that innovative teaching methods encourage deep approaches to study, an indicator of students reaching their own understanding of material and ideas. This improves student employability and satisfies employer need. Design/methodology/approach – Student response to two second year business modules, matched for high student approval rating, was collected through focus group discussion. One module was taught using EBL and the story method, whilst the other used traditional teaching methods. Transcripts were analysed and compared using {{the structure of the}} <b>ASSIST</b> <b>measure.</b> Findings – Critical understanding and transformative learning can be developed through the innovative teaching methods of enquiry-based learning (EBL) and the story method. Research limitations/implications – The limitation {{is that this is a}} single case study comparing and contrasting two business modules. The implication is that the study should be replicated and developed in different learning settings, so that there are multiple data sets to confirm the research finding. Practical implications – Future curriculum development, especially in terms of HE, still needs to encourage students and lecturers to understand more about the nature of knowledge and how to learn. The application of EBL and the story method is described in a module case study – “Strategy for Future Leaders”. Originality/value – This is a systematic and comparative study to improve understanding of how students and lecturers learn and of the context in which the learning takes place...|$|E

The theory and real-time implementation is described for this computer based parameter identification method. Special computer <b>assisted</b> <b>measuring</b> techniques are conducted on a laboratory test setup, used to drive a commercially available 3 hp interior PM synchronous machine at up to 8000 rpm.

Magnetic non-linearities are accounted for by recomputation of the machine model over a wide range of operating points.

The FTIR spectra were acquired using the Video <b>Assisted</b> <b>Measure</b> option of the Bruker™ OPUS software (v. 5.0). For each spot, we acquired one spectrum in unpolarized infrared (IR) light and two spectra in polarized IR light taken at orthogonal orientations corresponding to maximum and minimum pleochroism under polarized light. The IR polarizer was gold-coated thallium bromide iodide, {{and it had}} 87 % polarization efficiency. The IR source was a mid-IR lamp, and a KBr beam splitter was used. Spectra were collected with a[*]×[*] 15 IR objective and a nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector, and the values were calculated over the range of 4, 000 to 700  cm- 1 at 4  cm- 1 resolution by averaging 100 scans.

40|$|Excessive {{loading of}} the {{articular}} cartilage {{is considered a}} biomechanical factor {{in the development of}} degenerative cartilage diseases in man. There are still insufficient systematic investigations of the underlying mechanisms, however. Continuous clinical observations have to be coupled with specific experimental research for this purpose.

40|$|Funding the {{reengineering}} and recapitalisation of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) will, in part, {{depend on}} the ability of SDI component coordinators to comprehend and report on the performance of their initiatives. This is important for both aspects, as for reengineering, the performance of an infrastructure can only be improved if it is measured.

Therefore, it is imperative that SDI coordinators develop metrics to evaluate, and report on performance.

40|$|Background: The {{world is}} facing an ageing population. Physical {{inactivity}} is considered as the fourth leading {{risk factor for}} non-communicable diseases. Walking is recognized as an affordable exercise to elderly people. However there is rarely any systematic review conducted to {{examine the effect of}} walking on quality of life of elderly people Objective: This systematic review of randomized controlled trials is to examine the effect of walking on quality of life (QoL) of older people. Methods: Articles were searched through Medline and Ovid by using keywords of “elderly people”, “aged, 50 or more”, “old people”, “elderly”, “the aged”, “walk”, “walking”, “QoL” and “quality of life”. PICO criteria were used for the criteria in selecting articles for this review. CONSORT 2010 checklist was used to assess the quality of included studies. Results and Discussion: 8 articles out of 237 articles from Medline and 883 articles from Ovid were included in this systematic review after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were from 4 different countries. Average age of the subjects was above 60. Subjects were randomized to intervention (walking) and control groups. Outcome measures were QoL indicators. There was significant improvement in various QoL dimensions while other studies have results of either no significant difference between intervention and control groups, or results favoring the control group. Subjects’ adherence was high in the initial phase, yet it was doubtful whether subjects could maintain the habit without the assistance of experimenter and the <b>assisting</b> <b>measures.</b> Conclusions: From this systematic review, the effect of walking on quality of life on elderly people is still unclear.

40|$|Extrusion {{processes}} and especially processes of PVC extrusion {{are based on}} the supply of mechanical energy. The use of mechanical energy results in a great wear of the production plant and material load. In this report, the development of microwave assisted extrusion processes is described. This development is based on polyvinylchloride and is proceeded at the Fraunhofer Institute of Chemical Technology (Pfinztal, Federal Republic of Germany). The advantages of the use of microwaves are: independence of thermal conduction, fastly controllable energization, improvement of the ecology and economy of processes. By means of microwave calorimetry, different PVC powders are characterized rapidly and exactly. Different mixtures of PVC powders with additives are investigated with regard to their heating up by means of microwaves at a frequency of 2. 5 GHz. Great differences in the group of lubricants and in the systems of stabilisators are manifested. Dry fillers absorb very small amounts of water. The composition of the mixtures do not influence the adsorption behavior of the mixtures. The use of microwave technique in order to heat up unpolar plastics requires highly microwave active additives. The authors have discovered additives and base chemicals which can be used for the activation of unpolar plastics by microwave absorption. A microwave assisted plastification of PVC in a laboratory is achieved for the first time by means of a microwave <b>assisted</b> <b>measuring</b> kneader. By modification of the kneader chamber of the measuring kneader, one part of the energy which is used for the plastification is supplied by microwaves. The efficiency of the microwaves is greater than 90 %. The microwave coupling shows a very good stability of high-frequency tuning against external influences by interference.
