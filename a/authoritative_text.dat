His Tiberian vocalization of the Bible is still, for all intents and purposes, the text all Jews continue to use, and he was the first systematic Hebrew grammarian.|$|E

25|$|Samkhya is an atheistic and {{strongly}} dualistic orthodox (Astika) school of Indian philosophy. The earliest surviving <b>authoritative</b> <b>text</b> on classical Samkhya philosophy is the Samkhyakarika (c. 350–450 CE) of Iśvarakṛṣṇa. The Samkhyakarika is {{silent on the}} issue of Isvara's existence or nonexistence, although first millennium commentators such as Gaudapada understand the text as compatible with some concept of God. However, the Samkhya Sutra (14th c. CE) and its commentaries explicitly attempt to disprove God's existence through reasoned argument.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Somali {{community}} has produced numerous important Islamic sheikhs and clerics over the centuries, {{many of whom}} have significantly shaped the course of Muslim learning and practice in the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and well beyond. Among these Islamic scholars is the 14th-century Somali theologian and jurist Uthman bin Ali Zayla'i of Zeila, who wrote the single most <b>authoritative</b> <b>text</b> on the Hanafi school of Islam, consisting of four volumes known as the Tabayin al-Haqa'iq li Sharh Kanz al-Daqa'iq.|$|E
25|$|As {{a writer}} {{he was an}} {{authority}} on veterinary and agricultural matters. For over forty years he edited the periodical, ‘North British Agriculturist’. His book entitled, Elementary Veterinary Science for Agricultural Students, Farmers, and Stock-Keepers, remains an <b>authoritative</b> <b>text</b> book 120 years after its first publication (1895) and is available in paperback form today. It went into seven editions, and was translated and referred to by all sides in the Great War. ‘Greens’ encyclopaedia (the leading authority of the day), contained thirty-six articles appearing under his name.|$|E

25|$|Alberdina Houtman {{and colleagues}} theorize {{that while the}} Mishnah was {{compiled}} {{in order to establish}} an <b>authoritative</b> <b>text</b> on halakhic tradition, a more conservative party opposed the exclusion of the rest of tradition and produced the Tosefta to avoid the impression that the written Mishnah was equivalent to the entire oral Torah. The original intention was that the two texts would be viewed on equal standing, but the succinctness of the Mishnah and the power and influence of Yehuda Ha-Nassi made it more popular among most students of tradition.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitutional}} {{provisions in}} relation to use of the official language in legislation at the State level largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their official language, Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these {{have the same rights}} to their mother tongue with the Speaker's permission. The <b>authoritative</b> <b>text</b> of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} the Trojan War are found in many works of Greek {{literature}} and depicted in numerous works of Greek art. There is no single, <b>authoritative</b> <b>text</b> which tells the entire {{events of the}} war. Instead, the story is assembled {{from a variety of}} sources, some of which report contradictory versions of the events. The most important literary sources are the two epic poems traditionally credited to Homer, the Iliad and the Odyssey, composed sometime between the 9th and 6th centuries BC. Each poem narrates only a part of the war. The Iliad covers a short period {{in the last year of}} the siege of Troy, while the Odyssey concerns Odysseus's return to his home island of Ithaca, following the sack of Troy.|$|E

25|$|The Institutes proved {{instantly}} popular, {{with many}} {{asking for a}} revised edition. In 1539, Calvin published a much larger work, with seventeen chapters of about the same length as the six chapters of the first edition. It includes many references to classical authors and Church fathers, {{as well as many}} additional references to the Bible. Calvin's epistle to the reader indicates that the new work is intended for theological students preparing for ministry. Four chapters were added in a third edition in 1543, and a 1550 edition was published with only minor changes. The fifth and final edition with which Calvin was involved, and which is used by scholars as the <b>authoritative</b> <b>text,</b> is 80% larger than the previous edition and was published in Geneva in 1559.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevailing}} astronomical {{model of}} the cosmos in Europe in the 1,400 {{years leading up to}} the 16th century was that created by the Roman citizen Claudius Ptolemy in his Almagest, dating from about 150 A.D. Throughout the Middle Ages it was spoken of as the <b>authoritative</b> <b>text</b> on astronomy, although its author remained a little understood figure frequently mistaken as one of the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt. The Ptolemaic system drew on many previous theories that viewed Earth as a stationary center of the universe. Stars were embedded in a large outer sphere which rotated relatively rapidly, while the planets dwelt in smaller spheres between—a separate one for each planet. To account for apparent anomalies in this view, such as the apparent retrograde motion of the planets, a system of deferents and epicycles was used. The planet was said to revolve in a small circle (the epicycle) about a center, which itself revolved in a larger circle (the deferent) about a center on or near the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Henry Gray {{wrote the}} {{original}} version of Gray's Anatomy with an audience of medical students and physicians in mind, especially surgeons. For many decades however, precisely because Gray's textbook became such a classic, successive editors made major efforts to preserve its position as possibly the most <b>authoritative</b> <b>text</b> on the subject in English. Toward this end, a long-term strategy {{appears to have been}} to make each edition come close to containing a fully comprehensive account of the anatomical medical understanding available at the time of publication. Given the explosion of medical knowledge in the 20th century, it is easily appreciated that this led to a vast expansion of the book, which threatened to collapse under its own weight in a metaphorical and physical sense. From the 35th edition onward, increased efforts were made to reverse this trend and keep the book readable by students. Nevertheless, the 38th edition contained 2,092 pages in large format – the highest page count of any and an increase from the 35th edition, which had 1,471 pages. The current 41st edition has 1,584 pages.|$|E

500|$|In the [...] "Preface" [...] to his edition, Johnson justifies {{trying to}} {{determine}} the original language of the Shakespearean plays.

500|$|Ulrich Bonnell Phillips {{wrote the}} first major {{historical}} study of the 20th century dealing with slavery. [...] In American Negro Slavery (1918), Phillips refers to slaves as [...] "negroes, who {{for the most part}} were by racial quality submissive rather than defiant, light-hearted instead of gloomy, amiable and ingratiating instead of sullen, and whose very defects invited paternalism rather than repression." [...] American Negro Slavery is infused with racial rhetoric and upholds perceptions about the inferiority of black people common in the southern United States at the time. Although African American academics such as W. E. B. Du Bois criticized Phillips's depiction of slaves, the book was considered the <b>authoritative</b> <b>text</b> on slavery in America until the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|The Satanic Bible is a {{collection}} of essays, observations, and rituals published by Anton LaVey in 1969. It is the central religious text of LaVeyan Satanism, and is considered the foundation of its philosophy and dogma. It has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism. Though The Satanic Bible is not considered to be sacred scripture {{in the way that the}} Christian Bible is to Christianity, LaVeyan Satanists regard it as an <b>authoritative</b> <b>text</b> as it is a contemporary text that has attained for them scriptural status. It extols the virtues of exploring one's own nature and instincts. Believers have been described as [...] "atheistic Satanists" [...] because they believe that God is not an external entity, but rather something that each person creates as a projection of his or her own personality—a benevolent and stabilizing force in his or her life. There have been thirty printings of The Satanic Bible, through which it has sold over a million copies.|$|E
