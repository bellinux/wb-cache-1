5|$|The Energy Savings Trust has {{estimated}} that micro-generation could provide a significantly increased proportion of the UK's electricity demand by 2050 although {{only a fraction of}} this would come from renewable sources. The current Scottish output is negligible. In May 2006 the then Communities Minister Malcolm Chisholm launched a Planning Advice Note aimed at promoting micro-renewables. Small-scale 'wind2heat' projects, which use wind turbines to power electrical storage heaters directly, have proven to be successful in remoter rural areas; as have various other local schemes such as <b>air</b> <b>source</b> heat pumps.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{management}} is {{obtained by the}} usual measures of engineering controls, administrative controls and procedures, and personal protective equipment, including hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA), protective equipment, medical screening, training and standardised procedures. Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they {{are an important part}} of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative <b>air</b> <b>source,</b> buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.|$|E
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static <b>air</b> <b>source,</b> which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E

25|$|Flutes can {{be played}} with several {{different}} <b>air</b> <b>sources.</b> Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The flue pipes of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, are blown by bellows or fans.|$|R
40|$|With {{huge amount}} of {{observed}} air quality and components data, it is of great challenge to analyze and trace the pollutant diffusion path. Partitioning the <b>air</b> pollution <b>sources</b> (<b>air</b> quality observation stations) into subnetworks will help a lot in tracing the air pollution diffusion path. Conventional <b>air</b> pollution <b>sources</b> clustering methods, {{which are based on}} geography or pollutant levels, present weak correlation with pollution transmission links. In order to overcome such problem, a method of <b>air</b> pollution <b>sources</b> clustering via activation force (AF) model is introduced in this paper. We model the connections of the pollution sources by AF so that the relationship among the observation stations and the coincidence of the transmission links can be modeled effectively. With the affinity matrix obtained via AF modeling, we conduct clustering of the <b>air</b> pollution <b>sources</b> via modularity measurement. Compared to K-means clustering method purely, which is based on the air quality index of pollutants, the proposed approach shows several advantages in air pollution network clustering...|$|R
25|$|A {{demand valve}} on a {{regulator}} {{connected to a}} separate independent diving cylinder would also be called an alternate <b>air</b> <b>source</b> and also a redundant <b>air</b> <b>source,</b> as it is totally independent of the primary <b>air</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E
25|$|Effective {{use of any}} {{alternate}} <b>air</b> <b>source</b> requires {{competence in}} the associated skill set. The procedures for receiving air from another diver or from one's own equipment are most effective and least {{likely to result in}} a life-threatening incident if well trained {{to the extent that they}} do not distract the diver from other essential matters. A major difference from buddy breathing is that the diver using a redundant alternative <b>air</b> <b>source</b> need not alternate breathing with the donor, which can be a substantial advantage in many circumstances. There is a further significant advantage when the alternate <b>air</b> <b>source</b> is carried by the diver using it, in that it is not necessary to locate the buddy before it is available, but this comes at the cost of extra equipment.|$|E

25|$|In some jurisdictions the {{stand-by}} diver must be supplied from an <b>air</b> <b>source</b> which {{is independent of}} that supplying the working divers, {{as the cause of}} an emergency may be failure or contamination of the main air supply to the working diver.|$|E
25|$|In {{underwater}} diving, {{an alternative}} <b>air</b> <b>source,</b> or more generally alternative breathing gas source, is a secondary supply of air or other breathing gas {{for use by}} the diver in an emergency.

25|$|Use {{of other}} {{emergency}} <b>air</b> <b>sources</b> such as octopus second stage, integrated DV/BC inflator units, bailout cylinders etc. also requires {{the learning of}} appropriate skills. These procedures are as complex as buddy breathing {{up to the point}} of sharing, and the fundamental difference is that the donor and recipient are not required to alternate breathing with a period when no air is available, which can be a big advantage. These alternatives to buddy breathing also require substantial learning and reinforcement to be reliable in a stressful situation.|$|R
25|$|The {{secondary}} {{demand valve}} {{can be a}} hybrid of a demand valve and a buoyancy compensator inflation valve.

25|$|The {{most urgent}} {{underwater}} emergencies usually involve a compromised breathing gas supply.

25|$|According to the US EPA, {{geothermal}} heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44% compared with air-source heat pumps {{and up to}} 72% compared with electric resistance heating.

25|$|In cold weather, {{the outdoor}} unit of an <b>air</b> <b>source</b> heat pump {{needs to be}} {{intermittently}} defrosted. This will cause the auxiliary or emergency heating elements (located in the air-handler) to be activated.

25|$|A pneumofathometer supply valve, which {{supplies}} gas to the pneumofathometer for the diver. This valve {{is usually}} near the main supply valve {{but with a}} different handle.

2500|$|The {{essential}} {{aspect of}} surface-supplied diving is that breathing gas is supplied from the surface, either from a specialized diving compressor, high-pressure cylinders, or both. In commercial and military surface-supplied diving, a backup source of breathing gas {{should always be}} present in case the primary supply fails. The diver may also wear a cylinder called a [...] "bail-out bottle," [...] which can provide self-contained breathing gas in an emergency.

25|$|When {{there is}} a high {{temperature}} differential (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of, say, 0Â°C (32Â°F)), it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to Carnot efficiency limits, the heat pump's performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (outside temperature gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at â273Â°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around â18Â°C (0Â°F) for <b>air</b> <b>source</b> heat pumps.|$|E
25|$|A pony bottle {{is a small}} {{independently}} filled diving cylinder, {{often of}} only a few litres capacity, which forms part of an extended scuba set and which is fitted with its own independent regulator. In an emergency, such as exhaustion of the diver's main air supply, it can be used as an alternate <b>air</b> <b>source</b> in place of a controlled emergency swimming ascent. The key attribute of a pony bottle is that it provides a totally independent and redundant source of breathing gas for the diver. A pony bottle is a specific configuration of bailout cylinder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Air</b> <b>source</b> {{heat pumps}} are {{relatively}} easy and inexpensive {{to install and}} have therefore historically been {{the most widely used}} heat pump type. However, they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source. The higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency. In mild weather, COP may be around 4.0, while at temperatures below around 0Â°C (32Â°F) an air-source heat pump may still achieve a COP of 2.5. The average COP over seasonal variation is typically 2.5-2.8, with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates.|$|E
