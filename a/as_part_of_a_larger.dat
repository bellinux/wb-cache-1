5|$|A seminal work by Adam Hardy (1995) {{examined}} the Karnataka temple-building tradition {{over a period}} of 700years, from the 7th century to the 13th century, and reviewed more than 200temples built by four dynasties; Badami Chalukya, Rashtrakuta, Western Chalukya and Hoysala. The study covered dravida and nagara style monuments and the differences between the dravida tradition in modern Karnataka and that of neighbouring Tamil Nadu and made it possible to interpret the many architectural details <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scheme.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{international}} investigations {{took place in}} the early 2000s regarding the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. The Brazilian government investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees in 2008.

Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes. German authorities found that citizens were using insurance policies of a Bermuda-based Credit Suisse subsidiary to earn tax-free interest.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{molecular}} clock estimation, Trigonognathus {{is thought to}} have originated around 41 million years ago during the Middle Eocene, <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> evolutionary radiation of etmopterid genera. The genus is represented in this time period by the extinct species T. virginiae, whose fossilized teeth have been recovered from Lutetian age (47.8–41.3 Mya) strata in Landes, southwestern France. Fossil teeth virtually identical to those of the modern viper dogfish are known from the Cubagua Formation in northeastern Venezuela, which dates to the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene (11.6–3.6 Mya).|$|E
5|$|Cladistic {{studies have}} {{consistently}} {{found that the}} closest relatives of the kitefin shark are the cookiecutter sharks (Isistius), with which they share several dentitional, skeletal, and muscular similarities.

5|$|Moldova's {{constitution}} forbids {{the country}} from joining a military alliance, but some politicians, such as Moldovan Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinuța, have suggested joining NATO <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> European integration. Moldova joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994, and initiated an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2010. Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO officials warned that Russia might seek to annex Transnistria, a breakaway Moldovan region. This separatist issue could preclude Moldova from joining NATO.|$|E

5|$|NY195 {{remained}} unchanged up to April10, 1980, when the designation was officially {{removed from the}} route.

These sortied {{in response to}} U.S. Navy air raids on Wake Island. No contact between the two forces was made, and the Japanese task force returned to Truk on 26 October 1943. She soon left Truk for home waters, and on 16 December 1943, Kongō arrived at Sasebo for refits and training in the Inland Sea.|$|E
5|$|Quarrying {{was carried}} out in the castle grounds during the 18th century, and the {{gatehouse}} leading into the outer bailey was demolished to build a track for the stones to be removed from the site. In 1840 the castle was purchased by John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache, at that time the largest landowner in Cheshire, <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> estate.

5|$|All {{dates of}} the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which {{was applied to the}} coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata is {{classified}} in the subgenus Amanita of the genus Amanita, according to the systems proposed by Cornelis Bas (1969), and Rolf Singer (1986). It was one of 49 Amanita species included in a 1998 molecular phylogenetic analysis intended to help clarify natural groups and phylogenetic relationships within the genus. In the cladogram, A.rubrovolvata is on a branch next to a cluster of species including A.pantherina var. lutea, A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.sinensis. These results were comparable to those published in later phylogenetic analyses (1999, 2004, 2010) that have included A.rubrovolata <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> dataset.|$|E

This does not happen with Canada's Walk of Fame, although some may have an individual star but are also included <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> group, such as John Candy, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who have their own star but also were in Second City Television.|$|E
5|$|During his {{childhood}} Downey had minor roles in his father's films. He made his acting debut {{at the age}} of five, playing a sick puppy in the absurdist comedy Pound (1970), and then at seven appeared in the surrealist Greaser's Palace (1972). At the age of ten, he was living in England and studied classical ballet <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> curriculum. He attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York as a teenager. When his parents divorced in 1978, Downey moved to California with his father, but in 1982 he dropped out of Santa Monica High School and moved back to New York to pursue an acting career full-time.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's New Jersey portion in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers began to use the alignment of Route31 as a toll-free alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike.

The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike instead. In themid-2000s, the portion of Route31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and Clinton that widened the road to four lanes.|$|E
