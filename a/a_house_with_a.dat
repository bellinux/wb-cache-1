5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop a loud voice if kept in <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat {{has a lot of}} energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E

The house is {{described}} as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter {{the house with a}} few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E

5|$|Glinda and Elphaba {{meet again}} at the site where Nessarose has been crushed by <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl named Dorothy inside. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument. The guards arrive, and Elphaba guesses that Glinda {{arranged}} for all of this. Fiyero arrives as well, and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba can escape. Glinda realizes that Fiyero does truly love Elphaba, and tells the guards not to hurt him, but they don't listen as they escort Fiyero to the field where they can interrogate him into revealing where Elphaba has fled to so they can recapture her. Elphaba tries to cast a spell {{to save his life}} and protect him from injury, but is frustrated by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West ("No Good Deed").|$|E
5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{removed the}} twin houses {{to build his}} much larger Mahandrihono residence, which was {{decorated}} with silver birds and chains. He also expanded the compound and added a second enclosure of voafotsy wood (replaced annually) around {{the exterior of the}} stone walls. Mandraimanjaka was removed and in its place Andrianampoinimerina built <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small tower, which he named Manjakamiadana ("where it is good to rule"), designating it as the residence for the royal sampy (idol) called Imanjakatsiroa and the guardians assigned to protect it. Two other idols were kept nearby: Ifantaka, kept in a house in the Bevato compound, and Kelimalaza, guarded in its house at the Ambohimanga neighborhood of Ambohimirary. Under Radama I, the stone wall was reinforced with palisades that enclosed three houses, two of which were twin houses like those that Andriambelomasina had built. Ranavalona I enlarged the compound's courtyard and expanded Manjakamiadana. She constructed the stone walls that currently enclose the compound, as well as its two stone gateways. Ranavalona II re-added palisades to the compound's stone walls. She demolished Manjakamiadana and in its place constructed two hybrid Malagasy-European pavilions using wood from the historic and spiritually significant Masoandro house, which had been removed from the royal compound of Antananarivo by Ranavalona I. French general Joseph Gallieni used these European-influenced buildings as his summer residence {{in the early years of}} the French colonial period. In 2013, Andrianampoinimerina's original house, the reconstructed tombs, and the two royal pavilions are preserved in the compound, which also includes a watchtower, a pen for sacrificial zebu, and two pools constructed during the reign of Ranavalona I.|$|E

25|$|The form of {{the houses}} was also {{constrained}} by the narrow lots, resulting in buildings much deeper than they were wide. Even some of the bungalows built in the mid-20th century on vacant or redeveloped lots within the district were positioned so that the side gable faced the street, with the main entrance likewise located {{on the side of}} the lot. In a few cases, two lots were consolidated to build <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wide front.|$|E

25|$|In 1852 {{the family}} moved about a mile further along York Street to a more spacious home in a newly-built terrace, {{opposite}} St Luke's Church, with greater access to outdoor space. Barely a year later, with his wife pregnant for a fifth time, Hodgson died suddenly of a stroke, leaving the family without an income. Frances was cared for by her grandmother while her mother took over running the family business. From her grandmother, who bought her books, Frances learned to love reading, in particular her first book, The Flower Book, which had coloured illustrations and poems. Because of their reduced income, Eliza {{had to give up}} their family home and moved with her children to live with relatives in Seedley Grove, Tanners Lane, Pendleton, Salford, where they lived in <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large enclosed garden in which Frances enjoyed playing.|$|E
25|$|Back in the UK he was curate of Bramley, Leeds, {{including}} the curacy of Holy Trinity Hough End, 1930–1931. He was vicar of St Augustine's, Halifax, West Yorkshire, and chaplain for Halifax Poor Law Institute 1931–1938. He was vicar of Coley, West Yorkshire, 1938–1947, and of Marton 1947–1950. He was vicar of Thurstonland 1950–1953. In 1950 the Thurstonland living was £450 and <b>a</b> <b>house,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> parish population of 4132.

25|$|From 1899 the {{competitive}} pilot system was abolished {{and a new}} piloting law was introduced, establishing the Naval Pilot Authority. By 1910 {{there was only one}} pilot left at Fedje. This was dramatically changed during the First World War, when series of British convoys traveled up and down the coast. Soon there were four pilots stationed at Fedje, and when needed experienced fishermen were also used. After {{the end of the war}} in 1918 things settled down and from 1920 there was only a single pilot working out of Fedje. This was further increased to two in 1927. During the 1930s each of them had an average thirty missions per year. Pilots were required to have <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good view of the open sea towards the direction of the sea lane. Of this reason placing houses at Hesthaugen was popular amongst the pilots. There was a new boom in pilot demand during the Second World War, with an average 69 missions per year.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{settlers}} were from northern Italy, {{particularly from the}} Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. Part of the population included Slovenians who were escaping from persecution in Fascist Italy, as well as Poles and Czechoslovaks who were admitted after Italy introduced a new policy that restricted their immigration to Italy from Poland and Czechoslovakia, respectively. The inhabitants initially paid a 10% deposit of {{the total value of}} the land they received, which was delivered fenced and ploughed. The extensions included <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> porch, bathroom and well. The houses built on the 10 and 15 hectare extensions came with four bedrooms, while the ones built on the 5 hectare lots had two. The development plan of the Colonization Company encouraged crop diversification and promoted the cultivation of alfalfa, vineyards, pear trees, and apple trees. In 1925, {{the settlers}} worked every Sunday for a month to build a 1.5km (.93mi) path; they later built a church and a graveyard at the end of it. The next year, the train station of Villa Regina was inaugurated.|$|E
