5|$|Cheney's {{political}} career began in 1969, {{as an intern}} for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration. He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969–70. He held several positions {{in the years that}} followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} series, divisions in ship assignments were denoted by shirt color; for the movie, these color codes {{were moved to}} small patches on each person's uniform. The Starfleet delta symbol, which previously indicated duty branches—command, science, medical, engineering, and so forth—was replaced with the command symbol for all branches, superimposed over a circle of color indicating area of service. The blue color of previous uniforms was discarded, for fear they might interfere with the blue screens used for optical effects. Three types of uniforms were fabricated: dress uniforms used for special occasions, Class A uniforms for regular duty, and Class B uniforms as an alternative. The Class A designs were double-stitched in gabardine and featured gold braid designating rank. It was felt that the traditional four gold sleeve stripes for the captain's rank was too blatantly militaristic. Povill had to send out <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> Fletcher with the modified stripe rank system, as the designer continued to get the 20th and 23rd centuries confused. Fletcher designed the Class B uniform as similar to evolved T-shirts, with shoulder boards used to indicate rank and service divisions. Each costume had the shoes built into the pant leg to further the futuristic look. An Italian shoemaker decorated by the Italian government for making Gucci shoes was tasked with creating the futuristic footwear. Combining the shoes and trousers was difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, as each shoe had to be sewn by hand after being fitted to each principal actor. There were difficulties in communication, as the shoemaker spoke limited English and occasionally confused shoe orders due to similar-sounding names. Jumpsuits, serving a more utilitarian function, were the only costumes to have pockets, and were made with a heavyweight spandex that required a special needle to puncture the thick material. A variety of field jackets, leisure wear, and spacesuits were also created; as these parts had to be designed and completed before most of the actors' parts had been cast, many roles were filled by considering how well the actors would fit into existing costumes.|$|E

25|$|Most of what {{is known}} about the actual {{proceedings}} of the meetings comes from notes kept by Durant which were later submitted as <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> the NSC and commonly referred to as the Durant Report.

25|$|Under the {{direction}} of Frederick Lindemann, an extensive series of {{studies were carried out}} by Derek Jackson at RAF Coltishall. Starting in September, aircraft with Mk. IV and Mk. VII were tested against window in a series of 30 flights. Much to everyone's consternation, Jackson concluded that the Mk. VII's spiral-scan display proved to be affected by window more than the simpler display of the Mk. IV. When he learned the results, Douglas wrote <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> the Air Ministry asking that window be held back until new radars could be developed that were not as susceptible to its effects.|$|E
25|$|In February 1971 the {{principal}} circulated <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> all employees outlining {{a new dress}} code, apparently motivated by the administration's belief that {{public support for the}} district's bond issues was in part motivated by the teachers' appearance. Doyle, as an association official, had been aware that the administration was considering such a measure but had been led to believe that the association would have had some input before it was announced. He thus shared the memo with a friend at Cincinnati radio station WSAI, which used it as the basis for an on-air news item.|$|E
25|$|In {{the light}} of these potent signs of a great disturbance, the Criminal Investigation Department sent <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> the Colonial Secretary {{suggesting}} moving Maria back to York Hill to avoid further inciting Muslim anger. The Secretary did not agree on grounds that he had received no such representations from Muslim leaders, nor did he {{have the authority to}} remove Maria without further court orders– weak excuses since Maria could be relocated with her mother's consent. Nonetheless, it cannot be said definitively that moving Maria out of the convent at such a late stage could have averted the riots.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, on March 14, 2003, {{five days}} before the US started its 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, the OLC issued <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> William J.

In reaction to the release of the abuse pictures from Abu Ghraib in Iraq in April and May 2004, and the leak that summer of the Bybee memo, the administration advised agencies to suspend actions based on those memos. CIA suspended the use of enhanced interrogation techniques.|$|E
25|$|On 30 June 1940 the Germans landed {{troops on}} the Channel Islands. Two days later, the British prime minister, Winston Churchill sent <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> his chief staff officer, General Hastings Ismay, asking him to begin {{planning}} an operation for a raid on the islands {{as soon as possible}} and stating that he felt that it would be the type of operations that the newly formed Commandos would be suited for.

25|$|De Gaulle's rank of brigadier-general became {{effective}} on 1 June 1940. That {{day he was}} in Paris. After a visit to his tailor to be fitted for his general’s uniform, he visited Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time, then the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France’s honour and asked him for his advice. On 2 June he sent <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> Weygand vainly urging that the French armoured divisions be consolidated from four weak divisions into three stronger ones and concentrated into an armoured corps under his command.

25|$|Haig {{had long}} thought French petty, jealous, {{unbalanced}} ("like {{a bottle of}} soda water … incapable of thinking … and coming to a reasoned decision"), overly quick to meddle in party politics and easily manipulated by Henry Wilson. Haig was increasingly irritated by French's changes of orders and mercurial changes of mood as {{to the length of}} the war, which French now expected to last into 1916. Haig still thought Germany might collapse by November, although {{at the same time he}} was sending <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> the War Office recommending that the BEF, now numbering 25 divisions, be equipped with the maximum number of heavy guns, ready for a huge decisive battle, 36 divisions strong in 1916.|$|E
25|$|Tryon showed {{concern for}} the {{wellbeing}} of his men and the better ordering of the Navy. Before Raleigh had left England, thirty men had deserted from the ship, and more {{took the opportunity to}} escape from ships of the squadron at Montevideo. Tryon wrote <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> the Admiralty recommending that the penalties for desertion should be reduced, suggesting that a number of those deserting were of little use to the navy and should be let go, while others who were good seamen, but who had some urgent personal reason for absconding, were afraid to return later because of the severe penalties. He also instituted a programme of weighing his men and ensuring they got enough food, noting that if, as frequently happened on board ship, the men weighed less by the end of a tour than at the start, then likely their strength and fitness was reduced too. He instituted a 'dry canteen' on board to try to improve their diet.|$|E
25|$|The end of 1912 saw {{the end of}} a year of {{political}} struggle for Law. As well as the problem of Home Rule, there were internal party struggles; supporters of the Church of England or military reform lambasted Law for not paying attention to their causes, and tariff reformers argued with him over his previous compromise on food duties. Despite this, most Conservatives realised that as a fighting leader, Law could not be bettered. The results of by-elections throughout 1913 continued to favour them, but progress on the Home Rule Bill was less encouraging; on 7 July it was again passed by the Commons, and again rejected by the Lords on 15 July. Parliament rose for the summer recess on 15 August, and Law and the Unionists spent the summer trying to convince the King to voice an opinion on the issue. Their first suggestion was that he should withhold the Royal Assent on it, something that horrified Law's constitutional law adviser A.V. Dicey. The second was more reasonable– they argued that the Liberals had put the King in an impossible position by asking him to ratify a bill that would infuriate half of the population. His only option was to write <b>a</b> <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> Asquith saying this and requesting that the problem of home rule be put to the electorate via a general election. After thinking on this, the King agreed, and handed a note to Asquith on 11 August requesting either an election or an all-party conference.|$|E
