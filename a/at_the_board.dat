5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E

In 1917, during the First World War, Pick was appointed to be head of the Mines Directorate's Household Fuel and Lighting Department <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> of Trade where Albert Stanley was the President. Pick {{was responsible for the}} control of the rationing and distribution of domestic fuel supplies. He remained in this position until June 1919.

25|$|Alfred Milner {{remained}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> of Inland Revenue until 1897. He {{was regarded}} as one of the clearest-headed and most judicious officials in the British service, and his position as a man of moderate Liberal views, who had been so closely associated with Goschen at the Treasury, Cromer in Egypt and Hicks-Beach (Lord St Aldwyn) and Sir William Vernon Harcourt while at the Inland Revenue, marked him as one in whom all parties might have confidence. The moment for testing his capacity in the highest degree had now come.|$|E

The Home Office proposed to introduce measures that would raise the age limit for international marriage visas from 18 to 21, which would impact on the strictly orthodox community. He was part of a delegation that met with the immigration minister in March 2008 to express their concerns over the proposal.|$|E

25|$|To give an example, two chess players {{might be}} engaged in a bitter {{struggle}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>board,</b> but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, {{that no one else}} will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).|$|E
25|$|Young {{was later}} {{appointed}} the senior admiral <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> {{of the court}} martial held against Gambier in July 1809, to investigate Gambier's actions at the Battle of the Basque Roads. Gambier's principle critic was Lord Cochrane, {{who went on to}} accuse Young of undue bias in Gambier's favour, but Cochrane had already clashed with Young over the matter of prize money, and had accused Young of inefficiency in outfitting ships during his time at Plymouth when Cochrane was MP for Westminster. Young did object to Cochrane's discursive answers during the court martial, but {{does not seem to have}} been any more hostile than the other members of the board.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, Ormonde {{lived in}} {{retirement}} at Cornbury in Oxfordshire, a house lent {{to him by}} Lord Clarendon, but emerged in 1687 to offer opposition <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> of the Charterhouse to James's attempt to assume the dispensing power and force upon the institution a Roman Catholic candidate without taking the oaths. Ormonde also refused the king his support in {{the question of the}} Indulgence; James, to his credit, refused to take away his offices, and continued to hold him in respect and favour to the last. Despite his long service to Ireland he admitted that he had no wish to spend his last years there.|$|E
