5|$|Academically, the University of Toronto {{is noted}} for {{influential}} movements and curricula in literary criticism and communication theory, known collectively as the Toronto School.

5|$|After her {{training}} {{exercises in the}} Atlantic and the Pacific were finished, New Mexico was overhauled and modernized at the Philadelphia Harbor by the Navy from March 1931 to January 1933. The overhaul included the replacement of her turbo-electric drive with more conventional geared turbines, which were made by Curtis. In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed. After the overhaul, she returned the Pacific to continue training exercises <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> tactical operations.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{were among}} the wild animals hunted for food before the Neolithic {{revolution}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> agriculture. For example, in the Epipaleolithic of the Levant, between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both waterfowl and migratory birds were eaten. Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially {{registered}} synagogues {{and prayer}} houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life {{had moved to}} new centres like Podgórze. This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.|$|E

The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers, although some were also hunters, fishers, or government employees working in mines or the salt marshes.
