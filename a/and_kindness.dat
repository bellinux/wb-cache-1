5|$|General Woundwort: The main antagonist: a fearless, cunning and brutally {{efficient}} rabbit who was orphaned {{at a young}} age, Woundwort {{founded the}} Efrafa warren and is its tyrannical chief. Though larger and stronger than Bigwig, he lacks mercy <b>and</b> <b>kindness.</b> He even leads an attack to destroy the Watership warren {{as an act of}} revenge against Bigwig stealing does from Efrafa, which is narrowly defeated by Hazel's ingenuity and Bigwig's bravery. After his apparent death fighting the Nuthanger farm dog, he lives on in rabbit legend as a bogeyman.|$|E
5|$|In Sir Thursday, {{readers are}} also {{introduced}} to the power issues that Arthur begins to struggle with – his natural compassion and desire for fairness <b>and</b> <b>kindness,</b> against the characteristics displayed by other senior denizens and Dame Primus, {{and the influence of}} the key. In addition, the idea of Arthur losing his mortality and becoming an immortal Denizen of the House, represented by the silver/gold crocodile ring that was introduced in Drowned Wednesday, is further explored, with Arthur often choosing to refrain from using the key – and the power it represents – to ensure he remains human.|$|E

5|$|Memories of {{more than}} a score of years of devoted service enhance the sense of {{personal}} loss which Miss LeHand's passing brings. Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact <b>and</b> <b>kindness</b> of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which made her a real genius in getting things done. Her memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by all the members of our family but by the wide circle of those whose duties brought them into contact with her.|$|E
5|$|Although Heber's episcopate {{had been}} brief {{he had made}} a {{considerable}} impression, and news of his death brought many tributes from around India. Sir Charles Grey, an old Oxford friend who was serving as Calcutta's Chief Justice, spoke of Heber's cheerfulness, his lack of self-importance, his good humour, patience <b>and</b> <b>kindness.</b> Flags were flown at half-mast in Madras and Calcutta, and the Governor-General ordered a salute of 42 guns—one for each completed year of the bishop's life. In several cities public subscriptions were opened to raise funds for monuments. In St John's church in Trichinopoly, initially a simple plaque above the grave recorded the date and place of Heber's death; this was in due course made much more elaborate. In St George's church, Madras, a large sculpture by Francis Chantrey was erected, depicting Heber ministering to members of his flock. Reflecting Heber's interest in the training of local ordinands, further funds were raised to provide Heber scholarships at Bishop's College; in Trichinopoly a school founded by the German missionary Christian Friedrich Schwarz became the Heber Memorial School.|$|E
5|$|Fates is {{primarily}} {{set in the}} territories of the kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr. Their royalty share a similar line of descent from ancient dragons, but each kingdom worships different dragon deities, and so exist {{in a state of}} war. Little do they know that there is also another dragon deity; the dragon Anankos, ruler of the kingdom of Valla. This realm is located under the Bottomless Canyon which separates Hoshido and Nohr. Anankos has usurped the throne of Valla and is intentionally provoking war between the two kingdoms. In the Hidden Truths DLC, it is revealed that Anankos was formerly a kind dragon who gave wisdom to humanity, but his growing power and inability to ascend to the spirit realm with the world's other dragons began corrupting him. After he killed Valla's king in an uncontrolled fit of bestial rage, he finally went mad: his remaining sanity <b>and</b> <b>kindness</b> took temporary shelter in a human form and fathered the Avatar before dying, while his dragon self began an insane crusade to destroy humanity.|$|E

5|$|In his profession, Coward {{was widely}} admired and loved for his {{generosity}} <b>and</b> <b>kindness</b> {{to those who}} fell on hard times. Stories are told of the unobtrusive {{way in which he}} relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the Actors Orphanage, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward {{to play a role in}} The Italian Job. Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.|$|E

25|$|Representations of the bodhisattva in China {{prior to}} the Song dynasty (960–1279) were {{masculine}} in appearance. Images which later displayed attributes of both genders {{are believed to be}} in accordance with the Lotus Sutra, where Avalokitesvara has the supernatural power of assuming any form required to relieve suffering, and also has the power to grant children. Because this bodhisattva is considered the personification of compassion <b>and</b> <b>kindness,</b> a mother goddess and patron of mothers and seamen, the representation in China was further interpreted in an all-female form around the 12th century. In the modern period, Guanyin is most often represented as a beautiful, white-robed woman, a depiction which derives from the earlier Pandaravasini form.|$|E

25|$|According to William Manchester, General Douglas MacArthur was a chivalric warrior {{who fought}} {{a war with}} the {{intention}} to conquer the enemy, completely eliminating their ability to strike back, then treated them with the understanding <b>and</b> <b>kindness</b> due their honour and courage. One prominent model of his chivalrous conduct was in World War II and his treatment of the Japanese {{at the end of}} the war. MacArthur's model provides a way to win a war with as few casualties as possible and how to get the respect of the former enemy after the occupation of their homeland. On May 12, 1962, MacArthur gave a famous speech in front of the cadets of United States Military Academy at West Point by referring to a great moral code, the code of conduct and chivalry, when emphasizing duty, honour, and country.|$|E

After the German invasion and occupation of France during World War II, and the deportation of French Jews to the Nazi concentration camps, Werfel had to flee again. With the assistance of Varian Fry and the Emergency Rescue Committee in Marseille, he and his wife narrowly escaped the Nazi regime, finding shelter for five weeks in the pilgrimage town of Lourdes. He also received much help <b>and</b> <b>kindness</b> from the Catholic orders that staffed the shrine. He vowed to write about the experience and, safe in America, he published The Song of Bernadette in 1941.|$|E
25|$|Slaying the Dragon, Ching's fact-based 2012 opera, explores {{intolerance}} and redemption, and {{was inspired}} by the 1990s true story Not by the Sword by Kathryn Watterson. The two-act opera's libretto is by Ellen Frankel, and it was premiered in June 2012 by Philadelphia's Center City Opera Theater, which commissioned the work. The opera {{is the story of a}} Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon whose life is transformed by the friendship <b>and</b> <b>kindness</b> of a local rabbi and his wife. The man renounces his Klan association and begins to speak out publicly for tolerance; his terminal illness eventually incapacitates him and he moves into the rabbi's home, converting to Judaism before dying. The score balances the dark themes of bigotry and intolerance with an eclectic variety of ethnic music including Yiddish folk songs, Vietnamese children’s songs, Jewish sacred music, Aryan rock, Broadway scores, gospel music, and country-western tunes.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, Kelly met a man named Jake Hanson (played by Grant Show), an emotionally guarded biker who was {{slightly}} older than she. While Jake ultimately resisted their romance, citing Kelly's age, he admitted to admiring her for her heart <b>and</b> <b>kindness.</b> This story line was used to launch the spin-off series Melrose Place. Eventually, Kelly was revealed to have a notable conscience during a summer fling with Dylan McKay, the boyfriend of her friend Brenda, often being the voice of reason during their affair. Kelly went through a period of minor depression during her senior year in high school in season 3. The stress of having feelings for Dylan, someone who she could not pursue because of his relationship with Brenda, added to her struggles. Even when Kelly dated Dylan out in the open, following his relationship with Brenda, it caused her to temporarily lose Brenda as a friend.|$|E
