5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding at ground level. The tooth structure indicates combined slicing <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Mercury was {{ingested}} {{through the}} consumption of homemade bread, meat and other animal products obtained from livestock given treated barley, vegetation grown from soil contaminated with mercury, game birds that had fed on the grain and fish caught in rivers, canals, and lakes into which treated grain had been dumped by the farmers. Ground seed dust inhalation was a contributing factor in farmers during sowing <b>and</b> <b>grinding.</b> Consumption of ground flour through homemade bread {{is thought to have}} been the major cause, since no cases were reported in urban areas, where government flour supplies were commercially regulated.|$|E
5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the alveolar bone.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E
5|$|Industrial use of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Puppet theater, waterwheel-powered: The {{mechanical}} toys of Roman Egypt, {{especially the}} weight-driven puppet theater of Heron of Alexandria (c. 10–70 AD), {{are well known}} and discussed by historians such as Beck, Prou, and de Rochas d'Aiglun. In China, Zhang Heng (78–139) wrote of plays with artificial fish and dragons, while a 6th-century text Xijing Zaji states that when Liu Bang (reigned as Emperor Gaozu of Han from 202–195 BC) came upon the treasury of the deceased Qin Shihuang (r. 221–210) in 206 BC, he found an entire mechanical orchestra of 1m (3ft) tall puppets dressed in silk and playing mouth organs, all powered by pulling ropes and blowing into tubes. As written in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the engineer Ma Jun (fl. 220–265)—already associated with the differential gear system of the south-pointing chariot—invented a mechanical theater powered by a rotating wooden waterwheel for the entertainment of Emperor Ming's (r. 226–239 AD) court. With the waterwheel in motion, a number of mechanical puppets performed tricks, such as singing girls who played music and danced, other puppets who would beat drums and sound flutes when one puppet entered the scene, puppets dancing on balls, throwing swords, hanging upside down on rope ladders, etc. Other mechanical puppets dressed as government officials did tasks in their offices, puppets dressed as laborers did jobs of pounding <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> (trip hammer and millstone), while others watched cockfighting, all moving simultaneously. Water-powered puppet theaters {{in the tradition of}} Ma Jun were created in later dynasties as well.|$|E

25|$|Threading is {{the process}} of {{creating}} a screw thread. More screw threads are produced each year than any other machine element.

50|$|Yields depend {{primarily}} on temperature, brew time, <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> size, <b>and</b> {{in a complex}} way on method. Yield is inverse to grind size (smaller grinds have more surface area, so extract faster) and increases roughly linear with time, as the extraction proceeds. Thus for a given temperature <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> size, there is an ideal brew time, with larger grinds requiring longer brewing. French press features the largest grinds of conventional methods, hence the longest brewing, {{on the order of}} 3-4 minutes, while filter coffee has smaller <b>grinds</b> <b>and</b> shorter brewing, and espresso has yet smaller <b>grinds</b> <b>and</b> shorter brewing, on the order of 20-30 seconds.|$|R
