According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E
500|$|Accrington Stanley re-signed McEvilly on {{a one-year}} {{contract}} following his departure from Wrexham. On his return to Accrington he commented; [...] "I am back here because I feel I have unfinished business. I played well for a year here <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same again". He had played 10 games in League Two and one game in the League Cup failing to score, and picking up a red card for violent conduct after a stamp on Peterborough United winger Jamie Day in their 2–0 home loss on 1 September. However, McEvilly struggled to hold down a regular place in the Accrington side and was loaned out to former club, Rochdale in November 2007. On his return to Spotland Stadium, he scored the only goal of Rochdale's 1–0 win over Mansfield Town on 24 November, with a shot {{from the edge of}} the penalty area. McEvilly made a total of seven appearances for Rochdale scoring three goals, before returning in January 2008. He made one more appearance for Accrington, coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute for Paul Mullin in the 2–0 defeat to Stockport County on 12 January, before joining Cambridge United on loan on 18 January. McEvilly made 14 appearances and scored three goals for Cambridge, helping them finish second place in the 2007–08 Conference National, securing a place in the playoffs. In Cambridge's playoff semi-final first leg, they drew 2–2 with Burton Albion away at the Pirelli Stadium with McEvilly scoring both Cambridge's goals. Cambridge were 2–0 down and McEvilly came on as a substitute for Mark Beesley in the 74th minute. Paul Hurst was deemed to have handled in the penalty area, and four minutes later McEvilly converted the penalty four minutes after coming off the bench. He scored his second goal from a direct free kick. In the following leg, McEvilly started the game and had a shot within the opening 30 seconds which Rob Wolleaston managed to score from the rebound, before being replaced by Leo Fortune-West in the 77th minute. McEvilly played in the final, in which Exeter City defeated Cambridge 1–0 at Wembley Stadium.|$|E

As a youth, she was inspired by Project Mercury and the Apollo moon landing program.

2500|$|During this period, Tidwell {{would often}} return home from New York to Virginia Beach, to be [...] "rejuvenated" [...] and {{teach at the}} studio with his mother. [...] While still active in dance, Tidwell's career was losing focus, and his mother feared that he was losing his love for dance. That changed in late 2006 when the two went to see Tidwell's brother, Travis, perform in the So You Think You Can Dance tour in Madison Square Gardens. Travis had come in second place during the {{previous}} season, and was heavily featured in the touring show. His mother recalled, [...] "At Madison Square Garden, Danny {{looked at me with}} tears in his eyes and said, 'I want to do that.

2500|$|Many critics blamed Paramount's initial ad {{campaign}} for the film not finding a mainstream audience. The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern praised Douglas' work in the film, but criticized the poster, which featured a headshot of Douglas: [...] "a raffishly eccentric role, and he's never been so appealing. (Don't be {{put off by the}} movie's cryptic poster, which makes him look like Michael J. Pollard.)" [...] The Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan also slammed the poster: [...] "The film's ad poster brings Elmer Fudd to mind." [...] Hanson said that the poster made Douglas look [...] "like he was trying to be Robin Williams". In an interview with Amy Taubin, Hanson said, [...] "The very things that made Michael <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the movie so badly were the reasons it was so tricky to market. Since films go out on so many screens at once, there's a need for instant appeal. But Wonder Boys isn't easily reducible to a single image or a catchy ad line".|$|E
