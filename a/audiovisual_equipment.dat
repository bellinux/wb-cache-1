40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at {{discussing the}} relationship between the school and the use of audiovisuals, mainly, cinema. The starting point is that even though schools are more equipped than ever, the insertion of the cinema in schools is not effective. With the advance of technology and the improvement of <b>audiovisual</b> <b>equipments,</b> nowadays, great movie productions are accessible to most part of the population through VHS and DVD. Such growth seemed to be ignored by schools, and it is noticed that public administrations publicize largely that schools are equipped with the necessary equipments for the reproduction of films, but with no preoccupation {{when it comes to the}} courses for teachers and educators for the task. This piece of work also discusses the historical importance of the language and its way of cumulated historical knowledge to be transmitted by the school to its members. The hypothesis of this dissertation that movie language besides being a pedagogical tool is also a knowledge tool that allows a broader perception of reality, and that the courses for teachers do not prepare the professionals for an adequate use of this resource and its language were confirmed during the research, leading to the conclusion that the school still uses new languages, technologies and knowledge in a disjointed, inadequate and insufficient ways that leads to inferior results that could be achieved through the effective use of these languages, technologies and knowledge...|$|R

Technology, legal, and other barriers continue to thwart faculty finding and accessing the segments of video they want for teaching and lectures.

40|$|According {{to recent}} Association of Research Libraries (ARL) statistics, {{the cost of}} {{employing}} a student assistant is approximately 25 % of the hourly wage of a librarian (ARL 1997). From this cost perspective alone, {{there is a strong}} incentive for academic libraries to staff with student employees rather than librarians wherever possible.

Depending upon the scope of the collection and services offered by the particular media center student assistants perform a variety of functions vital to the day-to-day operation of the unit. Student employees assist users in setting up and operating <b>audiovisual</b> and electronic <b>equipment,</b> circulate and reshelve items, and conduct collection searches to retrieve a variety of materials often arranged in a complex fashion. Because student assistants often staff centers alone and work in highly visible locations, their performance can have an inordinate impact upon the center's reputation.
