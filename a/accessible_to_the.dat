5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general public. This was particularly significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E

5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton {{experienced}} rapid residential growth, stimulated by the railways running through their areas, with landowners in both areas profiting from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> railways, the parishes of Merton and Morden, which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new line through the area and increase the value of the land.|$|E
5|$|Large {{areas of}} {{limestone}} on the Mendips have been worn away by water, making the hills a national centre for caving. Some of the caves {{have been known}} about since {{the establishment of the}} Mendip lead mining industry in Roman times. However, many have been discovered or explored only in the 20th century. Specialist equipment and knowledge is required to visit {{the vast majority of the}} caves, but Cheddar Gorge and Wookey Hole Caves are two show caves which are easily <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. The active Mendip Caving Group and other local caving organisations organise trips and continue to discover new caverns.|$|E

5|$|Szigetvár {{was divided}} into three {{sections}} divided by water: the old town, the new town and the castle—each of which {{was linked to the}} next by bridges and to the land by causeways. Although it was not built on particularly high ground the inner castle, which occupied much of the area of today's castle, was not directly <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attackers. This was because two other baileys had to be taken and secured before a final assault on the inner castle could be launched.|$|E
5|$|The National Press Monument {{regularly}} conducts seminars {{regarding the}} press, media, and communications. It holds themed exhibitions of media based on national holidays, including Independence Day, {{the anniversary of}} the Youth Pledge, and National Press Day; the museum may also take some of its collection on a mobile exhibition. The digital collection and library is <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general public, while researchers may access paper copies of the newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|The X-10 Graphite Reactor {{was shut}} down on November 4, 1963, after twenty years of use. It was {{designated}} a National Historic Landmark on December 21, 1965, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. In 1969 the American Society for Metals listed it as a landmark for its contributions {{to the advancement of}} materials science and technology, and in 2008 it was designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society. The control room and reactor face are <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public during scheduled tours offered through the American Museum of Science and Energy.|$|E

5|$|The post-Chalukya {{period is}} characterised by the {{popularity}} of Shaiva and Vaishnava devotional writings, though secular and courtly topics written in native metres continued to flourish. Native metres in vogue were the shatpadi (six-line verse), the tripadi, the ragle (rhymed couplets) and the sangatya (compositions meant to be sung to the accompaniment a musical instrument). Overall, Kannada writings began to change from marga ("formal", due to Sanskritic influence) to desi ("vernacular") and become more <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> common man.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} study of dinosaurs began in the 1820s of England. In 1842, Richard Owen coined the term dinosaur, which under his vision were elephantine reptiles. An ambitious scientist who used dinosaurs and other fossils to promote his beliefs, Owen was the driving force for the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, the first large-scale dinosaur reconstructions that were <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public (1854). These sculptures, which can still be seen today, immortalized a very early stage {{in the perception of}} dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Bicycle kicks first {{occurred}} in the Pacific ports of Chile and Peru. While their ships were docked, British mariners played football among themselves and with locals {{as a form of}} leisure; the sport's practice was embraced at the ports because its simple rules and equipment made it <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general public. Peru's chief seaport of Callao, where football became a working-class sport, is possibly where the bicycle kick originates as news reports and oral traditions indicate that the local Afro-Peruvians performed the bicycle kick or tiro de chalaca ("chalaca shot", as spectators called it in reference to the local demonym) in the late 19th century, during matches with British sailors and railroad employees. Chile's important seaport of Talcahuano also holds a bicycle kick tradition dating to the 1910s, when Ramón Unzaga, a Basque athlete born in Spain and a naturalized Chilean, allegedly invented the manoeuvre locally known as chorera (also alluding the local demonym).|$|E

5|$|Casinos, {{and vendors}} serving, selling or storing {{alcoholic}} beverages for a casino, {{are required to}} obtain a casino hotel alcoholic beverage (CHAB) license from the Division of Gaming Enforcement. CHAB licenses must be renewed every five years. New Jersey's casino alcohol regulations are divided into five different regions of activity: (a) the casino floor (includes simulcasting facilities); (b) the hotel (includes restaurants and meeting rooms); (c) package goods; (d) room service; and (e) storage. Alcohol sold or given away on the casino floor and in hotel areas must be in an open container for immediate consumption, whereas alcohol sold in a package goods area must be sealed. Alcoholic beverages brought to a patron as a room service may be open or closed, whereas storage areas must not be <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public.|$|E
5|$|Development of Shiny Festa {{began as}} a result of series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami's desire to create a video game that has a lighter feel and makes use of the franchise's songs that had not been featured in video game form. Shiny Festa original releases sold a total of 119,132 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and together ranked as the best-selling video game in Japan that week. The games were described by reviewers as <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> franchise's new and existing fans, but the iOS releases were criticized by journalists for their prohibitive pricing. The mechanics of Shiny Festa later reappear in The Idolmaster Shiny TV, a high-definition remastered version for the PlayStation 3.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VI {{takes place}} on a large, unnamed world. During {{the course of the}} game, its {{geography}} and landscape change due to various developments in the game's plot. During {{the first half of the}} game, the world is divided into three major continents and referred to as the World of Balance. The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges and contains many of the locations <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player. Most of the southern continent has been taken over by the Empire, while the eastern continent is home to a large patch of land called the Veldt where monsters from all over the world can be found. Halfway through the game, the world's geographical layout is altered, resulting in its three large continents splitting into several islands of various size situated around a larger continent at their center. This altered layout of the game's locations is referred to as the World of Ruin.|$|E

5|$|From Tartus, al-Qassam {{traveled}} to Beirut by boat {{and then to}} Haifa, then under the British Mandate, where his wife and daughters later joined him. During the early 1920s, al-Qassam taught at the Madrasa Islamiya, an Islamic educational institution with many schools in Haifa and its periphery. It {{was funded by the}} Jamiat Islamiya, a waqf (religious endowments) administered by prominent Muslims from the city. Unlike other Muslim scholars, al-Qassam made himself easily <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public and often arrived late to teach his classes because he was frequently stopped by passersby for advice. He resigned from his teaching career due to the school's insistence that he maintain consistent hours. As part of his Islamic revivalist teaching, he denounced and discouraged some local Palestinian traditions, including unorthodox funeral rituals, mothers' visitation to the al-Khidr shrine near Mount Carmel to give thanks for their children's well-being or achievements and tribal dances around religious sites, as superstitious innovations to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1785, the {{government}} had taken possession of Southsea Common, the marshland surrounding the castle, to ensure it remained open and <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fort's guns, and convicts were deployed to fill in and flatten out the marshes from 1831 onwards. The surrounding area began to develop as an urban centre; seaside facilities were established {{at the start of}} the century and in the 1840s new private housing was built around the edge of the common, used by military and naval officers. The construction of a railway line from London enabled the settlement of Southsea, named after the castle, to turn into a prosperous resort. Southsea Common was leased by the local government in 1884 and, as the population grew, practising firing the castle's guns became more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{reactors}} {{were shut down}} between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, N Reactor, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public on occasional guided tours. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, and some historians advocate converting it into a museum. B reactor was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service on August 19, 2008.|$|E
