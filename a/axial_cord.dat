40|$|In the ventrolateral hypothalamus, the PV 1 -nucleus {{is defined}} by its {{population}} of parvalbumin-expressing neurons. During embryogenesis, the ventrolateral hypothalamus is colonized also by Foxb 1 -expressing neurons. In adult Foxb 1 -EGFP mice, many immunofluorescent neurons were found within the region that is occupied by the PV 1 -nucleus. They formed a cloud around the <b>axial</b> <b>cord</b> of the parvalbumin-immunopositive cells, which they greatly outnumber (3 : 1). Only {{a small proportion of}} the neurons in the PV 1 -nucleus co-expressed both parvalbumin and Foxb 1. In the light of these findings, a redesignation of this lateral hypothalamic structure as the PV 1 -Foxb 1 nucleus would more accurately reflect its specific biochemical properties...|$|E
40|$|A {{sample of}} Pulmonata {{collected}} in Santa Maria da Vitória, interior of Bahia, Brazil, in Caatinga semi-arid environment, is studied taxonomically. From the five species, four are revealed as new, {{including a new}} genus. The new taxa are the Bulimulidae (1) Kora corallina gen. et sp. n. characterized by the elongated shell with aperture somewhat dislocated from the shell axis, and an oblique tooth in middle level of inner lip; (2) Spixia coltrorum, mainly characterized by an uneven spire, delicate sculpture and peristome with 4 equidistant teeth; (3) Anostoma tessa, mainly characterized by a broad spire and well-developed anal canal; and the Megalobulimidae (4) Megalobulimus amandus, mainly characterized by pointed protoconch sculptured by dense quantity of <b>axial</b> <b>cords.</b> Rhinus suturalis is the only previously known species, but its geographic distribution is expanded southwards to Bahia state. A discussion with respect to necessity for improving the study on the malacofauna from the interior region of the Brazilian Northeast and the importance for preservation of the Caatinga biome is also provided...|$|R
40|$|The purine analogue, 8 -azaguanine, {{was added}} to {{cultures}} of the parasporal crystal-forming organism Bacillus cereus var. alesti at different times during growth and synchronous sporulation. The effect of its incorporation has been studied with particular reference to cell growth, nucleic acid composition, cytology, and the synthesis of the spore and crystal protein. Additions of the analogue during any stage of growth prevented further cell proliferation and all spore and crystal formation. Since both nucleic acids continued to be formed, cells of an increased size developed, containing large masses of chromatin {{in the form of}} condensed balls or <b>axial</b> <b>cords.</b> Lipid-containing inclusions also appeared following these additions and were usually aggregated at the centre or poles of the cells. The analogue could be isolated as the ribonucleotide from both the acid soluble and RNA fractions of these inhibited cells. Additions of the analogue following commencement of sporulation did not prevent either spore or crystal formation or affect the nucleic acid content of the sporulating cells. However, as before, the 8 -azaguanine was incorporated into both the acid soluble and RNA of the cells, but not into these fractions of the spores ultimately formed. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to crystal protein synthesis...|$|R

We modeled N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), which reflects axonal structural integrity and mitochondrial metabolism, with imaging measures of axonal structural integrity (<b>axial</b> diffusivity and <b>cord</b> cross-sectional area) to extract its mitochondrial metabolic contribution. Lower residual variance in NAA, reflecting reduced mitochondrial metabolism, was associated with greater clinical disability in MS, independent of structural damage...|$|R
50|$|Solatisonax cabrali has a small, relativelly {{thick-walled}} shell, with {{a maximum}} known diameter of 7.7 mm and up to 5 whorls. The outer surface of the shell is almost thoroughly ornamented by spiral and <b>axial</b> nodose <b>cords</b> and threads. Its outline changes along the ontogeny, from disk-shaped during the earliest stages of development to depressed cone-shaped in adult specimens. Similarly, the shell's basal region is more inflated than the upper side in younger specimens, but in adult individuals this relationship is inversed. The dome-shaped, inflated protoconch is considered small for an architectonicid as defined by Bieler (1993), ranging from 0.75 mm to 0.88 mm at 1.5 whorl. It has a glossy surface and a strong terminal varix marking the protoconch-teleoconch transition. Shell color is variable from pale beige to white, with scattered beige spots. Since no living specimens of S. cabrali were collected to date, the operculum, {{as well as any}} details of the animal's soft parts are yet to be described.|$|R
40|$|Distributions of {{serotonin}} and catecholamines in larvae of {{the marine}} bryozoan Bugula neritina (Bryozoa: Cheilostomatida) were investigated using immunohistochemistry with anti-serotonin antiserum and glyoxylic acid–induced fluorescence histochemistry. Anti-serotonin immunoreactive substances and glyoxylic acid–induced fluorescent substances had similar distributions in the equatorial neuromuscular ring, the neural plexus, the paired <b>axial</b> neuromuscular <b>cords,</b> and tracts connecting the neural plexus to ciliated cells bordering the pyriform organ. The effects of dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, tyramine, octopamine, synephrine and serotonin, at 10 − 4, 10 − 5 and 10 − 6 M, on settlement were analysed. In filtered seawater, 98 % of larvae settled in 3 h, but only 11 %, 3 % and 6 % total settlement was observed after 8 h in 10 − 4 M dopamine, 10 − 4 M serotonin and 10 − 5 M serotonin, respectively. Total settlement was 70 % in 10 − 4 M noradrenaline, 80 % in 10 − 4 M adrenaline and 60 % in 10 − 4 M tyramine. Less than 60 % settlement was observed in 10 − 4 and 10 − 5 M octopamine and synephrine. Serotonin's inhibitory effect on settlement was mimicked by a range of serotonin receptor agonists and antagonists, among which 5 -carboxamidotryptamine was the most potent...|$|R
40|$|Octopus vulgaris is a {{cephalopod}} of the Octopodidae family. It {{has four}} pairs {{of arms and}} two rows of suckers which perform many functions, including bending and elongation. For this reason the octopus was chosen as model {{to develop a new}} generation of soft-body robots. In order to explain some of the fine structures of the octopus arm in relation to its specific ability, we examined the external and internal structures of O. vulgaris arms in a frozen-hydrated state using cryo-scanning electron microscopy. The arms showed skin with a very complex design that is useful to elongation, and a pore pattern distribution on their surface which is functional to cutaneous oxygen uptake. The analysis of freeze-fractured frozen-hydrated arm samples allowed us to describe the developmental differences in the relative proportion of the areas of <b>axial</b> nerve <b>cord,</b> intrinsic and extrinsic musculature, in relation to the growth of the arms and of the increase in functional capability. In the suckers, we analyzed the shedding mechanisms in the outer part of the infundibulum and described the outer and inner characteristics of the denticles, showing in detail their pore system, which is fundamental for their ability to explore the environment. These results are discussed by considering their possible application in the design of new octopus-like artefacts, which {{will be able to take}} advantage of some of these ultrastructure characteristics and achieve advanced bioinspired functionalities.

40|$|Spinal cord {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} step to empirically quantify spinal cord atrophy that can occur in neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In this work, we propose a novel method to find the globally optimal segmentation of the spinal cord using a high dimensional minimal path search. The spinal cord cross-sectional shapes are represented using principal component analysis (in the probability simplex) which captures most of spinal <b>cord’s</b> <b>axial</b> crosssectional variation and partial volume effects. We propose modifications to the A * minimal path search algorithm that drastically reduce the required memory and run-time to make our high dimensional minimal path optimization computationally feasible. Finally, we validate our results over five vertebrae levels of both healthy and MS clinical MR volumes (20 volumes total) and show improvements on volume agreement with expert segmentations and less user interaction when compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

40|$|The Author 2017. The {{relationship}} between shell form and mode {{of life in}} gastropods {{is important to the}} interpretation of fossils, but has been little explored owing, in part, to the great diversity of gastropod shells. Infaunal gastropods that actively bury in sand must conform to the demands of moving efficiently and noiselessly through a dense granular medium, but which shell characters reflect these demands and how infaunal gastropods differ from surface-dwelling (epifaunal) species remain incompletely answered questions. Here, I survey infaunal and epifaunal Indo-West Pacific members of four families (Cerithiidae, Mitridae, Costellariidae and Conidae) and consider more broadly the distribution of shell traits that confer streamlining and other potential benefits to infaunal species. Sand-burying cerithiids, mitrids and costellariids (but not conids) have on average slenderer shells than their epifaunal counterparts. The only shell features unique to sand-burying gastropods are terraced <b>axial</b> ribs, spiral <b>cords</b> or sutures, in each of which the trailing edge is steeper than the leading edge in the direction of movement; but not all infaunal gastropods have such features. An angular profile, wide umbilicus, high-relief shell sculpture and limpet-like shell is exclusive to surface-dwelling species. Specializations to the infaunal habit are more common and better expressed in the Indo-West Pacific than in tropical America...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Embryologic {{development}} of the basilar artery occurs along two axis systems: longitudinal fusion and axial fusion. Longitudinal fusion consists of midline fusion of paired ventral arteries and reflects the simplified pattern of arterial anatomy found in the spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>Axial</b> fusion con-sists of fusion of the distal basilar artery, which arises from the caudal division of the internal carotid artery, to the mid-basilar agenesis to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery termination of the vertebral arteries. Persistent longitudinal nonfusion (or complete duplication) of the basilar artery is very rare, and persistent axial nonfusion is even rarer. We report one case of persistent longitudinal nonfusion of the basilar artery in a 3 -year-old boy and a case of persistent axial nonfusion of the basilar artery in a 43 -year-old man. The embryologic {{development of}} the basilar artery {{has been described as}} two separate processes occur-ring at two levels, longitudinal and axial (1). The longitudinal system is a continuation of the pattern found in the arterial anatomy of the spinal <b>cord,</b> whereas <b>axial</b> development is representative of the cerebral anatomy. The junction of the two systems is found at the trigeminal remnant site on the basilar artery (1). The longitudinal {{development of the}} basi-lar artery consists of midline fusion of two paired ventral arteries in a craniocaudal manner (1, 2). The axial development of the basilar artery consists of fusion of the caudal division of the internal carotid artery, producing the distal basilar artery, to the mid-basilar agenesis to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery termination of the vertebral arteries (1, 3). Persistent longitudinal nonfusion of the basilar ar-tery is very rare, and persistent axial nonfusion is even rarer. We report the case of a patient with a persistent longitudinal nonfusion and a patient with a persistent axial nonfusion of the basilar artery...|$|R
40|$|Human cadaver {{spinal cord}} {{specimens}} {{with and without}} intact pia mater were subjected to axial deformation over various strain rates. For those specimens with the pia mater intact, the force response to an applied stretch ratio of 1. 1 was independent of strain rate over 0. 1 s− 1 to 10 s− 1. Plastic deformation of the specimens was noted when the stretch ratio exceeded 1. 06. The neo-Hookean elastic modulus for specimens with intact pia mater was 1. 40 MPa. In contrast, the neo-Hookean elastic modulus for specimens with the pia mater incised was 0. 09 MPa. These results depict that during axial extension, the pia mater is the load bearing structure. ^ In addition to <b>axial</b> loading, spinal <b>cord</b> specimens with intact pia mater were subjected to subluxation in a custom designed apparatus. The neo-Hookean elastic modulus {{was determined to be}} 1. 45 MPa in these studies. 35 % occlusion of the vertebral canal by the simulated vertebral discs resulted in an axial stretch ratio of 1. 025 and no evidence of plastic deformation. In contrast, 100 % occlusion resulted in an axial stretch ratio of 1. 2 and gross plastic deformation similar to that observed by MRI after acute spinal cord injury. These results suggest that the vertebral canal can be minimally occluded without significantly stretching the spinal <b>cord</b> in the <b>axial</b> direction. ^ A novel mechanism for the interaction between the dentate ligaments and pia mater depicted how motion of the dura mater results in deformation of the spinal cord. ^ Individual axons were traced in fixed human spinal cord specimens using the fluorescent tracer DiI. Results from these studies depicted that axons undulate within the neural substance. A tortuosity coefficient was defined and determined for each axon. This inherent undulation of the axons suggests that the spinal cord can undergo deformation without significantly deforming individual axons. ^ Lastly, a mechanism of spinal cord injury was presented that is capable of predicting a variety of clinical syndromes ranging from transient neurapraxia to quadriplegia. This mechanism and the results described within this thesis can be utilized to refine current biofidelic models of the head-neck complex. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground contextEither an {{anterior}} approach or a posterior approach, {{which aims}} to decompress the spinal cord and restore the sagittal alignment, has been adopted to treat multilevel cervical degenerative myelopathy (CDM) associated with kyphosis. However, there is controversy on the optimal surgical strategy {{for the treatment of}} multilevel CDM with kyphotic deformity because of the complications of each surgical approach. PurposeThe {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the surgical efficacy of enlarged laminectomy (removing the inside edge of facet joints and decompressing the nerve foramina) and lateral mass screw fixation for the treatment of multilevel CDM associated with kyphosis. Study designA retrospective radiographic and clinical study to access the efficacy of enlarged laminectomy with lateral mass screw fixation in the treatment of multilevel CDM related to kyphosis. Patient sampleA total of 43 patients (28 men and 15 women; average age, 59. 6 years) with multilevel CDM correlated to kyphosis were obtained in the study. Outcome measuresAll radiological data were recorded on computer-based measurement from preoperative or postoperative X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography. All neurological parameters were accessed in each patient. MethodsAnalysis consisted of: Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, recovery rate, curvature index (CI), the expansion degree and drift-back distance of the spinal <b>cord,</b> <b>axial</b> symptom severity, and C 5 root palsy. The recovery rate based on the JOA score was calculated for each patient. Cervical CI as well as the expansion degree and drift-back distance of the spinal cord was measured using MRI. Axial symptom severity was quantified by a visual analog scale (VAS). Statistical analysis was performed using paired t test with significance set at p<. 05. ResultsEnlarged laminectomy was performed over a mean of 3. 97 levels (range, 3 – 5 levels). Follow-up information was obtained at a mean of 2. 8 years (range, 1. 5 – 5 years) after surgery. Analysis of the final follow-up data showed significant differences before and after surgery in the JOA score (t= 24. 17, p<. 001), CI improvement (t= 21. 89, p<. 001), the anteroposterior diameter at the level of maximum compression of the spinal cord (t= 9. 54, p<. 001), and VAS score (t= 13. 30, p<. 001). The mean spinal cord posterior shift was 4. 72 ± 1. 10 mm (range, 0 – 6. 71 mm). X-rays confirmed that bone grafts were completely fused at a mean of 3 months after surgery. During the follow-up period, only two patients (4. 7 %) did not obtain complete recovery, four patients (9. 3 %) experienced axial symptoms; there were no C 5 root palsy and instrument failures noted in this series. ConclusionEnlarged laminectomy with fixation for the management of multilevel CDM is demonstrated to be an effective strategy for improving neurological function, restoring the normal cervical lordosis, and decreasing the incidence of axial symptoms and C 5 root palsy, but there is a need for randomized controlled studies with long-term follow-up to confirm and clarify these results...|$|R
