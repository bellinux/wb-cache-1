40|$|Abstract – The paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} the choice of control for electric energy storage devices in power system aiming at maximum transient stability im-provement. This approach is based on Pontryagin’s maxi-mum principle. Though the solution thus obtained for nonlinear dynamic system {{is in the form}} of control trajec-tories and in general it can not be directly implemented, it is very useful in estimating technical possibilities of differ-ent controlled elements, and corresponding solution may serve as a standard to be obtained. Pontryagin’s maximum principle has been expanded to nonlinear dynamic system described by both differential and algebraic equations. It has been shown that for a dy-namic system described by n differential equations, m al-gebraic ones and containing l controls the optimality con-ditions are determined by the solution of 2 n differential equations (for the state and costate variables) and m(n+l+ 1) +l algebraic equations. The introduction of alge-braic subsystem considerably increases the dimension of the problem, though it is not critical for modern com-puters. The paper outlines general solution algorithm using quasilinearization approach which allows for eliminating algebraic equations at each integration step and provides an easy account of transversality conditions. The above approach has been used for the choice of SMES control in a simple EPS.

A diesel station can be started and stopped quickly as and when required. It does not need any warming period, and need not be kept running {{for a long time}} before picking up load.
