40|$|Objective: Atypical {{sequences}} {{of drug use}} progression {{are thought to have}} important implications for the development of substance dependence. The extent to which this assumption holds for South African populations is unknown. This paper attempts to address this gap by examining the prevalence and correlates of <b>atypical</b> <b>patterns</b> of drug progression among South Africans. Method: Data on substance use and other mental health disorders from a nationally representative sample of 4351 South Africans were analysed. Weighted cross tabulations were used to estimate prevalence and correlates of <b>atypical</b> <b>patterns</b> of drug use progression. Results: Overall, 12. 2 % of the sample reported <b>atypical</b> <b>patterns</b> of drug use progression. The most common violation was the use of extra-medical drugs prior to alcohol and tobacco. Gender was significantly associated with <b>atypical</b> <b>patterns</b> of drug use with the risk pattern varying by the type of drug. None of the anxiety or mood disorders were associated with <b>atypical</b> <b>patterns</b> of use. <b>Atypical</b> <b>patterns</b> of drug use were not associated with increased risk for a lifetime substance use disorder. Conclusion: <b>Atypical</b> <b>patterns</b> of drug use initiation seem more prevalent in South Africa compared to other countries. The early use of extra-medical drugs is common, especially among young women. Drug availability and social environmental factors may influence patterns of drug use. The findings have important implications for prevention initiatives and future research. Articl...|$|R

The purpose of this pictorial essay is to review different patterns of fatty liver deposition and sparing.

5000|$|There {{was little}} hint {{of what was}} to come that day as far as severe weather was concerned. Both Environment Canada in Toronto and the Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma {{outlined}} the risk for non-severe thunderstorms that day across the lower Great Lakes. Lapse rates yielded limited instability for severe weather, with a secondary cold front acting as a trigger. Given the much colder air aloft (freezing levels near 700 hPa) coupled with surface heating there was the risk for small hail and gusty outflow winds, which was also mentioned. Though some upper-level wind field parameters were sufficient for tornadic activity, they were marginal at best when coupled with the synoptic pattern at hand (a highly <b>atypical</b> <b>pattern</b> compared to previous major tornado events in the lower Great Lakes region). Goderich is also located in the [...] "lake shadow" [...] of Lake Huron, which is much less likely to be hit by tornadoes than other parts of Southwestern Ontario where lake convergence fronts collide. By 11:00am that morning, showers and thunderstorms began to develop over southwestern Ontario. Initially they were weak, but began to intensify in some localized areas. Hail and heavy rain came down with a line of storms tracking from northwest of Kitchener toward the Brampton area early that afternoon. There were reports of localized flooding and marginally damaging wind gusts associated with these storms. A brief tornado was also reported in Gananoque at 12:45pm. Later confirmed as an F1, this tornado caused minor damage in an area 1.5 kilometres long and 60 metres wide. Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm watch for most of southern Ontario as a result. The town of Goderich and surrounding areas of Huron County were included.|$|E
