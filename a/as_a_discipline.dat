25|$|The {{precursor}} sciences to {{the development}} of modern computer graphics were the advances in electrical engineering, electronics, and television that took place {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century. Screens could display art since the Lumiere brothers' use of mattes to create special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, but such displays were limited and not interactive. The first cathode ray tube, the Braun tube, was invented in 1897 - it in turn would permit the oscilloscope and the military control panel - the more direct precursors of the field, as they provided the first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded to programmatic or user input. Nevertheless, computer graphics remained relatively unknown <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>discipline</b> until the 1950s and the post-World War II period - during which time the discipline emerged from a combination of both pure university and laboratory academic research into more advanced computers and the United States military's further development of technologies like radar, advanced aviation, and rocketry developed during the war. New kinds of displays were needed to process the wealth of information resulting from such projects, leading {{to the development}} of computer graphics <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>discipline.</b>|$|E
