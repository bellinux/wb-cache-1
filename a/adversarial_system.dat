This was the principle stated in GCHQ and reiterated in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Where the executive has the best access to available materials, its views should be decisive or at least highly persuasive. It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines {{that there may be}} matters of fact not in the public domain which may be known only to the executive. Where sensitive facts are concerned, Singapore's <b>adversarial</b> <b>system</b> is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial. Furthermore, not all pertinent facts might be presented before the court.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church {{developed}} the inquisitorial {{system in the}} Middle Ages.

5000|$|A brief (Old French from Latin [...] "brevis", short) is {{a written}} legal {{document}} used in various legal <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems</b> that {{is presented to}} a court arguing why one party to a particular case should prevail.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems,</b> the {{defendant}} may plead [...] "guilty" [...] or [...] "no contest" [...] {{in exchange for}} reduced sentences, a practice known as plea bargaining, which is an extremely common practice in the United States. In theory, {{the defendant}} must allocute or [...] "voice" [...] his or her crimes in open court, and the judge must believe the defendant {{is telling the truth}} about his or her guilt. In an inquisitorial system, a mere confession of guilt would not be regarded as ground for a guilty verdict, and the prosecutor is required to provide evidence supporting a guilty verdict; however, this requirement is not unique to inquisitorial systems, as many or most <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems</b> impose a similar requirement under the name corpus delicti.|$|R
50|$|Proponents of inquisitorial justice dispute these points. They {{point out}} that many cases in <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems,</b> and most cases in the United States, are {{actually}} resolved by plea bargain or settlement. Plea bargain as a system {{does not exist in}} an inquisitorial system. Many legal cases in <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems,</b> and most in the United States, do not go to trial, which may lead to injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which {{is likely to be the}} case when the defendant is poor. In addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants in the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not.|$|R
25|$|Common law courts usually use an <b>adversarial</b> <b>system,</b> {{in which}} two sides present their cases to a neutral judge. In contrast, civil law systems usually use an inquisitorial system in which an {{examining}} magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side {{and then the other}} during the investigation phase.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that it is somewhat more sympathetic to rights-owner interests rather than user interests; for instance, by ruling to increase royalty rates under the Part VB Educational Statutory licence without a submission to this effect from either party in c.2003.

25|$|The Sixth Amendment {{guarantees}} {{a defendant}} {{a right to}} counsel in all criminal prosecutions. The purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel are to protect a defendant’s right {{to a fair trial}} and to assure that our <b>adversarial</b> <b>system</b> of justice functions properly by providing competent counsel as an advocate for the defendant in his contest against the “prosecutorial forces” of the state.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{courts of}} common law tradition, ecclesiastical tribunals {{do not follow}} the <b>adversarial</b> <b>system.</b> Based on the same Roman civil law that is behind much European law, the {{procedure}} of a canonical court is more akin to the inquisitorial system, with the judges leading the investigation. As a general rule, the defendant has the favorable presumption of law, {{which means that the}} defendant will win by default unless a majority of the judges is convinced with moral certainty of the petitioner's case (can. 1608). This presumption also applies in penal cases (can. 1728). There are few exceptions to this rule; in those cases, the burden shifts to the defendant.|$|E
25|$|The {{proceeding}} in the inquisitorial {{system is}} essentially by writing. Most {{of the witnesses}} would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but {{he or she will}} be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the <b>adversarial</b> <b>system,</b> the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together {{with the president of the}} trial bench, following their common deliberation.|$|E

25|$|Israel has {{a common}} law legal system. Its basic {{principles}} are {{inherited from the}} law of the British Mandate of Palestine and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the supreme court in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the <b>adversarial</b> <b>system.</b> One of the primary reasons that the Israeli constitution remains unwritten is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the Knesset (which, following the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, holds near-unlimited power).|$|E
500|$|For {{much of the}} 19th and 20th centuries {{his work}} was {{forgotten}} by academics, and interest arose only in 1991, with an article by John Beattie titled [...] "Garrow for the Defence" [...] in History Today. Garrow {{is best known for}} his criminal defence work, which, through the example he set with his aggressive defence of clients, helped establish the modern <b>adversarial</b> <b>system</b> in use in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other former British colonies. Garrow is also known for his impact on the rules of evidence, leading to the best evidence rule. His work was cited as recently as 1982 in the Supreme Court of Canada and 2006 in the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal. In 2009, BBC One broadcast Garrow's Law, a four-part fictionalised drama of Garrow's beginnings at the Old Bailey; a second series aired in late 2010.

50|$|The {{criminal}} justice system is based on trial before a panel of judges, and therefore resembles more the Napoleonic than the British or American <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems.</b> The prosecutor, a government employee, seeks to obtain an acknowledgement of culpability from the accused. If this happens quickly, the sentencing may be lenient. If culpability is obvious but the accused refuses to admit to it, the sentence may be correspondingly severe. Judges may dismiss the case for lack of proof at any time. Recent legislation defines required proof of guilt more closely, providing increased protection against trivial or mistaken charges. Minor criminal offences may be tried by the dzongkhag Drangpon (District Judge).|$|R
5000|$|The {{generally}} decentralized {{nature of}} academic institutions {{can make it}} difficult for victims to seek recourse, and appeals to outside authority have been described as [...] "the kiss of death." [...] Therefore, academics who are subject to bullying in workplace are often cautious about reporting any problems. Social media has recently been used to expose or allege bullying in academia anonymously. Bullying research credits an organizational rift in two interdependent and <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems</b> that comprise a larger structure of nearly all colleges and universities worldwide: faculty and administration. While both systems distribute employee power across standardized bureaucracies, administrations favor an ascription-oriented business model with a standardized criteria determining employee rank.|$|R
2500|$|Hitchens {{asserts that}} {{political}} mismanagement, facilitated by an {{abandonment of the}} <b>adversarial</b> <b>system,</b> has resulted in an overall decline in British society.

2500|$|The Supreme Court {{upheld the}} denial of a stay of {{execution}} by the Court of Appeals, saying that the Court of Appeals followed the procedural guidelines for handling such applications for stays of execution on habeas corpus appeals pursuant to a certificate of probable cause. The Court also upheld the appellate court's finding {{on the merits of}} the case, reasoning that that clinical prediction testimony [...] was not in every case wrong and could be refuted by opposing experts, trusting the <b>adversarial</b> <b>system</b> to determine the accuracy of such statements.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{depicts the}} right in {{particular}} as a confused and spent political force that has been subsumed by the centre-left, itself a product of Fabian social democracy. As {{a result of these}} factors, [...] "there is no longer any debate between the political parties about issues that have divided thinkers down the ages, and divide the population even now". Hitchens concludes that, since the compass is broken, the time has come in British politics for the re-establishment of a proper <b>adversarial</b> <b>system</b> and for principles to be rediscovered.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We study {{confidential}} safety, {{a notion}} of secrecy that arises naturally in <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems.</b> We provide a formal definition {{in the context of}} a concurrent while-language. We provide techniques for establishing confidential safety, building on three ingredients: (1) We develop a novel view of correspondence assertions that focuses on their confidentiality (in contrast to the traditional view of correspondence assertions that uses their integrity to derive secrecy and authentication properties of protocols). (2) We establish the confidentiality of a correspondence assertion using techniques reminiscent of information flow, and incorporating cryptography using confounders. (3) We prove protocols are confidentially safe using techniques based on frame-bisimulation that exploit the noninterference properties of well-typed programs...|$|R

The French system remains, despite shifts towards adversarial elements and recurring attacks on the pivotal role of the eponymous Juge d'instruction, one of Europe's inquisitorial judicial systems, and its structure of judicial supervision of police enquiries and epistemological ethos of truth seeking has periodically been advocated to improve the probity of cases in countries like England with <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems</b> pitting partisan cases supported by discrete pieces of evidence. This article explores how the supervisory system works in practice, the methods and thought processes of the French investigators in all their forms, and the societal ethos within which they operate...|$|R

2500|$|In the U.S. and in {{a growing}} number of nations, guilt or innocence (although in the U.S. a jury can never find a {{defendant}} [...] "innocent" [...] but rather [...] "not guilty") is decided through the <b>adversarial</b> <b>system.</b> [...] In this system, two parties will both offer their version of events and argue their case before the court (sometimes before a judge or panel of judges, sometimes before a jury).

5000|$|The {{right to}} counsel in {{criminal}} trials was initially not accepted in some <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems.</b> It {{was believed that}} the facts should speak for themselves, and that lawyers would just blur the matters. As a consequence, {{it was only in}} 1836 that England gave suspects of felonies the formal right to have legal counsel (the Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836), although in practise English courts routinely allowed defendants to be represented by counsel from the mid-18th century. During {{the second half of the}} 18th century advocates like Sir William Garrow and Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine helped usher in the <b>adversarial</b> court <b>system</b> used in most common law countries today. In the United States, however, personally retained counsel have had a right to appear in all federal criminal cases since the adoption of the Constitution and in state cases at least since the end of the Civil War, although nearly all provided this right in their state constitutions or laws much earlier. Appointment of counsel for indigent defendants was nearly universal in federal felony cases, though it varied considerably in state cases. It was not until 1963 that the U.S. Supreme Court declared that legal counsel must be provided at the expense of the state for indigent felony defendants, under the federal Sixth Amendment, in state courts. See Gideon v. Wainwright, [...]|$|R

40|$|Recent {{criticism}} of American legal education {{has focused on}} its being theory-driven rather than practice driven, which either produces or reinforces a divide or gap between theory and practice. Yet two of its prominent features expressly draw upon experiential learning, one directly by sending students into experiential learning situations (legal clinics) and the other indirectly by bringing instructors who are engaged full-time in active practice into the classroom (adjunct faculty). This article briefly reviews the ambivalent position of clinics and adjunct faculty in American legal education, to explore {{the degree to which}} these approaches to skills development can, or should, be transplanted to other systems of legal education. Drawing on accounts of efforts to develop clinical methods in countries with less <b>adversarial</b> <b>systems,</b> it concludes that legal culture is a critical element in the success, or lack thereof, in transplantation of these approaches...|$|R
