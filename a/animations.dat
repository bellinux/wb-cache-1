5|$|Having {{received}} Nintendo 64DD development kits {{that included}} the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, Iguana Entertainment added an optional high-resolution mode to the game {{early on in the}} development cycle. In conjunction with the Expansion Pak, this mode allows the game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels, a technical accomplishment for the Nintendo 64 at the time. An upgraded polygon modelling technique was used to give the game better-formed creatures. However, motion capture was avoided because none of game's enemies are human. Dienstbier felt that if their <b>animations</b> were motion captured, enemies would look like a person pretending to be a lizard in a costume. The game features different <b>animations</b> for different creatures. Unlike its predecessor, where enemies have two types of death <b>animations,</b> Seeds of Evil includes a third and gorier one.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{included a}} scripting team, who inserted pre-programmed scripts into the dialogue, a process {{referred to as}} scripting: these scripts {{could be used to}} change characters' <b>animations,</b> stop the text {{in the middle of a}} sentence, automatically proceed to the next text box, and pan the camera. The staff had to envision how scenes would look, and used these scripts to create a flow of character <b>animations</b> and add dramatic tension, such as adding a pause after a character sighs to increase the dramatic effect.|$|E
50|$|Traditional <b>animation</b> (or {{classical}} <b>animation,</b> cel <b>animation</b> or hand-drawn <b>animation)</b> is an <b>animation</b> technique {{where each}} frame is drawn by hand. The technique was the dominant form of <b>animation</b> in cinema until {{the advent of}} computer <b>animation.</b>|$|R

5|$|Triotech {{designed}} the ride's interactive 3D <b>animations,</b> which {{are accompanied by}} other special effects such as wind, adding the fourth dimension. During the park's Halloween Haunt event in October, the <b>animations</b> are replaced with zombie-themed effects. Delays during construction delayed the ride's opening until May 24, 2014; {{three weeks after the}} 2014 season began. Guardian was inspired by the dragon in Thunder Run—another roller coaster located in the mountain area of the park—and Starlight Spectacular—a nightly light-and-sound show focused on Wonder Mountain.|$|E
5|$|While {{the song}} is playing, the {{background}} visuals feature the players' chosen avatar, {{along with the rest}} of the band performing in one of several real and fictional venues. The reaction of the audience is based on the performance of the player judged by the Rock Meter. Guitar Hero II added special lighting and other stage effects that were synchronized to the music to provide a more complete concert experience. The games developed by Neversoft feature a simple storyline, usually about a band's quest for fame, which is told through <b>animations</b> played throughout the game. These <b>animations</b> were created by Chris Prynoski and his studio, Titmouse, Inc., who have also done <b>animations</b> for the animated show Metalocalypse.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{copyright}} problems {{an official}} {{release of the}} <b>animations</b> has proven impossible. For the American release of the film, the rights to use of the Playboy bunny costume was denied and the rights to Electric Light Orchestra's music was consequently not sought. However, a laserdisc featuring Daicon III & IV Opening Animation was unofficially released in Japan as bonus material to a ¥16,000 art book of the <b>animations.</b> This laserdisc is considered rare and highly valuable among collectors, easily fetching prices over a thousand dollars on online auctions.|$|E
5|$|During publication, the Luna Brothers {{promoted}} {{new issues}} on their website with <b>animations</b> of each issue's opening scenes. The animation {{work was done}} by their friend Giancarlo Yerkes. In 2011, they created a live-action ad to promote the deluxe hardcover.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} Source engine, the designers found that the game's scope exceeded their resources. Bloodlines has several styles of gameplay, requiring different interfaces, <b>animations</b> and artificial intelligence for stealth and melee combat, and first- or third-person capability. Compared to contemporary first-person shooters, with 10 to 20 animated character models, Bloodlines had over 150 characters with 3,000 unique <b>animations,</b> in {{addition to}} boss characters, with their own styles of movement. The designers underestimated {{the length of time}} required to develop and improve these systems. The game's scope suffered from content not being removed when necessary; other components would be endlessly refined without being finalized, preventing the developers from focusing on other parts of the game system. All content additionally required approval by White Wolf and Activision.|$|E

5|$|One {{animator}} {{was dedicated}} full-time during {{three years of}} the game's development to work out the boy's <b>animations,</b> including <b>animations</b> that showed anticipation on the player's actions or events in the game, such as reaching out for a cart handle as the player moved the boy near it. Jensen felt this was important as the character was always {{at the center of the}} player's screen, and the most important element to watch. Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions and discourage players from repeating their mistakes. While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that their goal was to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death <b>animations</b> entertaining to keep the player interested. Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too complex for the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.|$|E
5|$|The character's {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's <b>animations</b> were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character <b>animations.</b> Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He {{said they did not}} have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and <b>animations</b> were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E
