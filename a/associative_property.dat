40|$|Natural environments, and {{particularly}} visual stimuli in nature, are usually perceived as restorative following stress and attention fatigue. Studies extending these findings to auditory natural stimuli have used soundscapes comprising multiple types of sound. Birdsong recurs {{as a type}} of sound used in such studies, but little is known about restorative perceptions of bird sounds on their own and how these may relate to existing theories of environmental restoration. Via semi-structured interviews with twenty adult participants, bird songs and calls were found to be the type of natural sound most commonly associated with perceived stress recovery and attention restoration. However, not all bird sounds were regarded as helpful for such processes. Three themes formed the basis of these perceived relationships: affective appraisals, cognitive appraisals, and relationships with nature. Sub-themes of the acoustic, aesthetic, and <b>associative</b> <b>properties</b> of bird sounds were also related to restorative perceptions. Future studies should quantitatively examine the potential of a variety of bird sounds to aid attention restoration and stress recovery, and how these might be predicted by acoustic, aesthetic, and <b>associative</b> <b>properties,</b> in order to better understand how and why sounds such as birdsong might provide restorative benefits.

Glutamate released from the parallel fibers activates AMPA receptors which depolarize the postsynaptic cell. The parallel fibers also activate metabotropic glutamate receptors that release the second messengers IP3 and DAG. The climbing fibers stimulate a large increase in postsynaptic Ca2+ levels when activated. The Ca2+, IP3, and DAG work together in a signal transduction pathway to internalize AMPA receptors and decrease the sensitivity of the postsynaptic cell to glutamate.|$|R

Third, although space limitations preclude giving a proof of every theorem in this paper, every theorem has been proved with equational logic. The summary of equational logic is minimal, and the paper can serve as an introduction to linear temporal logic for those already familiar with equational logic. ...|$|R

Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high-pressure liquid chromatography, we demonstrated the existence of covalently cross-linked enzyme I dimers and trimers. Enzyme I exchange assays and phosphorylation experiments with [32 P]phosphoenolpyruvate showed that covalent dimers and trimers are catalytically active. Inhibitors of the enzyme I-catalyzed phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate exchange block the phosphorylation of enzyme I dimers and trimers. Inhibition of the activity of enzyme I by N-ethylmaleimide, but not that by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate, could be overcome by high concentrations of enzyme, suggesting that N-ethylmaleimide modification changes the <b>associative</b> <b>properties</b> of enzyme I.
