5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings. Journalists and others knew {{that they would not}} be able to publish any photographs or movies, so those aware of the incident did not bother recording it other than by accident, nor did any try to investigate it afterward. Most of the few photographs of the incidents have been destroyed or forgotten and lost. Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland. His act was captured in a 7-second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official newsreels of the festival omitted <b>any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident. This footage however survived, mislabeled either by accident or purpose, until it was rediscovered over twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include <b>any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E

25|$|An {{account of}} the battle was {{mentioned}} both by Diodorus and Plutarch, both based heavily on the report by Ephorus. Xenophon conspicuously omits <b>any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Theban victory in his Hellenica, though this has traditionally been ascribed to Xenophon's strong anti-Theban and pro-Spartan sentiments. An obscure allusion to Orchomenus in Hellenica, however, implies that Xenophon {{was aware of the}} Spartan defeat.|$|E
25|$|There is little, if <b>any,</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mill, barn or {{farmhouse}} in early histories or {{maps of the}} Garrison area. Although the architectural styles and building materials strongly suggest a mid- to late 18th century construction date, similar buildings {{are known to have}} been erected in the Hudson Valley as late as 1820. The framing system of the farmhouse is more commonly found in the lower valley, in areas closer to New York City that were settled earlier, and more study is needed, especially given the high integrity of the structure.|$|E
25|$|There was no Aigle or Eagle in the Royal Navy at the time, nor <b>any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{encounter}} in the logbooks of any British navy vessels matching her description. A Paris newspaper later reported that on 28 July, the British privateer brig Acquila, {{under the command of}} Captain Colonna, of 14 guns and 57 men, had arrived at Leghorn in great distress, having engaged a French vessel on 4 July. This may have been the ship Eagle, Captain Colin Campbell, of twelve 6-pounder guns and 317 tons (bm), which had received her letter of marque on 13 June 1797.|$|E

25|$|Before The Forty Days of Musa Dagh was {{published}} in English, Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) secured the film rights from Werfel's publisher, Paul Zsolnay Verlag and had the novel translated for the studio scriptwriters. Despite reservations {{on the part of}} legal counsel, who felt such a film would offend the Turkish government, MGM started pre-production work in 1934 and tentatively cast a rising young star named Clark Gable to play Gabriel Bagradian. When reports surfaced in the Hollywood press about the film late in 1934, Turkey's ambassador to the United States, Mehmed Münir Ertegün, was ordered by his government to prevent it from being made. As the successor state of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey was intent on suppressing <b>any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armenian Genocide.|$|E
25|$|While Harsiese A {{may have}} become king at Thebes prior to Year 4 of Osorkon II, contra Kitchen, he {{certainly}} ruled Thebes during {{the first decade of}} Osorkon II's reign as Kitchen notes. Osorkon II's control over this great city is only first documented by 2 separate Year 12 Quay Texts which means that Harsiese had died by this time. If Harsiese was already ruling at Thebes earlier under Takelot I, it might help explain why Takelot I's own Year 5, Year 8, and Year 14 Nile Quay Texts, which mention the serving High Priests Iuwelot and Smendes III—who were all brothers of Takelot I--consistently omit any mention of Takelot's name, as Gerard Broekman aptly notes in an article in JEA (88 (2002)). Takelot I's name is left deliberately blank here. This might indicate a possible rivalry between Takelot I and Harsiese A at Thebes. The Amun Priests may have chosen not to involve themselves in this dispute by omitting <b>any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reigning king's name.|$|E
25|$|The US signed its {{declaration}} of war on Great Britain on June 18, 1812, and that same day Secretary Eustis sent two letters to General Hull. One of them, sent by special messenger, arrived on June 24 but did not contain <b>any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{declaration of}} war. The second one, announcing the {{declaration of war}}, was sent via the postal service, and did not arrive until July 2. As a result, Hull was still unaware that war had broken out {{when he reached the}} rapids of the Maumee. Taking advantage of the waterway, he sent the schooner Cuyahoga Packet ahead of the army to Detroit with a number of invalids, supplies, and official documents. But, the British commander at Fort Amherstburg had received the declaration of war two days earlier, and captured the ship as it sailed past. He gained all of Hull's military papers and plans for an attack on Fort Amherstburg.|$|E

In addition, decryption keys have been extracted from a weakly protected player (WinDVD).

25|$|Though {{the film}} was quite {{faithful}} to the novel, even in script, {{there were a few}} changes. The Death of Rats is reduced to a one-scene cameo in the film where it reaps the soul of a mouse caught in a trap on Hogswatchnight, and then watches Death deliver presents, whereas in the novel it appears much more often with Quoth the Raven. The invasion of the tooth castle is covered in more detail in the movie, as is the gathering and controlling of the teeth. The annihilation of two of Teatime's associates were removed; thus, instead of Sideney being caught in the playground of his old elementary school (with curls), he was killed by the Scissor Man. The Cheerful Fairy and the Towel Wasp are both removed, along with <b>any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Money Bag Goblin by the Dean. Mention of Bibulous, the opposite brother of Bilious, is removed, and so is the Hangover Imp that is pounding Bilious' head in the scene where Susan meets him. Medium Dave and Banjo's surname in the novel is 'Lilywhite', not 'Cropper'.|$|E
25|$|The first American {{known to}} see the San Joaquin River was likely Jedediah Smith, a renowned {{mountain}} man, fur trapper and explorer. In 1826, Smith arrived in Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, California, when the region was under control of the Mexican government. As this was in violation of a law which prevented foreigners from entering California, {{and he could have}} been arrested for spying, he traveled north into the San Joaquin Valley, searching for populations of beaver. Smith noted the fertility and natural beauty of the area, and the apparent peace of the Native Americans living in the villages he passed. His expedition then turned east in an attempt to cross the Sierra Nevada. They tried to summit the range by way of both the Kings River and the American River (a tributary of the Sacramento), but it was early spring and the snow was too deep. Finally, they crossed the mountains along the Stanislaus River canyon, becoming the first recorded whites to cross the Sierra Nevada on foot. It is still disputed over whether Smith's party discovered gold on the San Joaquin or one of its tributaries. Although some of his men confirmed it, Smith did not make <b>any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precious metal in his journal.|$|E

5000|$|In 756, Abd ar-Rahman I, a {{survivor}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recently overthrown Umayyad Dynasty, landed in al-Andalus and seized power in Cordova and Seville, and proclaimed himself emir or malik, removing <b>any</b> <b>mentions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid Caliphs <b>of</b> Damascus from <b>the</b> Friday prayers. In <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> these events, southern Iberia became de jure and de facto independent from the Damascus Caliphate. Although {{this was not}} accepted outside al-Andalus and those North African territories with which it was affiliated, Abd ar-Rahman, and especially his successors, considered that they were <b>the</b> legitimate continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Umayyad caliphate, i.e. that their rule was more legitimate than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abbasids.

However, 30,000 convened in different convention centres in the city and Niemöller, Peter Petersen (Lichterfelde) and Adolf Kurtz (Twelve Apostles Church) - among others - held speeches. On 7 December the Gestapo forbade the Confessing Church to rent any location, in order to prevent future events like that.
