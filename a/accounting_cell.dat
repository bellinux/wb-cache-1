New expressions of the tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) are provided.

40|$|Reversibility {{of state}} {{transitions}} is intensively studied topic in many scientific disciplines over many years. In cell biology, it {{plays an important}} role in epigenetic variation of phenotypes, known as phenotypic plasticity. More interestingly, the cell state reversibility is probably crucial in the adaptation of population phenotypic heterogeneity to environmental fluctuations by evolving bet-hedging strategy, which might confer to cancer cells resistance to therapy. In this article, we propose a formalization of the evolution of highly reversible states in the environments of periodic variability. Two interrelated models of heterogeneous cell populations are proposed and their behavior is studied. The first model captures selection dynamics of the cell clones for the respective levels of phenotypic reversibility. The second model focuses on the interplay between reversibility and drug resistance in the particular case of cancer. Overall, our results show that the threshold dependencies are emergent features of the investigated model with eventual therapeutic relevance. Presented examples demonstrate importance of taking into <b>account</b> <b>cell</b> to cell heterogeneity within a system of clones with different reversibility quantified by appropriately chosen genetic and epigenetic entropy measures.

We find the jointly optimal power allocation, partner selection and receiver selection strategies that maximize the sum rate of the system.

The ratio of culturable to viable E. coli was close to 1 in highly contaminated waters (samples with a high concentration of culturable E. coli), but decreased drastically for weakly contaminated samples. This indicates a large fraction of viable but nonculturable (VBNC) E. coli in the latter samples.
