Motor skills delay is often observed, along with hypermobile or hyperflexible joints, drooling and speech difficulties, poor reflexes, decreased strength, decreased <b>activity</b> <b>tolerance,</b> rounded shoulder posture, with leaning onto supports, and poor attention. The extent and occurrence of specific objective manifestations depends upon {{the age of the}} patient, the severity of the hypotonia, the specific muscles affected, and sometimes the underlying cause.

5000|$|Functional {{capacity}} {{can also}} be expressed as [...] "METs" [...] {{and can be used}} as a reliable predictor of future cardiac events. One MET is defined as the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest, and is equal to 3.5 ml oxygen per kilogram body weight per minute. In other words, a means of expressing energy cost of physical activity as a multiple of the resting rate. For instance; walking on level ground at about 6 km/h or carrying groceries up a flight of stairs expends about 4 METs of activity. Generally, >7 METs of <b>activity</b> <b>tolerance</b> is considered excellent while <4 is considered poor for surgical candidates. Determining one's functional capacity can elucidate the degree of surgical risk one might undertake for procedures that risk blood loss, intravascular fluid shifts, etc. and may tax an already strained cardiovascular system.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effect of {{respiratory}} training (RT) on lung function, <b>activity</b> <b>tolerance</b> and acute exacerbation frequency with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Design: A randomised controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient clinic and home of the COPD patients, Zhengzhou City, China. Subjects: Sixty participants with COPD were randomised into two groups: an intervention group (n = 30) which received the RT in self-management and a control group (n = 30) that received an education program during the study. Intervention: Pulmonary function, <b>activity</b> <b>tolerance</b> and frequency of acute exacerbation of these COPD patients were evaluated before and after the program.

40|$|The Staphylococcus aureus lrg and cid operons encode {{homologous}} {{proteins that}} regulate extracellular murein hydrolase <b>activity</b> and penicillin <b>tolerance</b> in a diametrically opposing manner. Although their specific regulatory functions remain unknown, {{it has been}} postulated that the functions of CidA and LrgA are analogous to those of bacteriophage holins and antiholins, respectively, and that these proteins serve as molecular control elements of bacterial programmed cell death. Although these studies demonstrated that cidBC transcription is abundant in σB-proficient strains, cidABC transcription was only minimally expressed under standard growth conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that cidABC and lrgAB transcription in the clinical isolate UAMS- 1 is induced by growth {{in the presence of}} 35 mM glucose and that this enhances murein hydrolase <b>activity</b> and decreases <b>tolerance</b> to vancomycin and rifampin. The effect of glucose on murein hydrolase activity was not observed in the cidA mutant, indicating that the induction of this activity was dependent on enhanced cidABC expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effects of glucose on cidABC and lrgAB transcription are mediated by the generation of acetic acid produced by the metabolism of this and other carbon sources. These results shed new light on the control of the S. aureus cidABC and lrgAB genes and demonstrate that these operons, as well as murein hydrolase <b>activity</b> and antibiotic <b>tolerance,</b> are responsive to carbohydrate metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Introduction:Diabetes is a {{significant}} and expensive health problem which had influenced all the ages in almost all the countries. Increasing prevalence of this disease has been caused by continued changes in lifestyle such as unsuitable nutrition, lack of physical activities and fatness which is often related to modern city life, mechanization and industrialization. It is an expensive disease, both for patients and the health and hygienic care systems. This research tried {{to examine the relationship}} between lifestyle risk factors and type II diabetes. Methods: This research was a case-control type by random sampling and studying 140 diabetes type II patients as case group and 140 healthy people accompanying some other patients as the control group at Tonekabon Shahid Rajaei hospital. People were of both sexes, between 30 and 64 years of age and Tonekabon residents. The questionnaire used included demographic, nutritional, physical <b>activities,</b> stress <b>tolerance</b> and smoking status information.
