40|$|Childhood {{vaccination}} {{rates have}} steadily declined {{over the past}} decade and traditional educational strategies such as written resources and pediatrician recommendations have failed to produce immunization rates recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control. Starting the vaccination conversation with parents prior to the first pediatric visit could restore childhood immunization rates to their peak levels. This has strong implications for public health because it could prevent the re-emergence of infectious diseases and help maintain herd immunity. OB/GYN practitioners {{play a critical role in}} the timing of this conversation with parents prior to the birth of their child. To facilitate conversations between OB/GYN practitioners and expectant parents, micro-learning videos will be developed and used by the OB/GYN practitioners to improve their risk communication and shared-decision making skills. Once the program is implemented, they will report back upon their completion of video viewing, surveys and the number of women to whom they are communicating this knowledge. Pregnant women will also complete surveys <b>after</b> receiving <b>these</b> <b>messages</b> and take-home materials during program implementation. The goal of this program is to increase childhood vaccination rates in Allegheny County by providing information to pregnant women during prenatal visits. The target population is pregnant women receiving prenatal care at OB/GYN offices and clinics in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. With successful implementation of this program, parents will now have time to make this critically important decision, without feeling rushed or overwhelmed at their first pediatric visit and ultimately deciding to vaccinate their child(ren) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The IEC 61850 {{standard}} {{not only}} defines a new structure for substation automation, but also can provide more enhanced communication functionalities. The standard defines {{several kinds of}} messages for data exchange between nodes in the substation. Among them, two messages, sample values and GOOSE, play critical roles for substation protection. Because of their importance in the secure substation operation, any compromising of <b>these</b> <b>messages</b> should be prohibited. Along with the requirement of secure transmission, <b>these</b> <b>messages</b> have very stringent performance requirement. So any security algorithm {{that can be applied}} for secure exchange of <b>these</b> <b>messages</b> should not violate the performance criteria. In this paper we consider the security protocol for guaranteeing the message authentication and integrity. And we evaluate the security protocol and examine whether the protocol can meet this criteria by experiment...|$|R
