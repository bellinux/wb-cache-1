5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>a</b> <b>showcase</b> for visual improvements, Lost Coast {{acted as a}} testbed for Valve's commentary system.

Players hear the developers {{talk about what the}} player is seeing, what is happening, why they made certain decisions, and what kinds of challenges they faced. Commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes. Valve intended for players to first play the level with commentary disabled, and after completing the level, play it again with commentary enabled, learning about each new stage as they progress. The company has since made the commentary system standard in all of its later video games.|$|E
