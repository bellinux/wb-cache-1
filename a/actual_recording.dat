5|$|Before each episode, Steel {{researches}} {{the history}} of the place in which he is going to perform. His research interests include local notable people, landmarks, customs and humorous anecdotes. The majority of the research sometimes took place close to the <b>actual</b> <b>recording</b> date. For example, Steel carried out almost no research for his episode in Walsall until ten days before the recording. In Merthyr Tydfil he spent three days in the town, where he carried out research and met locals. He then performs a tailor-made show about the town in front of a local audience. The style of the programme is similar to other shows starring Steel, such as The Mark Steel Lectures, in which Steel presented a humorous lecture about a famous person in history.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone Magazine {{wrote in}} 1973 that the {{combination}} of Taylor and Deacon [...] "is explosive, a colossal sonic volcano whose eruption makes the earth tremble." [...] Deacon played guitar in addition to bass, taking over rhythm parts on many albums, as well as several acoustic performances. Some of the guitar work on Hot Space (the clean Fender Telecaster single-coil sound) is Deacon's. He would occasionally play synthesizers on his own compositions and often composed at the piano, playing a Wurlitzer electric piano on [...] "You're My Best Friend". He can also be seen playing the grand piano in the music video to [...] "Spread Your Wings", although on the <b>actual</b> <b>recording</b> the piano was played by Mercury. Unlike the other three members of Queen, Deacon did not sing on the group's records.|$|E
500|$|After the {{orchestra}} sections were done, Ahmadzaï took the track {{back to his}} home in Paris and did a complete re-arrangement. String engineer Geoff Foster recalled that Madonna wanted something [...] "big and brass" [...] which Ahmadzaï denied, since Madonna had already done that with her 1998 single, [...] "Frozen". Colombier explained that the final version was not the way he had structured the song, it was according to Ahmadzaï's mixing and ideas. [...] "He's a master manipulator. Sixty real strings, played live, became audio files in his computer. They can be chopped like real pieces of fabric. He's amazingly brilliant with that," [...] concluded Colombier. Madonna attended the recording sessions at Olympic Studios in London. There was a tango section in the song which Colombier recalled was composed perfectly during rehearsals. But during the <b>actual</b> <b>recording</b> it did not work out as expected, prompting Madonna to grab the talkback mic and telling the crew, [...] "It's not sexy enough, think about sex!" ...|$|E
500|$|The group took a {{hands-on}} {{approach to the}} <b>actual</b> <b>recording</b> sessions for Phantom Power, engineering and producing themselves for the first time. Recording largely took place at AV Happenings {{during the second half}} of 2002, with the band working through the night so as not to disturb staff who worked in other parts of the building during the day. According to bassist Guto Pryce this involved a fair amount of trial and error as the band [...] "didn't really know what [...] were doing". Soundproof booths were improvised by setting up tents in the office corridors: [...] "we'd record a guitar and it'd sound rubbish and we had to figure out why. So we started experimenting with different tent designs. In the end it was the wigwam that was easiest to put up and sounded best". The band had to take these booths down before office workers arrived in the morning, a process that guitarist Huw Bunford has described as [...] "ghosts in the night ... a bit clandestine". A brief two-week session with Gorwel Owen at Rockfield Studios saw some of the album's more [...] "straight ahead" [...] tracks recorded with live vocals before the band returned to AV Happenings and [...] "messed around" [...] with them. When the album was almost finished the band enlisted the services of Tony Doogan who engineered sessions during which several vocal parts were recorded.|$|E

500|$|In a 2004 interview, Simpson {{said that}} when she began seeking a {{recording}} contract record labels would not meet with her because they thought she just wanted [...] "to be like her sister". Simpson also said {{that she did not}} want to meet with Jessica's record label (Columbia) because she wanted to be signed because of her music, rather than her sister. She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the whole concept of the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they really let me have my hands in there. I got to write a lot." [...] Simpson said of making the album: [...] "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the <b>actual</b> <b>recording,</b> it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work." [...] In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album's liner notes, Simpson includes Benji and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, with whom she worked on the song [...] "Harder Everyday," [...] which was released as an international bonus track.|$|E

The name was changed to [...] "Mandy" [...] during the <b>actual</b> <b>recording</b> session on August 20, 1974, {{due to the fact that}} there had already been a song called [...] "Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)" [...] performed by Looking Glass and released in 1972 on Davis' Epic label.|$|E

Very similar– straight rock songs, no ballads, no keyboards, no nothing, just rock." [...] The band also used old analog equipment instead of more popular digital recording gear. Simmons said: [...] "Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. You press this button, you don't have to do anything. But analog is the love of your life. You can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the <b>actual</b> <b>recording</b> process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible.

2500|$|A 9-1-1 caller, who {{was sitting}} in a nearby gazebo, {{reported}} that someone, possibly a juvenile, was pointing [...] "a pistol" [...] at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. The caller twice said that the gun was [...] "probably fake". According to police spokesmen, it was initially unclear whether or not that information had been relayed to the dispatched officers, Loehmann and Garmback, and it was later revealed that the dispatcher had not elaborated beyond referencing [...] "a gun". According to one report, the 9-1-1 responder twice asked whether the boy was black or white before dispatching officers to the park at around 3:30p.m. The <b>actual</b> <b>recording</b> of the phone call reveals that the 9-1-1 responder asked whether the boy was black or white three times; however, the question was repeated only after the caller continued describing the color of Rice's clothing. The caller then left the gazebo, and Rice sat down in it sometime later.|$|E

2500|$|On one {{occasion}} Humph {{announced that they}} had a very distinguished actor as a guest who would join in the game of Mornington Crescent. When the game started, after great ceremony, the penultimate player, the last of the panellists, won on his first move, thus denying the distinguished guest the opportunity to make a single move. The chairman apologised but explained that this was an unavoidable possibility and the guest left without having uttered a word. The show was allegedly inundated with complaints at the treatment of Sir Alec Guinness as on the <b>actual</b> <b>recording</b> Lyttelton can be heard to say, [...] "Well I'm very sorry about that. Rather unfortunate. We would like to go on and ask you a few things about what you're doing currently, Sir Alec, but we do have to hurry on to the next game."

2500|$|The HSCA, {{using an}} amateur film {{shot of the}} motorcade, {{concluded}} that the recording originated from the motorcycle of police officer H. B. McLain, who later testified before the committee that his microphone was often stuck in the open position. However, McLain did not hear the <b>actual</b> <b>recording</b> until after his testimony, and upon hearing it he adamantly denied that the recording originated from his motorcycle. He said that the other sounds on the recording did not match his movements. Sirens are not heard on the recording until more than two minutes after what {{is supposed to be}} the sound of the shooting; however, McLain accompanied the motorcade to Parkland Hospital immediately after the shooting, with sirens blaring the entire time. When the sirens are heard on the Dictabelt recording, they rise and recede in pitch (the Doppler effect) and volume, as if passing by. McLain also said that the engine sound was clearly from a three-wheeled motorcycle, not the two-wheeler that he drove: [...] "There's no comparison to the two sounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to the studio to self-produce their second album. Released on November 9, 1999, the album title Sugar shared the same name as the fifth track on the recording.

[...] "Knock Down Walls" [...] and [...] "You Wanted More" [...] were charting singles released off the record, with the latter having first appeared on the soundtrack to the movie American Pie.

2500|$|The 20th {{century was}} a golden era for electrophysiology. In 1902 {{and again in}} 1912, Julius Bernstein {{advanced}} {{the hypothesis that the}} action potential resulted from a change in the permeability of the axonal membrane to ions. Bernstein's hypothesis was confirmed by Ken Cole and Howard Curtis, who showed that membrane conductance increases during an action potential. In 1907, Louis Lapicque suggested that the action potential was generated as a threshold was crossed, what would be later shown as a product of the dynamical systems of ionic conductances. In 1949, Alan Hodgkin and Bernard Katz refined Bernstein's hypothesis by considering that the axonal membrane might have different permeabilities to different ions; in particular, they demonstrated the crucial role of the sodium permeability for the action potential. They made the first <b>actual</b> <b>recording</b> of the electrical changes across the neuronal membrane that mediate the action potential. This line of research culminated in the five 1952 papers of Hodgkin, Katz and Andrew Huxley, in which they applied the voltage clamp technique to determine the dependence of the axonal membrane's permeabilities to sodium and potassium ions on voltage and time, from which they were able to reconstruct the action potential quantitatively.* * * * [...] Hodgkin and Huxley correlated the properties of their mathematical model with discrete ion channels that could exist in several different states, including [...] "open", [...] "closed", and [...] "inactivated".
