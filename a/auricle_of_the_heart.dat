6000|$|And hence we are indebted, for the {{correction}} of {{the error of}} Erasistratus, {{to one of the}} greatest experimenters of ancient or modern times, Claudius Galenus, who lived in the second century after Christ. I say it was to this man more than any one else, because he knew that the only way of solving physiological problems was to examine into the facts in the living animal. And because Galen was a skilful anatomist, and a skilful experimenter, he was able to show in what particulars Erasistratus had erred, and to build up a system of thought upon this subject which was not improved upon for fully 1,300 years. I have endeavoured, in Fig. 2, to make clear to you exactly what it was he tried to establish. You will observe that this diagram is practically the same as that given in Fig. 1, only simplified. The same facts may be looked upon by different people from different points of view. Galen looked upon these facts from a very different point of view from that which we ourselves occupy; but, so far as the facts are concerned, they were the same for him as for us. Well then, the first thing that Galen did was to make out experimentally that, during life, the arteries are not full of air, but that they are full of blood. And he describes a great variety of experiments which he made upon living animals with the view of proving this point, which he did prove effectually and for all time; and that you will observe was the only way of settling the matter. Furthermore, he demonstrated that the cavities of {{the left side of the}} heart--what we now call the left auricle and the left ventricle--are, like the arteries, full of blood during life, and that that blood was of the scarlet kind--arterialised, or as he called it [...] "pneumatised," [...] blood. It was known before, that the pulmonary artery, the right ventricle, and the veins, contain the darker kind of blood, which was thence called venous. Having proved that the whole of the left side of the heart, during life, is full of scarlet arterial blood, Galen's next point was to inquire into the mode of communication between the arteries and veins. It was known before his time that both arteries and veins branched out. Galen maintained, though he could not prove the fact, that the ultimate branches of the arteries and veins communicated together somehow or other, by what he called 'anastomoses', and that these 'anastomoses' existed not only in the body in general but also in the lungs. In the next place, Galen maintained that all the veins of the body arise from the liver; that they draw the blood thence and distribute it over the body. People laugh at that notion now-a-days; but if anybody will look at the facts he will see that it is a very probable supposition. There is a great vein (hepatic vein--Fig. 1) which rises out of the liver, and that vein goes straight into the 'vena cava' (Fig. 1) which passes to the heart, being there joined by the other veins of the body. The liver itself is fed by a very large vein (portal vein--Fig. 1), which comes from the alimentary canal. The way the ancients looked at this matter was, that the food, after being received into the alimentary canal, was then taken up by the branches of this great vein, which are called the 'vena portae', just as the roots of a plant suck up nourishment from the soil in which it lives; that then it was carried to the liver, there to be what was called [...] "concocted," [...] which was their phrase for its conversion into substances more fitted for nutrition than previously existed in it. They then supposed that the next thing to be done was to distribute this fluid through the body; and Galen like his predecessors, imagined that the [...] "concocted" [...] blood, having entered the great 'vena cava', was distributed by its ramifications all over the body. So that, in his view (Fig. 2), the course of the blood was from the intestine to the liver, and from the liver into the great 'vena cava', including what we now call the right <b>auricle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> whence it was distributed by the branches of the veins. But the whole of the blood was not thus disposed of. Part of the blood, it was supposed, went through what we now call the pulmonary arteries (Fig. 1), and, branching out there, gave exit to certain [...] "fuliginous" [...] products, and at the same time took in from the air a something which Galen calls the 'pneuma'. He does not know anything about what we call oxygen; but it is astonishing how very easy it would be to turn his language into the equivalent of modern chemical theory. The old philosopher had so just a suspicion of the real state of affairs that you could make use of his language in many cases, if you substituted the word [...] "oxygen," [...] which we now-a-days use, for the word 'pneuma'. Then he imagined that the blood, further concocted or altered by contact with the 'pneuma', passed to a certain extent to the left side of the heart. So that Galen believed that there was such a thing as what is now called the pulmonary circulation. He believed, as much as we do, that the blood passed through the right side of the heart, through the artery which goes to the lungs, through the lungs themselves, and back by what we call the pulmonary veins to the left side of the heart. But he thought it was only a very small portion of the blood which passes to the right side of the heart in this way; the rest of the blood, he thought, passed through the partition which separates the two ventricles of the heart. He describes a number of small pits, which really exist there, as holes, and he supposed that the greater part of the blood passed through these holes from the right to the left ventricle (Fig 2).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the regulatory role {{of the immune system}} on gastrointestinal macromolecular permeabil-ity in neonates, and ontogeny of the neonatal immune system, we have developed a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) program capable of maintaining immunologically “virgin ” germfree (GF) neonatal piglets. GF colostrum-deprived piglets obtained by aseptic hysterectomy 3 - 5 days prior to term were denied any oral feeding and maintained on central venous hyperalimenta-tion in the GF isolators. GF piglets were anesthetized and 20 -gauge silicone tubing was inserted into the external jugular vein and advanced to the level of right <b>auricle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> The distal end of the cannula was subcutaneously tunneled out between the shoulders and attached to a light jacket, tether, and swivel assembly that allowed the piglet to move freely inside the cage in a germfree unit. The TPN formula provided 60 Calfkgfday for the first day and gradually increased up to 165 Cal/kg/day for day- 7 and older piglets. The GF piglets were maintained on the TPN formula for 21 days and weight gain of the GF-TPN piglets averaged 23 g/day. The hematologic and serum biochemical parameters of GF-TPN piglets were within the normal range of gnotobiotic animals of their age group. The serum levels of total protein and albumin in the GF-TPN piglets were significantly less than those of colostrum-fed piglets, who absorbed a large quantity of the colostral macromolecules through their gastrointestinal tract into the blood stream. The TPN-maintained GF piglet model, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to examine a possible immuno-regulatory role of maternal immunoglobulins on the intestinal permeability to macromolecules, the antigenicity of TPN, and the role of antigen and maternal antibodies on the ontogeny of the neonatal immune system.

40|$|In 6 {{patients}} with bacterial endocarditis studies {{were made of}} the bacterial content of arterial and venous blood. Paired samples were collected, approximately simultaneously, from two different locations in the circulatory system, and colony counts were determined. As many as 48 specimens were taken for culture during a single period of study. Venous blood was drawn not only from different locations in the extremities, {{but also from the}} superior and inferior venae cavae, the right auricle, and the hepatic and renal veins. As would be expected, colony counts were highest in arterial blood. Blood from the antecubital veins gave colony counts only slightly lower than arterial blood. In the femoral veins, on the other hand, there were appreciably fewer organisms. This difference is attributed to the type of tissues drained by the two veins. Colony counts in blood from the superior and inferior venae cavae were also lower than arterial counts, the ratio being comparable to that found in femoral vein blood. In the renal veins colony counts were only slightly below the arterial level indicating that few organisms are removed from the blood during passage through the kidneys. The greatest reduction in bacterial content was found in hepatic vein blood. In 3 of the 6 subjects this reduction amounted to more than 95 per cent, and in all subjects the difference was very considerable. Mixed venous blood in the right <b>auricle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> gave colony counts which were usually one-half to two-thirds as high as in corresponding samples of arterial blood. An interesting finding in these studies was a remarkable constancy of the bacterial content of arterial blood, during periods of 1 or 2 hours. Despite the fact that a considerable portion of the bacteria which leave the heart in arterial blood appear to be removed during a single circuit of the body, the number of bacteria in successive samples of arterial blood shows little change. This indicates that in bacterial endocarditis organisms are discharged into the blood from the endocardial vegetations at a comparatively even rate, rather than in a haphazard fashion {{as a result of the}} breaking off of infected particles...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Irradiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> {{may lead}} to late {{cardiovascular}} complications and depending on the dose to cardiac-related death. There is increasing evidence that left atrial appendages {{play an important role}} in left ventricular filling especially in cardiac disease. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present study was to investigate <b>the</b> radiation response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat <b>heart</b> (<b>auricles</b> in particular) at morphological, histological and transcriptional level. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were irradiated with a single dose locally on <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> (0 - 22. 5 Gy). End-diastolic diameters <b>of</b> left <b>auricles</b> were measured during evaluation of cardiac function. Histopathological evaluations were performed at various time points up to 16 months post irradiation. Changes in mRNA expression of procollagen types I and III and pro-fibrogenic cytokines (TGF-beta 1 and IL- 1 beta) were investigated using competitive PCR. RESULTS: Irradiation leads to a dose-dependent decrease in end-diastolic diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>auricles.</b> This decrease was observed at 4 months post-irradiation, where no gross damage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ventricle has been reported. Histologically, epicardial fibrosis was found already 1 month post irradiation, and <b>the</b> frequency/severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structural changes appeared to be dose-dependent and progressive with time post irradiation. At 9 months, fibrosis was observed in all three layers (epicardium, myocardium and endocardium) <b>of</b> both <b>auricles.</b> On <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> gene expression, increases in procollagen types I and III were observed at 12 and 3 months post irradiation, respectively. Increases in IL- 1 beta and TGF-beta 1, cytokines known to influence collagen deposition at different levels, preceded <b>the</b> upregulation <b>of</b> procollagen mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Auricles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat <b>heart</b> show a marked pathological response to ionizing radiation, characterized by generalized accumulation of collagen (fibrosis) and a reduction <b>of</b> end-diastolic diameter. <b>The</b> reduction <b>of</b> auricular volume and loss of elasticity will negatively contribute to <b>the</b> pump function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> irradiated ventricle...|$|R
40|$|Background: Immediately after {{cardioversion}} of {{atrial fibrillation}} (AF) to sinus rhythm (SR) the atrial contractility is impaired. And especially <b>the</b> transience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atrial contractile dysfunction {{may play a}} pivotal role in a postfibrillatory positiv inotropic intervention. Hence we analysed <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> some positive inotropic agents on <b>the</b> atrial myocardium <b>of</b> patients with chronic atrial fibrillation in vitro. Methods: Biopsies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right human <b>auricle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>heart</b> were taken from patients undergoing open mitral valve surgery. 47 patients were in stable SR, 43 patients in chronic AF. From these, bundles of muscle fibres were prepared under microscopic control and stimulated with square pulses at standard conditions (1 Hz, 37 °C). Force of contractions (mN/ mm 2) before and after the agent specific incubation period were used to characterize the positive inotropy in both groups. In particular, the following agents were analyzed: Ca 2 + -Sensitizer (EMD), Na+/ Ka+ -ATPase -Inhibitor (DHO), Na+ -Channel-Modulator (BDF), ß-receptor-agonist (Isoproterenol, Iso), and Calcium (Ca 2 +) as a reference positive inotropic ion. Conclusions: 1) Although <b>the</b> baseline force <b>of</b> contraction is reduced by nearly 75 % in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, Ca 2 + could reveal a strong positive inotropic effect in the AF group. Deductively, <b>the</b> contractile reserve <b>of</b> patients with chronic atrial fibrillation is preserved. 2) Both DHO and Iso were not able to increase <b>the</b> force <b>of</b> contraction in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation compared to SR patients. 3) Ca 2 + -sensitizer (EMD) and Na+ -channel-modulator (BDF) were able to enhance <b>the</b> force <b>of</b> contraction in both groups significantly implying an important role as future therapeutic alternatives...|$|R

This study investigated the physiology and innervation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardiac tissues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squid Alloteuthis subulata, Loligo forbesii and L vulgaris.

30|$|An {{evaluation}} of cold tolerance {{was performed on}} <b>the</b> experimental farm <b>of</b> Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, China (47 ° 98 ′N, 128 ° 08 ′E) in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The parents and RIL populations were grown in a randomized block design with two replications of double row plots, a 2 -m row length, a 30 -cm row spacing and a 10 -cm hill spacing. The 190 RILs were divided into three groups, early maturing, middle-maturing and late-maturing groups, according to their heading dates. DN 422 belongs to the late-maturing group, and KY 131 belongs to the early maturing group. For <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> cold tolerance, each group was irrigated with 17  °C water in an irrigated pool (25  m[*]×[*] 5  m) independently from the panicle initiation stage (approximately 35  days after transplanting for the early maturing group, approximately 40  days after transplanting for the middle-maturing group, and approximately 45  days after transplanting for the late-maturing group) to the full heading stage. When <b>the</b> <b>auricle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag leaf is approximately 5  cm below <b>the</b> <b>auricle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penultimate leaf on each plant, the pollen should have undergone meiosis, which was indicative of panicle initiation stage (Satake and Hayase 1970). Water at 17  °C was prepared in a storage pool with a cool and warm water mixture measured by the temperature sensors. Flood irrigation was performed from the inlet to the outlet (5  m) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> irrigated pool. <b>The</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> irrigated water was 18 – 20  cm, and the irrigated time was from 8 a.m. to 16 p.m. every day.|$|R
40|$|The authors relate a {{therapeutic}} catastrophe, entailing 16 exhumations, following <b>the</b> administration <b>of</b> capsules containing digitoxin instead of oestradiol benzoate to patients suffering from prostatic cancer. The exhumations {{were carried out}} from 17 to 40 months (minus 3 days) after death. In decomposed bodies digitoxin remains in skeletal muscle and it is there that one has <b>the</b> best chance <b>of</b> detecting it. <b>The</b> reason probably {{lies in the fact}} that putrefaction sets in more slowly in this tissue than elsewhere. Routine chemical investigations were entirely unsuccessful except in 2 cases where thin layer chromatography provided a weak positive reaction in the muscle. On the contrary, entirely convincing, positive proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> glycoside was obtained by resorting to Trevan and co-workers' biological method (1928), using <b>the</b> isolated <b>auricles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rabbit. In all, 200 tracings were made, necessitating <b>the</b> sacrifice <b>of</b> some 60 rabbits. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 16 patients exhumed, 2, who were known for certain not to have received any digitoxin at all, were negative. Nine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14 others were strongly positive, 2 only probable and 1 doubtful. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14, only 2 eases remained negative although they had also undoubtedly taken large doses of digitoxin, but this was expected from <b>the</b> start because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extremely advanced state of putrefaction of those bodies.

40|$|A new fern species, Polystichum oblanceolatum H. He & Li Bing Zhang (Dryopteridaceae), is {{described}} and illustrated from a karst cave in Guangxi, southern China. As {{a member of}} Polystichum Roth sect. Haplopolystichum Tagawa, P. oblanceolatum, is morphologically most similar to P. dielsii Christ and P. liui Ching, but is distinguishable from the latter two by its often oblanceolate lamina with acute apex, its repand or broadly dentate pinnae with non-spinulose toothed distal margins, and the less developed, more or less truncate, but not sharply acute, basal acroscopic <b>auricles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pinnae.
