40|$|Many {{processor}} architectures {{provide a}} set of addressing modes in their address generation units. For example DSPs (digital signal processors) have powerful addressing modes for efficiently implementing numerical algorithms. Typical addressing modes of DSPs are auto post-modification and indexing for <b>address</b> registers. The <b>selection</b> of the optimal addressing modes in the means of minimal code size and minimal execution time depends on many parameters and is NP complete in general. In this work we present a new approach for solving the <b>addressing</b> mode <b>selection</b> (AMS) problem. We provide a method for modeling the target architectureâ€™s addressing modes as cost functions for a partitioned boolean quadratic optimization problem (PBQP). For solving the PBQP we present an efficient and effect way to implement large matrices for modeling the cost model. We have integrated the <b>addressing</b> mode <b>selection</b> with the Atair C-Compiler for the uPD 7705 x DSP from NEC. In our experiments we show that the <b>addressing</b> mode <b>selection</b> can be optimally solved for almost all benchmark programs and the compile-time overhead of the <b>address</b> mode <b>selection</b> is within acceptable bounds for a production DSP compiler. ...|$|R

30|$|This {{study has}} {{analysed}} {{the relationship between}} high effort, low self-esteem, and {{external locus of control}} and the risk of dropping out from education and labour market for English youths. We used the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, which is a rich source of information on English teenagers and can be linked to the National Pupil Database in order to get detailed information on school outcomes from administrative sources. We find that personality traits have a relevant link with the probability of being out of education or employment between the ages of 18 and 21. The size of the relation is notable and is higher than other important variables, such as maternal education or employment status or growing up in a single parent household. As in all non-experimental studies, the results should be interpreted as associations rather than definitive evidence of causal effects, given the impossibility of fully <b>addressing</b> <b>selection</b> on unobservables.|$|R
