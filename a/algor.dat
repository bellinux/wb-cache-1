50|$|<b>Algor</b> mortis (Latin: algor—coldness; mortis—of death), {{the second}} stage of death, is the change in body {{temperature}} post mortem, until the ambient temperature is matched. This is generally a steady decline, although if the ambient temperature is above the body temperature (such as in a hot desert), the change in temperature will be positive, as the (relatively) cooler body acclimates to the warmer environment. External factors can have a significant influence. <b>Algor</b> mortis also occurs when the body dies.|$|E
50|$|Loughton's High Road in the Middle Ages ran to Woodford to the south, {{but to the}} north, {{surrounded}} by Forest, it petered out, with footpaths running down to the Roding from Buckhurst Hill and to Chigwell. However, between 1611-1622, the High Road was extended via what is now Church Hill and Goldings Hill to Epping, and this quickly became the main coaching route from London to East Anglia. However, it remained a difficult route for horse-drawn traffic, because of steep hills, so in 1830-34 the Epping New Road was constructed. As early as 1404 the High Road was mentioned in a court action, when one John Lucteborough was prosecuted for throwing the rubbish from his ditch outside Richard <b>Algor's</b> gate on the King's highway. Richard <b>Algor's</b> house survived in part, concealed by much overbuilding, until 1963 near the junction of Algers Road and High Road. Many of Loughton's other roads are of ancient origin, such as Rectory Lane, Traps Hill, and Smarts Lane.|$|R
40|$|The {{deflection}} between FEA simulation {{and experiment}} test results still exist which affects {{the quality and}} accuracy of the results. Addressing {{it has become more}} challenging due to more stringent demands on simulation processes. It is becoming necessary to very rapidly identify sources of unnatural deflection for diagnostic and intervention purposes. The problem include the less efficient design for die and punch, limited die and punch for complex shape, and the unknown displacement control for round shape bending process of sheet metal. For methodology, a v-shape bend experiment and a v-shape bend simulation is done to show result. Comparison between the results of experiment and simulation to measure <b>Algor's</b> analysis accuracy which is applied to simulate round shape bend of sheet metal. Characteristics of sheet metal such as springback are observed during the simulation analysis. In addition, several designs are proposed for round shape bend and to determine which design is best for bending 62. 5 mm radius sheet metal. A data sheet containing the displacement control of the press brake machine is developed from the simulation. The framework used to develop the data sheet is general enough for further investigation by either evaluating other designs of its components or by extending its application to other problems...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was done on}} varying designs for flexible links {{to determine how the}} mechanical properties of the link changed depending upon slight design changes. The {{analysis was}} performed by varying the length of the small tapered section center by a value based on its diameter multiplied by 0 to 6 times. The length of the center of the link was varied depending on the length of the ends (either 0. 5 " or 0. 25 ") so that the overall height of the link remained at 3. 5 " with 0. 5 " ends and 3 " with 0. 25 "ends. <b>Algor's</b> FEMPRO was used to perform bending and compression tests on the links with a one-pound load. From the deflections obtained, the stiffness of the links could be calculated in both bending and compression. From this the stiffness ratio could be found. For design purposes, the stiffness ratio had to at least greater than 5000 : 1 to ensure proper performance of the links in the dynamometer. Overall, all link variations obtained a ratio greater than 5000 : 1 excluding the shortest length link with 0 x tapered section center. In addition, a stress analysis was performed on the links using FEMPRO. For this a proper mesh on the link had to be created in Cadkey and then imported in FEMPRO. Only a select few link were used in the stress analysis since the overall stress had little to no variation between different links. Overall, a stress of 43500 psi was obtained and this value did not change more than 300 to 400 psi in all the links tested. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

A man named Iras <b>Algor</b> wanted to lead a search for the seventh black book. However, no one knew of a way into the darklands. Iras <b>Algor</b> then recalled that Aresius had told him to search for Dargor. Surely he knew the way.

5000|$|Among coroners {{and other}} investigators, such as {{homicide}} and forensic detectives, livor mortis {{is not considered}} an exact way to measure time of death, but instead {{is a way to}} approximate it.

50|$|In {{forensic}} investigation, {{the time}} of occurrence of an event (such as time of death, time of incident) {{is one of the}} most important things to determine accurately as soon as possible. Sometimes this can only be estimated.

50|$|Transient {{evidence}} is frequently relied upon in {{the determination of}} time of death. The condition of rigor mortis begins to manifest after about 3 hours after death, and lasts about 72 hours.

[...] Shortly after death, within three to six hours, the muscular tissues become rigid and incapable of relaxing, during a stage called rigor mortis.

They also conjectured that all graphs can have an incidence coloring using Δ(G) + 2 colors (Incidence coloring conjecture - ICC). This conjecture was disproved by Guiduli, who showed that incidence coloring concept is a directed star arboricity case, introduced by Alon and <b>Algor.</b> His counter example showed that incidence chromatic number is at most Δ(G) + O(log Δ(G)).|$|E

There is dispute over this suggestion, since Cornwell also claims that the summer of 1978 saw a high air temperature in Rome that was behind the decision to embalm the Pope as soon as possible (see above). Cornwell's conclusion of rigor mortis onset also contradicts his conclusion that the Pope's corpse was manipulated into position (sitting up in bed, holding papers) after discovery.|$|E

5000|$|Putrefaction is {{the fifth}} stage of death, {{following}} pallor mortis, <b>algor</b> mortis, rigor mortis, and livor mortis. This process references the breaking down of a body of a human or animal post mortem (meaning after death). In broad terms, it {{can be viewed as}} the decomposition of proteins, and the eventual breakdown of the cohesiveness between tissues, and the liquefaction of most organs. This is caused by the decomposition of organic matter by bacterial or fungal digestion, which causes the release of gases that infiltrate the body's tissues, and leads to the deterioration of the tissues and organs. The approximate time it takes putrefaction to occur is dependent on various factors. Internal factors that affect the rate of putrefaction include the age at which death has occurred, the overall structure and condition of the body, the cause of death, and external injuries arising before or after death. External factors include environmental temperature, moisture and air exposure, clothing, burial factors, and light exposure.|$|E
