5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress as many times <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|E

25|$|Independent {{schools and}} Autonomous schools can admit up to 20% and 10% of their {{students}} via the Direct School Admission scheme (DSA) respectively. Students apply through exercises conducted by the schools around July and August, receiving notice of the results shortly after. Schools offering the Integrated Programme (IP) can take in as many students <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> via DSA. Other schools have also been granted permission by the Ministry of Education to take in students specialising in the schools' niche areas up {{to a maximum of}} 5% of their total student intake.|$|E
25|$|Airlines use futures {{contracts}} and derivatives to hedge {{their exposure to}} the price of jet fuel. They know that they must purchase jet fuel for as long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to stay in business, and fuel prices are notoriously volatile. By using crude oil futures contracts to hedge their fuel requirements (and engaging in similar but more complex derivatives transactions), Southwest Airlines was able to save a large amount of money when buying fuel as compared to rival airlines when fuel prices in the U.S. rose dramatically after the 2003 Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
25|$|Further studies {{reveal that}} the {{identification}} of second-generation immigrants, of Caribbean heritage, as African Americans leads these children to be more aware of racial discrimination in the U.S. In addition, the assimilation into black society and black culture in the U.S. by these children is hindered by their parents' oppositional stance to American black culture, contributing to identity conflict. In the case of Haitians, first generation Haitians hold on strongly to their foreign identity, as they associate the preservation of their culture with stronger solidarity in the community. These first generation Haitians attempt to instill this same Haitian pride in their children <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> the children to succeed {{on the basis of}} ethnic solidarity and the preservation of Haitian culture, and not by giving in to American culture. This creates a clash between the ideas and values these children learn at home, and from their peers and the non-Haitian black community. Thus, these children face conflicting pressures from family, non-second generation immigrant peers, and discrimination by the larger society.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} {{declaring that the}} fight was off, Arum {{had a change of}} heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it {{deadline}} to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests—one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of fair trade and ethical {{marketing}} organizations employing different marketing strategies. Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient volume of trade to affect the developing world. The Fairtrade brand is by far the biggest of the fair trade coffee brands. Packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional 10c per lb premium by buyers for community development projects. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices. The exporting cooperative can spend the money in several ways. Some go to meeting the costs of conformity and certification: as they have to meet fair trade standards on all their produce, they have to recover the costs from a small part of their turnover, sometimes as little as 8%, and may not make any profit. Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers. The cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but there is no evidence on which is more common.|$|E

500|$|When {{working with}} actors, Nolan prefers {{giving them the}} time to perform as many takes of a given scene <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} the {{lighting}} and camera setups, the technical things, take all the time, but running another take generally only adds a couple of minutes.... If an actor tells me they can do something more with a scene, I give them the chance, because it's not going to cost that much time. It can't all be about the technical issues." [...] Gary Oldman praised the director for providing a relaxed atmosphere on set, adding [...] "I've never seen him raise his voice to anyone". He also observed that Nolan would give the actors space to [...] "find things in the scene", and not just give direction for direction's sake.|$|E

[...] The supporters responded with chants of [...] "We're Hull City, we'll die when we want" [...] during that day's home match against Liverpool. Manager Steve Bruce credited the controversy for creating [...] " [...] a fantastic atmosphere" [...] but added, [...] "I have got to have a conversation with him because I don't think he quite understands what it means in terms of history and tradition." [...] However, Bruce also said that, because of the money Allam had invested in the club, [...] "If he thinks Hull Tigers is his way forward then we have to respect it." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{her first}} {{appearance}} in 1969, Driver remained {{in the role of}} Betty continuously. She suggested in 1999 that if she gave up she would die [...] "within a month from sheer boredom". In a 2006 interview she laughed off the notion of retirement, saying: [...] "From day one on The Street everyone has been very kind to me. In fact, I'm godmother to Bill Roache's son. So as long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> me, I'm happy to stay. The Street is like home and they really are my family." [...] She confirmed her intention to remain on the show in 2010, when the character celebrated her 90th birthday. In May 2010, the News of the World reported that Driver had decided to retire, just prior to the actress's 90th birthday. Driver was distressed by the rumour, and assured producer Phil Collinson of her intention to remain with the soap, and was told that Betty was {{very much a part of}} plans for the series' upcoming 50th anniversary celebrations. Driver died on 15 October 2011, having appeared in over 2,800 episodes of Coronation Street.|$|E
500|$|Flexible {{and little}} binding, Antoinist beliefs {{are close to}} the {{contemporary}} belief, as followers can choose the beliefs they wish and interpret events <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> The religion attaches great importance to freedom of conscience and free will, which renders it attractive and promotes a diversity of beliefs among the followers who can refer simultaneously to other religious traditions. Some believers see Antoine as an incarnation of God; others, who continue to practice Catholicism, consider him a prophet equal to Jesus Christ; others, who adhere to New Age doctrines, perceive him as a spiritual figure. The movement rejects indoctrination of children and prozelytism, even towards people who visit the temple, tolerates other religions as they teach the faith and prayer and thus detach people from the material world, and considers tolerance the highest virtue to practise. The religion does not provide any prescription on issues such as divorce, abortion and sexuality, has no political purpose and do not use honorary titles, considering all people equal. A periodical directed by writer Louis Pauwels summarized the main purposes of the religion as being the [...] "mutual aid, spiritual and human solidarity, availability and hospitality".|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the role, Kensit spent three days shadowing a real nurse, and observed open heart surgery being performed as research. She commented on the experience: [...] "I wanted to throw up. First of all I stood in the corner {{but in the end}} I couldn't get close enough ... nurses are incredible women. They're doing this job for next to nothing and do it with such love and care... I couldn't do it, I'd get too emotionally involved, I don't think I could cope." [...] In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in series 16 of Holby City sister show Casualty, appearing as a domestic abuse victim and giving what TV critic Ian Hyland deemed [...] "a convincing performance". Prior to her move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of Holby City: [...] "Making films isn't for me any more because I'm an old girl in that world ... I've been very lucky, this is something I grew up doing, in television there's so much satisfaction ... I'll stay as long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> me, I feel like I've come back home." ...|$|E
