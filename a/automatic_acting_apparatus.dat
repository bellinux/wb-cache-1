The small gravity acceleration (considered here as not varying between the two plates) allows us to perform all calculations to first order in this parameter. Some interesting results are found: a correction, depending on the gravity acceleration, to the well-known Casimir energy and pressure on the plates.

40|$|We {{review and}} assess {{a part of}} the recent work on Casimir {{apparatuses}} in the weak gravitational field of the Earth. For a free, real massless scalar field subject to Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the parallel plates, the resulting regularized and renormalized energy-momentum tensor is covariantly conserved, while the trace anomaly vanishes if the massless field is conformally coupled to gravity. Conformal coupling also ensures a finite Casimir energy and finite values of the pressure upon parallel plates. These results have been extended to an electromagnetic field subject to perfect conductor (hence idealized) boundary conditions on parallel plates, by various authors. The regularized and renormalized energy-momentum tensor has been evaluated up to second order in the gravity acceleration. In both the scalar and the electromagnetic case, studied to first order in the gravity acceleration, the theory predicts a tiny force in the upwards direction <b>acting</b> on the <b>apparatus.</b> This effect is conceptually very interesting, since it means that Casimir energy is indeed expected to gravitate, although the magnitude of the expected force makes it necessary to overcome very severe signal-modulation problems.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that captive rooks, like {{chimpanzees}} and other primates, develop cooperative alliances with their conspecifics. Furthermore, the pressures hypothesized to have favoured social intelligence in primates also apply to corvids. We tested cooperative problem-solving in rooks to compare their performance and cognition with primates. Without training, eight rooks quickly solved a problem in which two individuals had to pull both ends of a string simultaneously in order to pull in a food platform. Similar to chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys, performance was better when within-dyad tolerance levels were higher. In contrast to chimpanzees, rooks did not delay <b>acting</b> on the <b>apparatus</b> while their partner gained access to the test room. Furthermore, given a choice between an apparatus that could be operated individually over one that required the action of two individuals, four out of six individuals showed no preference. These results may indicate that cooperation in chimpanzees is underpinned by more complex cognitive processes than that in rooks. Such a difference may arise {{from the fact that}} while both chimpanzees and rooks form cooperative alliances, chimpanzees, but not rooks, live in a variable social network made up of competitive and cooperative relationships...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} deep <b>acting,</b> <b>automatic</b> regulation and customer tips with 2 different study designs.

Whereas deep acting refers to deliberate attempts to modify felt emotions and involves conscious effort, automatic regulation refers to automated emotion regulatory processes that result in the natural experience of desired emotions and do not involve deliberate control and effort. Multilevel analyses revealed that both types of emotion regulation were positively associated with customer tips. The second study was an experimental field study using a sample of German hairdressers (N = 41).

40|$|The nuclear {{receptor}} coactivators {{participate in}} the transcriptional activation of specific genes by nuclear receptors. In this study, we report the isolation of a nuclear receptor coactivator-interacting protein from a human liver cDNA library by using the coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-interacting protein (PRIP) (ASC 2 /AIB 3 /RAP 250 /NRC/TRBP) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Human PRIP-interacting protein cDNA has an ORF of 2, 556 nucleotides, encodes a protein with 852 amino acids, and contains a 9 -aa VVDAFCGVG methyltransferase motif I and an invariant GXXGXXI segment found in K-homology motifs of many RNA-binding proteins. The gene encoding this protein, designated PRIP-interacting protein with methyltransferase domain (PIMT), is localized on chromosome 8 q 11 and spans more than 40 kb. PIMT mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, {{with a high level}} of expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and placenta. Using the immunofluorescence localization method, we found that PIMT and PRIP proteins appear colocalized in the nucleus. PIMT strongly interacts with PRIP under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and the PIMT-binding site on PRIP is in the region encompassing amino acids 773 – 927. PIMT binds S-adenosyl-l-methionine, the methyl donor for methyltransfer reaction, and it also binds RNA, suggesting that it is a putative RNA methyltransferase. PIMT enhances the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and retinoid-X-receptor α, which is further stimulated by coexpression of PRIP, implying that PIMT is a component of nuclear receptor signal transduction <b>apparatus</b> <b>acting</b> through PRIP. Definitive identification of the specific substrate of PIMT and the role of this RNA-binding protein in transcriptional regulation remain to be determined...|$|R
5000|$|Hayes, in {{her article}} on {{impurity}} in Ancient Jewish society, states that it is commonly misconceived that the expulsion of the Gentile wives {{was a result of}} Judaean exceptionalism and nationalism. Hayes points out that the theory is not correct arguing that the root cause is largely a fundamental and core belief found within the religious laws of the Judaeans. Ezra, Hayes explains, imagined Israel as divinely ordained to remain pure and holy, set apart and without the influence of other nations in Canaan, just as the Priestly division were commanded, by God, to practice marriage exclusivity. In reaction to contemporaries, such as Hayes and Klawans, who argue that Ezra-Nehemiah's purity ideology is a product of conservative [...] "ritual" [...] and [...] "moral" [...] purity, independently; Olyan claims that Ezra-Nehemiah's alien expulsion mandate was a result of a melding ideology taken from, the two seemingly independent ideas of, [...] "moral" [...] and [...] "ritual" [...] purity and remains exclusive to the particular narrative of Ezra-Nehemiah. Moral purity has familial implications, which the lack of may cause disruption in the cohesiveness of the family unit. Transgressing Israelite moral structure was feared to cause violations of the commandments, which ordained by God, must be adhered to maintain ethnical identity. The influence of gentile women and culture upon Israelite men and posterity, through the eyes of ancient Judaean Priests, could turn Yahweh worshippers towards foreign deities and hedonism. Ritual purity stresses the importance of keeping to sacred practices dictated by revered predecessors and the Holy Scriptures. Olyan believes that Ezra's expulsion of the gentiles could also be linked with the idea that outside lineage would initially pollute the priestly bloodline, <b>acting</b> as an <b>apparatus</b> to destroy [...] "right" [...] ritual practice.|$|R
40|$|Restoring {{locomotion}} functionality of transfemoral amputees {{is essential}} for early rehabilitation treatment and for preserving mobility and independence in daily life. Research in wearable robotics fostered the development of innovative active mechatronic lowerlimb prostheses designed with the goal to reduce the cognitive and physical effort of lower-limb amputees in rehabilitation and daily life activities. To ensure benefits to the users, active mechatronic prostheses {{are expected to be}} aware of the user intention and properly interact in a closed humanintheloop paradigm. In the state of the art various cognitive interfaces have been proposed to online decode the user's intention. Electromyography in combination with mechanical sensing such as inertial or pressure sensors is a widely adopted solution for driving active mechatronic prostheses. In this framework, researchers also explored targeted muscles reinnervation for an objectiveoriented surgical amputation promoting wider usability of active prostheses. However, information kept by the neural component of the cognitive interface deteriorates in a prolonged use scenario due to electrodesrelated issues, thereby undermining the correct functionality of the active prosthesis. The objective of this work is to present a novel controller for an active transfemoral prosthesis based on whole body awareness relying on a wireless distributed noninvasive sensory <b>apparatus</b> <b>acting</b> as cognitive interface.

40|$|In {{the light}} of the present {{situation}} that placement of artificial fish-reefs has been strongly promoted in order to develop inshore fisheries, we began to study three multi-component artificial fish-reefs in Kata Bay, Pacific coast of Central Japan, as a model of artificial fish-reefs, to clarify function and effect of them. As a fundamental study, in this article we made a general description of the study fish-reefs first, then dealt with encrusting organisms and fish communities. The study fish-reefs were built in 23 - 35 m depth, from 1973 to 1976, almost at the middle between two set-nets situated close to each other. Main aim of placement of the fish-reefs is to attract fish for the set-nets. Three multi-component artificial fish-reefs are each constructed of 785 ㎥ of quarry rocks, 124 concrete shelteres, and 259 units of tier shelters. The tier fish-reef is accompanied by some five wooden ships. Biological surveys were carried out six times from 1977, eleven months after completion of the fish-reefs, to 1980, through direct obsevations by using SCUBA. Besides <b>automatic</b> under-water cameras <b>acting</b> by interval-timer and under-water TV with remote-control were occasionally used to watch come-and-go of fish on the fish-reefs. Communities of encrusting organisms are referable to a feather duster worms-moss animals complex. Most dominant species are Hydroides norvegica and caberea lata. Flora is very scarce as it is too deep. Though restricted to the most shallow, quarry rock fish-reef, only a brown alga, Ecklomiopsis radicola, has been found flourishing. 81 fish species representing 41 families and 64 genera were observed in all. Most frequently seen and important commercial fish are sardine, Sardinops melanosticta, anchovy Engraulis japonicus, beackperch, Oplegnathus fasiatus, grunt, parapres-tipoma trilineatum, and jack mackerel, Trachurus japonicus. Fish observed on the fish-reefs were classified on the basis of mode of life and relationship to the fish-reef into three categories under the names of visitor, transient and resident. Some discussions on the relationships between fishes belonging to respective categories and the fish-reef were made and ended with a conclusion that the height of the artificial fish-reef is one of the important factors yeiding sufficient reef-effects...|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{reality has}} been used widely as a {{computerized}} medium for training. In addition to visual and auditory feedback, the addition of haptic feedback to virtual environments envisions promising applications for human motor skill acquisition, such as rehabilitation and training of surgeons. Generally speaking, there exist two kinds of virtual training paradigms, virtual practice and haptic guidance. Compared to virtual practice, haptic guidance conveys more information to the trainee, some of which might not be realizable in the physical world, {{in order to improve}} the training efficacy over practice. In this thesis, the most general form of haptic guidance, shared control, is introduced. A shared controller dynamically intervenes, through an <b>automatic</b> feedback controller <b>acting</b> upon the system, to modify the coupled system dynamics during training. The coupled system dynamics are to be selected to help expedite learning of the task. Specifically, an error-reducing shared controller is proposed and implemented for this dissertation. A series of human-participant studies have been conducted to test the efficacy of the proposed shared control approach for performance enhancement and training in virtual environments. During the experiments, performance is measured utilizing a Fitts'-like under-actuated target-hitting task. Experimental results indicate that an error-reducing shared control paradigm with fixed control gains does enhance performance of the participants during the target-hitting task when assistance is on. However, a one-month long training experiment reveals that the error-reducing shared control paradigm with fixed control gains exhibits negative efficacy during training in virtual environments. It is suggested that the fixed control gains implemented in the shared controller are one of the primary reasons for negative efficacy of haptic guidance for training. Therefore, a shared controller with performance-based gain adaptation was also tested. In addition to comparisons with the fixed-gain shared controller, this paradigm is also compared to virtual fixtures, another commonly used form of haptic guidance. The experimental results indicate that the performance-based progressive shared control paradigm results in significantly better training performance than all other haptic guidance training protocols implemented in this study. Hence, the training effectiveness of performance-based error reducing shared control is verified. Finally, this study is aimed to improve the design of progressive shared control algorithms for manual control tasks. Therefore, a perception study has been conducted quantifying human sensitivity to varying system dynamics. The results of this study form the basis for properly choosing the step size of the progressive control gains of shared controllers...|$|R
40|$|A working {{dental model}} is a model made from the mold taken from an {{intervention}} in the mouth (in the fixed prostheticsthat is preparation of the teeth) and on which it is directly modeled and a fixed prosthetic construction is made. We pour a hard or super hard plaster. The mold is made first by mixing the super hard plaster, a small quantity is poured on the protruding part of the mold (distal part of the palate) by tapping in slowly it slides in the lumen of all the molded teeth. In this way the water and air are squeezed outso there aren’t any defects or porosity on the molded movable dental nog. Today the dental model making is imperative, and the whole laboratory making of the artificial dental crowns taken from the working models (knows as “master” models) are mobile nogs {{that can be taken}} out {{of the rest of the}} mold mutable times and again put back in the completely same position. The reason is that, the removed nogs very easy to approach, model and control the precision of the gingival edge of the artificial crown, especially from the mesial and distal side where there is a chance of a small gap. The second reason is that some particular widely accepted models for making an envelope as the first phase of the modeling of the crown (for example: making an envelope by wrapping it in plastic foil also known as the Adapta-system or a model made by dipping in molted wax) they can be made only if the working nog is not mobile. In a working dental model is made with a mobile nog, there are a number of ways of making that: with Ney metal stakes, Trey- model- system with tray leading grooves and with separation, with root continuance from plaster or peg, with galvanization, with a mobile periodontium (his regards the surrounding gingival, and not directly on the movable working log.) The goal of the study is to explore methods and apparatus for making models with movable dental nogs and their use in today’s modern practice. For realization of the set goal a research was made and information was gathered from different manufacturers of apparatus and methods for making models with movable dental nogs. By using the Pindex apparatus we can drill channels in the plaster for placing double (Duplex) stakes, by using the Top Spin (automatic laser drill) a laser drill is make and placement of the stakes for making movable dental nogs in the dental practice.
