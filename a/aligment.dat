This company was to adopt the Monmouth Railway and upgrade it to main line railway standards, and extend north-eastwards through the Forest of Dean to Newent, continuing to join the Worcester and Hereford line at Great Malvern. Acts of 1863 and 1864 authorised the undertaking. This moderately long new line gained considerable support, but the financial depression following {{the failure of the}} banking firm of Overend, Gurney and Company in 1866 resulted in a complete inability to raise money for railway schemes, and in 1868 the project was reduced to construction between Monmouth and Coleford only. The scheme was renamed the Coleford Railway. It purchased the Monmouth Railway and built its line in part on the formation of the Monmouth line, although the sharp curves that were acceptable for tramroad operation had to be smoothed out.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from {{molecular}} dynamics simulations that examine microscopic characteristics of mixtures combining acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at {{the vicinity of}} liquid/air and liquid/graphene interfaces. In the former interfaces, our simulations reveal a clear propensity of ACN to lie adjacent to the vapor phase at all concentrations. A simple model based on the consideration of a chemical equilibrium between bulk and surface states {{was found to be}} adequate to reproduce simulation results. Orientational correlations at the interface showed a mild tendency for dipolar <b>aligments</b> pointing toward the vapor phase in ACN-rich solutions; contrasting, in DMSOrich mixtures, the preferential orientations looked mostly parallel to the interface. Close to graphene plates, the local scenarios reverse and local concentrations of DMSO are larger than the one observed in the bulk. Dynamical results reveal that the characteristic time scales describing orientational relaxations and residence times at the interfaces stretch as the concentration of ACN diminishes. For liquid/air interfaces residence times for ACN were found to be larger than those for DMSO.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} a {{new approach}} for non-rigid medical im- age registration is presented. It relies onto a probabilistic framework {{based on the novel}} concept of Fuzzy Kernel Regression. The theoric framework, after a formal introduction is applied to develop several complete registration systems, two of them are interactive and one is fully automatic. They all use the composition of local deforma- tions to achieve the final alignment. Automatic one is based onto the maximization of mutual information to produce local affine <b>aligments</b> which are merged into the global transformation. Mutual Information maximization procedure uses gradient descent method. Due to the huge amount of data associated to medical images, a multi-resolution topology is embodied, reducing processing time. The distance based interpolation scheme injected facilitates the similairity measure op- timization by attenuating the presence of local maxima in the func- tional. System blocks are implemented on GPGPUs allowing efficient parallel computation of large 3 d datasets using SIMT execution. Due to the flexibility of Mutual Information, it can be applied to multi- modality image scans (MRI, CT, PET, etc.). Both quantitative and qualitative experiments show promising results and great potential for future extension. Finally the framework flexibility is shown by means of its succesful application to the image retargeting issue, methods and results are presented...|$|R

40|$|The Muzo, Tunja and Paipa lineaments are {{important}} Northwest-Southeast trending tectonic elements {{found in the}} Bogota-Sogamoso sector of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia. They are superficially expressed as notorious <b>aligments</b> of topographic lows that exert a strong Influence on drainage {{as well as being}} directly related to the appearance and delimitation of the high plains found In this part of the cordillera. The best evidence towards the structural control exerted by these NW-SE structures is the rupture and displacement of those structures parallel to the general trend of the cordillera. Examples of these are the truncation or distortion of individual folds or faults or the displacement of groups of folds and faults. Several volcanic centers, lesser intrusions and high temperature hot springs are found along the proposed lineaments. In connection with the former, at aligned intervals are found mainly emerald occurrences as well as non-economic copper, iron, fluoride, lead and zinc deposits. Their occurrence is such that they may be directly related to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids that gave rise to such deposits.   The nature of these reasonably parallel lineaments regularly spaced every 40 to 50 km, repeatedly reactivated and with lengths of hundreds of kilometers such as those here considered is important in the tectonic history not only of the Eastern Cordillera but also of the subandean basin of the Llanos Orientales and even of the Guayanan Craton itself. </span...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on {{large-scale}} progressive protein multiple sequence alignment algorithms. Although first developed over 30 years ago, multiple sequence alignment algorithms are still an active area of research given their widespread use in many biological analyses, and the dramatic increase in sequence information over the years. The behaviour of the existing algorithms {{with large numbers of}} sequences is examined in this work, and in particular the impact of guide trees on the alignments generated. This thesis is divided into 5 chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of a multiple sequence alignment, its uses and how it is constructed. It also details the specifics of progressive alignments, describes how guide trees are constructed, and provides an overview of a number {{of the ways in which}} the quality of an alignment can be measured. Chapter 2 examines the impact the topology of the guide tree has on the generated alignment. It finds that simply aligning sequences one after another can produce higher quality alignments than the default alignment methods when measured using structure-based benchmarks. This increase in quality is particularly noticeable with larger alignments. It also finds that randomly ordering the sequences produces <b>aligments</b> with similar quality as any of the other orderings examined. Chapter 3 finds that, because of a tradeoff between alignment accuracy and computation time, larger alignments generated by some of the the most common multiple sequence alignment programs are inherently unstable, and changing the order in which the sequences are listed in the input file will cause a different alignment to be created. Chapter 4 proposes an ordering of the sequences to be aligned that will produce a better quality alignment than the random ordering identified in Chapter 2. It also attempts to resolve the instability issue identified in the previous chapter. Finally, Chapter 5 reviews the findings presented in the thesis, and proposes possible future steps to both use and continue to develop these findings...|$|R

30|$|It can be {{immediately}} noted that predictive methods may provide significantly different Nexpected (before/after) and ΔNexpected estimates. Moreover, local models provide significantly lower Nexpected (before/after) than those {{based on the}} HSM method (both calibrated and uncalibrated), as stated in literature for the Italian two-lane rural road segment case (see e.g. [30]). The over-dispersion parameter k associated to the specific predictive model influences as well the estimates, since the weight factor assigned to the predicted frequency in the EB method is based on this parameter (see e.g. the Nexpected values based on Russo et al. [30] for different k parameters used). However, the attention should be mainly focused on the ΔNexpected, rather than before/after estimates, since the safety benefit assessment is mainly based on it. The ΔNexpected based on [30] is very low, because among all the variables included in the model, the only one affected in the “after” scenario is the lane width. Whereas, the other ΔNexpected estimates are significantly higher and comparable between them. In fact, in the predictions based on the HSM and on Cafiso et al. [28], more geometry-related variables are considered, then explaining the high crash reductions when modifying <b>aligment</b> and geometric standards. Clearly, no general conclusions about transferability and model assessments can be made, due to the limited application conducted. However, as expected, the model choice should {{be influenced by the}} types of countermeasures and the variables considered by the different models, in order to obtain reliable results. In this sense, a calibrated HSM model has the advantage of being potentially suitable for considering several countermeasures types, even if the associated CMFs were developed in a different context. However, the crash reduction outcome, in this limited example, is comparable with results from the local SPF by Cafiso et al.
