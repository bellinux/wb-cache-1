5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the Chelicerata contain the classes <b>Arachnida</b> (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (sea scorpions, extinct). The extinct Chasmataspida may be a sub-group within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|E

25|$|The genus Eurypterus {{belongs to}} the family Eurypteridae. They are {{classified}} under the superfamily Eurypteroidea, suborder Eurypterina, order Eurypterida, and the subphylum Chelicerata.

These organisms have eight legs as adults, and are placed in the same phylogenetic class (<b>Arachnida)</b> as spiders and ticks.|$|E
25|$|These early arachnids seem to {{have been}} adapted to {{stalking}} prey on the ground. They have been found within the very structure of ground-dwelling plants, possibly where they hid to await their prey. Trigonotarbids are currently among the oldest known land arthropods. They lack silk glands on the opisthosoma and cheliceral poison glands, and most likely represented independent offshoots of the <b>Arachnida.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nair {{and colleagues}} in {{southern}} Kerala in 2007 focussed on fauna also. Faunal biodiversity of the Myristica swamps consisted of Platyhelminthes- (Bipalium-2, tapeworm-1) 3 species, Nemathelminthes - 1 species, Annelida (Oligochaeta -2and Hirudinea-2) 4 species, Mollusca- 10 species, Unidentified Crustacean-1 species, Insecta- 281 species belonging to 83 identified families, Myriapoda- 6 species and <b>Arachnidae</b> 54 species, Pisces 14 species, Amphibia 56 species, Reptilia 55 species, Aves 129 species and Mammalia 27 species. Quantitative analysis of herpetofauna {{revealed that the}} differences in the environmental characteristics inside and outside the swamp {{play an important role in}} regulating the species diversity and abundance of both amphibians and reptiles. Amphibians were more susceptible to environmental changes. Patterns of diversity and abundance during day and night, across swamps and among months varied. There was no significant difference in patterns of diversity and abundance recorded during the two years. Many of the animals documented belong to red list and endemic categories.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{polymorphism}} {{in males}} {{has long been}} considered paradoxical because sexual selection is expected to deplete additive genetic variation. Although studies have shown how divergent selection between populations can make that work, it is very rare to find disruptive selection within one population. Since intersexual selection can {{have a significant effect}} on the phenotypic morphospace of the opposite sex, we analysed the role of female preference as a disruptive selective force. In this study we evaluated how female preference acts on anatomical and sex-related behavioural traits of two male morphs in the jumping spider Maevia inclemens. We used mate choice trials to analyse how female preference for the two morphs varied. The tests indicated that females preferred opposite values of two anatomical and two behavioural traits for each male morph. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to show disruptive sexual selection in <b>Arachnidae</b> and significantly expands the realm of disruptive selection, by adding one more case to the very few documented instances. These processes, which act entirely within a species, are of particular interest because they could contribute to the evolution of reproductive isolation and sympatric speciation by sexual selection, a controversial topic in evolutionary biology...|$|R
60|$|I was {{disappointed}} in the general aspect of the Coleoptera. The number of minute and obscurely coloured beetles is exceedingly great. (2/7. I may mention, as a common instance of one day's (June 23rd) collecting, when I was not attending particularly to the Coleoptera, that I caught sixty-eight species of that order. Among these, {{there were only two}} of the Carabidae, four Brachelytra, fifteen Rhyncophora, and fourteen of the Chrysomelidae. Thirty-seven species of <b>Arachnidae,</b> which I brought home, will be sufficient to prove that I was not paying overmuch attention to the generally favoured order of Coleoptera.) The cabinets of Europe can, as yet, boast only of the larger species from tropical climates. It is sufficient to disturb the composure of an entomologist's mind, to look forward to the future dimensions of a complete catalogue. The carnivorous beetles, or Carabidae, appear in extremely few numbers within the tropics: this is the more remarkable when compared to the case of the carnivorous quadrupeds, which are so abundant in hot countries. I was struck with this observation both on entering Brazil, and when I saw the many elegant and active forms of the Harpalidae reappearing on the temperate plains of La Plata. Do the very numerous spiders and rapacious Hymenoptera supply the place of the carnivorous beetles? The carrion-feeders and Brachelytra are very uncommon; on the other hand, the Rhyncophora and Chrysomelidae, all of which depend on the vegetable world for subsistence, are present in astonishing numbers. I do not here refer to the number of different species, but to that of the individual insects; for on this it is that the most striking character in the entomology of different countries depends. The orders Orthoptera and Hemiptera are particularly numerous; as likewise is the stinging division of the Hymenoptera; the bees, perhaps, being excepted. A person, on first entering a tropical forest, is astonished at the labours of the ants: well-beaten paths branch off in every direction, on which an army of never-failing foragers may be seen, some going forth, and others returning, burdened with pieces of green leaf, often larger than their own bodies.|$|R
25|$|As a {{zoologist}} Lankester was {{a comparative}} anatomist of the Huxley school, working mostly on invertebrates. He {{was the first}} to show the relationship of the horseshoe crab or Limulus to the <b>Arachnida.</b> His Limulus specimens can still be seen in the Grant Museum of Zoology at UCL today. He was also a voluminous writer on biology for the general readership; in this he followed the example of his old mentor, Huxley.|$|E
25|$|Discovering {{relationships}} within the arachnids has proven difficult , with successive studies producing different results. A study in 2014, {{based on the}} largest set of molecular data to date, concluded that there were systematic conflicts in the phylogenetic information, particularly affecting the orders Acariformes, Parasitiformes and Pseudoscorpiones, which have had much faster evolutionary rates. Analyses of the data using sets of genes with different evolutionary rates produced mutually incompatible phylogenetic trees. The authors favoured relationships shown by more slowly evolving genes, which demonstrated the monophyly of Chelicerata, Euchelicerata and <b>Arachnida,</b> {{as well as of}} some clades within the arachnids. The diagram below summarizes their conclusions, based largely on the 200 most slowly evolving genes; dashed lines represent uncertain placements.|$|E
25|$|During a {{study of}} the bat's diet, {{examination}} of droppings showed that it can also gather prey items from the ground. The diet was found mostly to consist of large Diptera (flies) but Trichoptera (caddisfly), Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants and hoverflies) and <b>Arachnida</b> (spiders and harvestmen) were also commonly eaten. The remains of other prey items occasionally found in the droppings included Lepidoptera (moths), Coleoptera (beetles), Hemiptera (bugs), Dermaptera (earwigs) and Chilopoda (centipedes). This bat may use its interfemoral membrane to catch prey and the fringing hairs may have a sensory function. It has been shown that it can land on the ground to pick up and pursue invertebrates that are active at night, and continues to emit search signals in order to locate them precisely.|$|E
40|$|The {{multifunctionality}} {{of living}} mulch systems was the underlying research question for field trials with cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. convar. Botrytis) and leek (Allium porrum L.). Field trials were {{conducted at the}} Hessian Research Estate Frankenhausen over 3 years, parallel demonstration plots were established over 2 years on commercial pilot farms for entomological investigations in a big scale mode, plots of 1000 m². In all trials white clover (Trifolium repens L.) {{was used as a}} single species living mulch. In the years 2012 and 2013 the experimental design consisted of a 2 -factorial approach for the test of 3 cultivars and the effect of additive and substitutive system for the establisment of living. The cultivars of cauliflower were Chambord F 1, Belot F 1, and White ball, of leek Herbstriesen Hannibal, Axima, and Catcher F 1. For the substitutive system of living mulch each third row was replaced by clover with the potential of common weeding in the areas covered by vegetables. The establishment of clover took place between 4 weeks after planting or later. In 2014 a one year trial was added for the investigation of different sowing dates of living mulch, 2 and 4 weeks after planting, towards the performance of cauliflower and leek, cultivated with one cultivar. The two year pilot farm activities were located at two organic field vegetable farms in Northrhine-Westfalia, each site in one year. Crop yields were mainly influenced {{by the fact that the}} Substitutive system had a plant density which was 2 / 3 of the figures in control and Additive system. Therefore all figures found were significantly lower. Opposite to these findings the data referred to single crops showed an advantage for the Substitutive system. With regard to the second system tested the addition of clover into the vegetable system did not cause reductions of yields in any case. This was obvious on the levels of nutrient yields of the crops. The samples of pit fall traps were measured over a time span between August and midth of September in 2013 and midth of August till end of September in 2014. The estimates were done on a family level. The main groups were found at each site, in each crop as dominant: Carabidae >> Staphilinidae > <b>Arachnidae.</b> The abundance was significantly different on the species level according to Kruskal Wallis evaluations, statistical distinctions on the system could not be found due to small diffenrences and partly inconsistent results...|$|R
25|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of species in the class <b>Arachnida,</b> which are oviparous, scorpions seem to be universally ovoviviparous. The young are born one by one after hatching and expelling the embryonic membrane, if any, and the brood is carried about on its mother's back until the young have undergone at least one moult. Before the first moult, scorplings cannot survive naturally without the mother, since they depend on her for protection and to regulate their moisture levels. Especially in species that display more advanced sociability (e.g. Pandinus spp.), the young/mother association can continue {{for an extended period}} of time. The size of the litter depends on the species and environmental factors, and can range from two to over a hundred scorplings. The average litter however, consists of around 8 scorplings.|$|E
25|$|Acari or Acarina is a taxon of arachnids that {{contains}} mites and ticks. Its fossil history {{goes back to}} the Devonian period, although there is also a questionable Ordovician record. The Devonian period was the time frame in which certain species of animals developed legs. In most modern treatments, the Acari is considered a subclass of <b>Arachnida</b> and is composed of two or three orders or superorders: Acariformes, Parasitiformes, and Opilioacariformes. Most acarines are minute to small (e.g. 0.080–1.00mm), but the giants of the Acari (some ticks and red velvet mites) may reach lengths of 10–20mm. It is estimated that over 50,000 species have been described (as of 1999) and that a million or more species are currently living. The study of mites and ticks is called acarology.|$|E
25|$|Acari (or Acarina) are a taxon of arachnids that {{contains}} mites and ticks. The {{diversity of the}} Acari is extraordinary and its fossil history goes back to at least the early Devonian period. As a result, acarologists (the people who study mites and ticks) have proposed {{a complex set of}} taxonomic ranks to classify mites. In most modern treatments, the Acari is considered a subclass of <b>Arachnida</b> and is composed of two or three superorders or orders: Acariformes (or Actinotrichida), Parasitiformes (or Anactinotrichida), and Opilioacariformes; the latter is often considered a subgroup within the Parasitiformes. The monophyly of the Acari is open to debate, and the relationships of the acarines to other arachnids is not at all clear. In older treatments, the subgroups of the Acarina were placed at order rank, but as their own subdivisions have become better understood, it is more usual to treat them at superorder rank.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} mating on female fitness may vary {{depending}} upon the kind of benefit that the females receive from males through of their choices. Direct benefits include nutritional resources {{to be used by}} females, donation of foods to mates, males offering prey to the female, seen in scorpion flies and dance flies. Several orthopteran species, butterflies, flies, and beetle males can donate secretions or nutritional substances to the females which are transferred in the ejaculate or produced by male glands which can contribute to increase female fecundity. In the green-veined white (Pieris napi), a virgin male can transfer an ejaculate containing 14% nitrogen by dry mass. Females utilize the nutrients transferred from the male in order to increase their nutrients. These nutrients essentially contribute to ensure successful egg production. A positive relationship between the amount of ejaculate material received and lifetime reproductive output, as male-transferred material increases female longevity. Male-transferred material also increases female longevity. In some insect species, males can donate some body parts to females such as the leg spurs or the fleshy hindwings of jumped-winged crickets, or they may be completely cannibalized, as occurs in mantis and some dipterous, as well as in some <b>Arachnida</b> scorpions and spider species.|$|E
25|$|Like the birds, {{the study}} of mammals was largely driven by hunters {{and for a while}} it was largely {{restricted}} to trophy hunting. It was perhaps when R. C. Wroughton, a forest officer who began a concerted study of the small mammals of India through the network of members of the Bombay Natural History Society, that mammalogy in India began in real earnest. He was initially interested in Hymenoptera, especially ants and later scorpions. His interest in scorpions led him to R. I. Pocock. At the time, Pocock {{was in charge of the}} <b>Arachnida</b> although he was interested in mammals. Attempts to start a large scale collection effort did not take off. In 1904 Captain Glen Liston of the Indian Medical Service read a paper on Plague, Rats and Fleas in which he noted the lack of information on rodents. Another paper by Dr Hossack of the plague department appeared. This interest in plague suddenly enabled the BNHS to raise funds for collection of small mammals. While hunters sent in many specimens for identification, there were a few who studied the habits of species in the wild. A major study of the rodents and bats was conducted by George Edward Dobson (1848–1895) a medical doctor by profession. Other notable mammalologists included Richard Lydekker (1849–1915), Robert Armitage Sterndale, Stanley Henry Prater (1890–1960) and Brian Houghton Hodgson (1800–1894). Richard Lydekker worked with the Geological survey of India and his primary focus during the period was on the fossil mammals of India.|$|E
500|$|A notable ancient legend {{from the}} Western canon that {{explains}} {{the origin of the}} spider comes from the Greek story of the weaving competition between Athena the goddess, and Arachne, sometimes described as a princess. This story may have originated in Lydian mythology; but the myth, briefly mentioned by Virgil in 29 BC, is known from the later Greek mythos after Ovid wrote the poem Metamorphoses between the years AD 2 and 8. The Greek [...] "arachne" [...] (αράχνη) means [...] "spider", and is the origin of <b>Arachnida,</b> the spiders' taxonomic class.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cephalothorax}} {{is joined}} to the abdomen {{by a thin}} flexible pedicel.

2500|$|Arachnids are a class (<b>Arachnida)</b> of joint-legged {{invertebrate}} animals (arthropods), in the subphylum Chelicerata. All arachnids {{have eight}} legs, although the front pair of legs in some species has {{converted to a}} sensory function, while in other species, different appendages can grow large enough {{to take on the}} appearance of extra pairs of legs. The term is derived from the Greek word [...] (aráchnē), from the myth of the hubristic human weaver Arachne who was turned into a spider. Spiders are the largest order in the class, which also includes scorpions, ticks, mites, harvestmen, and solifuges.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of <b>Arachnida</b> species, scorpions are viviparous. The young are born one by one, and the brood is carried about on its mother's back until the young have undergone at least one moult. The young generally resemble their parents, requiring between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Scorpions have quite variable lifespans and the lifespan of most species is not known. The age range appears to be approximately 4–25 years (25 years being the maximum reported life span in the giant desert hairy scorpion, Hadrurus arizonensis). They are nocturnal and fossorial, finding shelter during {{the day in the}} relative cool of underground holes or undersides of rocks and coming out at night to hunt and feed. Scorpions prefer to live in areas where the temperature is , but may survive in the temperature range of [...]|$|E
2500|$|Solifugae is {{an order}} of animals in the class <b>Arachnida</b> known {{variously}} as camel spiders, wind scorpions, sun spiders, or solifuges. The order includes more than 1,000 described species in about 153 genera. Despite the common names, they are neither true scorpions (order Scorpiones) nor true spiders (order Araneae) – though they are {{more closely related to}} scorpions than to spiders. Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two tagmata: an opisthosoma (abdomen) behind the prosoma (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two chelicerae that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for stridulation. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a [...] "tail". Most species of Solifugae live in dry climates and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling arthropods and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of , including legs. A number of urban legends exaggerate the size and speed of the Solifugae, and their potential danger to humans, which is negligible.|$|E
2500|$|The Opiliones [...] or [...] (formerly Phalangida) are {{an order}} of arachnids colloquially known as harvestmen, {{harvesters}} or daddy longlegs. Although both harvestmen and spiders are arachnids, the two orders are not otherwise closely related. , over 6,500 species of harvestmen have been discovered worldwide, although {{the total number of}} extant species may exceed 10,000. The order Opiliones includes five suborders: Cyphophthalmi, Eupnoi, Dyspnoi, Laniatores, and the recently named Tetrophthalmi. With the exception of the Dyspnoi (which are restricted to North America and Eurasia), representatives of each can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million-year-old Rhynie cherts of Scotland, and 305-million-year-old rocks in France, which look surprisingly modern, indicating that their basic body plan appeared very early on, and, at least in some taxa, has changed little since that time. Their phylogenetic position within the <b>Arachnida</b> is disputed: their closest relatives may be the mites (Acari) or the Novogenuata (the Scorpiones, Pseudoscorpiones, and Solifugae). Although superficially similar to and often misidentified as spiders (order Araneae), the Opiliones are a distinct order that is not closely related to spiders. They can be easily distinguished from long-legged spiders by their fused body regions and single pair of eyes {{in the middle of the}} cephalothorax. Spiders have a distinct abdomen that is separated from the cephalothorax by a constriction, and they have three to four pairs of eyes, usually around the margins of the cephalothorax.|$|E
60|$|The two highest {{groups of}} the Annulosa, the Insecta and the <b>Arachnida,</b> are {{represented}} in the Coal, either by existing genera, or by forms differing from existing genera in quite minor peculiarities.|$|E
60|$|The ANNULOSA.--The Carboniferous Insecta and <b>Arachnida</b> {{are neither}} less specialised, nor more embryonic, than these that now live, nor are the Liassic Cirripedia and Macrura; while {{several of the}} Brachyura, which appear in the Chalk, belong to {{existing}} genera; and none exhibit either an intermediate, or an embryonic, character.|$|E
60|$|The less highly {{organised}} terrestrial arthropoda--the <b>Arachnida</b> and Myriapoda--are, {{as might}} be expected, much more ancient. A fossil spider {{has been found in}} the Carboniferous, and scorpions in the Upper Silurian rocks of Scotland, Sweden, and the United States. Myriapoda have been found abundantly in the Carboniferous and Devonian formations; but all are of extinct orders, exhibiting a more generalised structure than living forms.|$|E
60|$|I should, be {{disposed}} {{to interpret the}} facts of the embryological history and of the anatomy of the Arthropoda in a different manner. The Copepoda, the Ostracoda, and the Branchiopoda are the Crustacea which have departed least from the embryonic or Nauplius-forms; and, of these, I imagine that the Copepoda represent the hypothetical Archicarida most closely. Apus and Sapphirina indicate the relations of these Archaeocarids with the Trilobita, and the Eurypterida connect the Trilobita and the Copepoda with the Xiphosura. But the Xiphosura have such close morphological relations with the <b>Arachnida,</b> and especially with the oldest known Arachnidan, Scorpio, that I cannot doubt the existence of a genetic connection between the two groups. On the other hand, the Branchiopoda do, even at the present day, almost pass into the true Podophthalmia, by Nebalia. By the Trilobita, again, the Archicarida are connected with such Edriophthalmia as Serolis. The Stomapoda are extremely modified Edriophthalmia of the amphipod type. On the other side, the Isopoda lead to the Myriapoda, and the latter to the Insecta. Thus the Arthropod phylum, which suggests itself to me, is that the branches of the Podophthalmia, of the Insecta (with the Myriapoda), and of the <b>Arachnida,</b> spring separately and distinctly from the Archaeocarid root--and that the Zoaea-forms occur only at the origin of the Podophthalmous branch.|$|E
6000|$|With {{respect to}} the Phylogeny of the Arthropoda, I find myself {{disposed}} to take a somewhat different view from that of Professor Haeckel. He assumes that the primary stock of the whole group was a crustacean, having that Nauplius form in which Fritz Müller has shown that so many Crustacea commence their lives. All the Entomostraca arose by the modification of some one or other of these Naupliform [...] "Archicarida." [...] Other Archicarida underwent a further metamorphosis into a Zoaea-form. From some of these [...] "Zoeopoda" [...] arose all the remaining Malacostracous Crustacea; while, from others, was developed some form analogous to the existing Galeodes, out of which proceeded, by gradual differentiation, all the Myriapoda, <b>Arachnida,</b> and Insecta.|$|E
6000|$|In an evil hour, however, our {{pastors and}} masters in {{conclave}} assembled said to one another, [...] "Come now, let us Teutonise English scientific education."

And there began to arise in England a new brood of patent machine-made scientists--excellent {{men in their}} way, authorities on the <b>Arachnida,</b> knowing all about everything that could be taught in the schools, but lacking somehow the supreme grace of the old English originality. They are first-rate specialists, I allow; and I don't deny that a civilised country has all need of specialists. Nay, I even admit that {{the day of the}} specialist has only just begun. He will yet go far; he will impose himself and his yoke upon us. But don't let us therefore make the grand mistake of concluding that our fine old English birthright in science--the birthright that gave us our Newtons, our Cavendishes, our Darwins, our Lyells--was all folly and error. Don't let us spoil ourselves in order to become mere second-hand Germans. Let us recognise the fact that each nation has a work of its own to do in the world; and that as star from star, so one nation differeth from another in glory. Let each of us thank the goodness and the grace that on his birth have smiled, that he was born of English breed, and not a German child.|$|E
60|$|Class, <b>Arachnida</b> (Spiders).—The {{males are}} often darker, but {{sometimes}} {{lighter than the}} females, as {{may be seen in}} Mr. Blackwall’s magnificent work.[422] In some species the sexes differ conspicuously from each other in colour; thus the female of Sparassus smaragdulus is dullish-green; whilst the adult male has the abdomen of a fine yellow, with three longitudinal stripes of rich red. In some species of Thomisus the two sexes closely resemble each other; in others they differ much; thus in T. citreus the legs and body of the female are pale-yellow or green, whilst the front legs of the male are reddish-brown: in T. floricolens, the legs of the female are pale-green, those of the male being ringed in a conspicuous manner with various tints. Numerous analogous cases could be given in the genera Epeira, Nephila, Philodromus, Theridion, Linyphia, &c. It is often difficult to say which of the two sexes departs most from the ordinary coloration of the genus to which the species belong; but Mr. Blackwall thinks that, as a general rule, it is the male. Both sexes whilst young, as I am informed by the same author, usually resemble each other; and both often undergo great changes in colour during their successive moults before arriving at maturity. In other cases the male alone appears to change colour. Thus the male of the above-mentioned brightly-coloured Sparassus at first resembles the female and acquires his peculiar tints only when nearly adult. Spiders are possessed of acute senses, and exhibit much intelligence. The females often shew, as is well known, the strongest affection for their eggs, which they carry about enveloped in a silken web. On the whole it appears probable that well-marked differences in colour between the sexes have generally resulted from sexual selection, either on the male or female side. But doubts may be entertained on this head from the extreme variability in colour of some species, for instance of Theridion lineatum, the sexes of which differ when adult; this great variability indicates that their colours have not been subjected to any form of selection.|$|E
