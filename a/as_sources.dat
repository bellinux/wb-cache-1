Blood {{bacterial}} wilt disease of banana: {{the distribution of}} pathogen in infected plant, symptoms, and potentiality of diseased tissues <b>as</b> <b>source</b> of infective inoculums. Nusantara Bioscience 3 : 112 - 117. Bacterial wilt caused by blood disease bacterium (BDB) {{is the most important}} disease of banana in Indonesia. The disease was difficult to control due to by poorly understood of ecology and epidemiology of the disease. This paper reports the distribution of pathogen infected plant, symptoms, and potentiality of diseased tissues <b>as</b> <b>source</b> of inoculums. For studying the distribution of BDB in diseased banana, a number of 14 points of plant organ tissue was sampled and the pathogen was detected by PCR using a couple of specific primer for BDB, 121 F and 121 R. In addition to the detection of BDB using PCR, both external and internal symptoms were observed. All the points of detection were also used <b>as</b> <b>source</b> of inoculums to search the potentiality of the tissues <b>as</b> <b>source</b> of infective inoculums. The results showed that BDB was distributed systemically in infected banana. The pathogen infection caused systemic symptom and all part of infected banana were potential <b>as</b> <b>source</b> of infective inoculums...|$|R
5|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} {{found in}} prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. These organisms can use hydrogen, reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate), ferrous iron (FeII) or ammonia <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite. These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.|$|E

While Scandinavian sagas describe events in 10th-century Britain, their value <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed. Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint Cathróe of Metz, a work of hagiography written in Germany {{at the end of}} the 10th century, provides plausible details of the saint's early life in north Britain.|$|E

5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{extensive}} magnetosphere envelops its {{ring system}} and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites. Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis. The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries. In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Norse sagas telling {{parts of}} the story of Augvald include the Saga of Olaf Tryggvason (both by Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla and by Oddr Snorrason), the Saga of Half & His Heroes and the Flateyjarbok. He also appears in the later Historia rerum Norvegicarum and other works of the Icelandic {{historian}} Thormodus Torfæus, who lived and worked in Kopervik, Karmøy. In addition, Augvald is mentioned in the Avaldsnes parish register, and in local Karmøy legends. Scholars have been very sceptical about the reliability of the legendary sagas, which were dismissed as being of little value even in the early 20th century, before the establishment of general source criticism. The legendary sagas' value <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> has not been re-evaluated in recent times.|$|E

5|$|Of Jupiter's moons, eight are regular {{satellites}} with prograde {{and nearly}} circular orbits {{that are not}} greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets {{if they were in}} direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. Eighteen of the irregular satellites have not yet been named.|$|E

The seething anticipation {{that preceded the}} début was followed up by {{a large amount of}} thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press, as well as largely negative analysis in the blogosphere.

5|$|Thallium {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E
5|$|The 1840s were a {{turbulent}} decade in the Church of England.

In 1846 George Eliot published an English translation of Leben Jesu which became a source of religious doubts for Froude and many of his contemporaries.
