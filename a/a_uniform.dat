40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} define a space with <b>an</b> <b>uniform</b> base at non-isolated points, give some {{characterizations}} {{of images of}} metric spaces by boundary-compact maps, and study certain relationship among spaces with special base properties. The main results are the following: (1) X is an open, boundary-compact image of a metric space {{if and only if}} X has <b>an</b> <b>uniform</b> base at non-isolated points; (2) Each discretizable space of a space with <b>an</b> <b>uniform</b> base is <b>an</b> open compact and at most boundary-one image of a space with <b>an</b> <b>uniform</b> base; (3) X has a point-countable base if and only if X is a bi-quotient, at most boundary-one and countable-to-one image of a metric space.

5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a falling body would fall with <b>a</b> <b>uniform</b> acceleration, {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during <b>a</b> <b>uniform</b> acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).|$|E

Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces <b>a</b> <b>uniform</b> motion; Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (c. 1080 – 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that velocity and acceleration are two different things, and that force is proportional to acceleration, not to velocity.|$|E
