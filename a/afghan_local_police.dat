500|$|An {{investigation}} by the U.S. Army, completed on August 13 and {{released to the public}} the first week of November 2008, found that the Taliban attackers had been assisted by the <b>Afghan</b> <b>local</b> <b>police</b> (ALP), forces and a district leader. The evidence included large stocks of weapons and ammunition discovered in the police barracks in Wanat after the battle. The stocks were much more than could be used by the villages' 20-man police force and included dirty weapons which appeared to have been used recently. In response to the report, Schloesser concluded that the governor and local police chief [...] "had probably been acting under duress and had been cooperative with American troops." [...] The governor was absolved of blame in the attack but it was unclear about what was done with the local police chief.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effort to}} {{handover}} security to Afghans has been hampered by {{a spike in}} attacks by local forces supposed {{to be working with}} American and NATO personnel. United States military officials suspended temporarily on 2 September 2012 the training of <b>Afghan</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Police</b> (ALP) {{in the wake of a}} deadly series of so-called ‘green on blue’ attacks by Afghan soldiers and police on their international allies. [...] The training has been put on hold in order to carry out intensified vetting procedures on new recruits, and 16,000 existing ALP recruits will be re-vetted. ALP training is a U.S. mission, carried out by Special Forces teams who work with Afghan elders and government officials in remote villages to help villagers defend themselves against insurgent attacks and intimidation. Training of uniformed police and army personnel is done under the banner of the NATO operation. The suspension affects not only <b>Afghan</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Police,</b> but also Afghan special operations and commando forces. Special Operations officials said that they anticipate it will take about two months to rescreen all of the Afghan forces and that the training of new recruits could stall for as long as a month.|$|E

50|$|The National Traffic Police (Liikkuva poliisi, Rörliga polisen) was {{folded into}} the <b>local</b> <b>police</b> in 2013, thus <b>local</b> <b>police</b> is also {{responsible}} for highway patrol. Originally, <b>local</b> <b>police</b> districts were very small and had limited resources, so a separate mobile police organization was founded for riot control, alcohol law enforcement and reserve force duties. Political reliability and independence from local strongmen was also important because of the threat from fascists; indeed, the first task was to escort former president K.J. Ståhlberg {{back to his home}} after he was kidnapped by the Lapua Movement. The organized later evolved into a highway patrol. However, because of mergers, <b>local</b> <b>police</b> departments had become larger. Thus, the separate national organization was deemed redundant and traffic police units were subordinated to the <b>local</b> <b>police</b> departments instead, without change in the actual number of highway patrol officers.|$|R
