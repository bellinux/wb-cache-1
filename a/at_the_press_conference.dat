5|$|On March 21, 2007, a {{press conference}} was held at City Hall in Orlando, Florida, {{formally}} announcing the event for Orlando at the Citrus Bowl. According to an interview with The Daytona Beach News-Journal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference,</b> WWE chairman Vince McMahon mentioned Orlando being one of three front-runners to host the event, the other two being Las Vegas and Paris. McMahon explained that Orlando was chosen as geographically, a WrestleMania was never held in the southeast before.|$|E
5|$|At the Masters on 12 January, Stephen Maguire {{edged out}} O'Sullivan {{in a final}} frame to win their first-round match at Wembley. In a battle of the top two players in the {{provisional}} world rankings, O'Sullivan fought back from 1–4 down to level at 5–5 and take the match into a deciding eleventh frame. O'Sullivan missed the final blue with the rest, when poised to win the match, allowing Maguire to reach the quarter-finals. After withdrawing from the invitational Malta Cup, O'Sullivan returned at the Welsh Open in February. Playing a good tournament, he reached the final. Although he led 8–5, Selby won the last four frames to beat him 9–8. O'Sullivan {{was present at the}} China Open, in Beijing, where he lost 4–5 to Marco Fu in the first round. However, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference,</b> which followed the match, O'Sullivan was heard making some lewd remarks inviting a member of the press to perform fellatio on him, then laughing with the World Snooker media spokesman. O'Sullivan also joked about the size and girth of his penis, before simulating a sexual act on his microphone. In June 2008, the WPBSA punished him for his behaviour by docking the appearance money and world-ranking points that he had earned from the event.|$|E
5|$|Embarrassed by {{the events}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference,</b> Đính {{returned}} to the officers' mess at the Joint General Staff headquarters. His colleagues, led by General Trần Văn Đôn, were plotting a coup against Diệm because of the Buddhist crisis, and attempted to play on Đính's ego to convince him to join them. They knew that without Đính's assistance, a coup would be difficult as his forces dominated the region surrounding the capital. In a series of meetings, the other generals assured Đính {{that he was a}} national hero worthy of political authority, and claimed that Nhu had not realised how important he was in the future of the country. Đính's colleagues even bribed his soothsayer to predict his elevation to political power. The other generals told him that the people were dissatisfied with Diệm's cabinet and that Vietnam needed dynamic young officers in politics, and that their presence would reverse the declining morale in the ARVN. They advised Đính to ask Diệm to promote him to interior minister, Dương Văn Minh to defence minister, and Trần Văn Minh to education minister. The other generals hoped that would reject Đính and wound his pride. As a result, Đính and his fellow generals met Diệm at the palace, where Đính asked the president to promote him to the post of interior minister. Diệm bluntly chastised Đính in front of his colleagues, and ordered him out of Saigon to the central highlands resort town of Đà Lạt to rest. Đính felt humiliated and embarrassed, having promised his colleagues that he would be successful. The Ngô brothers had been alarmed by Đính's request, and put him under surveillance. Đính found out, further straining his relationship with the palace. Đính agreed to join the coup, although with his ambitious nature, the other officers were skeptical and planned to have him assassinated if he tried to switch sides.|$|E

25|$|When {{the story}} of the {{positive}} drug test was first leaked to the press, it resulted in Puma opting not to continue Christie's £100,000 sponsorship contract. Three years earlier, at the Atlanta Olympics, Christie had worn contact lenses embossed with the Puma logo <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> preceding the 100m final. Reebok had paid $40million to be the official sponsor, and Christie's actions were seen as ambush marketing and a breach of Olympic rules on the wearing of sponsor's logos by athletes.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of looting and {{disruption}} the night before, on August 16, Nixon declared {{in a press conference}} a state of emergency and implemented nightly curfews in Ferguson from midnight to 5:00a.m. Some residents <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> said that law enforcement officers had instigated the violence with their military-like tactics.

All three drugs were found to be at levels investigators considered normal for therapeutic treatment (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A blood-alcohol level was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner, added it was impossible to say whether any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process. It was also ruled out that Nancy was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.|$|E
25|$|Lippi {{confirmed}} his squad for the match {{at a press}} conference at the headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels on 12 March, at which UEFA President Michel Platini, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Manchester United director Sir Bobby Charlton were also present. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference,</b> Lippi revealed that Zinedine Zidane had been approached to come out of retirement to play in the game, but the French midfielder had declined. Zidane's reasons were not made public, but it is believed {{that he did not want}} to play on the same team as Marco Materazzi, whom he had infamously headbutted in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final.|$|E
25|$|In late March 1966 in Michigan, {{two days}} of mass UFO {{sightings}} were reported, and received significant publicity. After studying the reports, Hynek offered a provisional hypothesis {{for some of the}} sightings: a few of about 100 witnesses had mistaken swamp gas for something more spectacular. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> where he made his announcement, Hynek repeatedly and strenuously stated that swamp gas was a plausible explanation for only a portion of the Michigan UFO reports, and certainly not for UFO reports in general. But much to his chagrin, Hynek's qualifications of his hypothesis were largely overlooked, and the term swamp gas was repeated ad infinitum in relation to UFO reports. The explanation was subject to national derision.|$|E

25|$|During the 1989/90 season Davis {{recorded}} {{wins over}} Jimmy Van Rensberg and Mike Watterson, but a 10–6 defeat by Ian Brumby {{in the second}} round of qualifying for the World Championship meant that he was forced into a 'play-off' to maintain his full professional status. Davis opted to play and was defeated 10–5 by Jason Prince. Suffering from arthritis of the knee, Davis literally limped from the arena to the press conference during which he was given an emotional standing ovation from spectators, players on other match tables and even those on the practice tables, who all ceased playing to acknowledge the moment. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference,</b> Davis announced he was now retired from competitive snooker but would keep playing in UK-based billiard tournaments. Ironically however, snooker threw its doors open to all comers and Davis resumed his snooker career, but played little competitive billiards thereafter.|$|E
