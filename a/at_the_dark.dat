5|$|A {{man from}} Glastonbury {{is engaged to}} a girl from Wookey. A witch living in Wookey Hole Caves curses the romance so that it fails. The man, now a monk, seeks revenge on this witch who—having been jilted herself—frequently spoils budding relationships. The monk stalks the witch into the cave and she hides in a dark corner {{near one of the}} {{underground}} rivers. The monk blesses the water and splashes some of it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> parts of the cave where the witch was hiding. The blessed water immediately petrifies the witch, and she remains in the cave to this day.|$|E

Some smaller guerilla gigs were performed that Autumn which received no advance billing whatsoever, including a solo show <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Mills festival at London's Colour House Theatre on 4 September 2010, the launch party of the Illamasqua store on 16 September (at which Boy George served as DJ), and a guest spot at the Monster Raving Loony Party's annual conference in Fleet, Hampshire, on 25 September.

25|$|The type {{specimen}} of Sinosaurus triassicus IVPP V34 was recovered in the Zhangjiawa Member of the Lufeng Formation, in Yunnan, China. These remains were discovered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Red Beds that were deposited during the Sinemurian {{stage of the}} Jurassic period, approximately 196-183 million years ago. Several other discoveries referred to Sinosaurus {{were made in the}} Zhangjiawa Member: specimens IVPP V97 (postcrania), IVPP V36 (teeth), IVPP 37 (teeth), IVPP V88 (ilium), IVPP V35 (teeth and postcranial bones), IVPP V100 and IVPP V48 (teeth and postcranial bones) discovered in 1938 by M. Bien & C.C. Young, FMNH CUP 2001-2003 discovered by E. Oehler and Hu. Specimens FMNH CUP 2097, FMNH CUP 2098, FMNH CUP 2004, FMNH CUP 2005 were discovered in 1948 by M. Bien & C.C. Young at Zhangjiawa Member, as well. Sinosaurus sp. fossils have been found in the Zhenzhuchong Formation, and were previously thought to be a poposaur, although they might have only been from the equivalent Lufeng Formation.|$|E
500|$|The {{cultural}} historian Jeremy Black {{points to}} the theme of international travel in Diamonds Are Forever, which was still a novelty to most people in Britain at the time. This travel between a number of a locations exacerbates one of the problems identified by Black: that there was no centre to the story. In contrast to the other novels in the Bond canon, where Casino Royale had Royale, From Russia, with Love had Istanbul and Dr. No had Jamaica, Diamonds Are Forever had multiple locations and two villains and there was [...] "no megalomaniac fervour, no weird self-obsession, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> centre of the plot".|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{compiled}} a 16mm colour film for [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong", {{the first time}} he made a promotional clip for one of his singles. The film was little seen at the time of release; it was first broadcast in January 1975, on UK television, and then on the French network TF1's show Midi Premiere in May that year. The video was issued officially on disc eight of Harrison's Apple Years 1968–75 box set in September 2014. Described as [...] "a hoot" [...] by Robert Rodriguez, it conveys what Harrison deemed the [...] "comical" [...] aspect of the song. Leng describes the clip as [...] "sporadically amusing" [...] and says of its content: [...] "As the audiences <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Horse Tour concerts were about to discover, the only 'old' that he wanted to 'ring out' was the Beatles." ...|$|E

Raman micro-spectroscopy proves presence of mostly a monoor bi-layer graphene on all the grains.

In addition to his endeavors in mainstream film, Ishioka continued working in the AV industry in the early-2000s, making videos for Athena Eizou, Atlas21, and Try-Heart where he directed AV Idol Honoka in two of her early videos in 2004.|$|E

2500|$|Kevin Knox, who was {{in charge}} of {{doughnuts}} quality at Starbucks from 1987 to 1993, recalled on his blog in 2010 how George Howell, coffee veteran and founder of the Cup of Excellence, had been appalled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> roasted beans that Starbucks was selling in 1990. Talking to the New York Times in 2008, Howell stated his opinion that the dark roast used by Starbucks does not deepen the flavor of coffee, but instead can destroy purported nuances of flavor. The March 2007 issue of Consumer Reports compared American fast-food chain coffees and ranked Starbucks behind McDonald's Premium Roast. The magazine called Starbucks coffee [...] "strong, but burnt and bitter enough to make your eyes water instead of open". As reported by TIME in 2010, third wave coffee proponents generally criticize Starbucks for over-roasting beans.|$|E

2500|$|The Women Under Siege Project {{was begun}} by Gloria Steinem in 2012 {{in order to}} {{document}} violence against women taking place during violent conflicts. The idea was inspired by two books: Sexual Violence Against Jewish Women During the Holocaust by Sonja M. Hedgepeth and Rochelle Saidel and <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance - a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to Black Power by Danielle McGuire. After reading these two books which addressed sexual violence, Steinem wondered if there were {{lessons to be learned}} from both history and current affairs; and also, if information were more widely available and people were aware of the issues, if rape and gender-based violence could be prevented in the future. She has said that [...] "suffering has to be visible and not called inevitable or blamed on the victim before we can stop it." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{remained}} to be seen, however, {{whether or not}} a medicated and stabilised Ant would wish to continue the direction his unmedicated self had taken. [...] Although he gave at least one live performance {{in the immediate aftermath of}} his release (a jam at a Chelsea bar at some point during the weekend of 19–20 June 2010), which appeared consistent with his previously stated intentions, he otherwise kept a mostly low profile for the rest of his supervised outpatient period. Ant was subsequently reported to have been rehearsing in East London, with a band retaining Landesman but otherwise featuring a new all-female lineup including former Babyshambles drummer Gemma Clarke and Suffrajets frontwoman Claire Wakeman on guitar. A possible concert on 12 August 2010 at the Electric Ballroom, featuring songs from the lost Persuasion album, was mooted but did not materialize. Some smaller guerrilla gigs were performed that Autumn which received no advance billing whatsoever, including a solo show <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Mills festival at London's Colour House Theatre on 4 September 2010, the launch party of the Illamasqua store on 16 September (at which Boy George served as DJ), and a guest spot at the Monster Raving Loony Party's annual conference in Fleet, Hampshire, on 25 September.|$|E
2500|$|The Wolverhampton Express and Star praised {{his show}} of 1 June 2011 at the Birmingham's O2 Academy saying [...] "From {{the moment the}} Prince Charming singer opened his mouth for his first song, Plastic Surgery, his {{performance}} was full of energy with him barely pausing for breath as he played hit after hit." [...] Even the one serious negative onstage incident, at Fat Sam's in Dundee on 21 May 2011 when Ant reacted angrily to some crowd elements who booed his kilt decorated with the St George's Cross (as previously worn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Mills concert) was mitigated by local newspaper The Courier as merely a [...] "disappointing end to {{what had been a}} great show by the 56-year-old, who still looks the part and still managed a near two-hour set including hits like Goody Two Shoes, Stand And Deliver, Dog Eat Dog and Kings of the Wild Frontier, bringing huge cheers and two encores." [...] The tour closed in Manchester on 5 June with a show at the city's Manchester Academy which was applauded by frequent supporter John Robb in hyperbolic fashion: [...] "What a great singer he is, the yodelling is really fab, it's that very Adam touch of pure pop and dark underground... {{this is one of the}} great rock n roll voices, a brilliant clarity that cuts like a knife even two weeks into a tour. [...] The set list is perfect. Loads of 'Dirk' period stuff. Plastic Surgery, Kick, Cartrouble, Cleopatra, Physical but also the hits including a great stripped down Prince Charming, and a whole host of off the cuff covers. It's packed in here – Totally sold out.... The word is out. The tour has been brilliant and this is one of the great comebacks." ...|$|E
