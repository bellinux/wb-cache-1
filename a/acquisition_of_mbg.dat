In this review, we highlight the recent advances made in the preparation <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> particles, spheres, fibers and scaffolds. The advantages <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> for drug delivery and bone scaffold applications are related to this material’s well-ordered mesopore channel structure, superior bioactivity, and the application for the delivery of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Mean {{blood glucose}} (MBG) and MBG-independent factors both {{influence}} A 1 C levels. Race {{was related to}} A 1 C independent <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> in adults. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine if racial disparity exists in A 1 C independent <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> in children with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Participants included 276 children with type 1 diabetes. A 1 C and MBG were obtained from multiple clinic visits, and a hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) (an assessment of A 1 C levels independent <b>of</b> <b>MBG)</b> was calculated. A 1 C and HGI were analyzed controlling for age, diabetes duration, and MBG. RESULTS — African Americans had statistically significantly higher A 1 C (9. 1 � 0. 1) and HGI (0. 64 � 0. 11) than Caucasians (A 1 C 8. 3 � 0. 1, HGI � 0. 15 � 0. 07) independent of covariates. CONCLUSIONS — Because of racial disparity in A 1 C, which is independent <b>of</b> <b>MBG,</b> we recommend that A 1 C and MBG be used together to make therapeutic decisions for children with diabetes. Diabetes Care 33 : 1025 – 1027, 2010 Our group previously demonstrated that A 1 C levels are determined by mean blood glucose (MBG) and MBG-independent factors (1 – 3). Identification of MBG-independent factors that influence A 1 C levels is important for proper interpretation of A 1 C results and assessment of glycemic control in patients with diabetes, particularly because patients with higher than average A 1 C levels independent <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> have greater risk of microvascular complications (2). Recent data from adults (4 – 8) indicate that ethnicity/race is associated with differences in A 1 C independent <b>of</b> <b>MBG.</b> Race may also be associated with variation in A 1 C levels in children with or without diabetes (9, 10), although these findings were not shown to be independent <b>of</b> <b>MBG.</b> The goal <b>of</b> the current study was to determine if racial disparity exists in A 1 C independent <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> in children with type 1 diabetes...|$|R

However, the mechanism by which MBG impairs endothelial permeability is unknown. We utilized rat lung microvascular endothelial cells (RLMEC) to examine alterations in MBG-induced monolayer permeability and the effect <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> on the phosphorylation status of ERK 1 / 2, Jnk, and p 38. Apoptosis was evaluated by examining alterations in caspases 3 / 7, 8, and 9 and annexin-V staining. We also examined the effect <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> on the endothelial adherens junctions of the RLMEC monolayer. MBG inhibited the proliferation, and increased the monolayer permeability, of RLMEC. These actions <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> were attenuated by ERK, p 38, and pan caspase inhibition. MBG significantly decreased the phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and activated the phosphorylation of Jnk and p 38. MBG also significantly increased the expression of caspases 3 / 7, 8, and 9, indicating the activation of apoptosis. MBG-induced apoptosis signaling was not observed in cells pretreated with a p 38 inhibitor. MBG treatment induced the disruption of endothelial cell junctions.

Osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and activity, Alizarin Red staining, while adipogenic differentiation {{was assessed by}} Oil Red-O staining. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were taken to evaluate the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx 2) and proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ).

That is, MBGs may induce the rapid formation of hydroxy apatite (HA) in simulated body fluid (SBF), which is a major inorganic component of bone extracellular matrix (ECM) and comes with both good osteoconductivity and high affinity to adsorb proteins. Meanwhile, the high bioactivity <b>of</b> <b>MBGs</b> may lead to an abrupt initial local pH variation during the initial Ca ion-leaching from MBGs at the initial transplant stage, which may induce unexpected negative effects on using them in in vivo application. In this study we suggest a new way <b>of</b> using <b>MBGs</b> in bone tissue regeneration that can improve the strength and {{make up for the}} weakness <b>of</b> <b>MBGs.</b> We applied the outstanding bone-forming bioactivity <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> to coat the main ECM components HA and collagen on the MBG-polycarplolactone (PCL) composite scaffolds for improving their function as bone scaffolds in tissue regeneration. This precoating process can also expect to reduce initial local pH variation <b>of</b> <b>MBGs.</b> Methods and materials: The MBG-PCL scaffolds were immersed in the mixed solution of the collagen and SBF at 37 &deg;C for 24 hours. The coating of ECM components on the MBG-PCL scaffolds and the effect of ECM coating on in vitro cell behaviors were confirmed. Results: The ECM components were fully coated on MBG-PCL scaffolds after immersing in SBF containing dilute collagen-I solution only for 24 hours due to the high bone-forming bioactivity <b>of</b> <b>MBG.</b> Both cell affinity and osteoconductivity of MBG-PCL scaffolds were dramatically enhanced by this precoating process. Conclusion: The precoating process of ECM components on MBG-PCL scaffold using a high bioactivity <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> was not only effective in enhancing the functionality of scaffolds but also effective in eliminating the unexpected side effect. The MBG-PCL scaffold-coated ECM components ideally satisfied the required conditions of scaffold in tissue engineering, including 3 D well-interconnected pore structures with high porosity, good bioactivity, enhanced cell affinity, biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and sufficient mechanical properties, and promise excellent potential application in the field of biomaterials.

40|$|Background—Preeclampsia (PE) is a {{major cause}} of {{maternal}} and fetal mortality, and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Endogenous digitalis-like cardiotonic steroids (CTS) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of PE; this is illustrated by clinical observations that Digibind, a therapeutic digoxin antibody fragment which binds CTS, lowers blood pressure and reverses Na/K-ATPase inhibition in patients with PE. Recently we reported that plasma levels <b>of</b> marinobufagenin (<b>MBG),</b> a bufadienolide vasoconstrictor CTS, are increased four-fold in patients with severe PE.

40|$|Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) {{has been}} widely used for bone tissue regeneration. However, it lacks hydrophilicity, {{bioactivity}} and sufficient mechanical strength and its acidic degradation by-products can lead to pH decrease {{in the vicinity of}} the implants. Mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) with highly ordered structure (pore size 2 - 50 nm) possesses higher bioactivity than non-mesoporous bioactive glass (BG). The aim of this study is to investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> on the mechanical strength, in vitro degradation, bioactivity, cellular response and drug release of PLGA films and optimize their physicochemical, biological and drug-delivery properties for bone tissue engineering application. The surface and inner microstructure, mechanical strength and surface hydrophilicity of MBG/PLGA and BG/PLGA films were tested. Results indicated that MBG or BG was uniformly dispersed in the PLGA films. The incorporation <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> into PLGA films significantly improved their tensile strength, modulus and surface hydrophilicity. MBG/PLGA resulted in an enhanced mechanical strength, in vitro degradation (water absorbance, weight loss and ions release), apatite-formation ability and pH stability in simulated body fluids (SBF), compared to BG/PLGA. MBG/PLGA and BG/PLGA films enhanced human osteoblastic-like cells (HOBs) attachment, spreading and proliferation compared to PLGA. HOBs differentiation was significantly upregulated when cells were cultured on 30 MBG/PLGA for 14 days, compared to 30 BG/PLGA. MBG/PLGA enhanced the accumulative release of dexamethazone (DEX) at early stages (0 - 200 h) compared to BG/PLGA, however, after 200 h, DEX-release rates for MBG/PLGA was slower than that of BG/PLGA. The contents <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> in PLGA films can control the amount of DEX released. Taken together, MBG/PLGA films possessed excellent physicochemical, biological and drug-release properties, indicating their potential application for bone tissue engineering by designing 3 D scaffolds according to their corresponding compositions. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{present and}} discuss the latest {{addition}} of the Montreal Blue Galaxy (<b>MBG)</b> survey. Inspection <b>of</b> 59 Curtis Schmidt plates resulted {{in the identification of}} 135 new UV-bright galaxies with B < 15. 5. This brings the total number <b>of</b> <b>MBGs</b> to 469. New results of the V/V_m test show that our survey is complete to B = 14. 7. From our most recent spectroscopic follow-up, we confirm the discovery of one new Seyfert 1 galaxy and possibly one new Seyfert 2 galaxy. We confirm also the bias <b>of</b> the <b>MBG</b> survey towards the low-excitation and metal rich Starburst Nucleus Galaxies (SBNGs). The spectral characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>MBGs</b> {{are similar to those of}} the infrared luminous IRAS galaxies. As a common characteristic, they show a mean ratio Log([NII]/Hα) in excess of 0. 2 dex as compared to normal disk HII regions. In general, the MBGs have lower far-infrared luminosities (L_IR < 10 ^ 11 L_) and are nearer (z < 0. 05) than the luminous IRAS galaxies. The distribution of the morphologies <b>of</b> the <b>MBGs</b> indicates a high number of early-type spirals (Sb and earlier). Nearly half of these galaxies also possess a bar. In our sample, the fraction of galaxies with bars depends on the morphology and increases towards the late-type spirals. However, if we consider only isolated galaxies, the late-type spirals show a clear tendency to be barred. Signs of a recent interaction with neighbor galaxies are obvious only in 24...|$|R
40|$|Microsphere {{systems with}} the ideal {{properties}} for bone regeneration {{need to be}} bioactive, {{and at the same}} time possess the capacity for controlled protein/drug-delivery; however, the current crop of microsphere system fails to fulfill these properties. The aim of this study was to develop a novel protein-delivery system of bioactive mesoporous glass (MBG) microspheres by a biomimetic method through controlling the density of apatite on the surface of microspheres, for potential bone tissue regeneration. MBG microspheres were prepared by using the method of alginate cross-linking with Ca 2 + ions. The cellular bioactivity <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> microspheres was evaluated by investigating the proliferation and attachment of bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC). The loading efficiency and release kinetics of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on MBG microspheres were investigated after coprecipitating with biomimetic apatite in simulated body fluids (SBF). The results showed that MBG microspheres supported BMSC attachment and the Si containing ionic products from MBG microspheres stimulated BMSCs proliferation. The density <b>of</b> apatite on <b>MBG</b> microspheres increased with the length of soaking time in SBF. BSA-loading efficiency <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> was significantly enhanced by co-precipitating with apatite. Furthermore, the loading efficiency and release kinetics of BSA could be controlled by controlling the density of apatite formed on MBG microspheres. Our results suggest that MBG microspheres are a promising protein-delivery system as a filling material for bone defect healing and regeneration...|$|R

40|$|Hyperthermia {{and local}} drug {{delivery}} {{have been proposed}} the potential therapeutic approaches for bone defects resulting from malignant bone tumors. Development of bioactive materials with magnetic and drug-delivery properties may potentially meet this target. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop a multifunctional mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) scaffold system for both hyperthermia and local-drug delivery application potentially. For this aim, Iron (Fe) containing MBG (Fe-MBG) scaffolds with hierarchically large pores (300 - 500 µm) and fingerprint-like mesopores (4. 5 nm) have been successfully prepared. The effect of Fe on the mesopore structure, physiochemical, magnetism, drug delivery and biological properties <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> scaffolds has been systematically investigated. The results showed that the morphology of the mesopore varied from straight channels to curved fingerprint-like channels after incorporated parts <b>of</b> Fe into <b>MBG</b> scaffolds. The magnetism magnitude <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> scaffolds can be tailored by controlling Fe contents. Furthermore, the incorporating of Fe into mesoporous MBG glass scaffolds enhanced the mitochondrial activity and bone-relative gene (ALP and OCN) expression of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on the scaffolds. The obtained Fe-MBG scaffolds also possessed high specific surface areas and sustained drug delivery. Therefore, Fe-MBG scaffolds are magnetic, degradable and bioactive. The multifunction of Fe-MBG scaffolds indicates that there is a great potential for Fe-MBG scaffolds to be used for the therapy and regeneration of large-bone defects caused by malignant bone tumors through the combination of hyperthermia, local drug delivery and their osteoconductivity...|$|R
40|$|Development of hypoxia-mimicking bone tissue {{engineering}} scaffolds {{is of great}} importance in stimulating angiogenesis for bone regeneration. Dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG) is a cell-permeable, competitive inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH), which can stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α) expression. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop hypoxia-mimicking scaffolds by delivering DMOG in mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) scaffolds and to investigate whether the delivery of DMOG could induce a hypoxic microenvironment for human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC). MBG scaffolds with varied mesoporous structures (e. g. surface area and mesopore volume) were prepared by controlling the contents of mesopore-template agent. The composition, large-pore microstructure and mesoporous properties <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> scaffolds were characterized. The effect of mesoporous properties on the loading and release <b>of</b> DMOG in <b>MBG</b> scaffolds was investigated. The effects of DMOG delivery on the cell morphology, cell viability, HIF- 1 α stabilization, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and bone-related gene expression (alkaline phosphatase, ALP; osteocalcin, OCN; and osteopontin, OPN) <b>of</b> hBMSC in <b>MBG</b> scaffolds were systematically investigated. The results showed that the loading and release <b>of</b> DMOG in <b>MBG</b> scaffolds can be efficiently controlled by regulating their mesoporous properties via the addition of different contents of mesopore-template agent. DMOG delivery in MBG scaffolds had no cytotoxic effect on the viability of hBMSC. DMOG delivery significantly induced HIF- 1 α stabilization, VEGF secretion and bone-related gene expression <b>of</b> hBMSC in <b>MBG</b> scaffolds in which DMOG counteracted the effect of HIF-PH and stabilized HIF- 1 α expression under normoxic condition. Furthermore, it was found that MBG scaffolds with slow DMOG release significantly enhanced the expression of bone-related genes more than those with instant DMOG release. The results suggest that the controllable delivery <b>of</b> DMOG in <b>MBG</b> scaffolds can mimic a hypoxic microenvironment, which not only improves the angiogenic capacity of hBMSC, but also enhances their osteogenic differentiation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a retailer adopting a “money-back-guaranteed ” (MBG) sales policy, which allows customers to return products {{that do not}} meet their expectations back to the retailer for a full or partial refund. We use a two-stage optimization model, maximizing the retailer’s profits, in which the retailer decides on the quantity to procure from her supplier in the first stage, and makes pricing decisions in the second stage. A two-period framework in the second stage captures the important features <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> sales including returns from customers and the sale of these products as open-box items. We show that selling with MBGs increases retail sales and profit. Furthermore, the second-sale opportunity created by restocking returned products enables the retailer to generate more revenues from reduced initial stock. Our analysis identifies the ideal conditions under which this practice is most beneficial to the retailer. We also show that {{the effect on the}} new product price depends on the restocking fee charged for returns as well as the retailer’s flexibility in adjusting new product prices over time. In order to quantify the profit impact <b>of</b> offering a <b>MBG</b> and the incremental value of restocking and open-box sales, we also study the scenarios where the retailer offers a MBG but does not restock returned products, and the case without MBGs. Our computational study substantiates the analytical results and sharpens our insights on the drivers <b>of</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> policies and their impact on retail decisions.

40|$|Ordered {{mesoporous}} bioactive glasses (MBGs) {{with different}} compositions were prepared by using nonionic block copolymer surfactants as structure-directing agents through an evaporation-induced self-assembly process. Their in-vitro bioactivities were studied in detail by electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and {{inductively coupled plasma}} (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy. The ICP element analysis results were further calculated {{in terms of the}} total consumption of Ca and P, Delta[Ca]/Delta[P] ratios, and ionic activity product (IP) of hydroxyapatite. Through the above analysis, it is clear that MBGs show a different structure-bioactivity correlation compared to conventional sol-gel-derivcd BGs. The in vitro bioactivity <b>of</b> <b>MBGs</b> is dependent on the Si/Ca ratio in the network when the other material parameters such as the mesostructure and texture properties (pore size, pore volume) are controlled. MBG 80 S 15 C with relatively lower calcium content exhibits the best in vitro bioactivity, in contrast to conventional sol-gel-derived BGs where usually higher calcium percentage BGs (e. g. 60 S 35 C) show better bioactivity. Calcination temperature is another important factor that influences the in vitro bioactivity. According to our results, MBGs calcined at 973 K may possess the best in vitro bioactivity. The influences of the composition and calcination temperature upon bioactivity are explained in terms of the unique structures <b>of</b> <b>MBGs.</b> (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Maitake {{beta-glucan}} (MBG) is {{an extract}} from the fruit {{body of the}} Grifola frondosa mushroom that is being widely used to treat cancer in Asia. We have previously reported that MBG enhances mouse bone marrow cell (BMC) hematopoiesis in vitro and protects BMC from doxorubicin (DOX) toxicity. In the current study, we investigated the ability <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> to enhance hematopoiesis and to reduce the toxic effects of DOX on fresh human umbilical cord blood (CB) cells. MBG treatment significantly enhanced the colony formation unit (CFU) response of granulocytes-macrophages (CFU-GM response) over the whole dose range of 12. 5 to 100 μg/ml (P < 0. 05). The addition <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> to DOX-treated CB cells significantly protected granulocyte-macrophage colony formation from the toxicity of DOX, which otherwise produced strong hematopoietic repression. MBG also partially replaced recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), as shown by a significant augmentation of the CFU-GM response {{in the absence of}} rhG-CSF. We found that MBG induces granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production in CB CD 33 + monocytes, as detected by intracellular cytokine flow cytometric assessment. In contrast, we found that adult peripheral blood monocytes did not produce a significant G-CSF response to MBG, whereas both adult and CB monocytes produced G-CSF in response to lipopolysaccharide. These studies provide the first evidence that MBG induces hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation of CFU-GM in umbilical CB cells and acts directly to induce G-CSF...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{evolution}} of myocardial perfusion during follow-up after primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its association with final left ventricular (LV) function. The angiographic myocardial blush grade (MBG) was analyzed immediately after intervention and at a follow-up check (7. 5 ± 5. 6 months later) in a sample of 101 patients with a first-time AMI. Further parameters included Ckmax, sum of ST-segment elevation, TIMI frame count and LV ejection fraction. The myocardial perfusion (MBG) at follow up was persistently abnormal in 19 patients (20 %), improved from previously abnormal to normal in 30 patients (31 %), remained normal in 40 patients (42 %), and deteriorated from normal to abnormal in 7 patients (7 %). Comparing the evolution groups it was ound that patients with an improved MBG had a better LV ejection fraction at follow-up than thoses patients with persistelntly abnormal blush. Moreover, the factor evolution <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> had a better predictive value for LV ejection fraction at follow-up than acute MBG only. Regression analysis proved that the evolution <b>of</b> <b>MBG</b> from AMI to follow-up represents an independent predictor of LV function in addition to the initial size of jeopardized myocardium as defined by the sum of ST-segment elevation and infarct location. The results of the study show, that the myocardial perfusion after AMI is characterized by continous changes, as indicated by repeated MBG analysis.
