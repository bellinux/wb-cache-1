Dams, such as Alvaro Obregon, Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, Plutarco Elias Calles, Abelardo Rodriguez and Lazaro Cardenas, have been built along some of these rivers, at least two of them where natural lakes existed. Some of the dams formed large deltas, such as that of the Mayo River. The largest aquifers are mostly found between Hermosillo and coast, the Guaymas Valley and the area around Caborca. Most of these are having problems due to overpumping for agricultural irrigation.|$|E

50|$|The {{carbonate}} {{rocks that}} form the Floridan <b>aquifer</b> <b>system</b> are of late Paleocene to early Oligocene age and are overlain by low-permeability clays of Miocene age (upper confining unit) and surficial sands of Pliocene and Holocene age (surficial <b>aquifer</b> <b>system).</b> In west-central Florida, north Florida, and along the updip margin of the system, the limestone crops out and the <b>aquifer</b> <b>system</b> is unconfined. Where low-permeability clays of the upper confining unit are present and substantial, the system is confined and groundwater is contained under pressure. The upper confining unit is particularly thick in Coastal Georgia and South Florida; downward leakage of water through the upper confining unit in these areas is minimal and the Floridan <b>aquifer</b> <b>system</b> is thickly confined. Low permeability limestone rocks of Paleocene age (e.g. Cedar Keys Formation) form {{the base of the}} Floridan <b>aquifer</b> <b>system.</b> The Floridan <b>aquifer</b> <b>system</b> ranges in thickness from less than 100 feet in updip areas where the rocks pinch out to more than 3,700 feet in southwestern Florida. Recharge, flow, and natural discharge in the Floridan <b>aquifer</b> <b>system</b> are largely controlled by the degree of confinement provided by upper confining units, the interaction of streams and rivers with the aquifer in its unconfined areas, and the interaction between fresh and saline water along the coastlines.|$|R
