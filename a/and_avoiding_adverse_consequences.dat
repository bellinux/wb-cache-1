40|$|Managing large river basins for {{sustainability}} is {{a contentious}} social–ecological arena challenging traditional scientific and rational planning approaches to water and related natural resources governance. “Crises” are inevitable but double-edged: creating threats and uncertainties, but also new opportunities to shape trajectories of change <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences.</b> A {{case study of}} the large remote cross-border Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), in arid central Australia, shows how over two decades a series of social–ecological and political–administrative “crises” emerged, posing significant environmental and social dilemmas for water governance, while also opening up opportunities for institutional change. This article examines the role of crises in the emergence and evolution of water governance in the LEB, how they were perceived, the challenges and opportunities posed, social and institutional responses, and governance capacity outcomes. Finally, it reflects on emergent crises as opportunities for more systemic and adaptive change in large river basins...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{large sample}} of both {{publicly}} traded and privately held firms in South Korea (hereafter "Korea"), we investigate whether, and how, the deviation of controlling shareholders' control from ownership, business group affiliation, and listing status differentially affect {{the extent of}} earnings management. Our study yields three major findings. First, we find that as the control-ownership disparity becomes larger, controlling shareholders tend to engage more in opportunistic earnings management to hide their behavior <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences</b> such as disciplinary action. The result of our full-model regression reveals that {{an increase in the}} control-ownership wedge by I percent leads to an increase in the magnitude of (unsigned) discretionary accruals by 1. 3 percent of lagged total assets, ceteris paribus. Second, we find that for our full-model regression, the magnitude of (unsigned) discretionary accruals is greater for group-affiliated firms than for nonaffiliated firms by 0. 8 percent of lagged total assets. This result suggests that business group affiliation provides controlling shareholders with more incentives and opportunities for earnings management. Finally, we find that for our full-model regression, the magnitude of (unsigned) discretionary accruals is greater for publicly traded firms than for privately held firms by 1. 2 percent of lagged total assets. This result supports the notion that stock markets create incentives for public firms to manage reported earnings to satisfy the expectations of various market participants that are often expressed in earnings numbers.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{environmental effects}} of increasing atmospheric CO 2 levels are of major worldwide concern. One alternative for managing CO 2 emissions is carbon sequestration: the capture and secure confinement of CO 2 before it is emitted to the atmosphere. Successful technologies must be environmentally benign, permanent, economically viable, safe and effective. As a result, their timely development represents a significant challenge. Unlike many other proposed CO 2 sequestration technologies, which provide storage, CO 2 mineral sequestration provides permanent disposal via geologically stable mineral carbonates (e. g., MgCO 3). As such, mineral sequestration guarantees permanent containment <b>and</b> <b>avoids</b> <b>adverse</b> environmental <b>consequences</b> <b>and</b> the cost of continuous site monitoring. The major remaining challenge for CO 2 mineral sequestration is economically viable process development.

This is achieved by inserting stabilization clauses to ensure that future changes in policy or legislation of the host country does not affect the existing agreement. Multinational oil companies are nevertheless confronted by the reality that stabilization clauses do not in fact provide the requisite immunity against host government action. On the part of host countries, it is recognized that their right to enjoy maximum benefits <b>and</b> to <b>avoid</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences</b> from the exploitation of petroleum cannot be compromised on the ground that stability is an express term of the agreement.

40|$|This {{document}} {{is the first}} deliverable from Work Package 2 of the NEGOTIATE project, “Early job insecurity and youth unemployment as a theoretical and societal challenge”. The Work Package’s first objective is to develop “an original analytical framework for a comparative assessment {{of the individual and}} societal consequences of job insecurity early in a career. The analytical framework integrates concepts such as negotiation, agency, capability, empowerment, social resilience, embedded employability, networks, transition regimes, welfare state regimes and multi-level governance. A key interest is how to conceptualise the interactions between the young adults’ agency and structurally given constraints and opportunities, (e. g. how they perceive and use their scope for action through networks and active agency, even in seemingly adverse circumstances) and in what sense young adults’ find ways of negotiating the challenges of prolonged unemployment and job insecurity. ” (DoA, Annex 1, Part A, p. 16). NEGOTIATE’s core question is how young people’s scope for agency interacts with different layers of structural conditions in a multi-level governance system. As means to answering this question, the deliverable will review and summarise relevant theoretical literature on key concepts and assess how they contribute {{to an understanding of the}} consequences of early job insecurity for young people. A particular interest is the extent to which young women and men are able to negotiate these conditions <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> the most <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences</b> of such insecurity. We will be particularly attentive to mechanisms of gendered labour market outcomes and patterns of market marginalisation of young people. The practical goal of presenting the analytical framework and undertaking a conceptual clarification is to provide a common basis for the empirical work of NEGOTIATE (cf.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in {{symptomatic}} and asymptomatic women attending peripheral health centres to determine the laboratory prevalence of sexually transmitted infection (STI), reproductive tract infection (RTI) and HIV. A total of 4090 women in four study groups were subjected to general and speculum examination and screened for aetiological agents of RTI/STI by standard laboratory techniques. The main complaint was vaginal discharge, singly (11 · 2 %) or along with other symptoms (49 · 0 %). Prevalence of RTI/STI/HIV infection was 36 · 8 %. Agents of RTIs were harboured by 24 · 3 % and that of STIs by 12 · 5 %. HIV seroprevalence was very low (0 · 1 %).

40|$|Biologically active {{substances}} are expressed by cells within the periodontium {{in response to}} mechanical stimuli from orthodontic appliances. Several possible biomarkers representing biological modifications during specific phenomena as simile-inflammatory process, bone resorption and formation, periodontal ligament changes, and vascular and neural responses are proposed. Citations to potentially published trials were conducted by searching PubMed, Cochrane databases, and scientific textbooks. Additionally, hand searching and contact with experts in the area were undertaken to identify potentially relevant published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria were as follows: animal models involving only mice and rats undergoing orthodontic treatment; collection of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) as a noninvasively procedure for humans; no other simultaneous treatment that could affect experimental orthodontic movement. The data suggest that knowledge of the remodeling process occurring in periodontal tissues during orthodontic and orthopedic therapies may be a clinical usefulness procedure leading to proper choice of mechanical stress to improve and to shorten the period of treatment, <b>avoiding</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences.</b> The relevance for clinicians of evaluating the rate of some substances as valid biomarkers of periodontal effects during orthodontic movement, by means of two models of study, mice and men, is underlined...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{election}} of May 1997, Britain's Conservative government was committed to giving general practitioners a lead role in health service development. However, a qualitative study of managers and primary care workers, charged with implementing the initiative {{in the south of}} England, revealed that while many relished the opportunity to make service provision more responsive to local needs, they were concerned that such changes might fragment the National Health Service and damage the relationship between doctor and patient. This ambivalence gave rise to a precautionary principle, in which innovative change was stifled by the desire to <b>avoid</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences.</b> This "becalming" of health policy stemmed from disenchantment with both rational comprehensive planning and quasi-market incrementalism, leaving the government without an ideological basis on which to develop a new organizational form for health sector decision-making. The new Labour government pledged to eradicate the irrationality associated with the internal market. However, a return to the old NHS planning model is not proposed, and Labour is equally committed to involving GPs in commissioning health services at the local level, suggesting that the tension between centralized planning and local incrementalism may continue to undermine {{the development and implementation of}} health policy...|$|R

Secondary analysis and methods {{development has been}} conducted in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), enabling the integration of epigenetic measures in social research. Project description: Identifying and understanding the many influences that act across different stages of the life course on social, behavioural and health outcomes continues to present a challenge. This project aims to apply new technologies in epigenomics to interrogate this issue. We propose that the epigenome (markings added to the DNA sequence that alter how genes are regulated) act not only as an index of previous exposures (such as early life adversity, smoking or stress) - a biosocial archive - but may be intimately linked to, and predictive of, future wellbeing. This project will explore the relationship between epigenetic marks {{and a variety of}} different exposures in early life and across childhood and early adulthood. These epigenetic signatures will then be related to social, behavioural and health outcomes. The study will be based upon the well-established Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Understanding the role of the epigenome and its place in the life course may help to identify when best to intervene to <b>avoid</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences</b> of early life events on long term outcomes.

In a prospective observational study of 59 patients, Collyer et al.

40|$|Aims The {{inflammatory}} response to injurious agents is tightly regulated to <b>avoid</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences</b> of inappropriate leucocyte accumulation or failed resolution. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated endothelium recruits leucocytes to the inflamed tissue through controlled expression of membrane-associated adhesion molecules. LPS responses in macrophages {{are known to}} be regulated by integrin-linked kinase (ILK); in this study, we investigated the role of ILK in the regulation of the LPS-elicited {{inflammatory response}} in endothelium. Methods and results This study was performed on immortalized mouse endothelial cells (EC) isolated from lung and coronary vasculature. Cells were thoroughly characterized and the role of ILK in the regulation of the LPS response was investigated by suppressing ILK expression using siRNA and shRNA technologies. Phenotypic and functional analyses confirmed that the immortalized cells behaved as true EC. LPS induced the expression of the inflammatory genes E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1). ILK knockdown impaired LPS-mediated endothelial activation by preventing the induction of ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1. Blockade of the LPS-induced response inhibited the inflammatory-related processes of firm adhesion and trans-endothelial migration of leucocytes. Conclusion ILK is involved in the expression of cell adhesion molecules by EC activated with the inflammatory stimulus LPS. This reduced expression modulates leucocyte adhesion to the endothelium and the extravasation process. This finding suggests ILK as a potential anti-inflammatory target for the development of vascular-specific treatments for inflammation-related disease...|$|R

40|$|Following {{public sector}} reforms {{inspired}} by New Public Management, new structures and processes intended for actors {{to coordinate their}} activities have been introduced in the public sectors in Northern Europe since the 1980 s. Partly, the focus on structural change has evolved around creating market-like structures. Quasi-markets {{can be regarded as}} a structure for governance where market mechanisms should lead to improved quality, efficiency and responsiveness without <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences</b> for equity. Private and public providers who are publicly paid compete for citizens to use their services and citizens are free to choose a provider in line with their preferences. Also in Swedish primary, recent reforms involve expanded choice of provider for the population combined with freedom of establishment and privatization of providers. In this thesis, a theoretical model for governance in quasi-markets, taking into account actors, objectives and mechanisms of accountability is developed and empirical analyses related to objectives, actors and accountability in the context of Swedish primary care are conducted. Accountability is treated as a mechanism between principals and agents, where principals assess agents activities against their expectations on services and pass judgment on their conduct. In quasi-markets, providers (agents) are accountable for their conduct to both citizens and governments (principals). The accountability relationship between citizens and providers is choice. The accountability relationship between the government and providers is a horizontal accountability relationship, whereby governments provide resources and delegate power and responsibilities for collective objectives to providers by means of agreements or contracts. The theoretical model as well as the studies on Swedish primary care (three published articles) show that mechanisms for corrective action related to choice is not sufficient for quasi-markets to achieve its intended aims of improved quality, responsiveness and efficiency without <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences</b> for equity. Dual accountability relationships need to be established and maintained. Accountability relationships related to citizens are appropriate for objectives related to quality and responsiveness of services towards individuals. But traditional accountability relationships related to governments have to be maintained to <b>avoid</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>and</b> to achieve traditional objectives related to other aspects of quality, efficient use of resources and equitable distribution of services...|$|R
