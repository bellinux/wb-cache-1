It's always been very {{important}} to me that I've got on with the people we've worked with. People's attitude has always been really important to me. So much of why someone would exist on one of our albums is what they are like as a person.

In November 1991, Talk Talk sued EMI, delivering four writs against their former record label. The band claimed that material had been falsely attributed to them and that they were owed money from unpaid royalties. Talk Talk won the case in 1992, and EMI agreed to withdraw and destroy all remaining copies of the album.

They then turn to Bugs for help and he digs the sand mountain down. Afterwards, Granny reads them a story about Easter and the Easter Bunny. Taz is excited about this, but Granny tells him it's not until one more day, upsetting him.

However, Daffy tries to convince Bugs that there's still no Easter Bunny and Bugs, ordered by him to grow up and forget it all, tears the decorations down, upsetting Lola and Tweety. During naptime, Tweety and Lola suggest to Sylvester that they should take Taz to the forest where the Easter Bunny lives by looking at the pages in Granny's storybook. However, Daffy is shocked to find them gone and he and Bugs go into the forest, too to find them. Bugs, wearing a raincoat and rainboots, pretending to be the Easter Bunny, and Daffy, covered in yellow paint and a leaf around his body, to look like a duckling, paint rocks to look like Easter eggs. Taz falls in the river and is rescued by them. However, the [...] "eggs" [...] turned out to be rocks, and the yellow paint washes off Daffy in the river. Everyone finally realizes that there is no Easter Bunny, but by the next morning, they wake up to find real Easter eggs, delighting Taz, and Sylvester is given a chocolate chicken, which meant the Easter Bunny did come, and {{it turns out to be}} a happy Easter after all.|$|E
