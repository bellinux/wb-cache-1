500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E
2500|$|Wald {{recalled}} {{that he and}} Reddy married three days after meeting and, along with daughter Traci, the couple took up residence at the Hotel Albert in Greenwich Village. Reddy later stated that she married Wald [...] "out of desperation over her right to work {{and live in the}} United States." [...] According to the magazine New York, Wald was fired from William Morris soon after having met Reddy, and [...] "Helen supported them for six months doing $35-a-night hospital and charity benefits. They were so broke that they snuck out of a hotel room carrying their clothes in paper bags." [...] Reddy recalled: [...] "When we did eat, it was spaghetti, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> what little money we had on cockroach spray." [...] They left New York City for Chicago and Wald landed a job as talent coordinator at Mister Kelly's. While in Chicago, Reddy gained a reputation singing in local lounges – including Mister Kelly's – [...] and, in the spring of 1968, she landed a deal with Fontana Records, a division of major label Chicago-based Mercury Records. Her first single, [...] "One Way Ticket", on Fontana was not an American hit, but it did give Reddy her first ever appearance on any chart as it peaked at No. 83 in her native Australia.|$|E
60|$|June 8.--I {{finished}} five sheets this day. Will Clerk and Francis Scott of Harden came to dinner, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> {{a pleasant}} evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well then. That flying machine cost us twenty-eight {{hundred dollars}} new <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>spent</b> {{over two hundred}} dollars on improvements, so when she was smashed she was worth at least three {{thousand}} dollars." ...|$|R

5000|$|Mitch Seavey: The {{returning}} champion. His {{two sons}} Tyrell and Dallas are also competing. His dogs {{are known for}} stamina and pulling ahead {{at the end of}} the race. Seavey said, [...] "The trail was soft <b>and</b> punchy. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> hours <b>and</b> hours and hours wallowing in deep snow." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Jerry came aft to {{take part}} in the conversation, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> a good half-hour praising each other and chuckling over the good fortune that had been ours.|$|E
60|$|I {{did not see}} Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, {{when she}} volunteered to take me for a walk, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> a charming {{afternoon}} roaming in the woods, returning to the house about five.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we didn't {{know each}} other then. But we were staying at the same hotel, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> {{an hour or so}} shut up in an {{elevator}} together. That was when we really got acquainted." ...|$|E
5000|$|Morby's fourth studio {{album was}} {{recorded}} with his live band, with guitarist Meg Duffy noting: [...] "We all {{worked on the}} next record together, pretty collaboratively in terms of arranging <b>and</b> playing. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> {{a week in a}} beautiful studio, up near Stinson Beach." [...] The album, City Music, was released in June 2017.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The few goods <b>we</b> brought here, <b>and</b> {{in which}} <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> our money, would produce {{something}} if sold,' resumed Martin; 'and whatever they realise shall be paid him instantly. But they can't be sold here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, fully that," [...] she answered, with {{an effect}} of {{disappointment}} in his figures. [...] "We had just ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> never <b>spent</b> less than seven, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> didn't dress, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> didn't entertain, either, to speak of. But {{you have to live}} on a certain scale, and generally you live up to your income." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not very}} {{agreeable}} work, but {{for the sake of}} being near him, {{and at the same time}} to please Captain Hannock, I lent a hand, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> the remainder of the day together.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{new role}} for Sedgwick," [...] she remarked. [...] "When he has finished, we are going into the cathedral to hear the music. I'm fond of churches, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> the {{afternoon}} in Notre Dame." ...|$|E
60|$|Bickley did return, having {{recovered}} his temper, since {{after all}} {{it was impossible for}} anyone to remain angry with the Lady Yva for long, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> a very happy time together. We instructed and she was the humble pupil.|$|E
5000|$|In his own words: [...] "Over {{the years}} I have {{spent so much}} time {{backstage}} that the space behind the music is a part of me. Many of the musicians I photographed were far more than just subjects to me. The musicians became my friends <b>and</b> family. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> many hours honing our skills and teaching each other the politics of the arts." ...|$|R
5000|$|Robert Fraley, {{executive}} vice president and chief technology officer for Monsanto, said the company has been “focused on giving technology and tools to farmers to improve their productivity <b>and</b> yield <b>and</b> <b>we</b> haven’t <b>spent</b> nearly the time we have needed to on talking to consumers and talking to social media.” ...|$|R
50|$|According to guitarist and backing vocalist Elaine, “We’ve {{recorded}} the album, including the single, mostly in Wexford and in Sun Studios in Temple Bar <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> ten days in France {{to add the}} finishing touches. We’re really excited about getting the album done and getting the single out. We’re also looking forward to doing some live gigs after having been in the studio for so much of last year”.|$|R
60|$|It was a warm, {{pleasant}} day, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> much of {{our time}} in a beautiful arbor constructed in a retired place in the garden, where the trees and shrubbery were so arranged as to make a most charming retreat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Sankey has {{reported}} to me, sir, that Mr. Repton is very strongly of {{opinion that the}} barque, there, is the Spanish ship of war he boarded by night, just after the beginning of hostilities. He told us about it, sir, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> {{two or three days}} in looking for her." ...|$|E
60|$|My blue-eyed friend erected {{himself into}} an obelisk of profanity. He cursed me by his gods--the {{right and left}} bower; he even cursed the very good cigars he had given me. But, the storm over, he quieted down and explained. I apologized for causing him to waste an evening, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> a very {{pleasant}} time together.|$|E
50|$|<b>We</b> have <b>spent</b> {{more hours}} in overcrowded and uncomfortably crammed 12 seater Europcar vans {{travelling}} {{up and down}} the Hume. We have slept on more floors and played more gigs to just the bar guy and the sound guy that we ever thought we would. We have been charged ridiculous amounts by Virgins excess charges on so many occasions we could have bought our own plane, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>spent</b> many years chasing the dream that is Trial Kennedy <b>and</b> <b>we</b> feel like we are walking away happy.|$|R
40|$|After {{eight years}} of occupation, war, and {{sacrifice}} our military role in Iraq is over, and our troops are coming home. We have lost 4, 484 soldiers, over 32, 000 have been wounded, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>spent</b> nearly a trillion dollars. How we got involved in Iraq must never be forgotten; specifically, the ignorance of some {{in the world and}} the actions of self-serving politicians — both Republican and Democrat...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{report on}} our {{experiences}} {{with the implementation of}} a parallel al-gorithm to compute the cycle structure of a permutation given as an oracle. As a sub-problem, the cycle structure of a modified permutation given as a table that is par-titioned over N hard disks has to be computed. While a minor point during algorithm design <b>and</b> analysis, <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> most time to implement and tune this particular piece of code. We present the decisions taken during implementation and give preliminary performance figures. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you came}} up I was just {{contrasting}} this valley with one I remember visiting in the Old Country," [...] she said. [...] "It was in the West. Major Hume, who is with us now, once took me there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> an afternoon at a house which, I think, is older than any we have in Canada." ...|$|E
60|$|Henry has {{developed}} rheumatism in his back, ten skins have peeled off {{my hands and}} the eleventh is now peeling, while Tehei is more lunatic than ever and day and night prays God not to kill him. Also, Nakata and I are slashing away at fever again. And finally up to date, Nakata last evening had an attack of ptomaine poisoning, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> half the night pulling him through.|$|E
60|$|The {{country about}} Lynton is wonderfully beautiful, with rocks and valleys, and velvet lawns {{running into the}} sea, and woods and ancestral mansions, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> the day seeing all this, and also going down to Lynmouth, where the little ships lie high and dry on the sand when the tide goes out, and the carts drive {{up to them and}} put goods on board, and when the tide rises the ships sail away, which is very convenient.|$|E
6000|$|For {{another week}} nothing of moment happened, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> an hour one {{morning with the}} {{surveyor}} and a gray-haired gentleman from Winnipeg. He differed from the former in many ways, and spoke with a deliberate urbanity, but I felt that he also spoke with authority and was quietly taking stock of us. We signed several papers, a receipt among them, {{and it was only}} then that I realized what that unfortunate coulée had cost us, while, when at last we went out, the surveyor said: ...|$|R
2500|$|However, even Bill Drummond - the A man who {{had signed}} them - had harsh words {{to say about the}} project: [...] "I signed a band called Brilliant, who I worked with, <b>we</b> worked together, <b>and</b> it was {{complete}} failure. Artistically bankrupt project. <b>And</b> financially deaf. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> £300,000 on making an album that was useless. Useless artistically, useless... commercially." ...|$|R
60|$|I set out {{in company}} {{with my wife and}} sister, and Mr. and Mrs. Monkhouse, then just married, and Miss Horrocks. These two ladies, sisters, we left at Berne, while Mr. Monkhouse took the {{opportunity}} of making an excursion with us among the Alps, as far as Milan. Mr. H. C. Robinson joined us at Lucerne, and when this ramble was completed we rejoined at Geneva the two ladies we had left at Berne, and proceeded to Paris, where Mr. Monkhouse and H. C. R. left us, <b>and</b> where <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> five weeks, of which there is not a record in these poems.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Gregory, we {{are very}} glad to see you, and to find that you have done honour to the name. The {{despatch}} said {{that you have been}} previously mentioned, under the name of Gregory Hilliard. We always file our papers, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> an hour after breakfast in going through them. I suppose you threw up your appointment, as soon as you discovered that Geoffrey died, years ago, and that you had come into the title?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told her}} that I would take the subject into consideration, and give my opinion in a few days. That night, after my sister and myself had retired to our own apartment, I related to her the whole history, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> the night in talking of it. I was powerfully {{impressed}} with the justice and propriety of an immediate disclosure; while she, on the contrary, represented the painful consequences that would probably come upon Lady Byron from taking such a step.|$|E
60|$|We got {{a jar of}} shandy-gaff, some food, and, on Ewart's suggestion, two Japanese {{sunshades}} in Staines; we demanded extra cushions at the boathouse <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> {{an enormously}} soothing day in discourse and meditation, our boat moored in a shady place this side of Windsor. I seem to remember Ewart with a cushion forward, only his heels and sunshade and some black ends of hair showing, a voice and no more, against the shining, smoothly-streaming mirror {{of the trees and}} bushes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess we'll fix {{him up in}} that creamery," [...] said Jasper. [...] "The man {{who runs}} it was raised {{not far from the}} old folks' place in Ontario," [...] <b>and</b> <b>we</b> started {{forthwith}} on an apparently endless ride across the frozen prairie. Some of our horses are not much to look at, and others are hard to drive, but the way they can haul the light wagons or even the humble ground sleigh along league after league would surprise those not used to them. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> one night with a Highland crofter in a dwelling that resembled a burrow, for most of it was underground, but the rammed earth walls kept out the cold and the interior was both warm <b>and</b> clean. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> another in somewhat grim conviviality at the creamery, for the men whose fathers hewed sites for what are now thriving towns out of the bush of Ontario are rather hard and staunch than sprightly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think the}} risk is great," [...] Mordaunt replied. [...] "I {{sometimes}} speculate, and you have grounds for knowing I'm generally lucky. Well, some friends floated a small private company to develop a West Indian estate <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>spent</b> much of our capital on new plantations. The value of our produce is rising, but we need funds to carry us on until the crop is shipped and have agreed to a fresh levy. I must pay my share." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{she began}} to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to another subject, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> all <b>spent</b> a very happy evening together.|$|R
