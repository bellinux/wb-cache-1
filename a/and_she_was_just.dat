25|$|Courtney Alexis Stodden, (born 29 August 1994), is an American tabloid personality. She made {{headlines}} with {{her marriage to}} Green Mile actor Doug Hutchison in 2011, when he was 51 <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 16. She entered the house on Day 1 and left on Day 21, {{two days before the}} final night.|$|E
500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act, while record {{producer}} Patrick Leonard was the music director. [...] "At first I said, 'The {{girl in the}} underwear? Gedoudahere!'" [...] he recalled in 1992. [...] "But then I met her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> this vicious thing. You know, right in your face with, 'This is what I need. The tour's three months long. Whaddo I know about a band? You do it.' So I said okay." ...|$|E
2500|$|According {{to former}} Lieutenant Governor and Superintendent of Education William J. [...] "Bill" [...] Dodd, Blanche Revere was [...] "in her young years a true beauty. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as {{intelligent}} {{as she was}} good-looking. In her political days, her personality came across as either soft and sweet or blue steel and cold, depending {{not so much on}} how she felt, but on what the situation demanded." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, no, miss, not as I know of, but nurse {{has come}} home, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> {{like a wild}} thing; somehow or other Master Walter has got lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|The wife, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not one jot {{less than}} the husband, [...] The daughter, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> {{as good as the}} son, [...] The mother, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> every bit as much as the father.|$|R
2500|$|... "It {{was on a}} Friday {{night that}} Whitney came into the studio. It was great to meet her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a {{pleasure}} to work with. She was totally professional. Whitney actually had a cold that night, and her speaking voice was whispery and hoarse. But when she started singing, she sounded incredible. For Allan and {{me to be in}} the studio to hear her sing our song so beautifully, {{it was one of the}} greatest moments in our lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the January 1989 Elo rating list, {{at the age}} of 12, she {{was rated}} 2555, which was number 55 in the world and 35 rating points ahead of the Women's World Champion Maia Chiburdanidze. In the 6 months since the {{previous}} list, she had gained a remarkable 190 rating points. Judit's quiet and modest demeanour at the board contrasted with the intensity of her playing style. David Norwood, British GM, in recalling Judit beating him when he was an established player <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a child, described her as [...] "this cute little auburn-haired monster who crushed you". British journalist Dominic Lawson wrote about 12-year-old Judit's [...] "killer" [...] eyes and how she would stare at her opponent: [...] "The irises are so grey so dark they are almost indistinguishable from the pupils. Set against her long red hair, the effect is striking." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1872 she {{permanently}} {{retired from}} the stage with four performances of [...] "Fidalma" [...] in Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto, at the Paris Théâtre des Italiens but, in fact, she never gave up singing in private and in benefit concerts. When in 1887 the French and Italian Governments agreed upon moving the mortal remains of Rossini into the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence, Alboni, then a sixty-one-year-old lady living in seclusion, wrote to the Italian Foreign Minister, Di Robilant, proposing that the Petite Messe Solennelle, [...] "the last musical composition by Rossini", be performed in Santa Croce {{the day of the}} funeral, and [...] "demanding the honour, as an Italian and a pupil of the immortal Maestro," [...] of singing it herself in her [...] "dear and beloved homeland". Her wish, however, never came true <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> given the chance of being present at the exhumation ceremony in Paris. The Paris correspondent of the Rome newspaper Il Fanfulla wrote on the occasion: [...] "photographers snapped in the same shot the greatest performer of Cenerentola and Semiramide, and what is left of the man who wrote these masterpieces".|$|E
50|$|Bernardo Velasco and Rayanne Morais portray Prince Enrico and peasant Pietra, {{who fall}} in love in during their {{childhood}} and live a forbidden romance {{because he is the}} heir to the throne <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a commoner, deciding to fight for forbidden love, even if it costs the throne.|$|R
50|$|They all head home, {{with the}} {{children}} asking for chips. A man then pulls up {{in a car and}} is curious as to who the children are. Zoe tells him that they belong to a mate of hers <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> looking after them. He asks her if she would like to go for a drink. Zoe agrees to meet him.|$|R
6000|$|... "And miss my shopping? No, thank you. Besides, the Upolu is not {{a regular}} {{passenger}} steamer, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as liable to sail ahead of time as on time. And from what I hear about those Guvutu sybarites, {{the best time to}} shop will be in the morning. And now you'll have to excuse me, for I've got to pack." ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{definitely}} {{had a story}} for it – a specific story – that's why I {{felt that it was}} important for her and I to co-direct this particular video and song and she completely got it. She got my vision for it. She [...] got where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible and she's so creative and outstanding. And I always have a great time working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the first video that I'd ever {{stepped up to the plate}} to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit for in co-directing. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> so great and generous in teaching me some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Selfish things!' thought Alice, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{going to}} say 'Good-night' and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang {{out from under the}} {{umbrella}} and seized her by the wrist.|$|E
60|$|Harry pacified her by repeating her {{instructions}} perfectly; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{going to}} tell him more when General Vandeleur flung into the apartment, scarlet with anger, and holding a long and elaborate milliner's bill in his hand.|$|E
60|$|Jack. I {{will take}} very good care you never do. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> {{excessively}} pretty, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> only <b>just</b> eighteen.|$|R
50|$|A half Satyr {{girl who}} is another friend of Himeno. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> cool <b>and</b> composed. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> like her older brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I {{remarked to}} him, {{in the course}} of a {{conversation}} about the late Mother Superior, [...] "what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> going to do is a very fine thing,--a noble enterprise, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the sort of person to go into it, but after all I would rather see her married to the right sort of man. A woman like that owes it to society to be married." ...|$|R
60|$|Again Tink replied, 'You silly ass.' Peter {{could not}} {{understand}} why, but Wendy understood; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> slightly disappointed when {{he admitted that he}} came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I won't {{give you}} away. If she heard, she would {{write a book}} about it. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{starting}} to come up when I was downstairs. We came in together. You had better fly while there's time." ...|$|E

50|$|Keiko's anti-LaMB {{organization}} and conspiracy <b>is</b> discovered, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{put into a}} lamb suit. Due to recent developments in technology her suit is part plant possibly. She goes on a rampage and tries to destroy Eve1135, but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> immobilized by touching Griswold while she attacked him. She loses her balance and falls off the building. Eve1135 is eventually released from prison (possibly hundreds of years later) <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> Sara Integra <b>and</b> <b>she</b> kisses Griswold after they put flowers on his wife's grave.|$|R
5000|$|Sara discovers {{too late}} that Vanessa and Leandro <b>are</b> {{actually}} lovers <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a pawn in their giant scheme. While Vanessa is away with Leandro in some far away paradise spending the stolen money from her husband, Nicolas Cayetano (Mark Anthony Fernandez), Sara will become her [...] "double" [...] and experience all the punishment that is due {{for her and}} to fool everyone as if she never left. So when all the heat <b>is</b> gone <b>she</b> can still come back as if nothing ever happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>just</b> like Mrs Baggett. She always {{talks of}} women with supreme contempt. <b>And</b> yet <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as proud of herself as the queen {{when you come to}} {{contradict}} her." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{soon found}} {{their way back to}} where the bric-a-brac stand had been smashed. A woman was now in charge, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{finishing}} the cleaning away of the wreckage. Fred and Andy stood nearby watching her. Both wore a broad grin.|$|E
6000|$|While {{the major}} {{searched for the}} missing article the girls went on, and coming to the door, Amy tried to open it. The {{unwieldy}} foreign lock resisted her efforts, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> giving it an impatient little shake, when a voice said behind her,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|They stood {{so still}} that she quite forgot they were alive, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> looking round {{to see if}} the word [...] "TWEEDLE" [...] was written at the back of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked 'DUM.' ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{construction}} vehicles come to {{tear down}} the old building, and erect modern businesses in its place, Erin and her friends manage to rescue many of the treasures, including Grampa's huge book. Then they take Heaven Eyes, whom they now call Anna May, back to Whitegates, where the extraordinary child is able to heal Maureen's [...] "damaged" [...] soul. Maureen is able to finally become a true mother to the abandoned and orphaned children of Whitegates. Miraculously, January's mother appears to take him home, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as he imagined her.|$|R
500|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.

In this episode, Mulder and Scully search for the infamous killer Robert [...] "Pusher" [...] Modell (Robert Wisden)—a human {{with the ability to}} force his will onto others—after he escapes from prison. The agents soon discover that he is not their only concern; he has a sister, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as capable of mind-control as he is.|$|R
5000|$|Constance [...] "Connie" [...] Marsh Dobbs, {{the wife}} of [...] "Bob", has become as legendary in SubGenius circles as [...] "Bob" [...] himself. Although [...] "Bob" [...] has been married to other women, spirits, deities, and inanimate objects, Connie is {{described}} in the SubGenius documentary Arise! as [...] "his first, and still his primary wife." [...] Connie is the patron of SubGenius women, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> seen as a vision of true liberation for women. She refuses to submit to anyone (especially [...] "Bob"), <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as free-wheeling <b>and</b> promiscuous as her husband, although she has a more level head on her shoulders {{when it comes to}} domestic issues.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then it's my aunt, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{the same}} as a mother to me,' said Deesa, weeping more than ever. 'She has left {{eighteen}} small children entirely without bread, and it is I who must fill their little stomachs,' said Deesa, beating his head on the floor.|$|E
60|$|Nelly {{rubbed her}} eyes, and looked about her rather scared; but nothing had {{happened}} to her yet, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> going to complain that the bird had cheated her, when the sound of soft voices made her climb the rock behind her to see who was singing down there.|$|E
60|$|Miss Roberta retired quite {{early to}} her room, having been {{fatigued}} by her long drive, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{about to put}} out her light when she heard a little knock at the door.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{knitting}} that day, {{finishing a}} pair of socks for her father, who expected her {{to keep up the}} supply dutifully. <b>She</b> hated knitting, <b>and,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> at the heel part, she had to keep her eyes on her needles.|$|R
