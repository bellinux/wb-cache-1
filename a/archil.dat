25|$|Unable {{to garner}} the Russian {{support for his}} cause, Teimuraz {{concluded}} that the prospects for recovering the crown were nil and returned to Imereti to retire to a monastery in 1661, the same year when Rostom’s successor to the throne of Kartli, Vakhtang V, crossed into western Georgia to enthrone his son, <b>Archil,</b> as king of Imereti. Vakhtang V sent Teimuraz to Isfahan and the old Georgian ex-monarch was honorably received by Abbas II, but cast into prison when his grandson Heraclius returned from Russia and made a failed attempt at taking control of Kakheti. Teimuraz died in captivity at the fortress of Astarabad in 1661. His remains were transported to Georgia and interred at the Alaverdi Cathedral.|$|E

50|$|The two {{principal}} medieval Georgian chronicles - The Conversion of Kartli, and The Life of Kartli, - relate conflicting versions of <b>Archil’s</b> reign. The former story is extremely brief, but regretfully {{indicates that the}} positions of Zoroastrianism, an official Sasanid religion, was firm in Christian Iberia, a testimony to the effectively unchallenged Sasanid hegemony over the country. The other chronicle informs us of <b>Archil’s</b> successful rebellion against Iran, his victory over a punitive force and a retaliatory raid into Arran. The authenticity of this latter account has been questioned by modern scholars.|$|R
50|$|The couple's life in Russia {{was further}} marred in 1711 {{by the death}} of their last {{surviving}} son, Prince Alexander, who, a Russian artillery commander, had fallen {{in the hands of the}} victorious Swedes at Narva in 1700. On <b>Archil's</b> death in Moscow in 1713, with no surviving male children, Ketevan succeeded him as a steward of the estates granted upon the Georgian family by the Russian government, such as Vsekhsvyatskoye in the Moscow Governorate and Lyskovo in the Nizhny Novgorod Governorate. She died in Moscow on 16 April 1719 and was buried weeks later, due to a stormy flood, on 5 May 1719 at the Donskoy Monastery, alongside her husband. <b>Archil's</b> estates would pass, in 1724, to the family of his relative and yet another Georgian exile, Vakhtang VI of Kartli.|$|R
25|$|He {{used his}} rations to buy Chess Praxis by Danish {{grandmaster}} Aron Nimzowitsch, a book which Petrosian later stated {{had the greatest}} influence on him as a chess player. He also purchased The Art of Sacrifice in Chess by Rudolf Spielmann. The other player to have had an early effect on Petrosian's chess was José Raúl Capablanca. At age 12 he began training at the Tiflis Palace of Pioneers {{under the tutelage of}} <b>Archil</b> Ebralidze. Ebralidze was a supporter of Nimzowitsch and Capablanca, and his scientific approach to chess discouraged wild tactics and dubious combinations. As a result, Petrosian developed a repertoire of solid positional openings, such as the Caro–Kann Defence. After training at the Palace of Pioneers for just one year, he defeated visiting Soviet grandmaster Salo Flohr at a simultaneous exhibition.|$|E
25|$|In {{the western}} half of Georgia, ancient Colchis, which had {{remained}} under stronger Roman influence, local churches were under {{jurisdiction of the}} Patriarchate of Constantinople, and were culturally and linguistically Hellenistic. Bishops from the port cities took part in ecumenical councils, from the Council of Nicea (325) together with those from the Byzantine territories. From the 6th century, those churches, whose language remained Greek, were headed by a metropolitan in Phasis. The integration of the Black sea coastal regions into {{what came to be}} known as Georgia was a long process. A first step came with the Arab invasions of the 7th and 8th centuries, which mostly affected Kartli. Refugees, among them noblemen such as <b>Archil</b> of Kakheti, took shelter in the West, either in Abkhazia or Tao-Klarjeti, and brought there their culture. Such movements led to the progressive merge of western and eastern churches under the latter, as Byzantine power decreased and doctrinal differences disappeared. The western Church broke away from Constantinople and recognized the authority of the Catholicos of Mtskheta by the end of the 9th century. Political unification under the Bagrationi dynasty consolidated this evolution by the end of the 10th century: in a single, unified Kingdom of Georgia, there would be a unified Georgian Church.|$|E
25|$|Abkhazia, or Abasgia {{of classic}} sources, was a princedom under Byzantine authority. It lay chiefly along the Black Sea coast {{in what is}} now the northwestern part of the modern-day disputed Republic of Abkhazia and {{extended}} northward into the territory of today’s Krasnodar Krai of Russia. It had Anacopia as the capital. Abkhazia was ruled by a hereditary archon who effectively functioned as a Byzantine viceroy. The country was chiefly Christian and the city of Pityus was a seat of an archbishop directly subordinated to the Patriarch of Constantinople. Another Abasgian episcopal see was that of Soteropolis. The Arabs, pursuing the retreating Georgian princes – brothers Mir of Egrisi and <b>Archil</b> of Kartli – surged into Abkhazia in 736. Dysentery and floods, combined with a stubborn resistance offered by the archon Leon I and his Kartlian and Egrisian allies, made the invaders retreat. Leon I then married Mir’s daughter, and a successor, Leon II exploited this dynastic union to acquire Egrisi (Lazica) in the 770s. Presumably considered as a successor state of Lazica, this new polity continued to be referred to as Egrisi in some contemporary Georgian (e.g., The Vitae of the Georgian Kings by Leonti Mroveli) and Armenian (e.g., The History of Armenia by Hovannes Draskhanakertsi) chronicles.|$|E
25|$|As {{a reward}} for the {{contribution}} in struggle against the Arab occupants, the Kartlian ruler (erismtavari) <b>Archil</b> gave Hereti to the noble family of Bagrationi in the 740s–750s. After {{the death of the}} last Kartlian erismtavaris John and Juansher, the Heretian lords extended their fiefdoms and, in 787, established an independent principality (samtavro) with the capital in Shaki. The principality gained significant strength and prestige by 893 allowing Prince Hamam to be crowned the king. Alarmed by the increasing power of the Heretian kingdom, Kvirike I (892–918), the ruler of the neighbouring Kakhetian principality, allied himself with King Constantine III of Abkhazia and, in 915, campaigned against King Adarnase II Patrikios of Hereti (897–943). The allies occupied and divided the country but for a short time as Adarnase Patrikios soon reconquered what had been lost. A son and successor, Ishkhanik (943–951) ruled together with his mother Dinar, sister of Grand Magister Gurgen IV, Prince of Klarjeti (918–941). Under them, Hereti was forced to recognize the supremacy of the stronger neighbour, Principality of Deilam, ruled by the Salarid dynasty (Iranian Azerbaijan). In 950, Ishkhanik took advantage of the bitter power struggle in the Salarid State, and ceased to pay tribute effectively restoring his independence. It was during his reign, that the Heretians abandoned their Monophysite faith to convert to Georgian Orthodox Christianity.|$|E

500|$|Peace reigned in the Caucasus between Arabs and Khazars until 799, {{when the}} last major Khazar attack into Transcaucasia took place. Chroniclers again {{attribute}} this attack to a failed marriage alliance. According to Georgian sources, the khagan desired to marry the beautiful Shushan, daughter of Prince <b>Archil</b> of Kakheti (r. 736–786), and he sent his general Buljan to invade Iberia and capture her. Most of the central region of K'art'li was occupied, and Prince Juansher (r. 786–807) was taken off into captivity for a few years, but rather than be taken off captive, Shushan committed suicide and the furious khagan had Buljan executed. Arab chroniclers, on the other hand, attribute this to the plans of the Abbasid governor al-Fadl ibn Yahya (one of the famous Barmakids) to marry one of the khagans daughters, who died on her journey south, while a different story is reported [...] by al-Tabari, whereby the Khazars were invited to attack by a local Arab magnate in retaliation against the execution of his father, the governor of Derbent, by the general Sa'id ibn Salm. According to the Arab sources, the Khazars then raided {{as far as the}} Araxes, necessitating the dispatch of troops under Yazid ibn Mazyad, as the new governor of Transcaucasia, with more forces under Khazim ibn Khuzayma in reserve.|$|E

[...] On August 30, Georgian police released video footage showing dead bodies of several men in camouflage uniforms with their faces censored, and weapons recovered from the site of the clash, including a variety of automatic weapons, several anti-tank grenade launchers and at least two sniper rifles (one of them silenced), as well as communication and night vision equipment, Russian passports and copies of the Quran.|$|E
50|$|<b>Archil</b> and Elene {{had three}} children: Barbare, David, and Mariam. By an unknown concubine, <b>Archil</b> {{also had a}} natural son, Mamuka.|$|E
50|$|<b>Archil</b> was {{a son of}} Bagrat I, Prince of Mukhrani, son of Constantine II of Georgia, by {{his wife}} Elene. After Bagrat's resignation, Archil's elder brothers, Ashotan and Vakhtang, succeeded as princes of Mukhrani. <b>Archil</b> was {{actively}} involved in contemporary war and politics. During the Safavid invasion of Georgia in 1554, <b>Archil</b> joined his brothers in their exile at the court of their sister, Dedisimedi, in Samtskhe. Back to Kartli, <b>Archil</b> was allied with his cousin, King Simon I of Kartli, and perpetually challenged the Safavid control of Tbilisi, the capital of Kingdom of Kartli, frequently raiding the city's environs. In one of such forays, a Safavid force from the Tbilisi citadel assaulted and defeated <b>Archil</b> at Sapurtsle. The prince {{and his family were}} captured and sent to Iran. After Simon I himself was brought captive to the shah Tahmasp I and cast in the Alamut fortress, <b>Archil</b> and his family were imprisoned in Shiraz in 1573. Both Simon and <b>Archil</b> were released on the death of Tahmasp and returned to Kartli in 1576. <b>Archil</b> once again visited his sister in Samtskhe and died in that principality, at Atskuri, on 25 November 1582.|$|E
50|$|<b>Archil</b> was a {{scion of}} the former royal dynasty of Iberia (Kartli), the Chosroid dynasty and a son of Prince Stephen of Kakheti (r. 685-736). His rule coincided with the Arab conquests in Caucasia. The 735-737 {{expedition}} by Marwan ibn Muhammad forced <b>Archil</b> and his brother Mirian to flee to the west through Egrisi into Abasgia where they joined the local dynast Leon I {{in the defense of}} Anacopia against the invading Arabs. Returning to Kakheti, <b>Archil</b> launched a program of reconstruction and Christianization of his mountainous pagan subjects. The Georgian texts also relate the rise of the Georgian Bagratids, a future royal dynasty, during the time of <b>Archil.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Archil</b> {{was the son}} of Vakhtang V Shahnawaz of Kartli, who, {{under the}} Persian protection, {{attempted}} to reunify a fragmented Kingdom of Georgia under his crown. Having brought the neighboring eastern kingdom of Kakheti under his control, Vakhtang marched into western Georgia in 1661, deposed King Bagrat V of Imereti, and crowned his fourteen-year-old son <b>Archil</b> king at Kutaisi, capital of Imereti. The Ottoman government strongly objected to what it considered a Persian-inspired incursion into the Turkish zone of influence. A Turkish ultimatum was soon received in Isfahan, threatening a declaration of war if Shahnavaz maintained his son on the throne of western Georgia. Shahnavaz was forced to recall <b>Archil</b> from Kutaisi in 1663 and to restore the rightful king, Bagrat. Instead, Vakhtang installed <b>Archil</b> as king of Kakheti in 1664. To gain the shah's consent, <b>Archil</b> was prevailed upon, much against his will, to become a nominal convert to Islam, assuming the title of Shah-Nazar-Khan. In 1664, <b>Archil</b> defeated an attempt by the rival Kakhetian prince and his brother-in-law, Erekle, to regain his father's crown, and achieved a degree of stability and prosperity in Kakheti.|$|E
50|$|Prince <b>Archil</b> was {{a younger}} son of King Alexander V of Imereti by his wife, Tamar Abashidze {{and a brother}} of King Solomon I of Imereti. From 1769 to 1770, he {{commanded}} an Imeretian force against the Mingrelians around Khoni and, in July 1775, raided Atskuri in the Pashalik of Akhaltsikhe. In 1772 <b>Archil</b> married Princess Elene of Georgia, a daughter of King Heraclius II of Georgia. The marriage was political, forced upon Elene, who {{was in love with}} Prince Zakaria Andronikashvili. <b>Archil</b> died at Kaskhi in 1775.|$|E
5000|$|Around 786, eastern Georgia was {{subjected}} to another Arab invasion, this time led by Khuzayma b. Khazim, who had been reconfirmed as viceroy of Arab-controlled Caucasia (Armīniya) by the caliph al-Hadi (r. 785-786). <b>Archil,</b> in an untenable situation, pleaded for peace. Khuzayma b. Khazim promised <b>Archil</b> gifts in return for his acceptance of Islam, but the prince refused and was condemned to prison. Then the viceroy was informed of <b>Archil</b> being a descendant of the Chosroid kings who allegedly knew {{the location of a}} treasure hidden by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius while evacuating Caucasia in the 620s. Ibn Khazim intensified his effort to win <b>Archil</b> over to Islam and promised to make him [...] "general" [...] and [...] "king", but when realized that his efforts were in vain, he had the prince beheaded.|$|E
50|$|After {{her divorce}} from Bagrat, Ketevan {{was married to}} Prince Gogoberidze. In 1661, Darejan, beleaguered by enemies from all sides, appealed to Vakhtang V of Kartli for help, {{offering}} her niece Ketevan for Vakhtang V's son <b>Archil,</b> and her throne to Vakhtang himself. The deal did not materialize and Darejan, her husband Vakhtang, and Ketevn found themselves in captivity of the Ottoman pasha of Akhaltsikhe in Oltu. When in 1663 <b>Archil,</b> son of Vakhtang V, was deposed in Imereti and sent to Persia for confirmation as king of Kakheti, he decided to marry Ketevan in order to assert his claim to Imereti. Vakhtang V paid 20,000 silver kuruş to ransom Ketevan from the pasha. <b>Archil,</b> then king of Kakheti, wed Ketavan in Tbilisi on 22 March 1668. In 1675, <b>Archil,</b> {{at odds with the}} Persian grand vizier Shaykh' Ali Khan, left Kakheti and launched a series of attempts to establish himself in Imereti. By 1699, <b>Archil</b> gave up all hopes of reclaiming Imereti and finally settled down in Russia, whose government had first granted him and his family asylum in 1686.|$|E
