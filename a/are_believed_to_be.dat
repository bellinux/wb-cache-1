5|$|Prions are {{infectious}} agents composed {{entirely of}} a protein material that can fold in multiple, structurally abstract ways, {{at least one}} of which is transmissible to other prion proteins, leading to disease {{in a manner that is}} epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection. Prions composed of the prion protein (PrP) <b>are</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) among other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Sea turtles are {{protected}} by law in Costa Rica, but poaching remains common.

5|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} traditionally {{points to}} the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils, which <b>are</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis, induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). It is also known that Aβ selectively builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by neurons.|$|E
