40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effects of Integrated Instructional Model on Students achievement in <b>Advanced</b> Financial <b>Accounting</b> in Nigerian Universities. Poor performance of students in <b>advanced</b> financial <b>accounting</b> informed the study. The study employed a non-equivalent control group quasi-experimental design. The sample for the study comprised of five hundred and thirty seven (537) final year students drawn from four universities in the South-East Geopolitical Zone of Nigeria. Three research questions and three null hypotheses tested at 0. 05 level of significance guided the study. Data on students’ achievement in <b>advanced</b> financial <b>accounting</b> were collected using accounting achievement test. Data were analysed using mean, standard deviation and analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA). Result revealed that the Integrated Instructional Model (IIM) is superior to the conventional teaching method in enhancing achievement in <b>advanced</b> financial <b>accounting.</b> It also revealed that IIM has no significant differential effect on the mean achievement scores {{of males and females}} in <b>advanced</b> financial <b>accounting.</b> The test of interaction revealed that gender had no significant interaction with teaching methods on achievement in <b>advanced</b> financial <b>accounting.</b> Based on the findings, it was recommended that the IIM should be incorporated in financial accounting curriculum in order to enhance students’ achievement...|$|R

40|$|The major {{purposes}} of this study were twofold: (1) to determine the relationship between certain contextual variables of firm characteristics and the application of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> techniques, and (2) to identify how firm performance is affected by contextual variables and the application of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> techniques. Eight hypotheses were formulated to accomplish the study purpose. A questionnaire was developed to gather data. The sampling frame of the population was the Top 500 listed Australian companies. A pilot study of 100 questionnaires were sent to the respondents. Revised questionnaires were mailed to all Top 500 Australian companies. Two types of statistical analysis were adopted to test the hypotheses. Hypothesis one was tested using multiple logistic regression model. Hypotheses two through eight were tested using nonparametric statistical test, Mann-Whitney U test. The study found that the extent of use of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> techniques and firm size significantly reduce the probability the firm will perform above average performance of the sample firm. But the interaction variables provide evidence that any separation of size and capital intensity effect from the extent of the use of management accounting techniques is problematic. Looking at the interaction variables the results show that large firms that applied <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> techniques extensively significantly increase the probability the firm will perform above average performance of the sample firms. It is also true for high capital intensive firms that applied <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> techniques extensively. The study also observed that contextual variables of firm characteristics influenced the application of management accounting techniques. Contextual variables age, type of industry, capital intensity, and leverage have significant influenced on the application of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> techniques type I, II and HI. Firm size has significant influence on the application of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> techniques type I and III. Firm risk also only has significant influence on the application of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> techniques type II and DDL But in terms of ownership, there is no difference between public listed domestic firms and public listed foreign firms in applying management accounting techniques...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the gap between}} accounting educators and the profession. Research indicates accounting graduates are underprepared for this challenging career. The issue stems from accounting educators who only lecture and accounting students who memorize the information provided in these lectures. Accounting students need opportunities to build their professional skills through learning activities that mimic real-world situations. This qualitative study analyzes the perspectives of <b>advanced</b> <b>accounting</b> students before and after computer-assisted instruction {{to determine if they}} believe their critical thinking, communication and problem solving skills have improved. I conducted an analysis using an auditing simulation, semi-structured interviews before and after computer use, and reflective journals provided by <b>advanced</b> <b>accounting</b> students attending Central North Carolina universities. The auditing simulation introduced in the study created the opportunity for students to practice their knowledge of accounting and enhance their professional skills. The findings suggested students made a connection between concepts learned in course work and situations found in the accounting profession. The simulation built confidence in students and motivated them to learn more about enhancing skills necessary for the accounting profession. The evidence recommends accounting educators to use simulations as a supplemental learning tool in preparing accounting students for the profession. This study allows colleges...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} has investigated the current application of management accounting practices in Saudi and non-Saudi manufacturing firms that {{operate in the}} Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and {{the internal and external}} contingent aspects that prompted these firms to adopt or not to adopt <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> practices. In order to achieve the aforementioned aims, a mixed methodology was used, with a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews being used as instruments for collecting the required data. Three types of statistical analysis were used (descriptive, bivariate and multivariate) to analyse the data obtained from the returned questionnaires (158 out of 260). Analysis of the descriptive parts of the questionnaires has shown that Saudi and non-Saudi manufacturing firms are still loyal to their traditional management accounting practices, such as the extensive use of one accounting system for several purposes, traditional allocation methods, traditional decision-making tools, standard costing systems, traditional budgeting, and traditional financial measures. At the same time, the analysis has shown that there is slow move toward adopting new trends in management accounting among these firms, mainly due to satisfaction with traditional management accounting practices and a lack of relevant skill regarding the <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> practices. The bivariate results have shown that adoption of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> practices by Saudi and non-Saudi manufacturing firms is subject to certain contingent aspects, such as perceived environmental uncertainty, competition, size and firm strategy, but not product range or number. The same statistical test has shown that there is a partial relationship between the extent of adoption of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> practices, culture, and advanced manufacturing technologies. The results of the multivariate test have shown that adoption of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> practices by Saudi and non-Saudi manufacturing firms is related to only three predictors, which are size, number of products, and prospector strategy. Theoretical analysis of the interviews has revealed that adoption of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> practices is due to perceived environmental uncertainty, price and quality competition, size, number of products, culture, and firm strategy, but not advanced manufacturing technology. Also, analysis of the interviews has confirmed the descriptive finding regarding the heavy use of traditional management accounting practices. The research concludes by emphasising that the case of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia follows the mainstream in regards to the limited acceptance of <b>advanced</b> management <b>accounting</b> practices and the fact that adoption of these practices is due to certain internal and external contingent drivers...|$|R
