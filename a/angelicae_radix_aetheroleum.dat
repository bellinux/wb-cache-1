40|$|Objectives: <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> {{has been}} known {{traditional}} medicine with antimicrobial activities {{and it has been}} widely used for treatment of blood and inflammatory diseases. In the present study, some studies examined anti-inflammation effects of <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> but they usually were performed by ethanol extracted <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> pharmacopuncture. So We investigated the inhibitory effects of <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> pharmacopuncture by hot water and ethanol extract on Nitric oxide(NO) and Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) production in lipopolysaccharide(LPS) induced macrophage cell. Methods: <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> was extracted by ethanol and hot water. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. To evaluate anti-inflammation effects of <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> pharmacopuncture, we examined NO and PGE 2 production in LPS induced macrophages. The concentrations of NO and PGE 2 were measured by Griess assay and Enzyme Immuno-Assay. Results: 1) The MTT assay demonstrated that cytotoxic effect of <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> pharmacopuncture by hot water extract and ethanol extract in RAW 264. 7 macrophage cells were not appeared. 2) <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> pharmacopuncture by ethanol extract and hot water extract inhibited NO production in LPS induced macrophages significantly. 3) <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> pharmacopuncture by ethanol extract tended to inhibiting PGE 2 production in LPS induced macrophages. And <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> pharmacopuncture by hot water extract inhibited LPS induced production of PGE 2 in RAW 264. 7 macrophage cells significantly. Conclusions: This study suggests that <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> pharmacopuncture may have an anti-inflammatory property through the inhibition of NO and PGE 2 production in LPS induced macrophages.

In Danggui Buxue Tang, the complete functions of Astragali Radix require the assistance of <b>Angelicae</b> Sinensis <b>Radix,</b> and both herbs have to work harmoniously in order to achieve the maximal therapeutic purposes. In order to analyze the relationship of the two herbs, the role of ferulic acid, a major chemical within <b>Angelicae</b> Sinensis <b>Radix,</b> in chemical and biological properties of Astragali Radix was determined. Using ferulic acid in the extraction of Astragali Radix, the amounts of astragaloside IV, calycosin, and formononetin were increased in the final extract; however, the Astragali Radix polysaccharide showed a minor increase. The chemical-enriched Astragali Radix extract showed robust induction in osteogenic and estrogenic activities in cultured osteosarcoma MG- 63 and breast MCF- 7 cells. However, ferulic acid itself did not show such biological responses. The current results strongly suggest that Angelicae Sinensis Radix-derived ferulic acid is a positive regulator for Danggui Buxue Tang, which enhanced the solubilities of active ingredients derived from Astragali Radix, and which therefore increased the biological efficacies of Danggui Buxue Tang. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York...|$|R

40|$|Background: Herbal {{preparations}} like STW 5 (Iberogast(R)) {{are widely}} used drugs {{in the treatment of}} dyspepsia and motility-related disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. STW 5 is a phytotherapeutic agent consisting of a fixed mixture of 9 individual plant extracts. The electrophysiological mechanisms of action of STW 5 remain obscure. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether herbal extracts influence electrophysiological parameters of the small intestine. For this purpose, the resting membrane potential (RMP) and the slow wave rhythmicity of smooth muscle cells of mouse small intestine were observed. Methods: Intracellular recordings of smooth muscle cells of the circular muscle layer of mouse small intestine were performed using standard microelectrode techniques. After dissection of the mucosa, the small intestine was placed in an organ bath and a microelectrode was applied on a circular smooth muscle cell. The RMP and the amplitude of slow waves were measured in millivolts. Results: The RMP of smooth muscle cells was - 59 +/- 1. 3 mV. This RMP was significantly depolarized by STW 5 (9. 6 +/- 1. 6 mV); the depolarizing effects can be mainly attributed to the constituents of matricariae flos, <b>angelicae</b> <b>radix</b> and chelidonii herba. The basal frequency of small intestinal slow waves was 39. 5 +/- 1. 4 min(- 1) and the amplitude was 23. 1 +/- 0. 9 mV. STW 5 significantly reduced the amplitude and frequency of the slow waves (11. 7 +/- 0. 8 mV; 33. 5 +/- 3. 4 min(- 1)). This effect on slow waves represents the sum of the effects of the 9 phytoextracts. Whereas <b>angelicae</b> <b>radix</b> and matricariae flos completely blocked slow wave activity, Iberis amara increased the frequency and amplitude, chelidonii herba reduced the frequency and amplitude of the slow waves, mentae piperitae folium reduced the frequency and left amplitude unchanged and liquiritae radix, carvi fructus and melissae folium had no effects. Conclusion: Herbal extracts cause changes in smooth muscle RMP and slow wave rhythmicity, up to reversible abolition, by blockade of large conductance Ca 2 + channels and other not yet identified mechanisms. In herbal preparations like STW 5 these effects add up to a total effect and this study indicates that herbal preparations which {{are widely used}} in dyspepsia and motility-related disorders have characteristic, reproducible, reversible effects on small intestinal electrophysiology.

In this study, we explored the potential mechanism of DGLHD against insulin resistance and fatty liver in vivo and in vitro. Our data revealed that DGLHD normalized glucose and insulin level, increased the expression of adiponectin, diminished fat accumulation and lipogenesis, and promoted glucose uptake. Metabolomic analysis also demonstrated that DGLHD decreased isoleucine, adenosine, and cholesterol, increased glutamine levels in liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of ob/ob mice. Importantly, DGLHD promoted the shift of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines, suppressed T lymphocytes proliferation, and enhanced regulatory T cells (Tregs) differentiation. DGLHD also inhibited dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, attenuated DCs-stimulated T cells proliferation and secretion of IL- 12 p 70 cytokine from DCs, and promoted the interaction of DCs with Tregs. Further studies indicated that the changed PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway and elevated PPAR-γ expression were not only observed with the ameliorated glucose and lipid metabolism in adipocytes and hepatocytes, but also exhibited in DCs and T cells by DGLHD. Collectively, our results suggest that DGLHD exerts anti-insulin resistant and antisteatotic effects by improving abnormal immune and metabolic homeostasis.

The present study tested 17 Chinese medicinal herbs were tested for their potential anti-obesity effects. Methods: The herbs were evaluated in terms of their abilities to stimulate the transcription of Apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA-IV) in cultured Caco- 2 /TC 7 enterocytes. The herbs that showed stimulating effects on ApoA-IV transcription were further evaluated in terms of their abilities to reduce the formation of triglyceride in differentiated 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Results: ApoA-IV transcription was stimulated by Rhizoma Alismatis and <b>Radix</b> <b>Angelica</b> Sinensis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cultured Caco- 2 /TC 7 cells. Moreover, these two herbs reduced the amount of triglyceride in differentiated 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Conclusion: The results suggest that Rhizoma Alistmatis and <b>Radix</b> <b>Angelica</b> Sinensis may have potential anti-obesity effects as they stimulate ApoA-IV transcription and reduce triglyceride formation. © 2009 Guo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{cisplatin}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin alone does not achieve a satisfactory therapeutic outcome. Also cisplatin accumulation shows toxicity to normal tissues. In this study, we examined the possibility of HemoHIM both to enhance anticancer effect with cisplatin and to reduce the side effects of cisplatin in melanoma-bearing mice. Methods HemoHIM was prepared by adding the ethanol-insoluble fraction to the total water extract of a mixture of 3 edible herbs, <b>Angelica</b> <b>Radix,</b> Cnidium Rhizoma and Paeonia Radix. Anticancer effects of HemoHIM with cisplatin were evaluated in melanoma-bearing mice. We used a Cr 51 -release assay to measure the activity of NK/Tc cell and ELISA to evaluate the production of cytokines. Results In melanoma-bearing mice, cisplatin (4 mg/kg B. W.) reduced the size and weight of the solid tumors, and HemoHIM supplementation with cisplatin enhanced the decrease of both the tumor size (p in vitro, and did not disturb the effects of cisplatin in vitro. However HemoHIM administration enhanced both NK cell and Tc cell activity in mice. Interestingly, HemoHIM increased the proportion of NK cells in the spleen. In melanoma-bearing mice treated with cisplatin, HemoHIM administration also increased the activity of NK cells and Tc cells and the IL- 2 and IFN-γ secretion from splenocytes, which seemed to contribute to the enhanced efficacy of cisplatin by HemoHIM. Also, HemoHIM reduced nephrotoxicity as seen by tubular cell of kidney destruction. Conclusion HemoHIM may be a beneficial supplement during cisplatin chemotherapy for enhancing the anti-tumor efficacy and reducing the toxicity of cisplatin. </p...|$|R
40|$|This review {{results from}} a PubMed-based data-mining of {{scientific}} literature concerning typical tonic herbs and formulas of Chinese herbal medicine and their application principle under the theory of CM. We have focused on two aspects of tonic activity: body tonification against qi气-, blood血-, yin阴- and yang阳-deficiency, respectively, and organ (Zang 脏and Fu腑) tonification against heart-, liver-, spleen/stomach-, lung-, and kidney-deficiency, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Dozens of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) {{formulas}} {{have been}} used for promotion of "blood production" for centuries, and we are interested in developing novel thrombopoietic medicines from these TCMs. Our previous studies have demonstrated the hematopoietic effects of DangGui BuXue Tong (DBT), a formula composed of <b>Radix</b> <b>Angelicae</b> Sinensis and <b>Radix</b> Astragali in animal and cellular models. As a step further to identify and characterize the active chemical components of DBT, we tested the hematopoietic and particularly, thrombopoietic effects of polysaccharide-enriched fractions from the root of <b>Radix</b> <b>Angelicae</b> Sinensis (APS) in this study. Methods A myelosuppression mouse model was treated with APS (10 mg/kg/day). Peripheral blood cells from APS, thrombopoietin and vehicle-treated samples were then counted at different time-points. Using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assays, we determined the effects of APS on the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and megakaryocytic lineages. Using a megakaryocytic cell line M- 07 e as model, we analyzed the cellular apoptosis progression with and without APS treatment by Annexin V, Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Caspase 3 assays. Last, the anti-apoptotic effect of APS on cells treated with Ly 294002, a Phosphatidylinositol 3 -Kinse inhibitor (PI 3 K) was also tested. Results In animal models, APS significantly enhanced not only the recovery of platelets, other blood cells and their progenitor cells, but also the formation of Colony Forming Unit (CFU). In M- 07 e cells, we observed the anti-apoptotic effect of APS. Treatment by Ly 294002 alone increased the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. However, addition of APS to Ly 294002 -treated cells significantly reduced the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. Conclusions APS promotes hematopoiesis and thrombopoiesis in the mouse model. This effect likely resulted from the anti-apoptosis activity of APS and is likely to involve the PI 3 K/AKT pathway. </p...|$|R
40|$|Yokukansan (YKS) is a {{traditional}} Japanese herbal medicine called kampo medicine in Japan. Its extract comprises seven crude drugs: Atractylodis lanceae rhizoma, Poria, Cnidii rhizoma, Uncariae uncis cum ramulus, <b>Angelicae</b> <b>radix,</b> Bupleuri radix, and Glycyrrhizae radix. YKS is used to treat neurosis, insomnia, as well as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. To confirm the exposure and pharmacokinetics of the active components of YKS in healthy volunteers. A randomized, open-label, 3 -arm, 3 -period, crossover trial was conducted on 21 healthy Japanese volunteers at the Kochi Medical University between May 2012 and November 2012. Single oral administration of YKS (2. 5 g, 5. 0 g, or 7. 5 g/day) during each period. Plasma concentrations of three active compounds in YKS, namely 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), geissoschizine methyl ether (GM), and hirsuteine (HTE). The mean maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of GM and HTE increased dose-dependently (ranges: 0. 650 - 1. 98 ng/mL and 0. 138 - 0. 450 ng/mL, respectively). The times to maximum plasma concentration after drug administration (tmax) were 0. 500 h for GM and 0. 975 - 1. 00 h for HTE. The apparent elimination half-lives (t 1 / 2) were 1. 72 - 1. 95 h for GM and 2. 47 - 3. 03 h for HTE. These data indicate the rapid absorption and elimination of GM and HTE. On the other hand, the Cmax, tmax, and t 1 / 2 of GA were 57. 7 - 108 ng/mL, 8. 00 - 8. 01 h, and 9. 39 - 12. 3 h, respectively. We demonstrated that pharmacologically active components of YKS are detected in humans. Further, we determined the pharmacokinetics of GM, HTE, and GA. This information will be useful to elucidate the pharmacological effects of YKS. Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center JAPIC CTI- 121811...|$|R
40|$|Background/objectives: In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) drug {{treatment}} usually is given as prescription including multiple drugs. The prescription is highly individualized according to specific configurations of TCM syndromes. The analysis {{is to provide}} an overview of frequently or rarely used combinations of single drugs in a German TCM hospital, and how to compare such patterns in two clinical patient subgroups. Methods: Based on a sample of 2, 129 in-patients (71 % female, age 53. 5 ± 14. 3 yrs) of the TCM hospital Bad Kötzting, Germany, the relative frequencies of 221 single drugs prescribed {{at the beginning of the}} treatment were analysed. Patients who fulfilled the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) were compared with those patients who did not. Univariate and multivariate statistical models like logistic regression, factor and cluster analyses were applied. Results: Astragali radix was identified as the most frequently prescribed single drug in 47. 1 % of the patients. One prescription comprised 12 single drugs, on average. The frequency of use differed mostly in patients with or without MetS with respect to Chaenomelis fructus and Spatholobi caulisor (more frequent in MetS), and Bupleuri radix and Poria (less frequent in MetS). <b>Angelicae</b> pubescentis <b>radix</b> was prescribed more often in MetS while for <b>Angelicae</b> sinensis <b>radix</b> it was the opposite. Factor analysis indicated that some combinations of drugs exist which could be empirically confirmed in a subgroup analysis (two clusters of patients) with however, limited specificity regarding MetS. Conclusions: Use of multivariate analyses is essential when patterns of single drugs in TCM are to be explored. The results provide indications for different prescriptions in patients with MetS compared to those without.

40|$|Objectives：This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the collagen metabolism and tyrosinase activity of <b>Angelicae</b> Gigantis <b>Radix</b> extracts (AGR). Methods：The effect of AGR on type I procollagen production and collagenase activity in human normal fibroblasts HS 68 after UVB (312 nm) irradiation was measured by ELISA method. The tyrosinase activity after treatment of AGR was measured. Results：Type I procollagen production was recovered by AGR in UVB damaged HS 68 cells. The increased collagenase activity after UVB damage was significantly recovered by AGR and the tyrosinase activity was significantly reduced. However, the L-DOPA oxidation was not changed. Conclusion：AGR showed the anti-wrinkle effects and whitening effects in vitro. These results suggest that AGR may have potential as an anti-aging ingredient in cosmetic herbs.

40|$|A {{derivative}} formula, DGBX, {{which is}} composed of three herbs (<b>Radix</b> astragali, <b>Radix</b> <b>Angelicae</b> sinensis, and Coptis chinensis Franch), is derived from a famous Chinese herbal formula, Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT) (Radix astragali and <b>Radix</b> <b>Angelicae</b> sinensis). We aimed to investigate the effects of DGBX on the regulation of the balance between proliferation and apoptosis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) due to the aberrant immune response in a mouse model of aplastic anemia (AA). Cyclosporine (CsA), an immunosuppressor, {{was used as the}} positive control. Our results indicated that DGBX could downregulate the production of IFNγ in bone marrow cells by interfering with the binding between SLAM and SAP and the expressions of Fyn and T-bet. This herbal formula can also inhibit the activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis, interferon regulatory factor- 1 -induced JAK/Stat, and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 signaling pathways and thereby induce proliferation and attenuate apoptosis of HSCs. In conclusion, DGBX can relieve the immune-mediated destruction of HSCs, repair hematopoietic failure, and recover the hematopoietic function of HSCs in hematogenesis. Therefore, DGBX can be used in traditional medicine against AA as a complementary and alternative immunosuppressive therapeutic formula...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} Qiguiyishen decoction (QGYS) on the severity of nephropathy. MethodsTwenty-four rats were randomly divided into four groups (I, II, III, IV) according to the random number table. Group I as control group did not establish nephropathy model. Groups II, III, and IV were intravenously administered Adriamycin (7. 5 mg/kg) through the tail vein to establish nephropathy model. QGYS was prepared with the extracts of Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici), Danggui (<b>Radix</b> <b>Angelicae</b> Sinensis), Niuxi (<b>Radix</b> Achyranthis Bidentatae), and Chuanxiong (Rhizoma Chuanxiong). Group IV was administered QGYS (2 mL · kg− 1 · d− 1), group III was administered benazepril (10 mL · kg− 1 · d− 1), and group I, II was administered water (2 mL · kg− 1 · d− 1) once daily for eight weeks. ResultsQGYS reduced the excretion of urinary protein and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and alleviated the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in renal tissue. Additionally, QGYS effectively regulated the levels of transforming growth factor, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase, and matrix metalloproteinases in the kidney of the rats. ConclusionQGYS may reduce the accumulation of ECM in the kidneys of rats with Adriamycin-induced nephropathy...|$|R
