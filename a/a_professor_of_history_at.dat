Ike Clanton's account of the game (the only one that exists) gives the participants as John Behan, Virgil Earp, Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, and a fifth man Ike did not recognize, while Barra wrote that Holliday had attended the game.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, a Canadian {{teacher and}} writer Florence Deeks unsuccessfully sued Wells for {{infringement}} of copyright and breach of trust, claiming {{that much of}} The Outline of History had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript, The Web of the World's Romance, which had spent nearly nine months {{in the hands of}} Wells's Canadian publisher, Macmillan Canada. However, it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in Toronto in the safekeeping of Macmillan, and that Wells did not even know it existed, let alone having seen it. The court found no proof of copying, and decided the similarities were {{due to the fact that}} the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources. In 2000, A. B. McKillop, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>at</b> Carleton University, produced a book on the case, The Spinster & The Prophet: Florence Deeks, H. G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past. According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author, and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case. In 2004, Denis N. Magnusson, Professor Emeritus of the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Ontario, published an article on Deeks v. Wells. This re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book. While having some sympathy for Deeks, he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers, she received a fair trial, adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004).|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, longstanding {{cultural}} and historical ties have, in more modern times, resulted in the Special Relationship, the historically close political, diplomatic, and military co-operation between the United Kingdom and United States. Linda Colley, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>at</b> Princeton University and specialist in Britishness, suggested that because of their colonial influence on the United States, the British find Americans a [...] "mysterious and paradoxical people, physically distant but culturally close, engagingly similar yet irritatingly different".|$|E

500|$|Modern {{opinions}} in Indonesia {{tend to be}} laudatory. Sardiman, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>at</b> Yogyakarta State University, writes that Sudirman was as lively a speaker as Sukarno, who {{was known for his}} fiery speeches, and a devoted, incorruptible leader. The Indonesian historian and former Minister of Education and Culture Nugroho Notosusanto described Sudirman as [...] "his only idol", citing the general's guerrilla period as the origin of the army's esprit de corps. The general's guerrilla campaign is emphasised in biographies of him because, during that period, the army had a greater role than the exiled political leadership; beginning in the 1970s, all military cadets had to retrace the [...] long route prior to graduation, a [...] "pilgrimage" [...] meant to instill a sense of struggle. Sudirman's grave is also a pilgrimage destination, both for the military and general public. According to Katharine McGregor of the University of Melbourne, the Indonesian military has elevated Sudirman to a saint-like status.|$|E
500|$|Ziad J. Asali, who {{considers}} Zionism [...] "the heir—albeit illegitimate—of the Crusader movement," [...] goes further and writes that Prawer [...] "recognized {{the extent of}} the similarity in the individual and social experience of Crusaders and Zionists. Rather than studying the comparison and denying its validity, he chose to study the Crusader's experience {{as if it were a}} historical model which could be completely analyzed and dissected in order to benefit from its experience and avoid its mistakes." [...] To Zionist author Yoram Hazony, however, it is exactly because of Prawer's readiness to draw the analogy that he considers him a subverter of Zionism and a progenitor of post-Zionist thought. David Ohana, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>at</b> Ben Gurion University who rejects the Zionist-Crusader analogy, writes that the subject has now become a litmus test for clarifying one's views on Zionism, with post-Zionists freely making the analogy and sympathizers with the Zionist viewpoint rejecting it.|$|E
500|$|However, Lok-Ham Chan, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>at</b> the University of Washington, {{writes that}} Changchub Gyaltsen's aims were to {{recreate}} the old Tibetan Kingdom that existed during the Chinese Tang dynasty, to build [...] "nationalist sentiment" [...] amongst Tibetans, and to [...] "remove all traces of Mongol suzerainty." [...] Georges Dreyfus, a professor of religion at Williams College, writes that it was Changchub Gyaltsen who adopted the old administrative system of Songtsän Gampo (c. 605–649)—the first leader of the Tibetan Empire to establish Tibet as a strong power—by reinstating its legal code of punishments and administrative units. For example, instead of the 13 governorships established by the Mongol Sakya viceroy, Changchub Gyaltsen divided Central Tibet into districts (dzong) with district heads (dzong dpon) who had to conform to old rituals and wear clothing styles of old Imperial Tibet. Van Praag asserts that Changchub Gyaltsen's ambitions were to [...] "restore to Tibet the glories of its Imperial Age" [...] by reinstating secular administration, promoting [...] "national culture and traditions," [...] and installing a law code that survived into the 20th century.|$|E

However, he felt that Falun Gong spokespersons [...] "overplayed their hand" [...] with the concentration camp allegations, potentially losing credibility {{in the eyes of}} neutral observers, despite the real persecution they were suffering. A Congressional Research Service report by Thomas Lum said that the report relies on logical inferences and telephone call transcripts which, he suggested, may not be credible. Glen McGregor of the Ottawa Citizen was skeptical about the logistical plausibility of the allegations after visiting Sujiatun at the invitation of the Chinese Medical Association. He said that, depending on who you believe, [...] "the Kilgour–Matas report is either compelling evidence that proves the claims about Falun Gong ... or a collection of conjecture and inductive reasoning that fails to support its own conclusions".|$|E
