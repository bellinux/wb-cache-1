40|$|AbstractCalcium looping (CaL) {{systems have}} been {{proposed}} as a lower-cost method of CO 2 capture for power plants. This paper {{presents the results of}} a techno-economic assessment of <b>a</b> <b>CaL</b> system <b>for</b> post-combustion CO 2 capture at a pulverized coal (PC) power plant. Comparisons are made with a conventional MEA-based CO 2 capture process in terms of performance and cost. Considering the significant quantities of solid flows required <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>CaL</b> process, the applicability and operational feasibility of <b>a</b> <b>CaL</b> system <b>for</b> new or existing PC power plants also is studied. It was found that though the CaL system has better performance than the MEA-based CO 2 capture process, the capital cost of the power plant and the cost of electricity is much higher than when the MEA-based system is used...|$|R
