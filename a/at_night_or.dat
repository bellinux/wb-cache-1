5|$|Asthma is {{a common}} {{long-term}} inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur {{a few times a}} day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> with exercise.|$|E
5|$|Standard US {{tank and}} armored {{infantry}} battalions had a mortar platoon equipped with either M21s or the older M4 MMCs. The M21 was used mainly to illuminate targets <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> provide indirect fire {{support to the}} infantry. The usage was uncommon because the White Motor Company was only able to produce 110 M21s in 1944.|$|E
5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> during bad weather.|$|E

5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|Lynching was {{a terrifying}} and {{relatively}} uncommon spectacle. It could involve victims being hanged furtively by a mob <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>or</b> {{in front of}} hundreds or even thousands of witnesses during the day. An audience of 10,000, including the mayor and chief of police, {{was said to have}} attended the lynching of Jesse Washington in Waco, Texas, in 1916. As well as being hanged, victims were sometimes burned alive and tortured, and body parts were removed and kept as souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie {{closer to the}} water. <b>At</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles up the Columbia River. In 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and {{half a mile from}} the San Joaquin River.|$|E

5|$|Operation Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project in aerial warfare, initiated in 1966 by the United States Air Force {{to increase the}} ability to accurately strike <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> in adverse weather. During the 1960s the United States military worked hard to interdict the movement of men and materiel along the Ho Chi Minh trail. The North Vietnamese were experts {{in the use of}} weather and darkness to conceal their movement, and understanding the superiority of American air power put their skills immediately to good use. US forces seeking to impede the steady flow of supplies attempted to locate largely static targets during the day with poor results.|$|E
5|$|The F-16A/B was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Westinghouse AN/APG-66 fire-control radar. Its slotted planar array antenna {{was designed to be}} compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose. In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-clutter environment, and in look-down/shoot-down employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments. It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful signal processing, higher output power, improved reliability and increased range in cluttered or jamming environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not {{convinced}} when {{the class was}} being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but {{it is probable that}} firing them to port would have damaged the flight deck. They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.|$|E

50|$|Spawning occurs <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>at</b> <b>or</b> {{near the}} water's surface. Hawkfishes are pelagic spawners; they release many tiny buoyant eggs which drift with the ocean {{currents}} until hatching. Hatching {{is thought to}} happen after about three weeks; the distance travelled in this time may explain their exceptionally wide distribution. They have not been successfully bred in the aquarium, {{with the exception of}} the longnose hawkfish.|$|R

5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common sharks inhabiting the reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the other two being the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). The habitat {{preferences}} of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark. The whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations of its body, and unlike other requiem sharks can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> during slack tide, and spends much of the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.|$|E
5|$|The prince found {{fulfillment}} {{in activities}} that required physical skills, {{rather than in the}} classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent farrier. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a frock coat and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.|$|E

30|$|N. Reed Dunnick of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) {{stated that}} the field of {{radiology}} has expanded dramatically and no-one can master everything. Even “general radiologists” now restrict their practice domains to some extent. Furthermore, the subspecialties themselves are often further subdivided, such as neuroradiology into, for example, brain, head and neck spine, paediatrics and interventional neuroradiology. Electronic communication enables referring physicians to refer patients directly to subspecialty radiologists. General radiologists are needed in small and rural places, over nights and weekends, but nevertheless, the question arises whether a general radiologist could do neuroimaging more effectively than a non-radiology neuroscientist, and whether there are actually two levels of care, e.g. <b>at</b> <b>nights</b> <b>or</b> weekends.|$|R
