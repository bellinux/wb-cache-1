5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> other factories of death? How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers {{end up in the}} furnaces?...|$|E
25|$|Gregory is {{commonly}} credited with founding the medieval papacy <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> attribute {{the beginning of}} medieval spirituality to him.|$|E

50|$|The {{institute}} published <b>so</b> <b>many</b> monographs <b>and</b> hosted <b>so</b> <b>many</b> lectures <b>and</b> seminars {{that only}} a small sample of notable contributors are listed here.|$|R
25|$|As in the {{examples}} of ardeo 'heron' and abio 'fir', the names of most plants and animals are based on their binomial nomenclature, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> are Latin or Greek as well.|$|E
25|$|The edge spans then build a metric {{on the set}} of vertices. When {{the cities}} are viewed as points in the plane, many natural {{distance}} functions are metrics, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> natural instances of TSP satisfy this constraint.|$|E
25|$|On April 2, just as suddenly, {{consumer}} prices (then controlled by government) increased about 3-fold, cash dried up <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> daily wage workers lost their jobs, Soviet Union crashed miserably and got separated into different nations.|$|E

25|$|During the conflict, Turkish and German workers, {{together}} with allied prisoners of war, laboured {{to complete the}} railway for military purposes but with limited manpower <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{more important things to}} spend money on, only two of the gaps were closed.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Jay Haley {{published}} Uncommon Therapy, {{which for}} the first time brought Erickson and his approaches to the attention of those outside the clinical hypnosis community. Erickson's fame and reputation spread rapidly, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people wished to meet him that he began holding teaching seminars, which continued until his death.|$|E
25|$|Nickel silver is {{malleable}} {{and available}} as commercial sheet metal, {{and gives a}} bright tone but without the shimmer and sensitivity of tin bronzes. In the early to mid 20th century nickel alloy cymbals were far more widely produced and used, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> older recordings were probably made using cymbals with a significant nickel content.|$|E
6000|$|I cannot, dear, explain. <b>So</b> <b>many</b> events [...] Enlarge <b>and</b> make <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{hours of}} one, [...] That {{it would be}} too hard to tell them now.|$|R

60|$|The paths {{branched}} <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times <b>and</b> in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{different ways}} that the Pumpkinhead was often obliged to consult Ozma's map, and finally the Sawhorse became suspicious.|$|R
25|$|Utilizing {{buildings}} and supplies {{secured from the}} rebels at the Hospital de Jesús, Hospital Juárez, and the medical student dormitories and pharmacies, the brigades swiftly set to work. American medics from nearby El Paso, Texas formed the Hospital Insurrecto (Insurgent's Hospital) near the border. The devastation of the city <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> wounded strained the supplies and Arizmendi again rallied for funding.|$|E
25|$|The post-larva is characterised {{by the use}} of {{abdominal}} appendages (pleopods) for propulsion. The post-larva {{is usually}} similar to the adult form, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> names have been erected for the stage in different groups. William Elford Leach erected the genus Megalopa in 1813 for a post-larval crab; a shrimp post-larva is called a parva; hermit crab post-larva are called glaucothoe.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{everyone}} I've {{talked to}} says, 'We're gonna move to Houston.' What I'm hearing, {{which is sort}} of scary, is they all want to stay in Texas... Everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{of the people in the}} arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this (as she chuckles slightly) is working very well for them.|$|E

60|$|Antichrist may be {{considered}} either more particularly, or more generally. 1. More particularly: <b>And</b> <b>so</b> there are <b>many</b> Antichrists (1 John 2:18). 2. More generally: <b>And</b> <b>so</b> the <b>many</b> maketh but one great Antichrist, one man of sin, one enemy, one great whore, one son of perdition (2 Thess 2:3; Rev 19:2).|$|R

25|$|Secondary {{education}} is not available in the village, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of Yatton's children commute daily to the nearby village of Backwell in order to attend Backwell School. The school is a specialist Arts College, and includes a sixth form and takes pupils {{from the age of}} 11 (Year 7) to the age of 18 (Year 13). In November 2008, Backwell School was rated as outstanding by Ofsted.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the opening}} of the Suez and Panama Canals, the Horn remains part of the fastest sailing route around the world, and so the growth in {{recreational}} long-distance sailing has brought about a revival of sailing via the Horn. Owing to the remoteness of the location and the hazards there, a rounding of Cape Horn is widely considered to be the yachting equivalent of climbing Mount Everest, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> sailors seek it for its own sake.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> women are practicing the Dharma now. However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.|$|E
60|$|The {{place they}} had just been in called up <b>so</b> <b>many</b> recollections, <b>and</b> Kate had <b>so</b> <b>many</b> anecdotes of Madeline, <b>and</b> Nicholas <b>so</b> <b>many</b> anecdotes of Frank, <b>and</b> each was <b>so</b> {{interested}} in what the other said, <b>and</b> both were <b>so</b> happy <b>and</b> confiding, <b>and</b> had <b>so</b> much to talk about, {{that it was not}} until they had plunged for a full half-hour into that labyrinth of streets which lies between Seven Dials and Soho, without emerging into any large thoroughfare, that Nicholas began to think it just possible they might have lost their way.|$|R

60|$|Such was {{the state}} of this family down to the 7th April 1749, when there befell the first of that series of events which were to break <b>so</b> <b>many</b> hearts <b>and</b> lose <b>so</b> <b>many</b> lives.|$|R
25|$|In {{imitation}} of his father, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{others of the}} Greek rulers of Asia, he determined to perpetuate his own name by {{the foundation of a}} new capital and the site that he chose, in the immediate neighbourhood of the Megarian colony of Astakos, was so judiciously selected that the city of Nicomedia continued for more than six centuries {{to be one of the}} richest and most flourishing in Anatolia. The founding of Nicomedia is placed by Eusebius in 264 BC.|$|E
25|$|CD-RW is a re-recordable {{medium that}} uses a {{metallic}} alloy instead of a dye. The write laser {{in this case is}} used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> earlier CD audio players cannot read CD-RW discs, although most later CD audio players and stand-alone DVD players can. CD-RWs follow the Orange Book standard.|$|E
25|$|Early in Korean history, the shamanistic {{religion}} was dominant and because early Korea was divided often into smaller domains, such as Silla and Goguryeo, Baekje, the folktales and myths tended to differ also by those regions. With {{the arrival of}} Buddhism in the 3-4th century, the myths and native religion began to change as did the myths. With the advent of Neo Confucianism, the native {{religion was}} suppressed by the government where shamans were often killed for practicing <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of the legends either changed or were blended into existing legends.|$|E
