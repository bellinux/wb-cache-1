25|$|Laparoscopic cyst {{decortication}} (also {{referred to}} as marsupialization) consists in the removal {{of one or more}} kidney cysts through laparoscopic surgery, during which cysts are punctured, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of the larger cysts is excised with care not to incise the renal parenchyma. This procedure can be useful for pain relief in patients with ADPKD, and is usually indicated after earlier cyst aspiration has confirmed that the cyst to be decorticated is responsible for pain.|$|E
500|$|The ships' {{turbines}} were {{equipped with}} Föttinger gears, which significantly improved performance at cruising speeds {{and provided a}} corresponding increase in range of about 20percent. The vessels were designed to store [...] of coal and [...] of oil in purpose-built storage spaces; the hull areas between the torpedo bulkhead <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of the ship were used to store additional fuel. Maximum fuel capacity was [...] of coal and [...] of oil. This was estimated to give a range of up to about [...] at a cruising speed of [...] Electrical power on the vessels was provided by eight diesel generators that put out 2,320kilowatts at 220volts.|$|E

500|$|The tomb's {{construction}} is straightforward and, {{compared to the}} size of other royal tombs in the same area, surprisingly small. The design model was the tomb of king Djer (third pharaoh of the First dynasty), thought to be the 'Tomb of Osiris' from the Middle Kingdom. The architecture of Peribsen's tomb is similar to the residential palace. The tomb measures [...] x [...] and comprises three independent structures nested into one another: in the center is the main burial chamber, measuring [...] x , and which is [...] made of mud bricks, reeds, and wood. On the north, east and west sides the burial chamber is surrounded by nine small storage rooms leading into one another; on the south face is a long antechamber. A passageway runs between the inner structures <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
500|$|Like all puffballs, Handkea utriformis has a gasteroid basidiocarp, {{meaning the}} spores are {{produced}} internally, and are only released as the mature fruiting body ages and dries, or is broken.Young puffballs are typically [...] across, white, or pale grey-brown; in maturity it may attain dimensions of [...] broad by [...] tall. The exoperidum is tomentosedesely {{covered with a}} layer of fine matted hairs. The species derives its common name [...] "mosiac puffball" [...] from the [...] pattern across the top and sides that develops as the fruiting body matures <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> (exoperidium) breaks up into polygonal patches. The underside of the puffball is attached to the ground by a root-like assemblage of hyphae called [...] a rhizomorph. It is squat in appearance and roughly pear-shaped, not usually taller than it is wide. The flesh (gleba, or spore bearing mass) is white when young, but becomes brown and powdery upon maturity. The upper skin eventually disintegrates weeks or even months after the puffball's appearance, and the brown spores are released into the air; this process is often hastened by rain, or by being trodden on by cattle. Eventually, all that remains is the sterile cup-shaped base, which can sometimes hold water. This feature may have been the source of the specific epithet, as utrarius is Latin for ‘water carrier’.|$|E
50|$|The north (Palm Terrace) {{elevation}} is rhythmically articulated with brick piers, protecting vertical windows <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> upstairs Juvenile Court {{and witness}} rooms and downstairs offices.|$|R
50|$|The castle {{consist of}} inner <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> made of ashlar. There are wachtowers on <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> around <b>the</b> courtyard. Inside the castle, {{there is a}} chapel {{in the form of}} a basilica.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} largely {{destroyed}} during the air raids on Hanover in July and October 1943. Only {{the skeleton of}} <b>the</b> halls <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> entrance building remained. It took four days to re-open one track.|$|R
2500|$|The {{invention}} of the city wall is attributed to the semi-historical sage Gun (鯀) of the Xia dynasty, father of Yu the Great. The traditional narrative tells that Gun built the inner wall to defend the prince <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> to settle the people. An alternative narrative attributes the first city wall to the Yellow Emperor.|$|E
2500|$|In this system, each of two stereo {{channels}} {{is carried}} independently by a separate groove wall, each wall face moving at 45 {{degrees to the}} plane of the record surface (hence the system's name) in correspondence with the signal level of that channel. By convention, the inner wall carries the left-hand channel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> carries the right-hand channel. [...] While the stylus only moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording, on stereo records the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. During playback, the movement of a single stylus tracking the groove is sensed independently, e.g., by two coils, each mounted diagonally opposite the relevant groove wall.|$|E
2500|$|Earth was banked {{between the}} two walls to take the impact of cannon fire and {{this meant that the}} {{destructive}} effect of a cannon being fired at point blank range {{at the base of the}} main wall could be avoided. Secondary walls often have round towers set into them to fire on attackers entering the ‘dead’ areas between the walls. Outside the secondary wall there would be a wide moat or ditch and sometimes there would be a further low wall surrounding the moat. [...] In Austria these double circuits are shown on early prints of St Pölten, Krems. Enns, Freistadt, St Veit an Glan, Bruck an der Leitha, Tulln and Vienna. Merian's print of Villach provides a good illustration of multiple walls. At Friesach in Carinthia the double walls still exist on the eastern side <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> is still surrounded by a wide water filled moat.|$|E
50|$|At Lakkundi all {{the temples}} {{are made of}} green schist <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> entrances are very richly decorated. The shikhara is an in-between-style type <b>and</b> <b>the</b> parapet <b>and</b> <b>the</b> artistic {{division}} of the wall with pilasters {{is typical of the}} south-Indian style.|$|R
50|$|Today {{the main}} castle is badly run-down. Only a few {{remnants}} of <b>the</b> towers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> are still left. The only {{structure in the}} entire fortification that has withstood the ravages of time and history relatively well is the keep of <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> ward. Its ruins {{can be seen from}} a long way off.|$|R
50|$|The Hall {{resembles the}} Merchant Adventurers' Hall {{in that it}} has two floors, of which the lower one {{consisted}} of a hospital and a chapel. In contrast to the Merchants' Hall, however, {{the walls of the}} lower floor are of stone (rather than brick) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> timber-framed upper floor were rebuilt in brick in the 17th century.|$|R
2500|$|The area {{along the}} wall of the {{building}} from the eastern side has a narrow corridor flanked by [...] "lockers" [...] (small rooms with racks). The corridor wall is vertical beaded board, the floors are patched concrete <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> is concrete. The building appears to have been built in two stages, the eastern section has timber trusses and timber frames to the tethering area and looks older than the western end which has steel trusses and partition frames. The tethering area consists of low walls running parallel {{along the length of the}} building, equipped with steel rings for tethering animals and hay racks for them above. When the place is occupied, rails are erected to separate each bay and sawdust and sand bedding is put down. Around most of the perimeter of the building are very basic sleeping quarters for people showing their animals at Ekka. There are a few animal pens under the women's sleeping quarters in the western section. These are for cows in calf or with new calves. In the northwest corner of the building is a room for preparing food used by those sleeping in the building. The building has a later brick extension.|$|E
60|$|The deep interspaces or valleys {{between these}} ridges <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> are filled by bony substance, {{which is called}} cement, and coats the whole tooth.|$|E
60|$|Five {{acres of}} ground were {{enclosed}} within the oval of its outer wall, which outside rises perpendicularly in tiers of arches one above the other. Within, the galleries of seats projected forwards, each tier coming out {{far beyond the}} one above it, so that between the lowest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> there was room for a great space of chambers, passages, and vaults around the central space, called the arena, from the arena, or sand, with which it was strewn.|$|E

50|$|The area {{within the}} now ruined ramparts is 1560 m2. Most of the {{buildings}} are ruined. The only partially standing building is a three-story donjon. The length of the eastern wall is 9.60 m and its height is 12 m. The northern wall is 11.5 m long and 13 m high. The width of <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> is 1.50 m. The masonry of the inner walls is of ashlar blocks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> is of bossage blocks.|$|R
60|$|Between {{the body}} of the prison <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall,</b> there is a spacious garden. Entering it, by a wicket in the massive gate, we pursued the path before us to its other termination, and passed into a large chamber, from which seven long {{passages}} radiate. On either side of each, is a long, long row of low cell doors, with a certain number over every one. Above, a gallery of cells like those below, except that they have no narrow yard attached (as those in the ground tier have), and are somewhat smaller. The possession of two of these, is supposed to compensate for the absence of so much air and exercise as can be had in the dull strip attached to each of the others, in an hour's time every day; and therefore every prisoner in this upper story has two cells, adjoining and communicating with, each other.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} morning we commenced work upon our camp, Bradley, Olson, von Schoenvorts, Miss La Rue, and I having sat {{up half the}} night discussing the matter and drawing plans. We set the men at work felling trees, selecting for the purpose jarrah, a hard, weather-resisting timber which grew in profusion near by. Half the men labored while the other half stood guard, alternating each hour with an hour off at noon. Olson directed this work. Bradley, von Schoenvorts and I, with Miss La Rue's help, staked out the various buildings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall.</b> When the day was done, we had quite an array of logs nicely notched and ready for our building operations on the morrow, {{and we were all}} tired, for after the buildings had been staked out we all fell in and helped with the logging--all but von Schoenvorts. He, being a Prussian and a gentleman, couldn't stoop to such menial labor in the presence of his men, and I didn't see fit to ask it of him, as the work was purely voluntary upon our part. He spent the afternoon shaping a swagger-stick from the branch of jarrah and talking with Miss La Rue, who had sufficiently unbent toward him to notice his existence.|$|E
60|$|An {{involuntary}} exclamation {{burst from}} John, as he gained the platform. From the point {{on which he}} stood, he commanded {{a view of the}} whole city, and of the country round. Far below, at his feet, lay the crowded streets of the inner town; between which <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> the ground was thickly occupied by houses of the better class, standing half-embowered in trees. Close beside him rose the stately towers of Hippicus and Mariamne. Behind him was the Palace of Herod, standing on the ground once occupied by the Castle of David. On the east the Palace of Agrippa partly obscured the view of the Temple; but a portion of the building could be seen, standing on its platform on the summit of Mount Moriah. To its left, and connected with it by two lines of cloisters, was the castle of Antonia while, still further along, was the fort known as Acra. Behind the Palace of Herod, and its superb gardens, were scattered the palaces and mansions of the wealthy Jews and strangers which, with their gardens, occupied the whole of the upper part of Mount Zion. On the lower slope of Mount Moriah, lying between the Valley of Jehoshaphat and that of the Tyropoeon, was a densely-populated suburb known as the New Town. Westward, beyond the Tower of Hippicus, lay the valley of Hinnom, with the Dragon Pool glistening in the sun while, at a distance of four or five miles, to the southward could be seen the village of Bethlehem. The whole country outside the walls was a garden, with countless villas, mansions, and groves of trees.|$|E
50|$|The {{church was}} badly damaged during the Second World War {{in an air}} raid on 2 January 1945. The roof on the nave, crossing, transepts and choir {{collapsed}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> were badly damaged. It was rebuilt between 1946 <b>and</b> 1959 by <b>the</b> Nuremberg architect Rudolf Gröschel in an economic interpretative way, as the costs to reconstruct the baroque interior with its ornate detail was unaffordable at the time.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the aerial}} {{bombardment}} of Hildesheim by <b>the</b> RAF <b>and</b> RCAF in World War II, {{the main building}} was almost entirely destroyed; only <b>the</b> westwork <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> survived. Of <b>the</b> ancillary buildings, only the Gothic Anne's chapel (...) , erected in 1321 {{in the middle of}} the cathedral's courtyard, was mostly undamaged.

50|$|Nikolaus Pevsner {{described}} {{the building as}} “lying large and low like a tired beast”. It is 163 feet long, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> towers are 71 feet high. It was consecrated in 1260, at which time <b>the</b> manor <b>and</b> patronage of <b>the</b> church belonged to Rouen Cathedral, as it had from before the Norman invasion.
