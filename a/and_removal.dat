5|$|The most {{significant}} {{threat to the}} bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{is likely to be}} ongoing land clearing in semi-arid bioregions of Queensland and NSW. The eastern Australian Bioregions that comprise the core range of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat, particularly the Brigalow Belt (north and south), have been subjected to broad scale clearing and habitat modification since European settlement. Clearing of vegetation for agriculture <b>and</b> <b>removal</b> of hollow bearing trees for firewood collection and forestry are likely to reduce the availability of roosting sites for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat. Clearing of native vegetation <b>and</b> <b>removal</b> of dead wood and dead trees have been recognised as key threatening processes for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat in NSW.|$|E

In this proposal, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions <b>and</b> <b>removals</b> from Managed Forest Land in EU Member States will be accounted using the concept of Forest Reference Level (FRL), for the compliance period 2021 to 2030. The FRL is a country-specific projected baseline of future forest emissions <b>and</b> <b>removals,</b> against which the actual reported emissions <b>and</b> <b>removals</b> will be compared for accounting purposes at the time of compliance. According to the legal proposal, FRLs will be estimated based on the concept of the “continuation of current forest management practice and intensity”, as documented in a historical Reference Period (RP). This approach aims to promote an active forest management while ensuring that all the emissions <b>and</b> <b>removals</b> associated with changes in forest policies are fully reflected in the accounting in a transparent and credible way.

40|$|Four pilot (biological) {{granular}} {{activated carbon}} ((B) GAC) filters were operated to quantify the effects of ozonation and water temperature on the biodegradation of natural organic matter (NOM) in (B) GAC filters. Removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), assimilable organic carbon (AOC) and oxygen {{and the production of}} carbon dioxide were taken as indicators for NOM biodegradation. Ozonation stimulated DOC <b>and</b> AOC <b>removal</b> in the BGAC filters, but had no significant effect on oxygen <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> carbon dioxide production. The temperature had no significant effect on DOC <b>and</b> AOC <b>removal,</b> while oxygen <b>removal</b> <b>and</b> carbon dioxide production increased with increasing temperature.
