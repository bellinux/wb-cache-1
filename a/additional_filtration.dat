40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} design and function verification of <b>additional</b> <b>filtration.</b> It is intended for the common transmission and hydraulic oil filling of tractors. The main role of this filtration concept is to ensure {{a high level of}} oil cleanness as a condition for the application of ecologic fluids in tractors. The next one is to decrease the wear of lubricated tractor components, the degradation of oil and eventually to extend the interval of oil change. The designed additional filtering is characterized by ease installation through the use of quick couplings and hoses to the external hydraulic circuit. Therefore, the filtration is suitable for various tractor types. Filter element has been designed with the filter ability 1 micron and the ability to separate to 0. 5 [*]dm 3 of water from oil. Function of <b>additional</b> <b>filtration</b> was verified during the 150 engine hours of tractor operation.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether using {{different combinations of}} kVp and mAs with <b>additional</b> <b>filtration</b> can reduce the effective dose to a paediatric phantom whilst maintaining diagnostic image quality. Methods: 27 images of a paediatric AP pelvis phantom were acquired with different kVp, mAs and additional copper filtration. Images were displayed on quality controlled monitors with dimmed lighting. Ten diagnostic radiographers (5 students and 5 experienced radiographers) had eye tests to assess visual acuity before rating the images. Each image was rated for visual image quality against a reference image using 2 alternative forced choice software using a 5 -point Likert scale. Physical measures (SNR and CNR) were also taken to assess image quality. Results: Of the 27 images rated, 13 of them were of acceptable image quality and had a dose lower than the image with standard acquisition parameters. Two were produced without filtration, 6 with 0. 1 mm and 5 with 0. 2 mm copper filtration. Statistical analysis found that the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability was high.

40|$|Dual Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) allows {{performing}} simple material separation or differentiation {{based on}} the energy dependence of the attenuation coefficient by acquiring an image at high and low energy. Up to date, many applications of DECT exist in clinical practice, but the translation of this method to preclinical systems has not been investigated thoroughly. The {{aim of this study}} is to validate the feasibility of bone - iodine separation using DECT on a standard FLEX Triumph-II system. Compared to clinical CT, microCT images are inherently prone to a higher amount of noise. A possible application may be found in vascular studies where scanning an animal at two different energies allows to separate the different iodine filled vascular structures from the surrounding non-vascular structures like bone. Using a density calibration phantom and different iodine concentrations, the optimal energy combination for preclinical DECT was determined. It was found that a 50 - 90 kVp energy pair was suited best to perform bone - iodine decomposition, without requiring <b>additional</b> <b>filtration</b> for the high-and low-energy scan. Next, a three material decomposition algorithm for bone, iodine and soft tissue was validated using the density calibration phantom. As this test yielded good results, a mouse study was performed to validate if similar results could be obtained in-vivo and ex-vivo. Based on the obtained results, we found that material separation using the standard FLEX Triumph-II system was possible both on phantoms and in-vivo. However, the in-vivo results still showed some iodine contributions in the bone image, possibly due to the simplicity of the decomposition algorithm. In the future, more complex, raw data based algorithms may be required together with the use of <b>additional</b> <b>filtration</b> and more advanced iterative reconstruction algorithms to achieve better spectral separation...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{additional}} spectral filtration for dual-energy (DE) imaging using a dual-source CT (DSCT) system was investigated {{and its effect}} on the material-specific DEratio was evaluated for several clinically relevant materials. The x-ray spectra, data acquisition, and reconstruction processes for a DSCT system (Siemens Definition) were simulated using information provided by the system manufacturer, resulting in virtual DE images. The factory-installed filtration for the 80 kV spectrum was left unchanged to avoid any further reductions in tube output, and only the filtration for the high-energy spectrum was modified. Only practical single-element filter materials within the atomic number range of 40 ≤Z≤ 83 were evaluated, with the aim of maximizing the separation between the two spectra, while maintaining similar noise levels for high- and low-energy images acquired at the same tube current. The differences between mean energies and the ratio of the 140 and 80 kV detector signals, each integrated below 80 keV, were evaluated. The simulations were performed for three attenuation scenarios: Head, body, and large body. The large body scenario was evaluated for the DE acquisition mode using the 100 and 140 kV spectra. The DEratio for calcium hydroxyapatite (simulating bone or calcifications), iodine, and iron were determined for CT images simulated using the modified and factory-installed filtration. Several filter materials were found to perform well at proper thicknesses, with tin being a good practical choice. When image noise was matched between the low- and high-energy images, the spectral difference in mean absorbed energy using tin was increased from 25. 7 to 42. 7 keV (head), from 28. 6 to 44. 1 keV (body), and from 20. 2 to 30. 2 keV (large body). The overlap of the signal spectra for energies below 80 keV was reduced from 78 % to 31 % (head), from 93 % to 27 % (body), and from 106 % to 79 % (large body). The DEratio for the body attenuation scenario increased from 1. 45 to 1. 91 (calcium), from 1. 84 to 3. 39 (iodine), and from 1. 73 to 2. 93 (iron) with the additional tin filtration compared to the factory filtration. This use of <b>additional</b> <b>filtration</b> for one of the x-ray tubes used in dual-source DECT dramatically increased the difference between material-specific DE ratios, e. g., from 0. 39 to 1. 48 for calcium and iodine or from 0. 28 to 1. 02 for calcium and iron. Because the ability to discriminate between different materials in DE imaging depends primarily on the differences in DE ratios, this increase is expected to improve the performance of any material-specific DECT imaging task. Furthermore, for the large patient size and in conjunction with a 100 ∕ 140 kV acquisition, the use of <b>additional</b> <b>filtration</b> decreased noise in the low-energy images and increased contrast in the DE image relative to that obtained with 80 ∕ 140 kV and no <b>additional</b> <b>filtration...</b>|$|E

Several refinements in surgical technique and postoperative care (eg, the use of antimetabolites, argon suture lysis, and releasable sutures) have improved the success rates for trabeculectomy, but complications continue to occur at significant rates. In the short-term, these complications include hypotony with or without maculopathy, shallowing of the anterior chamber, choroidal effusions or hemorrhages, hyphema, and cataract formation.

40|$|The in situ {{cross-linking}} of reactive amphiphiles (i. e., surfactants) that self-organize in {{the presence}} of a solvent into a type I bicontinuous cubic (QI) lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) phase have significant potential as a new type of membrane material. These QI-phase networks contain completely uniform pores on the nanometer scale and tunable pore chemistry that could offer significant improvements over conventional nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Despite their significant potential, cross-linked QI-phase networks have never been processed into thin-films necessary to demonstrate commercially relevant productivity and limited characterization has been performed on QI-phase membranes to understand their fundamental performance characteristics. The overall objective of this thesis research is to design and develop a method or approach to fabricate thin-film composite (TFC) QI membranes and perform <b>additional</b> fundamental <b>filtration</b> studies to better understand the transport characteristics of QI-phase membranes. In this thesis research, a new fundamental processing approach is presented to fabricate thin-films of cross-linked QI-phase materials. In this approach, the water typically used for LLC phase formation is replaced with the low volatility, polar, organic solvent glycerol. Due to the low vapor pressure of glycerol, it does readily evaporate during thin-film processing. This allows LLC monomer and glycerol to be dissolved in a volatile casting solvent and applied to a porous support by solution-casting. Subsequent removal of the volatile casting solvent by gentle heating does not result in any appreciable evaporative loss of glycerol necessary to form the desired QI-phase. The applied thin-film can then be photo-cross-linked at the required temperature to create a TFC QI membrane. Water filtration experiments on TFC QI membranes demonstrate they have similar rejection performance to previous QI-phase membranes, except the flux is ca. 10 times greater due to the much thinner active layer. Overall, TFC QI membranes have performance characteristics in-between conventional NF and RO membranes. They reject neutral solutes like a porous NF membrane and reject monovalent and divalent salts comparable to a RO membrane at brackish water feed concentrations. <b>Additional</b> water <b>filtration</b> experiments revealed that anion-exchange has a significant impact on the flux of TFC QI membranes. The flux of TFC QI membranes can be drastically tuned by exposing the membrane to feeds containing different anions with little to no change in the rejection performance. The unexpected performance changes in TFC QI membrane with anion-exchange prompted the design and synthesis of new, cross-linkable, zwitterionic amphiphiles in which ionexchange is no longer possible. A new zwitterionic LLC monomer system has been developed that contains benzimidazolium cationic headgroups with covalently tethered anionic sulfonate groups. These new, cross-linkable, zwitterionic amphiphiles are capable of forming LLC phases in water and glycerol and may readily afford cross-linked LLC assemblies.

Most studies have been directed towards the treatment of final effluent (end-of-pipe approach) {{in order to deal with}} the problems associated with textile waste water. New technologies, such as MBR, enable water reuse in combination with <b>additional</b> membrane <b>filtrations,</b> as a post treatment step. An important feature of MBR is the possibility of employing high sludge concentrations, facilitating the growth of specialised microorganisms, and promoting improved organic degradation. In this review, the characterisation of coloured wastewaters and the treatment methods are discussed, not only to enable water discharge but also its re-use. Parameters that need to be considered are COD, BOD, TSS, Colourization (ADMI) and MLSS. The results showed that the COD is decreased in the last 72 hours and increased in 96 hours. BOD results show that when the 24 -hour period the value is decreased steadily until 96 hours in line with the increasing in time. TSS values decreased as the particles cannot pass through the filter as particles blocked during the refining process. Then MLSS increased due to the growth of microorganisms. Percentage of color removal was 26 %, indicating that the MBR has the potential to emit particles in weaving dye wastewater. The data collected is used to improve the effectiveness of research looms dye using MBR...|$|R
40|$|Background—Because of {{the higher}} {{radiosensitivity}} of infants and children compared with adults, {{there is a need}} to evaluate the doses delivered to pediatric patients who undergo interventional cardiac procedures. However, knowledge of the effective dose in pediatric interventional cardiology is very limited. Methods and Results—For an accurate risk estimation, a patient-specific Monte Carlo simulation of the effective dose was set up in 60 patients with congenital heart disease who underwent diagnostic (n 28) or therapeutic (n 32) cardiac catheterization procedures. The dose-saving effect of using extra copper filtration in the x-ray beam was also investigated. For diagnostic cardiac catheterizations, a median effective dose of 4. 6 mSv was found. Therapeutic procedures resulted in a higher median effective dose of 6. 0 mSv because of the prolonged use of fluoroscopy. The overall effect of inserting extra copper filtration into the x-ray beam was a total effective dose reduction of 18 % with no detrimental effect on image quality. An excellent correlation between the dose-area product and effective patient dose was found (r 0. 95). Hence, dose-area product is suitable for online estimation of the effective dose with good accuracy. With all procedures included, the resulting median lifetime risk for stochastic effects was 0. 08 %. Conclusions—Because of the high radiation exposure, it is important to monitor patient dose by dose-area product instrumentation and to use <b>additional</b> beam <b>filtration</b> to keep the effective dose as low as possible in view of the sensitivity of the pediatric patients.

40|$|Human and canine brain Thy- 1 antigens were solubilized in deoxycholate and antigen {{activity}} was followed both by conventional absorbed anti-brain xenosera of proven specificity and by mouse monoclonal antibodies to canine and human Thy- 1. It is shown that greater than 80 % of Thy- 1 {{activity in the}} dog and man binds to lentil lectin, that the mobility on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of canine and human Thy- 1 is identical with that of rat Thy- 1 and that the Stokes radius in deoxycholate of canine and human brain Thy- 1 is 3. 0 nm and 3. 25 nm respectively. Both lentil lectin affinity chromatography followed by gel-filtration chromatography {{on the one hand}} and monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography on the other gave high degrees of purification of the brain Thy- 1 molecule in the dog and man, resulting in single bands staining for both protein and carbohydrate on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (except for a slight contaminant of higher molecular weight staining for protein but not carbohydrate with human Thy- 1 purified by lentil lectin and gel-filtration chromatography). Analysis of canine and human brain Thy- 1 purified by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography with <b>additional</b> gel <b>filtration</b> through Sephadex G- 200 showed that these molecules had respectively 38 % and 36 % carbohydrate. The amino acid and carbohydrate compositions were similar to those previously reported for Thy- 1 of the rat and mouse, the main point of interest being the presence in canine and human brain Thy- 1 of N-acetylgalactosamine, which has been reported in rat and mouse brain Thy- 1 but not in Thy- 1 from other tissues...|$|R
