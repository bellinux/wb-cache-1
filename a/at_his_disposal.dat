5|$|Julian {{decided to}} confront the Alamanni with just the forces <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal.</b>|$|E
5|$|General Trưởng {{also had}} 12 {{artillery}} battalions <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> {{as well as}} the 1st Air Force Division based at Da Nang and Nuoc Man, which were still intact despite the early clashes in I Corps.|$|E
5|$|To decrypt Enigma messages, {{three pieces}} of {{information}} were needed: (1) a general understanding of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the rotors, and the plug connections on the plugboard). Rejewski had only the first <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau.|$|E
60|$|Sir Terence {{placed the}} {{hospitality}} of <b>his</b> table <b>at</b> <b>his</b> lordship's <b>disposal.</b> But the latter declined graciously.|$|R
60|$|With a {{comprehensive}} {{wave of his}} pipe, Mr. George places the whole building <b>at</b> <b>his</b> visitor's <b>disposal.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There's Lord Popplecourt,--quite a young man,--with {{everything}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>disposal,</b> and a {{very large}} estate. Think of the evil he might do if he were given that way." ...|$|R
5|$|At E3 2017 Bethesda {{announced}} Doom VFR, {{a virtual}} reality adaptation of Doom, {{compatible with the}} PlayStation VR and HTC Vive headsets. In Doom VFR the players assumes the role of Mars' last survivor who, after being killed, gets his consciousness uploaded into an artificial network, and is tasked with defeating the demons and restoring the facility's operations, having an array of electronic devices and weapons <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal.</b> The game is scheduled for release on December 1, 2017.|$|E
5|$|By 20 August 1831 Warsaw {{was almost}} entirely encircled by the Russians. Count Paskevich had <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> a {{formidable}} force. His main {{force on the}} left bank of the Vistula consisted of between 54,000 and 55,000 soldiers, supported by 324 guns of various calibres. A further 7000 soldiers and 20 guns guarded the river crossings. The II Corps under General Cyprian von Kreutz (21,000 soldiers, 90 guns) was heading towards the city from Osiek while von Rüdiger's corps was tied down around Radom, fighting a large Polish corps under General Samuel Różycki.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Kekewich's troops {{consisted}} of four companies of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, some Royal Engineers, six RML 2.5 inch mountain guns and two machine guns. Also <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> were 120men of the Cape Police (recalled from various outposts along the railway line), 2,000irregular troops, the Kimberley Light Horse, and {{a battery of}} obsolete seven-pounder guns. Eight Maxim machine guns were mounted on redoubts built atop tailing heaps around the town.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure he will," [...] said Sir Lionel, who {{certainly}} had just cause for such confidence, seeing how large a slice {{out of the}} sum had been placed <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>disposal.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "After that, my duties depend entirely {{upon the}} sultan. If {{there is any}} state {{ceremonial}} in the Palace, I summon those whose duty it is to attend, and see that everything is properly arranged and in order. If not, I am generally <b>at</b> <b>his</b> Highness's <b>disposal.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Carr {{secretly}} {{determined that}} it should remain {{as much as possible}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own exclusive <b>disposal,</b> but she did not say so.|$|R
5|$|In 1835 {{an act of}} Parliament {{reformed}} {{the local}} government structure, introducing a new town corporation structure with an elected mayor for the first time. Bute had {{to work harder to}} maintain his influence over the new corporation, using the various levers of influence <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal.</b> He was successful, and in practice the elected officials and councillors were controlled by Bute and his interests.|$|E
5|$|Otho and Vitellius {{realized}} the potential {{threat posed by}} the Flavian faction. With four legions <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him {{the advantage of being}} nearest to the vital province of Egypt, which controlled the grain supply to Rome. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire city garrison of Rome. Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high but so long as either Galba or Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action.|$|E
5|$|The 23rd Division (South Vietnam) {{under the}} command of Brigadier General Tran Van Cam was the main unit {{defending}} Ban Me Thuot and the surrounding areas. Major General Pham Van Phu had <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> five artillery battalions equipped with 146 artillery guns, and one armoured brigade of about 117 tanks and armoured vehicles. The South Vietnamese military also stationed air force and naval units in Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
6000|$|She now {{rose from}} her chair {{and began to walk}} about the room. [...] "He shall not go back from it. He shall learn that I am not a {{creature}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>disposal</b> in that way. He shall find that I have some strength,--if you have none." ...|$|R
60|$|Such {{a humiliating}} {{state of affairs}} had induced his lordship, on the very first occasion, to expend half a million of accumulations, which were <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>disposal,</b> in the {{purchase}} of Princedown, which certainly {{was a very different}} residence from Montfort Castle, alike in its clime and character.|$|R
60|$|The emir, who had {{expected}} to hear the princess talk nonsense, finding how calm and reasonable she was, assured the king {{that he could not}} venture to undertake a cure, but placed <b>his</b> head <b>at</b> <b>his</b> Majesty's <b>disposal,</b> on which the justly irritated monarch promptly had it cut off.|$|R
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{a variety of}} elements that both aid and hinder the player's progress through the waves. <b>At</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> Jones has TNT, guns, swords, hats for extra lives, jewels for extra time and his classic whip. Opposing him are bats, rats, snakes, spiders and an endless supply of Thugee servants. In addition, if Jones lands {{in any of the}} lava pits, crashes a mine cart or hits a boulder or spike trap, he loses one life.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{orders from}} Empress Elizabeth, Saltykov moved on Prussia in a methodical advance {{beginning}} in June 1759. Some estimates place his army {{as high as}} 70,000 men; others suggest he had approximately 41,000 in June and July. Upon learning of this advance, Frederick ordered General Dohna to halt the Russian westward advance. Dohna had a force of 26,000 <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> including several companies of cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Using his {{responsibility}} for the Volksdeutsche of the Banat as a pretext, Meyszner constantly interfered with operational orders issued to the 7th SS Division. In September 1943, the total police forces <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> comprised the 5th SS-Polizei Regiment, minus one company detached to occupied Greece and seven battalions of Hilfspolizei (auxiliary police) of various ethnicities, which had only received 4–5 weeks training due to constant employment.|$|E
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN [formally] The President respectfully solicits the {{privilege}} of {{an interview with the}} Chief Secretary, and holds himself entirely <b>at</b> <b>his</b> honor's august <b>disposal.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have put}} a check on his expenditure. I will not let his daily bread depend on any man; I have {{therefore}} left him five hundred a year <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>disposal,</b> from the day of my death. Let him make what ducks and drakes of that he can." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Amias accordingly, on {{his morning}} visit of inspection, intimated to the Queen that Mr. Talbot wished his {{daughter}} to return home {{with him for the}} recovery of her health. He spoke as if the whole suite were <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>disposal,</b> and Mary resented it in her dignified manner.|$|R
5|$|Having drilled {{his army}} {{for two years}} Corbulo, despite this misadventure, was ready. He had three legions <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> (III Gallica and VI Ferrata from Syria and IV Scythica), to which were added {{a large number of}} {{auxiliaries}} and allied contingents from Eastern client kings like Aristobulus of Lesser Armenia and Polemon II of Pontus. The situation was furthermore favorable to the Romans: Vologases faced a serious revolt by the Hyrcanians in the region of the Caspian Sea as well as incursions of Dahae and Sacae nomads from Central Asia, and was unable to support his brother.|$|E
5|$|However, Alexios's {{problems}} were only just beginning. At {{a time when}} the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire, taxation and the economy were in complete disarray. Inflation was spiralling out of control, the coinage was heavily debased, the fiscal system was confused (there were six different nomismata in circulation), and the imperial treasury was empty. In desperation, Alexios had been forced to finance his campaign against the Normans by using the wealth of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which had been put <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> by the Patriarch of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In March 1794, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional powers {{in the event of}} an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.|$|E
60|$|The {{immediate}} {{effect of this}} blood was that he said something more about the book, a promise, a definite promise. He could never recall his exact words, but their intention was binding. He conveyed his absolute acquiescence with Benham's wishes whatever they were. His life for that moment was unreservedly <b>at</b> <b>his</b> friend's <b>disposal....</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'But now he {{is entirely}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>disposal,</b> and a man of four or five-and-thirty, who {{has gone through a}} great deal, and I do not think that to send him a {{friendly}} message of thanks for a bunch of flowers to his old fellow-soldier's daughter would be anything but what Captain White would think his due.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Skrebensky {{sat beside}} her, {{listening}} to the sermon, {{to the voice of}} law and order. [...] "The very hairs of your head are all numbered." [...] He did not believe it. He believed his own things were quite <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>disposal.</b> You could do as you liked with your own things, so long as you left other people's alone.|$|R
5|$|In November 1871, New York Collector and {{a member}} of New York Senator Roscoe Conkling's {{political}} machine, was forced to resign. Murphy, a Grant appointee, had become embroiled in a dispute with another faction of the Republican party over the jobs <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> and was investigated by Congress for mismanagement and corruption in office. In December, Grant appointed Chester A. Arthur, another Conkling man, to replace Murphy, and administration of the Customs House steadily improved. On March 3, 1873, Grant signed into law a congressional and presidential salary increase. The unpopular Salary Grab Act was repealed in December, although Grant was allowed to keep his pay raise.|$|E
5|$|In the media, {{there were}} many testimonials and refutations given by journalists {{for the first part}} of Carr's {{argument}} regarding the capacity for concentration; treatments of the second part of Carr's argument regarding the capacity for contemplation, were, however, far rarer. Although columnist Andrew Sullivan noted that he had little leisure time <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> for contemplation compared with when he grew up, the anecdotes provided by journalists that indicated a deficiency in the capacity to contemplate were described only in the context of third parties, such as columnist Margaret Wente's anecdote about how one consultant had found a growing tendency in her clients to provide ill-considered descriptions for their technical problems.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} innovations in common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly had more than one manuscript <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>disposal.</b> In one instance the diction seems to come closer to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster. In spite of some miscomprehension of the story {{on the part of the}} revisionist scribe, the literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in the earlier version, which Rudolf Thurneysen points out is of help for the understanding of the tale.|$|E
60|$|He {{placed a}} chair <b>at</b> <b>his</b> visitor's <b>disposal,</b> himself {{resuming}} <b>his</b> seat <b>at</b> <b>his</b> writing-table, and unfolding the paper Garnache had given him. The newcomer seated himself, hitched his sword-belt round {{so that he}} could lean both hands upon the hilt, and sat, stiff and immovable, awaiting the Lord Seneschal's pleasure. From his desk across the room the secretary, idly chewing the feathered end of his goose-quill, took silent stock of the man from Paris, and wondered.|$|R
6000|$|Whether {{it might}} be two thousand, or fifteen, or twelve hundred, it would in any case {{undoubtedly}} be a great thing for him, {{if he could get}} it. The gratification to his ambition would be greater even than that of his covetousness. How glorious to out-top the archdeacon in his own cathedral city; to sit above prebendaries and canons and have the cathedral pulpit and all the cathedral services altogether <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>disposal!</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The monarch of Canada has a state landau <b>at</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>disposal</b> in Ottawa for {{ceremonial}} processions from Rideau Hall to Parliament Hill. The State Landau {{was given}} to Canada in 1911 and was formerly used by the Governor General of Australia.|$|R
