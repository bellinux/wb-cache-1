5|$|According to Nielsen ratings, {{the episode}} drew just over 24million viewers, {{indicating}} a 4million viewer decrease {{from the previous}} season premiere a year earlier.

5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi <b>and</b> <b>generally</b> dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E

5|$|As {{the name}} suggests, an {{elliptical}} galaxy has the cross-sectional {{shape of an}} ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, <b>and</b> <b>generally</b> older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found {{at the core of}} galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Australian kites may be {{sedentary}} or nomadic, <b>and</b> <b>generally</b> {{occur in}} open grasslands or valleys {{where there are}} scattered clumps of trees.

5|$|Because of its {{proximity}} to the mountains <b>and</b> <b>generally</b> sunny weather, Denver has gained a reputation as being a very active, outdoor-oriented city.

Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Book Two: Spirits premiered with 2.6 million viewers.

5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults <b>and</b> <b>generally</b> were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever they could get their hands on, at the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.|$|E

5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels {{that occurred in the}} past, <b>and</b> <b>generally</b> in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. They are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet Earth. They are {{rare in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean <b>and</b> <b>generally</b> form only once every several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|During his 1893 tour, Riley lectured {{mostly in}} the western United States, and in his 1894 tour in the east.

Sherley was a millionaire who published his own books. The literary community had dismissed his work, but Riley was instrumental in helping him to be accepted.|$|E
