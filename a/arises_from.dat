5|$|At the {{posterior}} {{angle of the}} wing base in some Diptera there {{is a pair of}} membranous lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the alula. The alula is well developed in the house fly. The outer squama (c) <b>arises</b> <b>from</b> the wing base behind the third axillary sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner squama (d) <b>arises</b> <b>from</b> {{the posterior}} scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer squama of the alula is turned upside down above the inner squama, the latter not being affected by the movement of the wing. In many Diptera a deep incision of the anal area of the wing membrane behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer squama of the alula.|$|E
