25|$|There were {{traditionally}} {{three areas}} of scoring on the stickball pole. There was a mark, about chest {{high on the}} pole, and when scored above, would award one point. Contact below that point was not scored. The {{top half of the}} pole, well above <b>arms</b> <b>reach,</b> was usually worth two points when hit. The very top of the pole, usually embellished with a large figure of a fish or other sacred animal, was worth three points. In recreational games, scoring was loosely kept, most times by the audience or a few players. Games typically would reach around twenty points before concluding.|$|E
25|$|Breaststroke {{uses the}} regular start for swimming. Some {{swimmers}} use a variant called the frog start, where the legs are pulled forward sharply before being extended again quickly during the airborne {{phase of the}} start. After the start a gliding phase follows under water, followed by one underwater pulldown and dolphin kick, then one whip kick as the hands are recovered back to a streamline. This {{is known as the}} pull-out. The head must break the surface before the <b>arms</b> <b>reach</b> their widest point on the first stroke after the pull-out. The downward butterfly kick was legalized by FINA, WWF and the NCAA in 2005, and remains optional. The downward fly kick is now allowed in MCSL.|$|E
