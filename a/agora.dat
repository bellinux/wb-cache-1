5|$|The Tariff Court {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} enclosure {{south of}} the <b>agora</b> and sharing its northern wall with it. Originally, {{the entrance of the}} court was a massive vestibule in its southwestern wall. However, the entrance was blocked by the construction of a defensive wall and the court was entered through three doors from the <b>Agora.</b> The court gained its name by containing a 5 meters long stone slab that had the Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it.|$|E
5|$|Archeology helps {{scholars}} {{better understand}} Jesus' social world. Recent archeological work, for example, indicates that Capernaum, a city important in Jesus' ministry, was poor and small, {{without even a}} forum or an <b>agora.</b> This archaeological discovery resonates well with the scholarly view that Jesus advocated reciprocal sharing among the destitute in that area of Galilee.|$|E
5|$|Palmyra {{had a large}} <b>agora.</b> However, {{unlike the}} Greek Agoras (public {{gathering}} places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's <b>agora</b> resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used {{in some of the}} tombs. Many burial monuments contained mummies embalmed in a method similar to that used in Ancient Egypt.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, a {{proposal}} for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (<b>AGORA),</b> this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. <b>AGORA</b> would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or {{by means of a}} small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA–ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the fort}} is leased to the Malta Film Commission, {{and it has been}} used {{extensively}} as a location for various films and serials. In recent years, huge sets were built within its walls for the films Gladiator (2000), Troy (2004) and <b>Agora</b> (2009). In these films, the fort stood in as Rome, Troy and Alexandria respectively. The fort was also used in the filming of Assassin's Creed (2016).|$|E

In {{addition to the}} <b>agora,</b> the gymnasium, the theatre, and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, {{one of the main}} markers of a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances. This was the case not only for Alexandria in Egypt, but also cities as distant as Ai-Khanoum in what is now modern-day Afghanistan.|$|E

A cross street at the western end of the colonnade leads to the Camp of Diocletian, built by Sosianus Hierocles (the Roman governor of Syria).

5|$|Nabis had {{appointed}} his brother-in-law, the Argive Pythagoras, {{as commander}} of his garrison of 15,000 men in Argos. As the Romans and the Achaean League were advancing towards the city, a young Argive named Damocles attempted {{to stir up}} a revolution against the Spartan garrison. With a few followers, {{he stood in the}} city's <b>agora</b> and shouted to his fellow Argives, exhorting them to rise in revolt. However, no mass uprising materialized and Damocles and most of his followers were surrounded and killed by the Spartan garrison.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} further deteriorated for Pyrrhus when Areus entered Argos with a {{force of}} 1,000 lightly armed Cretans and Spartans. The Argives, assisted by their Spartan and Macedonian allies, launched a counter-attack on Pyrrhus' Gallic troops in the <b>agora</b> and threw them {{into a state of}} panic. Due to the labyrinthine layout {{of the city and the}} darkness, both Pyrrhus' advancing troops and those of his opponents become scattered throughout Argos. The result was that Pyrrhus, entering the city at the head of his cavalry to assist the Gauls, was unable to effectively communicate his commands to his soldiers. Realising the difficulty of his situation, Pyrrhus ordered his army to retreat from Argos as day broke.|$|E

5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines {{that it is more}} likely that Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive <b>agora,</b> the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.|$|E
5|$|Palmyra's first {{excavations}} {{were conducted}} in 1902 by Otto Puchstein and in 1917 by Theodor Wiegand. In 1929, French general director of antiquities of Syria and Lebanon Henri Arnold Seyrig began large-scale excavation of the site; interrupted by World War II, it resumed soon after the war's end. Seyrig started with the Temple of Bel in 1929 and between 1939 and 1940 he excavated the <b>Agora.</b> Daniel Schlumberger conducted excavations in the Palmyrene northwest countryside in 1934 and 1935 where he studied different local sanctuaries in the Palmyrene villages. From 1954 to 1956, a Swiss expedition organized by UNESCO excavated the Temple of Baalshamin. Since 1958, the site has been excavated by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities, and Polish expeditions led by many archaeologists including Kazimierz Michałowski (until 1980) and Michael Gawlikowski (until 2011). The stratigraphic sounding beneath the Temple of Bel was conducted in 1967 by Robert du Mesnil du Buisson, who also discovered the Temple of Baal-hamon in the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The study {{presented}} in this article forms part of a wider project promoting collaboration between junior researchers from different universities with the objective of rethinking and improving teaching practice in relation to the use of technology. The article describes research carried out during the 2012 / 13 academic year aimed at developing collaborative action research through technologically mediated <b>agoras</b> involving students from three Spanish universities. The main results of this study show that junior researchers improved their teaching practice through technologically mediated inside and outside <b>agoras.</b> In addition, the transformation of university classrooms into <b>agoras</b> enabled the negotiated reconstruction of knowledge for the analysis of good practice in the use of technology. Likewise, these <b>agoras</b> helped reduce limitations by breaking down the barriers of time, distance and resources for sharing findings and limitations between junior researchers. Furthermore, they pave the way for improvements and their implementation in learning processes during initial teacher training...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{attempts}} to share knowledge, groups frequently experience cognitive conflicts {{due to a}} plurality of viewpoints, semantic heterogeneity and interpretative disagreement. With the <b>Agoræ</b> tool, we are seeking to develop an approach to knowledge sharing which is "tolerant to conflict " {{in order to support}} (and take into account) this kind of divergence. This implies understanding how groups proceed concretely in managing their cognitive conflicts. In this outline of our paper, we present work underway {{in the context of a}} UNESCO supported DKN project (Diaspora Knowledge Network) aimed at using <b>Agorae</b> for managing cognitive conflicts which arise when doing things together...|$|R
