[...] "He makes a run from the halfway line on the left hand side. I watched it and I showed our players it", said McCoist, adding that [...] "he [...] just has a desire to run and run <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> {{on the end of}} a cross.

500|$|Hunt {{described}} Bennett and Broncos teammate Darren Lockyer as {{the greatest}} influences on his league career. With Lockyer's move from fullback to five-eighth, Hunt had large shoes {{to fill in the}} position. Hunt proved to be a success for the Broncos; he played every game in 2004, missing just four minutes in total, and was the team's top try-scorer. Bennett remarked of him that [...] "Karmichael has an attitude just like Darren Lockyer where he can make a mistake and kiss it off <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> on with the game, It's a wonderful quality to have and you'd like every player to have it. A lot of guys dwell on mistakes and it stays with them too long." ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{writing and}} {{recording}} commencing {{almost immediately after}} finishing touring, the band were inspired to capture the energy of their live performances. Despite having previously received acclaim for redefining their sound record-to-record, the band felt little pressure to repeat this, Brian Lane simple stated that as with previous recording sessions, the band had become bored of performing their older material, and would naturally look to write and record songs that were different. Guitarist Vincent Accardi commented that [...] "after The Devil and God, the structures of songs were a bit more complex and things {{were a little bit}} delicate.

2500|$|Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 7 out of 10. As with Rybicki, {{he felt the}} blend of action and horror {{elements}} didn't really work; [...] "in trying to mix horror and action, The Suffering sets itself up for failure [...] once you shake off the anxiety you've been trained to associate with survival horror <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> on with it, it becomes something of a slog." [...] However, he felt the game did feature [...] "some genuinely disconcerting moments, an interesting story of demonic misadventure, some fairly ghastly sights and sounds, and some genuinely standout frights." [...] He further wrote [...] "Certainly it's been well designed in places." [...] However, he concluded [...] "The Suffering has some scary moments, {{but for the most}} part they punctuate a fairly regular, albeit twisted, action game, rather than driving it [...] It's a shame, because The Suffering could have been great. We're not asking for a carbon copy of Resident Evil or Silent Hill, but with a little more consideration, Surreal could have remoulded the experience a lot more effectively." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{composing}} Rebel Heart, Madonna {{would get}} [...] "fleeting moments of ideas" [...] {{of what she}} would like to perform on the tour.

[...] "I like to create personas and then the persona changes and grows into other things... I'm at the beginning of that process right now, in terms of thinking of my tour and stuff," [...] the singer explained. Rehearsals for the tour occurred for 10–12 hours per day. She added: [...] "When I go on tour, I like the rehearsal. I like the creation of everything. I like being able to wear my rehearsal clothes and be sweaty and not having to worry about how I look <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> into what it is I'm trying to say and do."

2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in my head. That was a mental error there. As soon as I {{realized there was}} no one to hand it to I started to run toward the line and tried to cover it up <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> down and I slid right into Brandon Moore." [...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. I guess (I was) more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E
