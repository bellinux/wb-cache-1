40|$|In {{this study}} it was {{examined}} {{how people are}} exposed to compounds contained in hygienic cleaning products used in the kitchen. The products for which exposure was assessed are dishwashing liquids, hygienic cleaning napkins, spray cleaners and bleach containing products (abrasive, <b>all</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>cleaner</b> and bleach). For each product type, exposure was assessed for one sample compound while performing one or two cleaning tasks in the kitchen. The exposure assessments were performed using the computer application, CONSEXPO. The calculated exposures were compared to the toxicity of the assessed compounds {{in order to assess}} risk. Exposure to didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride is concluded to be a possible cause of slight dermal irritation when using a hygienically cleaning trigger spray. On the basis of a first toxicological screening, exposure to the assessed compounds when using the products for cleaning tasks in the kitchen is not expected to cause adverse health effects...|$|E
40|$|Signal words, such as DANGER, WARNING, and CAUTION {{are often}} used on {{consumer}} products to connote various levels of hazard. Each of these signal words is usually printed in a color (e. g., white on a dark background) in order to potentially increase saliency or aesthetics. Hence, there is a potentially significant interaction of signal word, color, and product type on perceived hazard. Warning labels for muriatic acid, Xtra-Clean <b>All</b> <b>Purpose</b> <b>Cleaner,</b> and Crayola Crayons were factorially combined with signal word (DEADLY, DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION, and NOTE) and color of signal word (orange, blue, red, black) {{for a total of}} 60 conditions. A sample of 124 undergraduates rated each product warning on understandability, likelihood of compliance, carehlness, and attention-gettingness. Results indicated that muriatic acid had significantly higher hazard ratings than either the cleaner or crayons. Black connoted the highest level of hazard followed by blue, red, and orange. Furthermore, the order of perceived hazard from highest to lowest for signal word was DEADLY, DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION, and NOTE. Moreover, there appears to be an averaging effect in which muriatic acid with the signal word NOTE printed in orange produced the same connoted hazard level as the package of crayons with the signal word CAUTION printed in red. Implications for warning design are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The EU Ecolabel {{criteria}} for <b>all</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>cleaners,</b> sanitary cleaners and window cleaners are under revision. This revision process will {{take into account}} the current market conditions and the EU Ecolabel criteria will aim at addressing the most important environmental impacts of the all-purpose cleaners in a life cycle perspective. The identification of the main hotspots is carried out in this study by means of an initial extensive literature review and subsequent LCA studies. LCA studies showed that sourcing of the raw materials is the most relevant environmental aspect followed by heating up the water during cleaning if needed. Based on the normalisation assessment, by far the most significant impact category for all-purpose cleaners in Europe is natural land transformation. These findings are in agreement with the published literature and can be extrapolated to other all-purpose cleaners such as sanitary cleaners and window cleaners. The study reveals that there are several improvement opportunities such as cleaner concentration which can bring savings in resources or reduction in the wash temperature. Changes in the detergent formulation can also reduce the impacts in different categories. JRC. J. 5 -Sustainable Production and Consumptio...|$|R

Because ammonia results in a relatively streak-free shine, {{one of its most}} common uses is to clean glass, porcelain and stainless steel.

30|$|It {{is known}} that PVAc based {{adhesives}} may contain CN within the formulation (for instance UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose)</b> [36, 41]. When CN is present within a PVAc based formulation, this may compromise its ageing as determined by Down et al. [42], where the commercial product UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose,</b> initially performs well but later dramatically deteriorates in performance with ageing. A PVAc + CN formulation may have been applied to the vessels when additional repairs were made using UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose</b> before photographing artefacts for the virtual museum project in 1996. Alternatively, this formulation may have been applied at the relevant excavation site or when conserved, as UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose</b> {{is one of the}} longest used and most widely accessible adhesives across the globe [43].|$|R
