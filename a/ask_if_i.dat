500|$|Despite {{protests from}} crewmen, {{who wanted the}} remains hosed over the deck, Callaghan insisted that the young Japanese airman had done his job {{to the best of}} his ability, with honor, and {{deserved}} a military funeral. Stephen Cromwell, a corpsman at the time, later recalled, [...] "I was able to recover his body and I called up to the bridge to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should throw it overboard ... Captain Callaghan said, ‘No, when we secure, take it down to the sick bay, and we'll have a burial for him tomorrow.’" [...] Ivan Dexter, another crew member, gave his account of events to Herb Fahr, recalling that {{the top half of the}} Japanese pilot's body was scattered over the deck, while the bottom half fell with the rest of the plane into the sea. What remained of the body was brought to sick bay for examination, and various Missouri crew took souvenirs from the clothing, including the helmet, scarf, and jacket. Following examination, the remains were placed in a canvas bag with dummy shell casings to weigh it down.|$|E

Benjamin said, [...] "I couldn't believe it when I got the call a few months ago to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would return to Walford. I didn't think Lisa would give up baby Lou without one last fight." [...] The return storyline was temporary, allowing Lisa to usurp Phil and once again take custody of her daughter, with the help of Den Watts. The character then disappeared, exiting in November 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the things}} being {{discussed}} at the meetings was the pressing issue of recruitment. A West Point graduate, Ulysses was {{the only man in}} town with professional military training, and was elected to preside over the meeting. When Ulysses was given command of the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, a regiment composed of unruly volunteers, Jesse expressed disappointment in a letter to him, feeling that Ulysses' talent and efforts would have been better used commanding regular army troops. In a reply letter to his father Ulysses attempted to abate Jesse's criticism maintaining, [...] "You <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should not like to go in the regular army. I should not. I want to bring my children (recruits) up to useful employment, and in the army the chance is poor", stressing the point that he was more concerned about the war than he was a career.|$|E
2500|$|After taking office, Ali {{was interviewed}} by the Associated Press while [...] "holding his snoozing 8-month-old {{daughter}} outside the House chamber". When asked about the anti-Muslim protester during the campaign, Ali said the protester “was an exception to his experience on the campaign. 'It was disappointing {{that that kind of}} bigotry would still rear its head, but I understand it was an isolated incident. Occasionally people would <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was Muslim, {{but most of the time}} it was a curiosity, not an obstacle.'" [...] Ali did not want to be seen as just a novelty because of his religion, he said he'd “like to work on transportation matters and to pass a bill making it tougher for companies to track information and buying habits of private citizens." [...] He wanted his constituents to know he's one of them and said, [...] "I will represent the Muslims, but more importantly, I will represent all the people. I’m a Muslim, but I’m also a resident." [...] In other interviews that asked the same question, Ali replied “I'm Muslim, and that'll always be the case, but I'm here to push good issues and good policy for all Marylanders.... We're looking for good ideas", and [...] "I'm here to push good ideas, not so much to push my faith." ...|$|E
2500|$|DeLillo's work {{displays}} {{elements of}} both modernism and postmodernism. (Though {{it is worth noting}} that DeLillo himself claims not to know if his work is postmodern: [...] "It is not [...] I'm the last guy to <b>ask.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> had to classify myself, it would be in the long line of modernists, from James Joyce through William Faulkner and so on. That has always been my model.") He has said the primary influences on his work and development are [...] "abstract expressionism, foreign films, and jazz." [...] Many of DeLillo's books (notably White Noise) satirize academia and explore postmodern themes of rampant consumerism, novelty intellectualism, underground conspiracies, the disintegration and re-integration of the family, and the promise of rebirth through violence. In several of his novels, DeLillo explores the idea of the increasing visibility and effectiveness of terrorists as societal actors and, consequently, the displacement of what he views to be artists', and particularly novelists', traditional role in facilitating social discourse (Players, Mao II, Falling Man). Another perpetual theme in DeLillo's books is the saturation of mass media and its role in forming simulacra, resulting in the removal of an event from its context and the consequent draining of meaning (see the highway shooter in Underworld, the televised disasters longed for in White Noise, the planes in Falling Man, the evolving story of the interviewee in Valparaiso). The psychology of crowds and the capitulation of individuals to group identity is a theme DeLillo examines in several of his novels, especially in the prologue to Underworld, Mao II, and Falling Man. In a 1993 interview with Maria Nadotti, DeLillo explained ...|$|E

2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental car out of the garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away and <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had a place to go and if I had a way to get there and basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2009, Chakraverti {{collaborated with}} filmmaker Anjan Dutt and Sarika {{to make a}} film called The Loving Doll, with the story taken from Sacred Evil again. It will be filmed in Hindi with bits of English. Sarika plays the central {{character}} of a middle-aged woman obsessed about losing her looks. The story revolves around a married couple beset with personal problems, triggered by a doll owned by the wife. Charaverti said: [...] "After the film Sacred Evil, I have been approached by several directors for another film but the inspiration was not there. This time around there was a synchronicity— Sarika phoned me to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was thinking of another film. She has long wanted to play the woman in The Loving Doll [...] Then I happened to see Madly Bangalee, and liked Anjan’s work very much. I think he has the touch {{to be able to handle}} the subject of The Loving Doll. So I contacted him and he was very interested in the project. Though he works in a very different genre from mine, I think there is empathy between his work and mine." [...] Chakraverti also said that she may play the part of a healer in the film, [...] "It’s the director’s prerogative. We will do what is best for the film." [...] In April 2010, ETV Bangla created a serial called Dibaratrir Galpo, which was based on Beloved Witch. The plot of Dibaratrir Galpo, directed by Tathagata Banerjee, centres around a dispute between two aristocratic Bengali families, but the lead character (played by Sudipta Chakraborty) was shown as a follower of Wicca who learns to develop her psychic power and uses it to counter the machinations of her enemies. Chakraverti appeared on the commercials for the serial because she felt that her deglamorised presence helped audiences in the suburbs see elderly women, who are often branded as witches, in a positive light. [...] "I felt that the story of Dibaratrir Galpo would take to esoteric ideas very well. It has a women-oriented theme and it will show how the negative aspects of the esoteric can be countered." ...|$|E
