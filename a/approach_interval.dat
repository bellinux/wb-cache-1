In the proposed <b>approach,</b> <b>interval</b> weights for achievement of fuzzy goals to their aspired levels {{on the basis}} of their relative importance are considered in an uncertain environment. In the model formulation of the problem, the membership functions for each of the fuzzy goals are defined first. Then, the membership functions are transformed into membership goals by assigning the highest membership value (unity) and introducing under-and over-deviational variables to each of them. In the solution process, the interval weights (derived from pairwise interval judgment matrix) associated with the unwanted deviational variables is introduced in the goal achievement function for minimizing them to reach the aspired goal levels of the problem.

This study aimed to describe the prevalence of abnormal findings at follow-up ERC to determine whether upper endoscopy with stent removal and without cholangiography would suffice. Methods A retrospective cohort analysis of all patients referred for initial and follow-up ERC with post-CCY bile leak was performed. The rate of abnormal findings was measured including choledocholithiasis, biliary strictures, and persistent bile leaks at follow-up ERC. Secondarily, the study sought to define the clinical characteristics of patients who demonstrated stones or sludge at follow-up assessment. Results Between January, 2003 and April, 2008, 105 patients underwent initial and follow-up ERC. After a mean interval of 6. 9 ± 2. 7 weeks between endoscopies, 29 (27. 6 %) of the 105 patients demonstrated one or more abnormalities including persistent bile leak (n = 8), common bile duct (CBD) stones (n = 12), and CBD sludge alone (n = 9). In the subgroup analysis of the patients who underwent a balloon sweep at initial and follow-up ERC, the prevalence of CBD stones or sludge at the follow-up ERC was 17. 6 %. Besides stones during the initial ERC, no significant clinical predictors of CBD stones were found at follow-up ERC including surgical <b>approach,</b> <b>interval</b> between endoscopies, and location of bile leak. Conclusion After endoscopic treatment of a bile leak, the prevalence of abnormalities at follow-up ERC is significant.

30|$|Figure 8 {{illustrates}} {{the operation of}} each allocation approach. In the whole <b>approach</b> all <b>intervals</b> are allocated {{the same number of}} web server instances and database instance cores. In the basic <b>interval</b> <b>approach</b> the <b>interval</b> resource allocations follow almost a chronological order. Specifically, for intervals 1 to 6, allocations in any given interval either remain the same or drop when compared to the allocations in the previous interval. Interval 7 violates this observation since the bottleneck tier switches from the web tier to the database tier in one of the workload scenarios. RAP selects the interval for resource allocation to be the one with the highest mean response time. Consequently, its resource allocations show a pattern that reflects the combined burstiness characteristics of the application workload scenarios. From the figure, RAP estimates a requirement of at most 14 web server instances and 9 database instance cores in some intervals to satisfy application SLOs. The other approaches estimate higher numbers since they do not exploit burstiness.|$|R

Modal Interval Analysis (MIA) {{is an attempt}} to go beyond the limitations of classic intervals in terms of their structural, algebraic and logical features. The starting point of MIA is quite simple: It consists in defining a modal interval that attaches a quantifier to a classical interval and in introducing the basic relation of inclusion between modal intervals by means of the inclusion of the sets of predicates they accept. This modal <b>approach</b> introduces <b>interval</b> extensions of the real continuous functions, identifies equivalences between logical formulas and interval inclusions, and provides the semantic theorems that justify these equivalences, along with guidelines for arriving at these inclusions. Applications of these equivalences in different areas illustrate the obtained results.

Assuming {{that the rate of}} input of pollutants can be observed indirectly and that its relation to the observations is known, the problem is a model-inversion problem.

The paper considers two approaches to obtaining information on the input: the reconstructibility approach and the guaranteed <b>interval</b> <b>approach.</b> The reconstructibility approach leads to reliable but restricted information. The result of the reconstructibility approach is an input performance index (a function).
