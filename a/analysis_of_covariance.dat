[Background]: The course of cognitive function in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients suggests that some individuals are normal or near normal whereas some cases present a marked decline. The goal of the present longitudinal study was to identify neuroanatomical differences between deficit and non-deficit patients.

A global cognitive function score was used to classify deficit and non-deficit patients at baseline. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>covariances</b> and repeated-measures <b>analysis</b> were performed to evaluate differences in brain volumes.

We show that kernel covariance estimation provides uniformly consistent estimators for the within-subject covariance matrices, and the semiparametric profile estimator with substituted nonparametric covariance is still semiparametrically efficient.

In this paper, I was investigating whether the dominance of local comparisons emerges in people’s self-evaluations regarding performance, satisfaction with the performance, and in Weiner’s attribution theory’s (1985, 2010) central categories: ability, test-difficulty, effort, and luck. In total, 126 students participated in the study; however, 114 persons’ data was used in subsequent analyses. Participants took a mental abilities test and received bogus feedback regarding their performance.

Additional lines of research, informed by the adaptationist reasoning characteristic of evolutionary psychology, focused on the ways in which specific kinds of perceived threats (e.g., threat of interpersonal violence), and contextual cues connoting vulnerability to those threats (e.g., ambient darkness), trigger specific kinds of prejudices against specific categories of people.|$|E

As the number of effects (i.e., main, interaction) become non-null, and as {{the magnitude of the}} non-null effects increase, there is an increase in Type I error, resulting in a complete failure of the statistic with as high as a 100% probability of making a false positive decision.
