The 63 points were the most scored by an Alabama team since defeating Vanderbilt 63–3 in 1979.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Hokies's defeat, Virginia Tech chose to start a new quarterback and a new {{offensive}} plan. Behind freshman Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies rolled to five straight victories, including a win over No.22 Clemson by 18points. During the winning streak, Sean Glennon, who had started at quarterback for the Hokies during the first two games of the season, returned to alternate possessions with Taylor in an unusual two-quarterback system. On October 25, the Hokies had a chance to make up for their early-season loss to LSU when they faced No.2 Boston College on <b>a</b> <b>Thursday</b> night in Blacksburg, Virginia. Though the Hokies dominated for most of the game, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan managed a late-game comeback to win the game 1410 with 11seconds remaining.|$|E

5|$|In their ninth game, however, third-ranked Virginia Tech {{suffered}} {{its first}} loss. On <b>a</b> <b>Thursday</b> night game at home, the Hokies lost 277 to the fifth-ranked Miami Hurricanes. Normally, {{a loss to}} the division-rival Hurricanes would have knocked the Hokies out of contention for the ACC Championship Game, as Miami had the tie-breaking head-to-head victory and was expected to win the remainder of its games. But because Virginia Tech won {{the rest of its}} games and the Hurricanes lost two ACC contests, (Virginia Tech's only ACC loss was to Miami) the Hokies won the Coastal Division championship and qualified for the championship game over Miami.|$|E
5|$|The Festivals are Nativity, Epiphany, the Baptism of our Lord, the Transfiguration, the Annunciation, Palm Sunday, Easter, the Ascension, Pentecost, Holy Trinity, All Saints, and Christ the King. Most {{of these}} festivals {{are tied to}} the {{moveable}} feast of Easter. Festivals take precedence over all other days, including Sundays, have their own collects and Eucharistic proper prefaces. Of the festivals, Christmas is considered to be twelve days in length (from December 25 until January 5) and Easter is fifty days in length (from Easter Sunday up to and inclusive of Pentecost). For Easter, Sundays are considered to be another part of the festival. For the Ascension which, falling on fortieth day of Easter, will always be on <b>a</b> <b>Thursday,</b> the festival is sometimes transferred to the Seventh Sunday of Easter in addition to or in place of the normal part of the Easter festival for that day.|$|E

5|$|The {{two teams}} met for <b>a</b> <b>Thursday</b> night game at Blacksburg, {{a time and}} site where the Hokies have {{traditionally}} excelled. In the first quarter, Maryland drove 56yards, but was held to a 46-yard field goal attempt, which was missed by Obi Egekeze. In the next series, Tech quarterback Sean Glennon led the Hokies on an 80-yard drive that culminated in a short pass to Greg Boone for a score. The next series went into the second quarter, and Maryland was again forced to attempt a field goal, which was made good. Hokies tailback Darren Evans then broke away for a 50-yard carry to the Maryland 30-yard line, and later capped it with a one-yard rush into the endzone. Before the half, Tech managed a field goal to expand their lead, 17–3.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina rose to No. 7 in the {{national}} college football polls, and the victory over Indiana was followed the next week by a 2817 win over No. 17 Stanford University. The two season-opening wins were followed by six more in succession. The Tar Heels beat Maryland, 4014, on September 20, and Virginia on September 27 by a score of 4820. Prior to the win against Virginia, North Carolina, rose from No. 7 to No. 5 in the polls, and remained at that level after the win. Texas Christian University fell 3110 to the Tar Heels on October 4, and Wake Forest lost to North Carolina, 3012, on October 11. After a week of inactivity, in which the Tar Heels rose to No. 4, North Carolina defeated in-state rival NC State by a score of 207, and after another week and a half, the Tar Heels beat Georgia Tech narrowly, 1613, in <b>a</b> <b>Thursday</b> night game.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, Boston College {{traveled}} to Blacksburg, Virginia, home of Virginia Tech, for <b>a</b> <b>Thursday</b> night game broadcast on ESPN. In heavy rain, Virginia Tech's defense dominated {{for most of}} the game. As time ran down, however, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan orchestrated twolate-game touchdown drives, scoring 14points in the final 2minutes to win 1410. The victory seemingly sealed Boston College's route to a national championship game, while the loss potentially jeopardized Virginia Tech's chances of being selected to play in the ACC Championship Game. Over the next two weeks, however, Boston College was upset by Florida State and Maryland. The Eagles rallied to win their final two gamesagainst Miami and Clemsonto clinch the division title. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, was undefeated through the remainder of its schedule, including a division-clinching win over its archrival, Virginia. This meant that the ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville would be a rematch between these two division champions.|$|E
