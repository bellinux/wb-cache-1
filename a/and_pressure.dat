5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about Eugene's {{isolation}} <b>and</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> {{his release from}} his isolation <b>and</b> <b>pressures.</b> I choose this topic based on my curiosity about Eugene's ability to survive although he was isolated <b>and</b> under <b>pressure.</b> I {{want to know what}} <b>pressures</b> Eugene has <b>and</b> how he can be released from them. In this thesis, I want to show Eugene's release, from an isolated <b>and</b> <b>pressured</b> boy to become a man who is successful in his life. For my methodology, I use library research to find literary and psychological theories to support my analysis of the novel. I am going to discuss Eugene's pressures, in this case they are the ones caused by his family and friends and his release from the pressures. Since Eugene is isolated <b>and</b> under <b>pressure,</b> it is difficult for him to release himself from those obstacles, because he has no self-confidence to do it Then, I find out that Eugene's self-confidence arises because of the Leonards, his teachers. From this finding, I conclude that Eugene's experience with the Leonards is the most important turning point that releases him from his isolation <b>and</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R

5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went into orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E

5|$|At {{the center}} of the Sun is the core region, a volume of {{sufficient}} temperature <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.|$|E
5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E

5|$|Geyser activity, {{like all}} hot spring activity, {{is caused by}} surface water {{gradually}} seeping down through the ground until it meets rock heated by magma. The geothermally heated water then rises back toward the surface by convection through porous and fractured rocks. Geysers differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected {{to one or more}} narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> tight rock.|$|E
