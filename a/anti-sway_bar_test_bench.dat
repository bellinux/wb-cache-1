50|$|An {{anti-roll}} <b>bar</b> (roll <b>bar,</b> <b>anti-sway</b> <b>bar,</b> sway bar, stabilizer bar) {{is a part}} of many automobile suspensions {{that helps}} reduce the body roll of a vehicle during fast cornering or over road irregularities. It connects opposite (left/right) wheels together through short lever arms linked by a torsion spring. A sway bar increases the suspension's roll stiffness—its resistance to roll in turns, independent of its spring rate in the vertical direction. The first stabilizer bar patent was awarded to Canadian inventor Stephen Coleman of Fredericton, New Brunswick on April 22, 1919.|$|R
25|$|The base model's SOHC {{inline-four}} engine produced 95hp (71kW) {{and had a}} 9.1:1 compression ratio. The {{more powerful}} 1990–1991 GSi used a 1.6L DOHC engine that produced 130hp (97kW) and had a 9.8:1 compression ratio.

5000|$|In the {{original}} Seven, the front lower A-arm (or [...] "wishbone") {{of the double}} wishbone suspension is traditional, but {{for the purpose of}} reducing weight, the upper suspension integrated an anti-roll (<b>anti-sway)</b> <b>bar</b> into a horizontal suspension arm. This approach formed a pseudo-wishbone which was semi-independent in nature. This approach worked well with early crossply tyres, but with later radials, the configuration seriously affected its adjustability.|$|R

50|$|The TXT-1 {{exhibits}} a straight-axle suspension system damped via silicone-filled shocks, the latter {{a departure from}} friction shocks used on the Clod Buster. Of note is the fixed-ratio cantilever arrangement actuating the shocks which lengthens the effective range through which the shocks travel, increasing suspension articulation. By design the vehicle is somewhat prone to stability-degrading torque steer and body roll. The truck features zip-ties retaining metal <b>anti-sway</b> <b>bars</b> which significantly improve stability.|$|R

50|$|The {{significance}} of the roll center can only be appreciated when the vehicle's center of mass is also considered. If {{there is a difference}} between the position of the center of mass and the roll center a moment arm is created. When the vehicle experiences angular acceleration due to cornering, the size of the moment arm, combined with the stiffness of the springs and anti-roll <b>bars</b> (<b>anti-sway</b> <b>bars</b> in some parts of the world), dictates how much the vehicle will roll. This has other effects too, such as dynamic load transfer.|$|R

By {{analyzing}} two old {{forms of}} hydraulic winch <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> (Traditional hydraulic winch <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> and throttling hydraulic winch <b>test</b> <b>bench),</b> the new hydraulic winch <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> applies a new energy recycle technology and avoids enormous energy consumption.

It also analyzes the working principles of the new <b>test</b> <b>bench’s</b> obverse processes. The displacement of the loading pump should adapt to the change of the diameter ratio of the main drum and the auxiliary drum, so we use one loading pump and limit its displacement to realize energy recycle.

40|$|Passive damping is used {{to reduce}} {{vibrations}} of machining tools. The drawback with the passive damping system {{is that it is}} adjusted to damp out vibrations in one restricted frequency range. Active damping uses real time measurements to dampen the vibrations and is not tuned for one specific frequency range. Teeness AS {{wants to be able to}} investigate different ways of regulating an active damping system on a physical <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> and to investigate if an Arduino is suited for regulating the system. This paper presents the design development of the physical <b>test</b> <b>bench,</b> simulations of the designed <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> and an electrical setup with Arduino as the regulating controller. Actuators were evaluated and purchased. The <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> was designed to fit the actuators using Siemens NX as CAD program. The components of the <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> were produced by Teeness AS. Simulations of the designed <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> were conducted using FEDEM to investigate the dynamics of the system. Requirements for the Arduino were investigated and regulating scripts were coded, tested and evaluated. The simulated <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> was able to significantly reduce the vibrations investigated. However there were some behaviors of the simulated <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> that differ from the measurements made of the physical <b>test</b> <b>bench.</b> This was most likely a result of the modeling of actuators. The results from the simulations give an indication of the general behavior of the <b>test</b> <b>bench,</b> but the use of exact values should be avoided. To improve the validity of the simulations, further work with the simulation of the actuators should be conducted. Using an Arduino as a control mechanism seems promising, but further work needs to be done to reduce the noise of the sensor data and the regulating script presented in this paper should be improved...|$|R
40|$|Sandvik Mining and Construction Oy {{manufactures}} drill rigs, {{which are}} machines used for rock drilling. A drill rig has {{one or more}} rock drills that perform the actual drilling. The rock drills are <b>tested</b> in <b>test</b> <b>benches,</b> which are automatic test systems. These drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are used mainly for assuring quality of manufactured rock drills. In {{the beginning of the}} thesis process, Sandvik had project plans on building new drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> for <b>testing</b> durability of new rock drill products in the product development stage. Durability testing involves long test runs where test phases are repeated several times. The new drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> required a new control system to be developed. The control system is an embedded system consisting of several components, some of which run the Linux operating system. Additionally, a desktop application needed to be developed for creating tests for the drill <b>test</b> <b>benches.</b> In this thesis a concept of a testing framework is created, which describes conceptually how the automatic tests for the drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are defined and run. Applicability of the concept is analyzed also in a broader context for testing various kinds of systems. An implementation of the testing framework concept for drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> is developed, which is the main focus of this thesis. All levels of the control system are described briefly from both hardware and software perspectives. However, the thesis will not go into details of other software components beyond the testing framework since they were not implemented by the author. The project plans for building new drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> based on the new control system were cancelled late in the process of writing this thesis. Therefore, no feedback from production use was received. The control system can, however, be deployed later in new drill <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> projects or when an old drill <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> control system is updated. Based on current assessment, the project has achieved its goals. The new software used for creating tests has better usability than the one used in a previous drill <b>test</b> <b>bench.</b> Maintainability of the control system is also considerably better than in previous drill <b>test</b> <b>benches...</b>|$|R

40|$|Two new <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for the combined measurement of the thermal properties and overall optical efficiencies of receivers for the use in parabolic trough collectors. In the first <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> two receivers are simultaneously irradiated by natural sunlight via parabolic troughs that are mounted on a two axis tracking stage. Shutters enable the variation of the aperture for quasi constant solar input power over the test period. The second, the solar simulator <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> consists of an elliptical cylinder with flat end reflectors. Metal halide lamps (HMI) and the receiver are positioned in the two respective focal lines. The <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are operated in two modes: Cold performance tests with water flow through the receiver at near ambient temperature in order to measure the optical efficiency in the stationary enthalpy increase, secondly hot testing with the empty receiver at typical operating temperature in order to compare irradiant power and steady state thermal loss power and calculate the efficiency. The <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are operated in combination with classic heat loss measurement, together the three <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> form a complementary set.
