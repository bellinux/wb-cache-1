All three tail surfaces were all-moving, eliminating the requirement for separate elevators and rudders while preventing control lock-ups during high speeds.

40|$|Modelling {{the dynamic}} and {{acoustic}} behaviour of structurally advanced components (e. g. composites, lightweight structures, metamaterials) {{used in the}} transportation and aerospace industry remain a challenging and yet crucial issue. Although a considerable <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>be</b> <b>dedicated</b> {{to the prediction of}} their dynamical behaviour over the past years, predicting the vibro-acoustic response of these structures remains a difficult, often computationally expensive task. Wave-based methods have shown potential for describing the local dynamics of composite periodics in the medium/high frequency range, using Bloch theory to reduce the modelling effort to a waveguide's unit-cell. It is therefore possible to retrieve broadband wave dispersion characteristics from refined FEM of the composite unit-cell. This should enable design optimization at the micro- or mesoscopic scale in structures exhibiting arbitrarily high geometrical of material complexity. Yet, a further implementation of these methods for the design and structural optimization of composites requires a better description of the underlying meso-scale effects, which are responsible for various transition effects, wave conversion or local resonances. These phenomena can considerably affect the overall dynamic and acoustic response of the structure, but require the dispersion characteristics to be computed with fast and accurate models. In this work a reduced formulation is introduced for the Wave Finite Element framework, providing several orders of magnitude reduction of the computational effort. As it enables accurate observation of various wave frequency-conversion phenomena occurring within composite structures, the method it used to explore the so-called transition bandwidth in sandwich waveguides with 3 D parametric core geometries. status: publishe...|$|R

For centuries, the primary focus of science was mainly on natural events, but as the new technologies allowed to gather data from human interactions, it was natural for scientists to use this new information in order to apply the same logic to social systems, including science itself.   Since the late 19 th century, when the first modern scientific journals <b>were</b> published, science <b>has</b> seen a constant rise in both its size and productivity, thanks to the standardization of research practices and the building of an international community that actively helps to push forward the limits of human knowledge. As science itself went from being a purely intellectual endeavor to a complex social, economical and political system, it is no surprise that a lot of <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dedicate</b> in recent years to the study of the underlying mechanisms of science, aided by the explosion of means of communication that allow collaborations and exchange of information at instant speed across the globe, leaving behind digital traces that provide valuable data to study. The continuous exponential growth of science however, causes also difficulties in analyzing objectively the patterns and statistics that scientific data can reveal: for example a paper from the early 20 th century would rarely get more than 100 citations, while now it is not uncommon for publications to pass the 10 thousand citation mark.   This thesis follows these attempts in trying to grasp how science works, by investigating the connections, i. e. citations, that exists between scientific publications and how these connections create structures and patterns. It shows that typical patterns in citation count and diffusion of information between fields is heavily influenced by the rate of growth of science, thus suggesting to use the number of publications as a better measure of time. It shows that there is a lag between breakthrough discoveries and the time when they are recognized, thus suggesting that we might be either running out of discoveries or rather having too much of them, in either case an extreme phenomenon. It shows that the community of publications which builds around an original successful paper has a typical life cycle, with an initial clustering, followed by an inevitable breaking down. Finally, it offers a new way of quantifying the impact of publications across time based on their cumulative impact on the overall corpus of scientific material...|$|R

We show that the skin of the box-patterned gecko (Lucasium sp.) consists of dome shaped scales arranged in a hexagonal patterning. The scales comprise of spinules (hairs), from several hundred nanometres to several microns in length, with a sub-micron spacing and a small radius of curvature typically from 10 to 20 nm. This micro and nano structure of the skin exhibited ultralow adhesion with contaminating particles. The topography also provides a superhydrophobic, anti-wetting barrier which can self clean by the action of low velocity rolling or impacting droplets of various size ranges from microns to several millimetres. Water droplets which are sufficiently small (10 - 100 mu m) can easily access valleys between the scales for efficient self-cleaning and due to their dimensions can self-propel off the surface enhancing their mobility and cleaning effect. In addition, we demonstrate that the gecko skin has an antibacterial action where Gram-negative bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis) are killed when exposed to the surface however eukaryotic cell compatibility (with human stem cells) is demonstrated. The multifunctional features of the gecko skin provide a potential natural template for man-made applications where specific control of liquid, solid and biological contacts is required...|$|R
