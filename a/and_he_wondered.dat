25|$|McGovern {{had failed}} to act quickly when he learned of the mental health {{problems}} (though not their severe extent) because his own daughter was seriously depressed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> what effect dumping Eagleton because of his depression would have on her. Ultimately, Eagleton threatened that if McGovern tried to force him off the ticket, he would fight the move. Eagleton conditioned his resignation on McGovern's releasing a statement, written by Eagleton, that Eagleton's health was fine and that McGovern had no issues with Eagleton's mental status.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{felt that}} the main story {{employed}} [...] "one of the show's most reliable running jokes". Furthermore, he felt that Michael softening to Toby was an interesting element to the episode, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> if [...] "this was a one-time thing, or if Michael's treatment of Toby will be softened, even a little." [...] Sepinwall also felt that Pam's story was the stronger of the two subplots, and felt that an office controlled by her would be interesting. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode {{four out of five}} stars and called it [...] "pleasant". While he noted that each of the three stories [...] "weren't flat out funny", he wrote that they were all [...] "enjoyable". Furthermore, he positively commented on the main plot, noting that the Michael and Toby rivalry was fun.|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of Carmen continued through succeeding generations of American opera-goers; {{by the beginning}} of 2011 the Met alone had performed it almost a thousand times. It enjoyed similar success in other American cities and {{in all parts of the}} world, in many different languages. Carmen's habanera from act 1, and the toreador's song [...] "Votre toast" [...] from act 2, are among the most popular and best-known of all operatic arias, the latter [...] "a splendid piece of swagger" [...] according to Newman, [...] "against which the voices and the eyebrows of purists have long been raised in vain". Most of the productions outside France followed the example created in Vienna and incorporated lavish ballet interludes and other spectacles, a practice which Mahler abandoned in Vienna when he revived the work there in 1900. In 1919 Bizet's [...] aged contemporary Camille Saint-Saëns was still complaining about the [...] "strange idea" [...] of adding a ballet, which he considered [...] "a hideous blemish in that masterpiece", <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> why Bizet's widow, at that time still living, permitted it.|$|E

50|$|The song is a ballad, with Endrigo {{expressing his}} love for the title character. He sings, however, that she never stays with him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> about what she is doing. Nonetheless, his {{feelings}} for her remain unaltered.|$|R
500|$|On Saturday, 9 July 1720, London v Kent at White Conduit Fields was won by London. In this match, two London fielders {{were badly}} injured by {{a clash of}} heads. H. T. Waghorn noted a lull in the {{advertising}} and reporting of cricket after this game <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> if that was due to a perception that the sport was dangerous. If there was a lapse in cricket at this time, the more likely causes would be either: (a) the South Sea Bubble which ruined many investors and so could have reduced cricket patronage; or (b), as Waghorn himself mentions, [...] "the (news)papers were small, and space limited, the advertising and reporting (of) matches ceased". The South Sea Bubble may have had an economic impact on investment and gambling as, when the South Sea Company {{was found to be}} insolvent, its crash in 1720 caused massive repercussions throughout the economy and many formerly prosperous investors were ruined. This could have included cricket patrons, while a potential impact on reporting was the application of stamp duty to newspapers as this increased their publication costs and probably caused publishers to reduce paper size with less room for sports coverage.|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} {{released}} from the album was [...] "The Statue Got Me High". The titular lyrics originally started out as the dummy line [...] "The Apple of My Eye". However, Linnell soon conceived the line that would become the title, and he was amused at the juxtaposition of a statue—something [...] "utterly immobile and … in the past"—completely [...] "blowing somebody's mind". [...] "Spider" [...] is an eclectic song that was made when Flansburgh and Linnell were experimenting with a sampler. Linnell provided {{almost all of the}} voices, save for the line, [...] "must stop!" [...] which was spoken by Flansburgh. Flansburgh himself was responsible for the bongos, horns, and various sound effects. The second single from the album, [...] "The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)", was spawned from a jam session of The Tokens song [...] "The Lion Sleeps Tonight". The song was also originally intended to simply be titled [...] "The Guitar". Due to the legal ramifications of including the [...] "Lion Sleeps Tonight" [...] motif, Elektra required the band to add the name of the original song to the title. The song features Laura Cantrell on the chorus. [...] "Dinner Bell" [...] references Ivan Pavlov, and his experimentations in classical conditioning by using a dinner bell to cause his dog to salivate. According to Rolling Stone, [...] "Narrow Your Eyes" [...] is a [...] "touching breakup song that pays vocal tribute to The Beatles and The Four Seasons". Spin magazine called the song [...] "the most direct lyrically and simplest musically." [...] The opening line of [...] "See the Constellation"—described by Rolling Stone as [...] "a psychedelic/New Wave potion"—references railroad tracks and was inspired by a promotional photo of an Elektra recording artist who was resting on tracks. Flansburgh was struck by the [...] "contrary elements of the image", <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered,</b> [...] "How relaxing can that kind of rest be unless you’ve given up on everything else?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{there was}} a lack of vision and serious {{interest}} in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in Washington. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard's rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding. Between the World Wars, the Guggenheim Foundation was the main source of funding for Goddard's research. Goddard's liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian Eugene Emme, but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans. Interestingly, Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he [...] "would not be surprised if the research would become something in the nature of a race" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> how soon the European [...] "theorists" [...] would begin to build rockets.|$|E
5000|$|The Emma Peel episode [...] "Too Many Christmas Trees" [...] sees Steed {{receive a}} Christmas card from Mrs Gale <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> {{what she can}} be doing in Fort Knox, a cheeky {{reference}} to Blackmans appearance in Goldfinger.|$|R
50|$|In February 2011, David Deterding, an Associate Professor at University Brunei Darussalam {{questioned}} {{and raised}} some linguistic questions after reading some entries posted on his blog.

5000|$|The lyrics chronicle a lost promise; {{the singer}} {{talks about how}} a {{relationship}} failed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> [...] "how the hell'd we wind up like this".

60|$|There was a moment's silence. Louise <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{exchanged}} <b>wondering</b> glances.|$|R
60|$|She nodded. Her parasol drooped {{a little}} his way, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> {{whether it was}} because she desired her face hidden.|$|E

60|$|He {{said he had}} met a {{good many}} Americans, and liked them, but he couldn't see {{for the life of}} him why they do some things English people don't do, and don't do things English people do do. For instance, <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> why we don't drink tea for breakfast. Miss Pondar had made it for him, knowing he'd want it, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> why Americans drink coffee when such good tea as that was comes in their reach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some old enemy I have forgotten," [...] {{reasoned}} the captive. <b>And</b> then <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> where <b>he</b> {{was being}} taken, {{and for what}} purpose.|$|R

50|$|The scene {{moves to}} modern day Tokyo, where {{the protagonist of}} the story, Takakage Takasaka, wakes up {{realising}} {{he has had a}} wet dream.
