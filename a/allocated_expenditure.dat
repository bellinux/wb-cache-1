50|$|Much of the Arabian Peninsula was {{politically}} unified by 1932 {{in the third}} and current Saudi State, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The military campaign led by King Abdulaziz ibn Saud and his Bedouin army of tribesmen conquered the Hejaz and ousted the ruling Hashemite clan. The new Najdi rulers, nomadic Arabs largely tribal and illiterate, found themselves at the reins of a highly sophisticated society. A cohesive political structure based on the Majlis al-Shura (consultative council) system had been in place for centuries. A central administrative body managed an annual budget which <b>allocated</b> <b>expenditure</b> on secondary schools, military and police forces. Similarly, the religious fabric of the Najd and the Hejaz were vastly different. Traditional Hejazi cultural customs and rituals were almost entirely religious in nature. Celebrations honouring Muhammad, his family and companions, reverence of deceased saints, visitation of shrines, tombs and holy sites connected with any of these were among the customs indigenous to Hejazi Islam. As administrative authority of the Hejaz passed into the hands of Najdi Wahabi Muslims from the interior, the Wahabi Ulama viewed local religious practices as unfounded superstition superseding codified religious sanction that was considered a total corruption of religion and the spreading of heresy. What followed was a removal of the physical infrastructure, tombs, mausoleums, mosques and sites associated with the family and companions of Muhammad.|$|E

We are able to <b>allocate</b> <b>expenditures</b> per pupil at the *individual* student and family income level. This allows us to examine both student and school district characteristics and to assess several measures of equality of expenditure across the income distribution of parents and by funding sources. We find a surprising degree of equality in the actual amounts expended per child in low- vs. high-income families. But adjusting for student needs to reach equivalent education expenditures results in much greater inequality over the income distribution. Policy implications for school finance and increased equality of eduational opportunity are drawn in closing. ...|$|R

Some state governments finance {{most of their}} highways, whereas in other states similar roads are financed locally. Larger governments attain scale economies. However, {{they also tend to}} be more bureaucratic and have higher operating costs, all else being equal, because of problems such as span of control. A study was done to relate highway expenditures with the share of expenditure by state governments to determine how governments should <b>allocate</b> <b>expenditure</b> on all roads in a state. Highways are divided into two hierarchical classes (higher and lower), governments into two layers (state and local), and costs into capital and operations and maintenance. Regression models to predict different highway expenditures on each highway class as a function of utilization, capacity, and funding shares are estimated. It is found that there is a share of expenditures by each level of government for each highway class that results in a minimum expenditure for eac...|$|R

Both sub-national expenditures ratio and sub national revenue ratio were used to measure fiscal decentralisation in Nigeria.

That is, there is a long run relationship between fiscal decentralisation and economic development. The results from the VEC granger causality test showed a unidirectional causality run from economic development to fiscal decentralization i. e. economic development granger causes fiscal decentralization (only sub-national revenue decentralization ratio) in Nigeria. By implication, economic benefits derived from fiscal decentralization are the products of economic development simply because as economy is developing, these benefits emerge in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|Government {{expenditure}} on {{elementary education}} in Karnataka {{has been increasing}} {{in recent years to}} improve the access to and quality of schooling. Despite the progress made towards universalizing education, low enrollment rates and high dropout rates continue to exist, especially at the upper primary level. This paper uses a block level data set from the 2004 Karnataka Child Census to explore the tradeoff between perceived costs and benefits that affect the demand for primary education. By modeling enrollment and completion rates as a function of block, teacher/classroom, and school characteristics, the determinants of expected gain and opportunity costs to education are investigated. The results indicate that while both perceived benefits and costs appear to be important in driving the demand for elementary schooling, benefits appear to be especially important to enrollment, whereas completion seems to be affected by both perceived benefits and costs. These findings indicate the complexities of education reform and the importance of <b>allocating</b> <b>expenditures</b> according to appropriate weights to those factors which best address household concerns and are most valuable to improving the quality of elementary schools...|$|R
40|$|In a {{world of}} perfect {{certainty}} and perfect capital markets agents <b>allocate</b> <b>expenditure</b> {{in such a way}} that the marginal utility of discounted expenditure is the same in each period. In this paper we present a test of whether any particular series of discounted prices and quantities can be exactly reconciled with a utility function and marginal utility of discounted expenditure that do not change from period to period. We find that U. K., U. S. and Canadian postwar aggregate data all reject our condition, although it is not rejected for long sub-periods. We show that our results for the U. K. suggest particular modifications to the strong form of the rational expectations hypothesis that our conditions test. In fact these data are exactly consistent with a number of alternative hypotheses. From this we argue that time series data are ill suited to parametric testing of any of the competing hypotheses on the inter-temporal allocation of expenditure.

40|$|After {{the reform}} of local {{government}} organisation and finance following Act 142 / 1990, Reforming local autonomy, Italian councils can exercise considerably more discretion in setting their expenditure and taxation levels; in this paper a model in the microeconomic tradition is developed to predict the likely changes in these councils' behaviour. The model {{is based on the}} assumption that local governments behave as if they were maximising a nested Stone - Geary utility function; at the first stage of the utility-maximisation process, they set up the overall level of taxation, and at the second level they decide how to <b>allocate</b> <b>expenditure</b> among the different services. The results suggest that in the first years after the reform a utility-based incremental budgeting model could explain the determination of expenditure and its composition. Although the model has strong microeconomic foundations, the interpretation of the results may need to be tentative because the data used in the estimation procedure are for a transition year from the old to the new system. The results of the estimated econometric model were then used to predict the likely changes in expenditure which will be brought about by the introduction to the system of a locally managed property tax. ...|$|R

Introduction Cardiovascular diseases are Australia’s largest health problem, accounting for 50, 294 deaths in 2002 and affecting 3. 67 million Australians in 2001 (AIHW 2004 b). In 1998, 1. 1 million Australians had disabling conditions associated with cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular diseases are the most expensive diseases in Australia in terms of health expenditure. They were responsible for 11 % of total allocated recurrent health system expenditure—$ 5. 48 billion in 2000 – 01 (AIHW 2004 a). The following is an overview of total <b>allocated</b> health system <b>expenditure</b> associated with cardiovascular diseases in Australia.

Estimates are presented by area of expenditure: hospitals, high level services in aged care homes, out-of-hospital medical services, dental and other health professional services, pharmaceuticals and research.
