Her {{side of the family}} (though her not so much) <b>all</b> <b>believe</b> in fortune-telling and other clairvoyant-like skills. Noboru recommends Malta Kano, and she and her assistant sister, Creta, help Toru in finding the cat using their vague insight of the future. Creta meets Toru and begins to tell him the story of her past, involving being raped by Noboru. Among other events that occur, Toru notices one day that Kumiko is wearing perfume that has been gifted to her by some unknown person. The cat remains missing, and the first section ends with Lieutenant Mamiya telling Toru about his wartime experiences.|$|E
25|$|This {{picture of}} Spinoza's {{determinism}} is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in Ethics: ″the infant {{believes that it}} is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … <b>All</b> <b>believe</b> that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″ Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience {{that we have a}} false ideal of choice predicated upon this.|$|E

25|$|Returning outside, Kruvajan and Gorobec meet Katia Vajda. She {{tells them}} that {{she lives with her}} father and brother Constantine in a nearby castle that the villagers <b>all</b> <b>believe</b> is haunted. Struck by her {{haunting}} beauty and sadness, Gorobec instantly becomes smitten with Katia. The two men then leave her and drive to an inn. Meanwhile Asa is brought back to life by Kruvajan's blood. She contacts Javuto telepathically and orders him to rise from his grave. He does so and goes to Prince Vajda's castle, where Vajda holds up a crucifix to ward the reanimated corpse away. However, Vajda is so terrified by the visit that he becomes paralyzed with fear. Katia and Constantin send a servant to fetch Dr. Kruvajan, but the servant is killed before he can reach the inn. It is the evil Javuto who arrives to bring Kruvajan to the castle. Javuto leads Kruvajan to Asa's crypt, and Kruvajan watches in horror as her coffin explodes. From its ruins, the witch hypnotizes Kruvajan and says she needs a few more drops of his blood, offering him eternal life (and a night of pleasure) in return. Asa then kisses him, turning him into her servant. By Asa's command, Kruvajan enters Vajda's room and murders him.|$|E

Some {{of the information that}} Griswold asserted or implied was that Poe was expelled from the University of Virginia and that Poe had tried to seduce his guardian John Allan's second wife. Even so, Griswold's attempts only drew attention to Poe's work; readers were thrilled at the idea of reading the works of an [...] "evil" [...] man. Griswold's characterization of Poe and the false information he originated appeared consistently in Poe biographies for the next two decades.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with many}} critics praising {{the return of}} Mac and the increased role of peripheral characters, the resolution to the rape mystery, and the setup of the next major story arc. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "great". He wrote that [...] "Spit & Eggs" [...] was a welcome episode for longtime fans, as it involved several plots converging {{in a way that}} he found satisfactory. He praised the final few scenes, writing that the episode transitions well into the next mystery of Dean O'Dell's death by developing it slowly {{over the course of the}} season's prior episodes, but he was more mixed towards the reveal of Mercer as the rapist, commenting [...] "the ultimate revelation can't help but be a little underwhelming, since not enough time has been spent on any of the credible suspects to really have a good handle on them or be invested in them one way or another." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, who was quite critical of the rape storyline in earlier episodes, said that the conclusion made the storyline slightly better overall. He praised the double reveal of Mercer and Moe as accomplices, stating, [...] "That twist overall is effective because it plays on everyone's expectations. The characters <b>all</b> <b>believe</b> there is a single culprit here. [...] It makes the revelations more plausible, while also making the need for those revelations less intense (the two are related)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Luther's 1524 creedal hymn [...] "" [...] ("We <b>All</b> <b>Believe</b> in One True God") is a three-stanza {{confession}} of faith prefiguring Luther's 1529 three-part {{explanation of the}} Apostles' Creed in the Small Catechism. Luther's hymn, adapted and expanded from an earlier German creedal hymn, gained widespread use in vernacular Lutheran liturgies as early as 1525. Sixteenth-century Lutheran hymnals also included [...] "Wir glauben all" [...] among the catechetical hymns, although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as Trinitarian rather than catechetical, and 20th-century Lutherans rarely used the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune.|$|E

Throughout the play, Ann is often {{referred}} to as pretty, beautiful, and intelligent-looking and as [...] "Annie". She had a relationship with Larry Keller before his disappearance, and has since moved on because she knows the truth of his fate. She hopes that the Kellers will consent to her marriage to Larry's brother, Chris, with whom she has corresponded by mail for two years. Ann soon finds out that the neighbors <b>all</b> <b>believe</b> that Joe is guilty, and eventually finds out the truth after a visit from her older brother George. Ann is the knowledge-bearer in the play: finally, unable to convince Kate that Larry is gone forever, Ann reveals a letter from Larry stating his intention to commit suicide having learned of his father’s implied guilt.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Quince and {{his band}} of six labourers ("rude mechanicals," [...] as they are {{described}} by Puck) have arranged to perform their play about Pyramus and Thisbe for Theseus' wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania's bower, for their rehearsal. Bottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for a jackass) transforms his head into that of a donkey. When Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom's confusion. Determined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself. Titania, having received the love-potion, is awakened by Bottom's singing and immediately {{falls in love with}} him. She lavishes him with the attention of her and her fairies, and while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes the changeling. Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania, orders Puck to remove the donkey's head from Bottom, and arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius and Lysander will <b>all</b> <b>believe</b> they have been dreaming when they awaken. Puck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena's love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart. Eventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade. Once they fall asleep, Puck administers the love potion to Lysander again, claiming all will be well in the morning.|$|E

In early September 2006, ahead of the season three premiere episode, DeLay wrote, [...] "Sara Evans has been a strong supporter of the Republican Party and represents good American values in the media.
