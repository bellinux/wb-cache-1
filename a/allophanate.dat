5000|$|Purple-K, {{also known}} as PKP, is a dry-chemical fire {{suppression}} agent used in some dry chemical fire extinguishers. It {{is the second most}} effective dry chemical in fighting class B (flammable liquid) fires after Monnex (potassium <b>allophanate),</b> and can be used against some energized electrical equipment fires (USA class C fires). It has about 4-5 times more effectiveness against class B fires than carbon dioxide, and more than twice that of sodium bicarbonate. Some fire extinguishers are capable of operation in temperatures down to −54 °C or up to +49 °C. Dry chemical works by directly inhibiting the chemical chain reaction which forms one of the four sides of the fire tetrahedron (heat + oxygen + fuel + chemical chain reaction = fire). To a much smaller degree it also has a smothering effect by excluding oxygen from the fire.

The dependency of apparent activation energy on conversion led to the identification of two different kinetic models, each involving two activation energies: a phenomenological model based on the Kamal–Sourour equation with non integer reaction exponents; and a new semi-mechanistic model assuming a main second order reaction between alcohols and isocyanates forming urethane linkages and a secondary reversible reaction forming <b>allophanates</b> that is known to become significant above 120 °C.

40|$|Growth {{substrates}} containing an s-triazine ring {{are typically}} metabolized by bacteria to liberate 3 mol of ammonia via the intermediate cyanuric acid. Over a 25 -year period, {{a number of}} original research papers and reviews have stated that cyanuric acid is metabolized in two steps to the 2 -nitrogen intermediate urea. In the present study, <b>allophanate,</b> not urea, was shown to be the 2 -nitrogen intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism in all the bacteria examined. Six different experimental results supported this conclusion: (i) synthetic <b>allophanate</b> was shown to readily decarboxylate to form urea under acidic extraction and chromatography conditions used in previous studies; (ii) alkaline extraction methods were used to stabilize and detect <b>allophanate</b> in bacteria actively metabolizing cyanuric acid; (iii) the kinetic course of <b>allophanate</b> formation and disappearance was consistent with its being an intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism, and no urea was observed in those experiments; (iv) protein extracts from cells grown on cyanuric acid contained <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase activity; (v) genes encoding the enzymes AtzE and AtzF, which produce and hydrolyze <b>allophanate,</b> respectively, were found in several cyanuric acid-metabolizing bacteria; and (vi) TrzF, an AtzF homolog found in Enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and shown to have <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase activity. In addition, we have observed {{that there are a}} large number of genes homologous to atzF and trzF distributed in phylogenetically distinct bacteria.

In view of these observations, it was surprising to find that on induction at 22 degrees C, approximately 2 to 6 min elapsed between the appearance of <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase and urea carboxylase activities. In search of an explanation for this apparent paradox, we determined {{whether or not a}} detectable period of time elapsed between the appearance of <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase activity and activation of the urea carboxylase domain by the addition of biotin.

A steady-state level of biotin-free enzyme was reached 16 min after induction and persisted indefinitely thereafter. These data are consistent with the suggestion that sequential induction of <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase and urea carboxylase activities results from the time required to covalently bind biotin to the latter domain of the protein...|$|E

40|$|TrzF, the <b>allophanate</b> {{hydrolase}} from Enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned, overexpressed in {{the presence}} of a chaperone protein, and purified to homogeneity. Native TrzF had a subunit molecular weight of 65, 401 and a subunit stoichiometry of α 2 and did not contain significant levels of metals. TrzF showed time-dependent inhibition by phenyl phosphorodiamidate and is a member of the amidase signature protein family. TrzF was highly active in the hydrolysis of <b>allophanate</b> but was not active with urea, despite having been previously considered a urea amidolyase. TrzF showed lower activity with malonamate, malonamide, and biuret. The <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, AtzF, was also shown to hydrolyze biuret slowly. Since biuret and <b>allophanate</b> are consecutive metabolites in cyanuric acid metabolism, the low level of biuret hydrolase activity can have physiological significance. A recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing atzD, encoding cyanuric acid hydrolase that produces biuret, and atzF grew slowly on cyanuric acid as a source of nitrogen. The amount of growth produced was consistent with the liberation of 3 mol of ammonia from cyanuric acid. In vitro, TrzF was shown to hydrolyze biuret to liberate 3 mol of ammonia.

40|$|In the {{unicellular}} green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardi (strain y- 1), {{synthesis of}} the enzymes required for urea hydrolysis is under substrate induction control by urea and under end product repression control by ammonia. Hydrolysis of urea if effected by the sequential action of the discrete enzymes urea carboxylase and <b>allophanate</b> lyase, collectively called urea amidolyase. The carboxylase converts urea to <b>allophanate</b> in a reaction requiring biotin, adenosine 5 '-triphosphate, and Mg 2 +. The lyase hydrolzyes <b>allophanate</b> to ammonium ions and bicarbonate. Neither activity is present in more than trace amounts when cultures are grown with ammonia or urea plus ammonia, or when they are starved for nitrogen for 8 h. Urea {{in the absence of}} ammonia induces both activities 10 to 100 times the basal levels. Addition of ammonia to an induced culture causes complete cessation of carboxylase accumulation and an 80 % depression of lyase accumulation. Ammonia does not reduce urea uptake by repressed cells, so it does not prevent induction by the mechanism of inducer exclusion. The unicellular green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa (strain 3 Emerson) also has discrete carboxylase and lyase enzymes, but only the carboxylase exhibits metabolic control...|$|E
40|$|Urea amidolyase (UAL) {{is a key}} {{virulence}} {{factor that}} regulates the yeast to hyphae switch in the opportunistic pathogen, Candida albicans. UAL is a multi-domain enzyme with two enzyme activities: urea carboxylase (UC) and <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase (AH). UC is a biotin-dependent carboxylase that adds a carboxyl group to urea to make <b>allophanate</b> by the coordinated action of three domains. <b>Allophanate</b> is subsequently hydrolyzed into NH 3 and CO 2 in the AH domain. Studies on the structure and function of UAL may lead to treatments for systemic candidiasis and can serve to clarify the molecular basis for multi-functional swinging arm enzymes. In the present study, the first structure of AH was solved by X-ray crystallography. Site-directed mutagenesis and steady-state kinetic analysis of Granulibacter bethesdensis AH reveal a role for two residues, Tyr 299 and Arg 307, in maintaining substrate stringency and providing transition state stabilization. In addition, as UAL activity is essential for urea-dependent growth of yeast, a yeast genetic screen was developed to identify key functional residues in UAL.

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae can utilize {{allantoin}} as a sole nitrogen {{source by}} degrading it to ammonia, “CO 2,” and glyoxylate. We have previously shown that {{synthesis of the}} allantoin degradative enzymes is contingent upon the presence of <b>allophanate,</b> the last intermediate in the pathway. The reported repression of arginase by ammonia prompted us to ascertain {{whether or not the}} allantoin degradative system would respond in a similar manner. We observed that the differential rates of allantoinase and <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase synthesis were not decreased appreciably when comparing cultures grown on urea to those grown on urea plus ammonia. These experiments were also performed using the strain and conditions previously reported by Dubois, Grenson, and Wiame. We found <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase production to be twofold repressed by ammonia when that strain was grown on glucose-urea plus ammonia medium. If, however, serine or a number of other readily metabolized amino acids were provided in place of ammonia, production of the allantoin degradative enzymes was quickly (within 20 min) and severely repressed in both strains. We conclude that repression previously attributed to ammonia may result from its metabolism to amino acids and other metabolites...|$|E
40|$|AtzF, <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase, is a {{recently}} discovered {{member of the}} amidase signature family that catalyzes the terminal reaction during metabolism of s-triazine ring compounds by bacteria. In the present study, the atzF gene from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP was cloned and expressed as a His-tagged protein, and the protein was purified and characterized. AtzF had a deduced subunit molecular mass of 66, 223, based on the gene sequence, and an estimated holoenzyme molecular mass of 260, 000. The active protein did not contain detectable metals or organic cofactors. Purified AtzF hydrolyzed <b>allophanate</b> with a kcat/Km of 1. 1 × 104 s− 1 M− 1, and 2 mol of ammonia was released per mol <b>allophanate.</b> The substrate range of AtzF was very narrow. Urea, biuret, hydroxyurea, methylcarbamate, and other structurally analogous compounds were not substrates for AtzF. Only malonamate, which strongly inhibited <b>allophanate</b> hydrolysis, was an alternative substrate, with a greatly reduced kcat/Km of 21 s− 1 M− 1. Data suggested that the AtzF catalytic cycle proceeds through a covalent substrate-enzyme intermediate. AtzF reacts with malonamate and hydroxylamine to generate malonohydroxamate, potentially derived from hydroxylamine capture of an enzyme-tethered acyl group. Three putative catalytically important residues, one lysine and two serines, were altered by site-directed mutagenesis, each with complete loss of enzyme activity. The identity of a putative serine nucleophile was probed using phenyl phosphorodiamidate that was {{shown to be a}} time-dependent inhibitor of AtzF. Inhibition was due to phosphoroamidation of Ser 189 as shown by liquid chromatography/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The modified residue corresponds in sequence alignments to the nucleophilic serine previously identified in other members of the amidase signature family. Thus, AtzF affects the cleavage of three carbon-to-nitrogen bonds via a mechanism similar to that of enzymes catalyzing single-amide-bond cleavage reactions. AtzF orthologs appear to be widespread among bacteria...|$|E

40|$|Degradation of allantoin, allantoate, or urea by Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{requires}} {{the participation of}} four enzymes and four transport systems. Production of the four enzymes {{and one of the}} active transport systems is inducible; <b>allophanate,</b> the last intermediate of the pathway, functions as the inducer. The involvement of <b>allophanate</b> in the expression of five distinct genes suggested that they might be regulated by a common element. This suggestion is now supported by the isolation of a new class of mutants (dal 80). Strains possessing lesions in the DAL 80 locus produce the five inducible activities at high, constitutive levels. Comparable constitutive levels of activity were also observed in doubly mutant strains (durl dal 80) which are unable to synthesize <b>allophanate.</b> This, with the observation that arginase activity remained at its uninduced, basal level in strains mutated at the DAL 80 locus, eliminates internal induction as the basis for constitutive enzyme synthesis. Mutations in dal 80 are recessive to wild-type alleles. The DAL 80 locus has been located and is not linked to any of the structural genes of the allantoin pathway. Synthesis of the five enzymes produced constitutively in dal 80 - 1 -containing mutants remains normally sensitive to nitrogen repression even though the dal 80 - 1 mutation is present. From these observations we conclude that production of the allantoin-degrading enzymes is regulated by the DAL 80 gene product and that induction and repression of enzyme synthesis can be cleanly separated mutationally...|$|E

This conclusion is based upon the observation that: (i) wild-type strains produced a large amount of allantoinase upon addition of allantoin, allantoate, ureidoglycolate, or urea to the medium, (ii) no increase in activity was observed unless the added compound could be metabolized to <b>allophanate,</b> (iii) strains lacking <b>allophanate</b> hydrolase contained large amounts of allantoinase {{even in the absence of}} added urea, and (iv) the urea analogue, formamide, was capable of inducing allantoinase synthesis in wild-type strains but would not serve this function in a strain lacking urea carboxylase...|$|E
