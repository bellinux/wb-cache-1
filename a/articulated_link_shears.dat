The specimen {{is to examine the}} behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> by using diagonal stiffener on web part under static monotonic and cyclic load. The cyclic loading pattern conducted in the experiment is adjusted according to AISC loading standards 2005. Analysis was carried out using non-linear finite element method using MSC/NASTRAN software. Link was modeled as CQUAD shell element. Along the boundary of the loading area the nodal are constraint to produce only one direction loading. The length of the link in this analysis is 400 mm of the steel profile of WF 200. 100. Important parameters considered to effect significantly to the performance of <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> have been analyzed, namely flange and web thicknesses,, thickness and length of web stiffener, thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric of diagonal stiffener. The behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> with diagonal web stiffener was compared with the behavior of standard link designed based on AISC 2005 criteria. Analysis results show that diagonal web stiffener is capable to increase <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> performance in terms of stiffness, strength and energy dissipation in supporting lateral load. However, differences in displacement ductility’s between <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> with diagonal stiffener and <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> based on AISC standards have not shown to be significant.

Experimental testing apparently has shown results of the same behavior as predicted in the numerical study.

Ideally, robots are able to autonomously infer articulation models by observation. In this paper, we present an approach to learn kinematic models by inferring the connectivity of rigid parts and the articulation models for the corresponding links.

To obtain parameter-free models, we seek for low-dimensional manifolds of latent action variables in order to provide the best explanation of the given observations. The mapping from the constrained manifold of an <b>articulated</b> <b>link</b> to the work space is learned by means of Gaussian process regression.
