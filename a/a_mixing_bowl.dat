50|$|Mixing: The {{ingredients}} are all placed in <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> {{at once and}} combined together. A variation of this technique is to add ingredients sequentially. This mixing process may be done by hand kneading or by machine. Once fermentation has commenced, it will continue until {{the heat of the}} oven kills the yeast during baking. For fast fermentations, long, intense mixing techniques are recommended for dough development, whereas for long-fermented doughs, short-mixing techniques on slow speeds or hand kneading may be used with sufficient later folding.|$|E

40|$|Lower back injuries, {{specifically}} lumbar stress fractures, {{account for}} the most lost playing time in professional cricket. The aims {{of this study were}} to quantify the proportion of lower trunk motion used during the delivery stride of fast bowling and {{to examine the relationship between}} the current fast bowling action classification system and potentially injurious kinematics of the lower trunk. Three-dimensional kinematic data were collected from 50 male professional fast bowlers during a standing active range of motion trial and three fast bowling trials. A high percentage of the fast bowlers used <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bowling</b> action attributable to having shoulder counter-rotation greater than 30 Â°. The greatest proportion of lower trunk extension (26 %), contralateral side-flexion (129 %), and ipsilateral rotation (79 %) was used during the front foot contact phase of the fast bowling delivery stride. There was no significant difference in the proportions of available lower trunk extension, contralateral side-flexion, and ipsilateral rotation range of motion used during fast <b>bowling</b> by <b>mixed</b> and non-mixed action bowlers. Motion of the lower trunk, particularly side-flexion, during front foot contact, in addition to variables previously known to be related to back injury (e. g. shoulder counter-rotation), should be examined in future cross-sectional and prospective studies examining the fast bowling action and low back injury...|$|R

50|$|Food {{processing}} {{is typically}} a mechanical process that utilizes large mixing, grinding, chopping and emulsifying {{equipment in the}} production process. These processes inherently introduce a number of contamination risks. As <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> or grinder is used over time the food contact parts will tend to fail and fracture. This type of failure will introduce into the product stream small to large metal contaminants. Further processing of these metal fragments will result in downstream equipment failure {{and the risk of}} ingestion by the consumer. Food manufacturers utilize industrial metal detectors to detect and reject automatically any metal fragment. Large food processors will utilize many metal detectors within the processing stream to reduce both damage to processing machinery as well as risk to consumer health.|$|E

In the Vix Grave <b>a</b> bronze <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> was found which indicates the high status of the woman buried there. It derives from a Greek workshop and is 1.6 m high, weighs over 200 kg and has a volume of 1100 L, making it the largest metal vessel to survive from the ancient world. In eight cremation graves from Frankfurt Rhine-Main from the middle and late La TÃ¨ne period, which contained young girls, statues of dogs were found, measuring 2.1 to 6.7 cm in length. They were made of jet, clay, glass and bronze; their purpose, whether amulet, votive gift or toy, cannot be determined.

40|$|Since low-dose antibiotic-loaded {{bone cement}} (ALBC) was {{approved}} by the FDA for second-stage reimplantation after infected arthroplasties in 2003, commercially premixed low-dose ALBC has become available in the United States. However, surgeons continue to mix ALBC by hand. We presumed hand-mixed ALBC was not as homogeneous as commercially premixed ALBC. We assessed homogeneity by determining the variation in antibiotic elution by location in a batch, from premixed and hand-mixed formulations of low-dose ALBC. Four hand-mixed methodologies were used: (1) suspensionâantibiotic powder in the liquid monomer; (2) no-mixâantibiotic powder added but not mixed with the polymer powder before adding monomer; (3) hand-stirredâantibiotic powder stirred into the polymer powder before the monomer was added; and (4) bowl-mixâantibiotic powder mixed into polymerÂ powder using <b>a</b> commercial <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> before the monomer was added. Antibiotic elution was measured using the Kirby-Bauer bioassay. None of the mixing methods had consistently dissimilar homogeneity of antibiotic distribution from the others.

5000|$|Most bare {{cast-iron}} {{pots and}} pans are cast as {{a single piece of}} metal, including the handle. This allows them to be used on both the stovetop and in the oven. Many recipes call for the use of a cast-iron skillet or pot, especially so that the dish can be initially seared or fried on the stovetop then transferred into the oven, pan and all, to finish baking. Likewise, cast-iron skillets can double as baking dishes. Cornbread in particular is seen as a food item that is best prepared in a cast-iron skillet: the iron pan is heated beforehand in the oven, the ingredients are first combined and mixed in <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl,</b> then added to the heated pan, and the dish is then placed directly into the oven for fast baking.

5000|$|Runemaster : The Runemaster is {{the class}} in the game that the player will most likely control during battle, due to its spellcasting ability. The Runemaster is a {{physically}} weak character who can wield only staves as weapons and wear only the most basic armor, although this class can equip and use wands and rods. The Runemaster can create and cast spells to aid the party in battle. By equipping <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl,</b> the Runemaster can use known runes and ingredients to create powerful spells. In battle, the Runemaster can use its special ability, Cast Spell. This allows the Runemaster to cast any spells it has made.

5000|$|Cake {{opens on}} a baker {{cracking}} eggs into <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> {{to the opening}} strains of [...] "My Favorite Things", performed by Julie Andrews. This begins a montage of shots of white-uniformed cooks moving trolleys of ingredients and performing cake preparation work such as zesting oranges and mechanically mixing cake batter. Several large blocks of madeira cake are taken from the oven, starting a time-lapse sequence of the brick-like cakes being arranged into a pile and being mortared with buttercream icing. After a shot of gloved hands kneading orange sugar paste, a woman pours melted chocolate into a pot of Rice Krispies. The sugar paste is pressed between rollers, and the pot of Rice Krispies emptied into a mould. Layers of Battenberg cake are mortared together with raspberry jam. The Rice Krispies are removed from the moulds and arranged as panels around the madeira structure, creating the rough outline of a car. Jelly mixture is poured into a mould while another cook attaches Fox's Glacier Mints to a fondant base to create a headlamp. Long lines of liquorice are wrapped as belts around pieces of a madeira engine. A tin of golden syrup is poured in place of lubricant. The engine is lowered into {{the front of the}} car while pastry chairs are lowered into the interior. The jelly mould is removed to reveal a brake light, and a tyre made of chocolate fondant is wheeled in and various details such as liquorice windscreen wipers and a front grille made of chocolate Flakes are added to the car. The bonnet is lowered and icing sugar is dusted onto the roof before a fondant Å koda logo is attached to the front.

25|$|The Corinthian Order {{does not}} have its origin in wooden architecture. It grew {{directly}} out of the Ionic in the mid 5th century BC, and was initially of much the same style and proportion, but distinguished by its more ornate capitals. The capital was very much deeper than either the Doric or the Ionic capital, being shaped like a large krater, <b>a</b> bell-shaped <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl,</b> and being ornamented with a double row of acanthus leaves above which rose voluted tendrils, supporting {{the corners of the}} abacus, which, no longer perfectly square, splayed above them. According to Vitruvius, the capital was invented by a bronze founder, Callimachus of Corinth, who took his inspiration from a basket of offerings that had been placed on a grave, with a flat tile on top to protect the goods. The basket had been placed on the root of an acanthus plant which had grown up around it. The ratio of the column height to diameter is generally 10:1, with the capital taking up more than 1/10 of the height. The ratio of capital height to diameter is generally about 1.16:1.|$|R
