5|$|Only Kronshtadts hull {{survived the}} war {{reasonably}} intact <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 10% complete in 1945. She was judged obsolete and the Soviets considered converting her into an aircraft carrier, {{but the idea}} was rejected and both hulls were scrapped in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> twice its current diameter.|$|E

5|$|By 1983, Kennedy Martin {{had written}} {{the first draft of}} what would {{eventually}} become Edge of Darkness – at this stage it was called Magnox (a reference to the Magnox type of nuclear reactor) <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> trade union problems in the nuclear industry. The script was given to BBC Head of Drama Series & Serials, Jonathan Powell, who encouraged Kennedy Martin to continue its development. The script would go though many changes and revisions before reaching its final form.|$|E
5|$|Hay {{accompanied}} McKinley on his nationwide {{train tour}} in mid-1901, during which both men visited California {{and saw the}} Pacific Ocean for the only times in their lives. The summer of 1901 was tragic for Hay; his older son Adelbert, who had been consul in Pretoria during the Boer War <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to become McKinley's personal secretary, died in a fall from a New Haven hotel window.|$|E
5|$|In AD 13, Augustus {{appointed}} him {{commander of the}} forces in the Rhine, which totaled eight legions <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> one-third of Rome's total military force. The next year in August, Augustus died and on 17 September the Senate met to confirm Tiberius as princeps. That day the Senate also dispatched a delegation to Germanicus' camp to send its condolences {{for the death of}} his grandfather, and more importantly, to grant him proconsular imperium. The delegation would not arrive until October.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} Snakedance, Saward {{requested that}} writer Christopher Bailey devise another story. The initial outline for May Time was commissioned on 24 August 1982 <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> the Doctor {{and his companions}} arriving at the court of Byzantium. Full scripts were commissioned on 16 September 1982 with the new title Man-watch, but the scripts were dropped from production for unclear reasons. A second attempt at the story under the title Children of Seth was attempted as a Sixth Doctor story, for which the scripts commissioned on 14 July 1983. This failed because of Bailey's failure to devise a structure for the new doctor's new 45 minute episode format and a tangible villain for the Doctor to face. It was later adapted as The Children of Seth by Marc Platt for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in December 2011. This version reverts to the TARDIS crew of the Fifth Doctor, Tegan and Nyssa.|$|E
5|$|Helmut Lent {{was ordered}} to {{intercept}} and engage the attacking bomber force and after refuelling—Lent had just landed at Jever from an armed patrol—claimed three Wellingtons, two of which, shot down at 14:30 and 14:45, were later confirmed. The two aircraft were both from No. 37 Squadron, captained by Flying Officer P.A. Wimberley and Flying Officer O.J.T. Lewis respectively, and both crashed in the shallow sea off Borkum. It is likely that his third claim may have been No. 37 Squadron Wellington 1A N2396, LF-J, piloted by Sergeant H. Ruse, which crash-landed on the sand dunes of Borkum. Lent was refused the victory over Wimberley, as the Wellington was attacked by Lent after {{it had already been}} badly damaged <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to crash. The Wellington was credited to pilot Carl-August Schumacher.|$|E
5|$|Joaquim Inácio {{returned}} to Rio de Janeiro in October, his {{tour of duty}} having lasted three years. He was then sent back to Cisplatina aboard the frigate Niterói and in December {{he became the first}} officer of the barque Grenfell. On 17 February 1828, he fought in the Battle of Quilmes. During the engagement, the Brazilian barque-brig (three-masted barque) Vinte e nove de agosto ran aground <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to be boarded. Seeing this, Joaquim Inácio positioned the Grenfell near the threatened vessel and protected her until she could be freed by the rising tide. Both ships {{returned to}} the battle, which resulted in a Brazilian victory. Brazil's efforts in the war were ultimately in vain, as it eventually relinquished Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of Uruguay. In July 1829, Joaquim Inácio again returned to Rio de Janeiro, and on 17 October he was promoted to first lieutenant.|$|E

5|$|Several {{accounts}} {{indicate that}} during the Cherry Valley massacre or thereafter, Colonel Stacy was stripped naked and tied to a stake, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to be tortured and killed, as was the ritual for enemy warriors, but was spared by Joseph Brant. William Stacy was a Freemason; Joseph Brant was an educated American Indian, and had also become a Freemason. It is reported that Stacy made an appeal as one Freemason to another, thus saving his life. Colonel Stacy was subsequently taken to Fort Niagara, the Loyalist base in New York and held prisoner under Colonel Butler {{during the summer of}} 1779. At Fort Niagara, Molly Brant, the sister of Joseph Brant, was hostile toward Stacy, and wanted Colonel Butler to return custody of Stacy to the Indians. She proclaimed dreams of her and the Indians using Stacy's head in an Indian football game. Colonel Butler placated Molly Brant with rum and protected his prisoner. Subsequently, from late-1779 through mid-1782, Colonel Stacy was held prisoner at Fort Chambly near Montreal.|$|E
5|$|The Ashvamedhika Parva narrates Uttanka's {{meeting with}} the god Krishna. As Krishna was {{returning}} to his kingdom Dwarka, he noticed the wandering ascetic Uttanka. Uttanka met Krishna and asked for news. Krishna told about the devastation in the Kurukshetra War. Uttanka was agitated <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to curse Krishna for not bringing about a compromise between the warring cousins Pandavas and Kauravas. Krishna explained the necessity of war for restoration of dharma and revealed his Vishvarupa form to Uttanka. The sage bowed to Krishna. Krishna told Uttanka {{to ask for a}} boon. Uttanka asked Krishna to grant him the boon of finding water whenever he was thirsty. Krishna granted the boon to Uttanka. Uttanka was the only other person other than Arjuna and Bhishma to get a divine vision of Krishna.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} {{young woman}} was {{discovered}} in the water of Belstead Brook at Thorpe's Hill, near Hintlesham, {{by a member of the}} public on 2 December 2006. The body, later identified as 25-year-old Gemma Adams, had not been sexually assaulted. Six days later, on 8 December, the body of 19-year-old Tania Nicol, a friend of Adams who had been missing since 30 October, was discovered in water at Copdock Mill just outside Ipswich. There was no evidence of sexual assault. On 10 December, a third victim, found by a member of the public in an area of woodland by the A14 road near Nacton, was later identified as 24-year-old Anneli Alderton. According to a police statement, she had been asphyxiated <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> three months pregnant when she died.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in Delaware {{resulted}} {{in one of}} only thirteen presidential disaster declarations {{for the state of}} Delaware. Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over Pennsylvania the next day. The storm's center remained to the south and west of Delaware, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 175miles (280km) from Delaware at its closest approach. At that time, Isabel was a strong tropical storm located in central Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The wall facing {{towards the}} Golden Horn, where in later times most seaborne traffic was conducted, {{stretched}} {{for a total}} length of 5,600 metres from the cape of St. Demetrius to the Blachernae, where it adjoined the Land Walls. Although most of the wall was demolished in the 1870s, during {{the construction of the}} railway line, its course and the position of most gates and towers is known with accuracy. It was built further inland from the shore, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 10metres tall. According to Cristoforo Buondelmonti it featured 14gates and 110towers, although 16 gates are known that are of Byzantine origin. The northern shore of the city was always its more cosmopolitan part: a major focal point of commerce, it also contained the quarters allocated to foreigners living in the imperial capital. Muslim traders had their own lodgings (mitaton) there, including a mosque, while from the time of Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) on, the emperors granted to the various Italian maritime republics extensive trading quarters which included their own wharfs (skalai) beyond the sea walls.|$|E
5|$|When the Sasanians reached Chalcedon in 615, {{it was at}} this point, {{according}} to Sebeos, that Heraclius had agreed to stand down <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> ready to become a client of the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II, allowing the Roman Empire to become a Persian client state, as well as even allow Khosrow II to choose the emperor. Things began to look even more grim for the Byzantines when Chalcedon fell in 617 to Shahin, making the Persians visible from Constantinople. Shahin courteously received a peace delegation but claimed {{that he did not have}} the authority to engage in peace talks, directing Heraclius to Khosrow, who rejected the peace offer. Still, the Persian forces soon withdrew, probably to focus on their invasion of Egypt. Yet the Persians retained their advantage, capturing Ancyra, an important military base in central Anatolia, in 620 or 622. Rhodes and several other islands in the eastern Aegean fell in 622/3, threatening a naval assault on Constantinople. Such was the despair in Constantinople that Heraclius considered moving the government to Carthage in Africa.|$|E
