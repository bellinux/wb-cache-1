25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last <b>afternoon</b> <b>I</b> saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E

Sondheim met Hal Prince, who would direct many of his shows, at the opening of South Pacific, Hammerstein's musical with Richard Rodgers. The comic musical he wrote at George School, By George, was a success among his peers and buoyed the young songwriter's self-esteem.

I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high above my head.
