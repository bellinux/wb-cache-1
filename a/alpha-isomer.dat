40|$|Human {{haemoglobin}} {{was prepared}} containing [14 C]haem {{in either the}} alpha- or the beta-subunits. Coupled oxidation of such hybrid haemoglobins with ascorbate and O 2 showed that the biliverdin produced by the alpha-subunits contained approx. 55 % <b>alpha-isomer</b> and 45 % beta-isomer, whereas that produced by the beta-subunits contained approx. 75 % <b>alpha-isomer</b> and 25 % beta-isomer. Coupled oxidation of isolated alpha- and beta-subunits gave approx. 70 % <b>alpha-isomer,</b> 30 % beta-isomer and 78 % <b>alpha-isomer,</b> 22 % beta-isomer respectively. These {{results are consistent with}} calculations of differences in the haem environment in the two subunit types...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-one allylstannanes {{have been}} {{prepared}} via a simple Wurtz-type coupling reaction of allyl bromides and R 3 SnX compounds (R = Me, Et, Pr, Bu, Ph; X = Cl, I, OH), Bu 2 SnCl 2, and (BU 2 SnCl) 20 in cosolvent/H 2 O (NH 4 Cl saturated) media under the mediation of zinc powder. Also R 3 SnSnR 3 compounds (R = Ph, p- and m-Tol) {{have been prepared}} via coupling of triaryltin chlorides. The stereochemical course of the reaction between R 3 SnCl and (C 4 H 7) Br (C 4 H 7 = alpha-methylallyl, trans- and cis-crotyl) has been extensively studied. Two distinct reactions {{are involved in the}} overall process: (i) the coupling reaction, which gives rise stereoselectively to the sole R 3 SnCH(CH 3) CH=CH 2 (<b>alpha-isomer),</b> and (ii) the subsequent isomerization of the <b>alpha-isomer</b> furnishing mixtures of (alpha, trans, cis) -isomers. The occurrence of reaction ii depends upon the nature either of the R group or the employed cosolvent. In cyclohexane, the <b>alpha-isomer</b> is exclusively obtained with R = Bu, while with R = Me, Et, and Pr it is found as a major component in the ternary isomeric mixture. In tetrahydrofuran, 2 -propanol, acetonitrile, and pyridine, the isomerization occurs to an extent which depends on the polarity and the coordinating ability of the cosolvent itself. The observed stereoselection has been hypothesized to occur through one-electron transfer from the zinc metal to the (C 4 H 7) Br to form stereoselectively an adsorbed CH 2 =CHCH(CH 3) Br. -Zn. + radical ion which is trapped by the R 3 SnCl reactant to form the <b>alpha-isomer.</b> Similarly, ditin compounds are thought to be formed by interaction of R 3 SnCl. -Zn. + radical ions with R 3 SnCl molecule...|$|E

40|$|The {{amount and}} {{isomeric}} composition of urinary biliverdin in rabbits were analysed by h. p. l. c. Physiological values were maintained after the injection of haemin. On the other hand, when haemoglobins from several mammalian species were injected into rabbits, the excretion of biliverdin-IX alpha and biliverdin-IX beta were increased 6 - 18 -fold and 32 - 66 -fold respectively over physiological excretion. Injection of myoglobin {{resulted in a}} 44 -fold increase in excretion of the IX <b>alpha-isomer.</b> Coupled oxidation with ascorbate of haemoglobin and myoglobin by oxygen produced mainly the IX alpha- and IX beta-isomers from haemoglobin and the IX <b>alpha-isomer</b> from myoglobin. The destruction of part of the haem from injected haemoproteins by non-enzymic chemical degradation would account for the observed respective increases in the excretion of biliverdin isomers. The excretion of biliverdin isomers after the injection of phenylhydrazine into rabbits {{was similar to that}} after the injection of haemoglobin...|$|E
40|$|Spray dried {{products}} with controlled crystallinity is desired to realize an improved quality and functionality {{of the final}} products. This study used the glass-filament single droplet drying technique to study lactose crystallization behaviour during convective drying. Single lactose droplets with different proportions of alpha- and beta-isomers were subjected to air drying temperatures of 70 degrees C and 110 degrees C. Lactose particles dried at 70 degrees C with higher initial proportions of <b>alpha-isomer</b> showed the lowest dissolution rate. XRD analysis on the freshly dried particles showed that higher crystallinity was achieved with a higher air drying temperature and a higher initial <b>alpha-isomer</b> proportion. This observation was confirmed with the SEM observation of lactose particles that were both freshly dried and with a post-drying crystallization process. Dried lactose particles could have a two-layer morphology where the surface shell and the interior part possess different crystallinity, due to the different crystallization kinetics during drying. The results suggest that during drying there is a critical crystallization stage where both droplet temperature and moisture content are sufficiently high, constituting large T - T-g driving force. For rapid crystallization to occur. The findings provide experimental support for the solid-phase crystallization theory. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|Conversion of four isomers of meso-oxyprotohaem IX {{into the}} {{corresponding}} biliverdin IX was attempted with a reconstituted haem oxygenase {{system in the}} presence of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and NADPH. Only the <b>alpha-isomer</b> of meso-oxyprotohaem IX was converted effectively into biliverdin IX alpha, which was further reduced to bilirubin IX alpha by biliverdin reductase. Only trace amounts of biliverdins IX beta, IX gamma and IX delta were respectively formed from the incubation mixture of the corresponding oxyprotohaemin IX isomers with the complete haem oxygenase system under the same conditions. In a kinetic study, the Km for alpha-meso-oxyprotohaem IX was 3. 6 microM, which was 2 -fold higher than that for protohaem IX. The maximum velocity (Vmax.) of the conversion of alpha-meso-oxyprotohaem IX into biliverdin IX alpha was twice as fast as that of protohaem IX. These results demonstrate that alpha-meso-oxyprotohaem IX is an intermediate of haem degradation and it was converted stereospecifically into biliverdin IX alpha via verdohaem IX alpha...|$|E
40|$|The biliary {{excretion}} {{of the four}} isomers of bilirubin-IX was studied in Wistar rats (JJ) and homozygous Gunn rats (jj). Synthetic preparations of 14 C-labelled pigments were used. 1. After intravenous administration, the <b>alpha-isomer</b> was rapidly excreted in conjugated form in bile of Wistar rats. In Gunn rats excretion was insignificant. In contrast, both rat species promptly excreted the non-alpha-isomers at rates that were comparable with that found for bilirubin-IXalpha in Wistar rats. 2. In normal rats about 16 % of the beta- and delta-isomers and at least 50 % of the gamma-isomer were excreted as ester conjugates of the injected parent bile pigments. Conjugation of the beta- and delta-isomers had occurred exclusively at the carboxyl groups of pyrrole ring D and C respectively. For bilirubin-IXgamma no preference for any carboxyl group could be established. 3. In homozygous Gunn rats the non-alpha-isomers were apparently excreted chemically unaltered. This suggests that, as for bilirubin-IXalpha, conjugation of the non-alpha-isomers is also deficient in Gunn rats. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the modifying influence of 17 -beta oestradiol (E 2), on the cytotoxicity of methotrexate (MTX) towards two cell lines derived from human breast carcinoma. E 2 (10 (- 7) M- 10 (- 6) M) significantly reduced the antimetabolic effects of the drug towards an E 2 non-responsive cell line, MDA-MB- 436, whilst potentiating the action of MTX in an E 2 responsive line, MCF- 7. Similarly, E 2 (10 (- 6) M) partially reversed the anti-proliferative effects of MTX in the MDA-MB- 436 line and potentiated growth inhibition in the E 2 responsive cells. This potentiation was not observed if E 2 {{was replaced by the}} less biologically active <b>alpha-isomer.</b> In both cell lines pharmacological concentrations of the E 2 reduced intracellular levels of MTX achieved during a 48 h treatment period. The latter finding is consistent with the ability of E 2 to protect MDA-MB- 436 cells from the action of MTX. Potentiation of the effects of MTX towards MCF- 7 cells occurs despite reduced intra-cellular drug levels...|$|E
40|$|The steroids {{trenbolone}} acetate (TbA) and melengestrol acetate (MGA) are licensed as growth promoters for farm animals in several meat-exporting countries. Although {{many studies have}} explored their safety for both animals and consumers, {{little is known about}} their fate after excretion by the animal. Our study aimed to determine the residues and degradation of trenbolone and MGA in solid dung, liquid manure, and soil. In animal experiments lasting 8 weeks, cattle were treated with TbA and MGA. Solid dung and, in case of trenbolone, liquid manure were collected and spread on maize fields after 4. 5 and 5. 5 months of storage, respectively. Determination of the hormone residues in all samples included extraction, clean-up (solid-phase extraction), separation of metabolites and interfering substances by HPLC (RP- 18), and quantification by sensitive enzyme immunoassay. Procedures were validated by mass spectrometry (MS) methods. During storage of liquid manure the level of trenbolone decreased from 1, 700 to 1, 100 pg/g (17 <b>alpha-isomer),</b> corresponding to a half-life of 267 days. Before storage, the concentrations in the dung hill ranged from 5 to 75 ng/g TbOH and from 0. 3 to 8 ng/g MGA. After storage, levels up to 10 ng/g trenbolone, and 6 ng/g MGA were detected. In the soil samples trenbolone was traceable up to 8 weeks after fertilization, and MGA was detected even {{until the end of the}} cultivation period. The results show that these substances should be investigated further concerning their potential endocrine-disrupting activity in agricultural ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Propylene {{glycol monomethyl ether}} (PGME) is {{a widely}} used {{additive}} in industrial and consumer products (paints, inks, diluents, cleaning products, cosmetics.). The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine uptake and disposition of PGME <b>alpha-isomer</b> in humans. METHOD: Six healthy male volunteers were exposed to PGME-alpha vapour (15, 50 and 95 ppm) with and without respiratory protection for 6 h including a 30 -min break. Free PGME and total PGME (free and conjugated) were analysed in urine. The analytical method involved hydrolysis with HCl (only for the analysis of total PGME in urine), a solid phase extraction on LC- 18 columns and a gas chromatograph-flame ionisation detector (GC/FID) analysis after derivatisation with trimethylsilylimidazole. RESULTS: End-exposure levels of free PGME in urine were found to reach 1. 3 (+/- 0. 3), 4. 4 (+/- 1. 6) and 7. 9 (+/- 2. 5) mg/l for 15, 50 and 95 -ppm exposure, respectively, without respiratory protection. End-exposure levels of total PGME in urine were found to reach 2. 5 (+/- 0. 8), 6. 2 (+/- 1. 6) and 10. 3 (+/- 2. 3) mg/l for 15, 50 and 95 -ppm exposure respectively. Levels of free PGME were also monitored in exhaled air (0. 4 (+/- 0. 1), 1. 4 (+/- 0. 4) and 2. 9 (+/- 0. 9) ppm at the end of 15, 50 and 95 -ppm exposure, respectively) and in blood (2. 0 (+/- 0. 9), 4. 9 (+/- 2. 3) and 11. 8 (+/- 2. 4) mg/l at the end of 15, 50 and 95 -ppm exposure, respectively). PGME is rapidly excreted in urine and in exhaled air; the half-lives were calculated to be approximately 3. 5 h in urine and 10 min in exhaled air. PGME was below detection limits in breath (< 0. 1 ppm), in blood (< 1 mg/l) and in urine (< 1 mg/l) after dermal-only exposure to vapour. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated the relatively high pulmonary uptake compared with the dermal uptake. It has also shown the rapid excretion in urine (3. 5 h) and in expired air (10 min). With regard to metabolism, this study has established the presence of conjugated PGME in urine...|$|E
