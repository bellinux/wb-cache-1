The new museum was renamed Museum of the African Diaspora to reflect a broadened scope and mission, and incorporated as a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization. The architecturally stunning space was designed by the nationally renowned Freelon Group within the St. Regis Museum Tower. MoAD opened its doors in 2005, debuting a modern museum designed to showcase art and culture through the lens of the African Diaspora.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This essay poses and {{attempts}} to answer the central question, “what does <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> studies do?” It takes an autobiographical approach to address the genealogy, status quo and the potential future of the floating signifier that is <b>African</b> <b>Cultural</b> Studies. It unpacks and multiplies <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> studies and contextualizes it {{as a form of}} African studies and as both interventionist in and contributory to transnational <b>cultural</b> studies. <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> studies marginality in the global discourse is rearticulated as both a positioning of disempowerment {{on the one hand and}} one of generative and insurgent politics on the other. Stressing the need for continental and diasporic Africans to self-identify issues to be addressed (in place Eurocentric, imposed preoccupations), the essay identifies as examples the always already complex nature of identity and belonging (and the irony of emergent zenophobia); continental and diasporic relations that trouble the taken for grantedness of what constitutes Africa(ns), and queer Africa in the face of institutionalized homophobia. Whether local nativist or globally engaged approaches are taken, the essay concludes, <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> studies ought to be self-reflexively, dedicated not only to doing cultural studies but to what the doing of <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> studies does for Africa(ns) and for transnational cultural studies...|$|R

40|$|The article {{examines}} {{ways in which}} arts-based educational approaches were applied {{to a group of}} African descendant youth in Western Australia, as a way of understanding challenges to their bicultural socialization and means to developing their bicultural competence. Drawing on <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> memory as a cultural resource enabled participants to discover the relevance of <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> memory and embodied knowledge to their bicultural socialization and bicultural competence. The article challenges the argument that successful integration into dominant culture is only possible when migrants remain focused on acquisition of dominant cultural values – ‘Fitting in’. The <b>African</b> <b>Cultural</b> Memory Youth Arts Festival (ACMYAF) offered an alternative conception of successive integration as a process inclusive of creative appropriation and revaluation of ancestral culture through cultural memory. The festival became a third space through which the participants explored embodied knowledge and <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> memory towards a positive self-concept and bicultural competence...|$|R

40|$|The {{move towards}} contextual Christianity in Africa is an {{essential}} venture if Christianity is {{to communicate with the}} <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. As a universal religion, Christianity has to find an expression within the cultural context. However, the contextualization of Christianity in Africa appears to have permitted the practice of syncretism. It has resulted in the emergence of African Christianity, which is the amalgamation of Christianity and African Traditional Religion. The amalgamation of Christianity and African Traditional Religion appears to overlook the essence of both religions as there is currently no clarity on how Christianity can best be expressed within the <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> and religious heritage. This paper employs the document review method to explore the things that fall in between—“adiaphora”, which the proponents of contextual Christianity may have overlooked with regard to the <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> and religious heritage. These include the pragmatic nature of the <b>African</b> <b>cultural</b> and religious heritage, and the African traditional methods of healing...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} the programme work of eight Central European <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> in two West European capitals between 2000 and 2008 : the Hungarian, Polish, Slovak and Czech <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> in Paris and Berlin. In the 1990 s {{the principle of}} a foreign cultural policy itself, {{as well as its}} instruments, were fundamentally questioned in the four Visegrád states. These institutions also faced many critics, including in France and Germany. Nevertheless the Visegrád states have chosen to maintain the <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> they had in the French and German capitals and, if needed, to create some more. This {{raises the question of whether}} these institutions developed a long-term plan. The present study assumes that the special character and added value of national <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> abroad is based on the potential to promote dialogue between representatives of different cultures. The central question addressed in this paper is: to what extent do the <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> of the Visegrád states in Paris and Berlin intend to position themselves as a forum for intercultural dialogue at the beginning of the 21 st century? Firstly, this paper wants to make a contribution to a field of research – the <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> of the Visegrád states – which has not yet been the subject of much study. A thus far nonexistent analysis of the programme work of the eight <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> and their perception by the public between 2000 and 2008 is conducted. Secondly, this study aims to provide the <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> with impetus for the reflection on their future role in the European Union (EU). The analysis is based on comprehensive empirical material, which was collected for the purpose of this study. Before the programme work of the eight <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> between 2000 and 2008 is addressed, an overview of their history is presented. In order to answer the question of the dialogic approach of the analysed <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> at the beginning of the 21 th century, their objectives during the years 2006 and 2008, which are published by the Ministries and the institutes in the internet, are first analyzed. The analysis then focuses on the local implementation of the objectives. By means of an analysis of the programme work of the eight institutes between 2000 and 2008, it is examined thereafter, whether some elements that are beneficial to the intercultural dialogue are incorporated in practice. Using a survey of the audience, the impression of visitors regarding the <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> and how important the dialogic approach is with regard to the perception of the visitors is also investigated. The analysed <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> represent countries which have joined the EU in 2004. In this context, the attention was directed to the new member states. The final part of the analysis addresses the question, whether the examined <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> have noticed and incorporated this new dynamic, in order to become part of the intercultural European dialogue...|$|R
