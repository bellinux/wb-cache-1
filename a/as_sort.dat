25|$|It {{turned out}} that the Ryti-Ribbentrop {{agreement}} was less significant for the outcome of the war than it appeared in June 1944. The Wehrmacht had already delivered critical anti-tank weapons and sent a significant air-force detachment to support the Finnish defence on the Karelian isthmus. In fact, all necessary military aid was already in Finland or en route when Ribbentrop started pressuring President Ryti; German defense ministry diplomacy and military headquarters seemingly acted independently of each other. Before the Soviet summer offensive of 1944, Finland's army was estimated to be keeping at least 26 divisions, 5 brigades and 16 regiments of the Red Army busy. The Wehrmacht had every reason to utilize the Finns <b>as</b> <b>sort</b> of a rear-troop, still strong and still very dedicated to their task to defend their homeland from a Communist invasion, while the Germans retreated from Russia and the Baltic countries.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Fazekas {{talked about}} how the series would relate to the One-Shot, saying, [...] "The short really {{is the basis for}} the series. 's working at SSR, post-war...If you think of the short <b>as</b> <b>sort</b> {{of the end of the}} series, the series would be leading up to that moment where she gets {{assigned}} to S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] Markus reiterated this in January 2015, but added that [...] "we all agree and understand that [...] going to get tougher if we continue" [...] making the series. The first season introduces the origins of the Black Widow and Winter Soldier programs, which both appear in several MCU films, while the second season shows the discovery of the Darkforce (known as Zero Matter in the series), which previously appeared in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and has ties to Doctor Strange.|$|E
500|$|Alan Partridge {{was created}} for the 1991 BBC Radio 4 comedy {{programme}} On The Hour, a spoof of British current affairs broadcasting, as the show's hapless sports presenter. He is portrayed by Steve Coogan, who had performed a similar character for a BBC college radio station at university. On The Hour writers Armando Iannucci, Patrick Marber, Richard Herring and Stewart Lee wrote much of Partridge's original material, although Herring credits the creation to Coogan and Iannucci. Iannucci asked Coogan to do a voice for a generic sports reporter; according to Iannucci, [...] "Someone said, 'He's an Alan!' and someone else said, 'He's a Partridge!' Within minutes we knew where he lived, we'd worked out his back story, what his aspirations were." [...] Coogan said Partridge was originally a [...] "one-note, sketchy character" [...] and [...] "freak show", but became [...] "more and more refined <b>as</b> <b>sort</b> of a dysfunctional alter ego" [...] over the years.|$|E

2500|$|Before such {{elements}} were {{forced out of}} opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot <b>as</b> <b>sort</b> of an [...] "opera-within-an-opera." [...] One reason for this {{was an attempt to}} attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public opera houses. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the commedia dell'arte, a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in-between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of [...] "intermezzi", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.|$|E
2500|$|The L'Amour {{program of}} Audio Dramas is still ongoing but {{the pace of}} {{production}} has slowed considerably. Beau L'Amour and Paul O'Dell released Son of a Wanted Man, the first L'Amour Drama in half a decade in 2004. Son of a Wanted Man is also the first Louis L'Amour novel to {{be turned into a}} drama. Considerably more complex than earlier shows it had a cast of over twenty mid-level Hollywood actors, a music score recorded specifically for the production and sound effects completely recorded in the field in many locations across the west. Produced <b>as</b> <b>sort</b> of a [...] "profitable hobby" [...] Beau L'Amour and Paul O'Dell created the production while working around their day-to-day jobs. Since this allowed them no more than nine or ten weeks a year, the show took four years to complete. According to the Louis L'Amour website the next production will be The Diamond of Jeru, a L'Amour adventure based in 1950s Borneo. The show is in the editorial stages (as of April 2011) but because of an even more ambitious production process than that of Son of a Wanted Man no release date has been announced.|$|E
2500|$|Joubert {{moved to}} Moseley, Birmingham, in 1962 {{to take up}} a Senior Lectureship at the University of Birmingham; he was later made Reader in Music. In 1979 he was a visiting {{professor}} at the University of Otago in New Zealand. The number and scope of his works increased, and among those composed during the following decades were two further full-length operas, Under Western Eyes (Op. 51, 1968) and Jane Eyre (Op. 134) (based on the novels by Joseph Conrad and Charlotte Brontë respectively), Symphony No. 2 (Op. 68, 1970), various large-scale choral works with orchestras including the oratorio The Raising of Lazarus (Op. 67, 1970) and Herefordshire Canticles (Op. 93, 1979), a second and third piano sonata (Op. 71, 1972; Op. 157), a second and third string quartet (Op. 91, 1977; Op. 112, 1986), song cycles with piano and/or instrumental ensembles, and accompanied and unaccompanied smaller-scale choral music. On the wide scope of his work, Joubert has commented: [...] "I've never really wanted to be pigeonholed as a composer. I've always wanted to write anything that I was either asked to, or wanted to write. I've never wanted to specialise, although I have to a certain extent been pigeonholed already. I'd rather not be looked upon <b>as</b> <b>sort</b> of limited in that way." ...|$|E

The Ballot Question--oldest of dialectic nightmares--is often found astride of a somnolent sederunt. The Greeks and Romans, too, are reserved <b>as</b> <b>sort</b> of general-utility men, to do all the dirty work of illustration; and they fill as many functions as the famous waterfall scene at the [...] "Princess's," [...] which I found doing duty on one evening as a gorge in Peru, a haunt of German robbers, and a peaceful vale in the Scottish borders. There is a sad absence of striking argument or real lively discussion. Indeed, you feel a growing contempt for your fellow-members; and it is not until you rise yourself to hawk and hesitate and sit shamefully down again, amid eleemosynary applause, that you begin to find your level and value others rightly. Even then, even when failure has damped your critical ardour, you will see many things to be laughed at in the deportment of your rivals.|$|E
60|$|An old {{man from}} Warren, called Dr. Gilmore, was then {{introduced}} {{on the part}} of the defense. He swore that he had known Fisher for several years; that Fisher had resided at his house a long time at each of two different spells--once while he built a barn for him, and once while he was doctored for some chronic disease; that two or three years ago Fisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun, since which he had been subject to continued bad health and occasional aberration of mind. He also stated that on last Tuesday, being the same day that Maxcy arrested William Trailor, he (the doctor) was from home in the early part of the day, and on his return, about eleven o'clock, found Fisher at his house in bed, and apparently very unwell; that he asked him how he came from Springfield; that Fisher said he had come by Peoria, and also told of several other places he had been at more in the direction of Peoria, which showed that he at the time of speaking did not know where he had been wandering about in a state of derangement. He further stated that in about two hours he received a note from one of Trailor's friends, advising him of his arrest, and requesting him to go on to Springfield as a witness, to testify as to the state of Fisher's health in former times; that he immediately set off, calling up two of his neighbors as company, and, riding all evening and all night, overtook Maxcy and William at Lewiston in Fulton County; that Maxcy refusing to discharge Trailor upon his statement, his two neighbors returned and he came on to Springfield. Some question being made as to whether the doctor's story was not a fabrication, several acquaintances of his (among whom was the same postmaster who wrote Keys, as before mentioned) were introduced <b>as</b> <b>sort</b> of compurgators, who swore that they knew the doctor to be of good character for truth and veracity, and generally of good character in every way.|$|E
