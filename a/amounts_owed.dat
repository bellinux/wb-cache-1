25|$|As of 2014, {{the income}} tax rates on Connecticut {{individuals}} are divided into six tax brackets of 3% (on income up to $10,000); 5% ($10,000-$50,000); 5.5% ($50,000-$100,000); 6% ($100,000-$200,000); 6.5% ($200,000-$250,000); and 6.7% (more than $250,000), with additional <b>amounts</b> <b>owed</b> depending on the bracket.|$|E
25|$|In a May 4, 2011, statement, trustee Picard {{said that}} the total fictitious <b>amounts</b> <b>owed</b> to {{customers}} (with some adjustments) were $57 billion, of which $17.3 billion was actually invested by customers. $7.6 billion has been recovered, but pending lawsuits, only $2.6 billion is available to repay victims. If all the recovered funds are returned to victims, their net loss would be under $10 billion.|$|E
50|$|This {{monthly payment}} formula {{is easy to}} derive, and the {{derivation}} illustrates how fixed-rate mortgage loans work. The <b>amount</b> <b>owed</b> on the loan {{at the end of}} every month equals the <b>amount</b> <b>owed</b> from the previous month, plus the interest on this amount, minus the fixed amount paid every month.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} derivation of {{this formula}} illustrates how fixed-rate mortgage loans work. The <b>amount</b> <b>owed</b> on the loan {{at the end}} of every month equals the <b>amount</b> <b>owed</b> from the previous month, plus the interest on this amount, minus the fixed amount paid every month. This fact results in the debt schedule: ...|$|R
5000|$|List all debts in {{ascending}} order from smallest balance to largest. This is the method's most distinctive feature, in that the order is determined by <b>amount</b> <b>owed,</b> not the rate of interest charged. However, if two debts are very close in <b>amount</b> <b>owed,</b> then the debt with the higher interest rate would be moved above in the list.|$|R
25|$|The non-marketable {{securities}} represent <b>amounts</b> <b>owed</b> to program beneficiaries. For example, {{in the case}} of the Social Security Trust Fund, the payroll taxes dedicated to Social Security were credited to the Trust Fund upon receipt, but spent for other purposes. If the government continues to run deficits in other parts of the budget, the government will have to issue debt held by the public to fund the Social Security Trust Fund, in effect exchanging one type of debt for the other. Other large intragovernmental holders include the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation's Resolution Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Medicare).|$|E
500|$|The {{alternate}} approach taken is the [...] "beneficiary election" [...] approach. This is {{that where}} trust funds are wrongly mixed with the trustee's personal funds, used for an investment, and the money is thus not recoverable, the beneficiaries are allowed to [...] "elect" [...] whether the investment is to be held as a security for the <b>amounts</b> <b>owed</b> to them, or whether to take the unauthorised investment {{as part of the}} trust fund. This is considered the exception, rather than the rule; in Foskett v McKeown, Millett said that [...] "The primary rule in regard to a mixed fund, therefore, is that gains and losses are borne by the contributors rateably. The beneficiary's right to elect instead to enforce a lien to obtain repayment is an exception to the primary rule, exercisable where the fund is deficient and the claim is made against the wrongdoer and those claiming through him".|$|E
2500|$|When medieval Europe moved {{towards a}} {{monetary}} {{economy in the}} 13th century, sedentary merchants depended on bookkeeping to oversee multiple simultaneous transactions financed by bank loans. One important breakthrough took place around that time: the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping, which is defined as any bookkeeping system {{in which there was}} a debit and credit entry for each transaction, or for which the majority of transactions were intended to be of this form. The historical origin of the use of the words [...] "debit" [...] and [...] "credit" [...] in accounting goes {{back to the days of}} single-entry bookkeeping, which had as its chief objective keeping track of <b>amounts</b> <b>owed</b> by customers (debtors) and <b>amounts</b> <b>owed</b> to creditors. Debit in Latin means [...] "he owes" [...] and credit in Latin means [...] "he trusts".|$|E

50|$|Compared to the {{situation}} of the short cadastre (survey) of 1854, it was determined that annuities <b>owed</b> <b>amount</b> to no more than 25% of the original <b>amount</b> <b>owed</b> by the villein socagers overall. Some had not been paid since the 19th Century. To rectify {{the situation}} for once and all, the SNRRS issued an edict dated 15 September 1940 stating that whatever was due no later than 11 November of that year was to be paid directly to the manorial lord as before. Any <b>amount</b> <b>owing</b> after that date would be paid to the municipality.|$|R
2500|$|Sexton filed {{a lawsuit}} against the {{president}} and fellows of Harvard in May 1916 for breach of contract, claiming that he had not been fully paid the <b>amounts</b> <b>owed</b> under his contract. [...] Sexton sought $2,000 in unpaid salary and claimed that the Harvard Athletic Committee had interfered with his coaching and had no right to do so. [...] During a jury trial in March 1917, Sexton gave a demonstration of his methods, placing a handkerchief on the floor as home plate, and explaining the position from which he wanted the catcher to throw the ball. [...] Sexton testified that the person who the Athletic Committee sought to impose as an assistant coach wanted to override his instruction to the catchers. [...] The jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of Harvard.|$|E
2500|$|Without the mechanic's lien, the {{contractor}} {{would have a}} limited number of options to enforce payment of the <b>amounts</b> <b>owed.</b> Further, there is usually a long list of claimants on any failed project. To avoid the specter of various trades, materialmen and suppliers attempting to remove the improvements they have made, and to maintain a degree of equality between the various lienors on a project, the statutory lien scheme was created. Without it, Tradesperson A may try to [...] "race" [...] Supplier B to the courthouse, the project site or the construction lender to obtain payment. Most lien statutes instead mandate strict compliance with the formalized process they create in return for the timely resolution and balancing of claims between all parties involved - both owners and lien claimants.|$|E

50|$|This {{derivation}} illustrates {{three key}} components of fixed-rate loans: (1) the fixed monthly payment depends upon the amount borrowed, the interest rate, {{and the length of}} time over which the loan is repaid; (2) the <b>amount</b> <b>owed</b> every month equals the <b>amount</b> <b>owed</b> from the previous month plus interest on that amount, minus the fixed monthly payment; (3) the fixed monthly payment is chosen so that the loan is paid off in full with interest {{at the end of its}} term and no more money is owed.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that there is a difference between a deficiency and a deficiency judgment. A [...] "deficiency" [...] is the difference between the <b>amount</b> <b>owed</b> on a loan and the total amount received/collected at the closing of a loan. A deficiency judgment is a court judgment that is a public record of the <b>amount</b> <b>owed</b> and by whom. In many states, items included in calculating the amount of a deficiency judgment include: the loan principal, accrued interest and attorney fees, less the amount the lender bid at the foreclosure sale.|$|R
