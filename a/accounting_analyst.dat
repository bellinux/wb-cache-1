40|$|Beyond wide {{agreement}} that {{many areas of}} contemporary policy making are unintelligible if processes that transcend the boundaries of individual states are not taken into <b>account,</b> <b>analysts</b> often disagree on how various 'global' and 'local' factors interact to produce policies and policy outcomes. The disagreement stems {{in part from the}} use of different analytic lenses, and specifically from the choice between 'state-centric' and 'polycentric' lenses. This article examines the fundamental assumptions of these general perspectives with regard to the polity, politics and policy dimensions of global policy making, and surveys some of the research questions and findings that resulted from their use. It concludes that scholars and policy makers should treat the two analytical lenses as complementary, as each of them stimulates the analyst to ask questions and look for entities and causal connections that the other lens may miss...|$|R

We also show that audit committee accounting expertise is related to higher trading volume and lower liquidity risk, supporting incentives for greater analyst following.

We are the first to explicitly consider the predictive influence of option implied volatility in such a framework, which we unsurprisingly find to be an important indicator of future extreme price movements. However, after controlling for implied volatility levels, other factors, particularly firm age and size, still have additional predictive power of extreme future returns. Furthermore, excluding predicted extreme return stocks leads to a portfolio that has lower risk (standard deviation of returns) without sacrificing performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{position}} of the United States as de facto global hegemon, China is a rising power in the world. As Chinese power grows, the projection of Chinese influence will be felt most acutely in Southeast Asia. Whether to accommodate, contain or resist China will depend on future developments that none can foresee, including Chinese ambitions, the policies of other international players (the U. S., Japan), and the cohesion or fragility of the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN). This paper argues that in deciding how best to deal with China, two factors that will influence the countries of Southeast Asia are their own long histories of bilateral relations with China and their own differing conceptions of how foreign relations should be conducted. This is to argue that history and culture are central to any understanding of the likely future shape of China-Southeast Asia relations.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, neural {{networks}} have drawn noticeable attention from many computer and operations researchers. Essentially, a Neural Network is a non-parametric estimation technique. It {{does not make}} any distributional assumption regarding the underlying variable. In various studies Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, have been proved to be powerful predictive tools, where a variable is explained {{by a set of}} explanatory variables without assuming any structural or linear relationship among the variables. Some critical success factors to train ANN are the network architecture, network design algorithm, training algorithm, and stop training conditions. While some previous studies, have found encouraging results with using this artificial intelligence technique to predict the movements of established financial markets, {{there is a lack of}} studies examining the stock picking ability of different ANN paradigms, taking into <b>account</b> <b>analyst</b> earning forecasts as input data. Our approach is based on the notion, that trading strategies guided by forecasts of stock earnings, may be effective and lead to higher profits. This paper attempts to enhance the stock selection process by employing ANN to select stocks in the Us stock market. Neural networks are used to identify stocks for the portfolio which are likely to outperform the market, given the forecast earnings information of stocks. Our purpose is to compare various ANN models, to identify critical predictors to forecast stock prices and to see, which model show the best stock picking ability, increasing in this way investment strategy profitability for the professionals in the market. The competiting models, are examined in terms of various trading performance and economic criteria, like annualized return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, annualized volatility, average gain/loss ratio etc via a trading experiment. Empirical experimentation suggests that by using artificial neural networks for nonlinear predictions there is potential economic value for subsequent portfolio choices. ANN-based investment strategies, once financial analyst earning forecast are considered, obtain higher returns than other investment strategies examined in this study. Consequently, we find that the returns obtained from the equally weighted portfolio formed by the stocks selected by neural networks, outperform those generated by the buy and hold strategy, computed with a benchmark index for a given period under investigation. The influences of the length of investment horizon and the commission rate are also considered. The present study does not support efficient market hypotheses...|$|R

Using a sample of Chinese listed firms between 2003 and 2009, we find that analyst coverage, which serves as an external governance mechanism, helps to enhance the financial reporting quality of Chinese listed firms. The effect is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises (i. e., private firms), {{in that they are}} more dependent on external equity capital and, therefore, under greater pressure from analysts to provide high-quality <b>accounting</b> information. Furthermore, <b>analysts</b> play a more effective role for firms with stronger incentives to manipulate financial reports. Our findings are robust to the control of endogeneity issue. ...|$|R
