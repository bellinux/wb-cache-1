2500|$|The SB-series would {{continue}} to be improved and sell well until 1974 and the arrival of solid state and digital design, with the SB-104 transceiver, its accessories and a new generation of amateur radio gear. Though somewhat redesigned physically it had a similar appearance to the earlier SB-series generation. The SB-670 was a short-lived dream <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> that matched the SB-104. Unfortunately, only a few were produced and those were considered [...] "prototypes". However, technical issues with the first production run of the SB-104 led to Heath having to quickly update it with the SB-104A. By that time, amateurs were buying transceivers made overseas being produced for {{the same amount of money}} with more features (including the AM and FM modes that the Heathkit SB and HW series did not have) and did not require user assembly.|$|E
50|$|Although a {{preselector}} {{is placed}} in the same location as an <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner,</b> it serves a different purpose: An <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> or “transmatch” connects two signal lines with different signal impedances and only blocks out-of-tune frequencies incidentally (if it blocks any at all).|$|E

50|$|The basic circuit {{required}} when lumped capacitances and inductors {{are used}} is shown below. This circuit {{is important in}} that many automatic <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> use it, and also because more complex circuits can be analyzed as groups of L-networks.|$|R
50|$|MFJ Enterprises, {{founded in}} 1972 by Martin F. Jue, is a {{manufacturer}} of {{a broad range of}} products for the amateur radio industry. They specialize in station accessories, such as <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> and <b>antenna</b> switching equipment. MFJ now manufactures more amateur radio products than any other company in the world.|$|R
50|$|A {{variable}} capacitor is a capacitor whose capacitance may be intentionally and repeatedly changed mechanically or electronically. Variable capacitors {{are often used}} in L/C circuits to set the resonance frequency, e.g. to tune a radio (therefore it is sometimes called a tuning capacitor or tuning condenser), or as a variable reactance, e.g. for impedance matching in <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners.</b>|$|R

50|$|Weak antenna tuner: Users {{report that}} the {{internal}} <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> is weak, and only capable of tuning a 3:1 SWR antenna or better.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{parts of}} a radio are the <b>antenna,</b> <b>tuner,</b> demodulator and amplifier. Carbon nanotubes are special in that they can function as these parts without the need of extra circuitry.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of devices used between a source of energy and a load that perform [...] "impedance matching". To match {{electrical}} impedances, engineers use combinations of transformers, resistors, inductors, capacitors and transmission lines. These passive (and active) impedance-matching devices are optimized for different applications and include baluns, <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> (sometimes called ATUs or roller-coasters, because of their appearance), acoustic horns, matching networks, and terminators.|$|R
50|$|Butterfly {{capacitors}} {{are used}} in symmetrical tuned circuits, e.g. RF power amplifier stages in push-pull configuration or symmetrical <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> where the rotor needs to be “cold”, i.e. connected to RF (but not necessarily DC) ground potential. Since the peak RF current normally flows from one stator to the other without going through wiper contacts, butterfly capacitors can handle large resonance RF currents, e.g. in magnetic loop antennas.|$|R
50|$|Some simpler {{types of}} <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> also produce some preselection: The now-common ‘T’-network is a high-pass circuit, {{and can be}} {{adjusted}} for high operating , which will strongly block frequencies below the operating frequency, and can attenuate frequencies above the operating frequency {{by as much as}} 20 dB. The complementary ‘Π’-network is low-pass, and can be similarly adjusted to strongly block frequencies above the tuned frequency and provide as much as 20 dB attenuation below the tuned frequency.|$|R
50|$|As a {{broadband}} antenna, the T2FD will normally {{display a}} reasonably low {{standing wave ratio}} (SWR) across its entire frequency range. However, at some frequencies the loading element may be moderately reactive, so {{the use of an}} <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> may be needed when using modern solid-state transmitters at anything approaching their rated power output. Also, “low SWR” does not mean high antenna efficiency. This antenna is not recommended for those wanting to make serious weak signal contacts. A dipole cut for the lowest used frequency, fed with ladder line, and matched with an <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> would perform better than the T2FD over the HF region of frequencies.|$|E
50|$|An <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner,</b> a matchbox, transmatch, {{antenna tuning}} unit (ATU), or antenna coupler is a device {{connected}} between a radio transmitter or receiver and its antenna to improve power transfer between them by matching {{the impedance of}} the radio to the antenna's feedline. Similar matching networks are used in other equipment (such as linear amplifiers) to transform impedance.|$|E
50|$|The {{radio is}} issued {{together}} with ancillaries {{to make up}} the operating station, inducing a power cable, <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> unit, coaxial cables and antenna wires. Other accessories such as the selector unit radio frequency (SURF) were available. The SURF, when tuned, allowed more than one set to be operated from the same position without interfering with each other.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{variable}} capacitors {{are commonly}} used in high-voltage applications: 5000 volts (5 kV) and above. They are used in equipment such as high-powered broadcast transmitters, amateur radio RF amplifiers and large <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners.</b> Industrially they are used in plasma generating equipment, for dielectric heating, and in semiconductor manufacturing. The main applications today are RF plasmas of 2 to 160 MHz where the vacuum capacitor is used as the impedance variation part in an automatic matching network in the fabrication of chips and flat panel displays.|$|R
5000|$|St. Giga {{and other}} {{satellite}} radio broadcasters {{found it hard}} to attract paying subscribers as Japan's recession made consumer reluctant to invest in the expensive <b>antennas</b> and <b>tuners</b> needed to pick up satellite broadcasts. Billboard Magazine, 23 July 1994 ...|$|R
50|$|If {{the loss}} of power is very low in the line {{carrying}} the transmitter's signal into the <b>antenna,</b> a <b>tuner</b> at the transmitter end can produce a worthwhile degree of matching and tuning for the antenna and feedline network as a whole. With lossy feedlines, maximum power transfer only occurs if matching is done {{at both ends of}} the line.|$|R
50|$|Transformers, autotransformers, and baluns are {{sometimes}} {{incorporated into the}} design of narrow band antenna tuners and antenna cabling connections. They will all usually have {{little effect on the}} resonant frequency of either the antenna or the narrow band transmitter circuits, but can widen the range of impedances that the <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> can match, and/or convert between balanced and unbalanced cabling where needed.|$|E
5000|$|An {{impedance}} matching (<b>antenna</b> <b>tuner)</b> circuit {{to match the}} impedance of the transmitter to the impedance of the antenna (or the transmission line to the antenna), to transfer power efficiently to the antenna. If these impedances are not equal, it causes a condition called standing waves, in which the power is reflected back from the antenna toward the transmitter, wasting power and sometimes overheating the transmitter.|$|E
5000|$|A transmatch matches {{transmitter}} impedance to feedline impedance, so {{that signal}} {{power from the}} radio transmitter smoothly transfers into the antenna’s feed cable; a properly adjusted transmatch prevents transmitted power from being reflected back into the transmitter (‘backlash’ current [...] ). Some <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> circuits can both impedance match and preselect, for example the Series Parallel Capacitor (SPC) tuner, and most circuits for balanced line (BLT) tuners can be adjusted to also function as band-pass filters.|$|E
50|$|A type of {{continuously}} variable air core inductor is the variometer. This {{consists of two}} coils with {{the same number of}} turns connected in series, one inside the other. The inner coil is mounted on a shaft so its axis can be turned with respect to the outer coil. When the two coils' axes are collinear, with the magnetic fields pointing in the same direction, the fields add and the inductance is maximum. When the inner coil is turned so its axis is at an angle with the outer, the mutual inductance between them is smaller so the total inductance is less. When the inner coil is turned 180° so the coils are collinear with their magnetic fields opposing, the two fields cancel each other and the inductance is very small. This type has the advantage that it is {{continuously variable}} over a wide range. It is used in <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> and matching circuits to match low frequency transmitters to their antennas.|$|R
40|$|The {{impedance}} of {{an antenna}} changes heavily with changing EM environments, while RF power amplifiers (PAs) are optimized for driving a well-defined load impedance. As a solution, switchable matching networks {{are used in}} automatic <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> to match the antenna impedance to (about) the desired PA load impedance. This paper presents a theoretical treaty of the minimum number of required states for switchable matching networks to achieve sufficient matching from a certain load VSWR to a sufficiently low input VSWR. First for an arbitrary passive lossless switchable matching network, the mathematical minimum required number of states {{as a function of}} the required input VSWR and of the required load VSWR is derived. Several variants are analyzed and benchmarked: single-stage one-ring configuration, single-stage two-ring configuration, two-stage one-ring configuration and three-stage one-ring configuration showing that single-ring configurations are optimum. An extension towards the required number of states for lossy matching networks is also provided...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{applications}} for <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> is in AM and shortwave broadcasting transmitters. AM transmitters usually use a vertical antenna (tower) which can be from 0.20 to 0.68 wavelengths long. At {{the base of the}} tower an ATU is used to match the antenna to the 50 Ohm transmission line from the transmitter. The most commonly used circuit is a T-network, using two series inductors with a shunt capacitor between them. When multiple towers are used the ATU network may also provide for a phase adjustment so that the currents in each tower can be phased relative to the others to produce a desired pattern. These patterns are often required by law to include nulls in directions that could produce interference as well as to increase the signal in the target area. Adjustment of the ATUs in a multitower array is a complex and time consuming process requiring considerable expertise.|$|R
5000|$|The {{challenge}} {{for many years}} has been to devise an antenna which is an efficient radiator, compact, andalso inexpensive. Previous solutions include the Barker Williamson folded dipole, the Australian traveling-wave antenna and other designs by Guertler etc. Many [...] "broadband" [...] designs have also been offered by the Amateur Radio community but these are generally not true broadband antennas as they only work well (without an <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner)</b> in the harmonically related Amateur bands.|$|E
5000|$|The company's well {{regarded}} [...] "K-Line" [...] {{consists of}} the K3 transceiver, the KPA500 500W power amplifier, the KAT500 automatic <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner,</b> and the P3 panadapter. [...] Also the P3SVGA add-on to the P3 to display the panadapter data on a large screen and the W2 HF/VHF/UHF wattmeter are sometimes {{considered part of the}} K-Line. Most recently Elecraft has introduced the [...] "KX-Line" [...] consisting of the KX2 and KX3 transceivers, the PX3 panadapter, and the KXPA100 100W power amplifier.|$|E
50|$|Complex {{impedance}} of {{an antenna}} {{is related to}} the electrical length of the antenna at the wavelength in use. The impedance of an antenna can be matched to the feed line and radio by adjusting the impedance of the feed line, using the feed line as an impedance transformer. More commonly, the impedance is adjusted at the load (see below) with an <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner,</b> a balun, a matching transformer, matching networks composed of inductors and capacitors, or matching sections such as the gamma match.|$|E
5000|$|Altogether 39 shows, each 52 minutes long, were {{recorded}} in 1965-66 at WNJU-TV (Channel 47), a New York City-based UHF station with studios in Newark, New Jersey. The shows were broadcast by Channel 47, primarily a Spanish-language outlet, to a very limited audience because only televisions equipped with a UHF <b>antenna</b> and <b>tuner</b> could receive them, and reception was difficult in an age prior to cable. For a few years in 1967-68, the shows were repeated on public television station WNDT (Channel 13, now WNET).|$|R
50|$|This type of {{connector}} {{is used on}} the Apple Airport Extreme Base Station's external {{antenna port}} and requires an adapter for most antennas. MCX and the smaller MMCX connector are frequently used to connect external antennas to GPS receivers. They are also common on USB DVB-T tuners for computers and laptops, to connect an external <b>antenna</b> to the <b>tuner.</b>|$|R
50|$|The primary {{benefit of}} using optical fibre for a {{satellite}} TV IF distribution {{system is that}} the fibre can carry the entire received spectrum on one cable, which can then be split to provide for multiple tuners, without requiring a separate feed from the <b>antenna</b> to each <b>tuner.</b> Additional outlets {{can be added to}} increase the number of receivers within one home without accessing the central antenna or main infrastructure.|$|R
