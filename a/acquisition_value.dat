25|$|Proposition 13 {{sets the}} {{assessed}} value of properties {{at the time}} of purchase (known as an <b>acquisition</b> <b>value</b> system), with a possible 2% annual assessment increase. As a result, properties of equal value can have a great amount of variation in their assessed value, even if they are next to each other. The disparity grows when property prices appreciate by more than 2% a year. The Case-Shiller housing index shows prices in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco appreciated 170% from 1987 (the start of available data) to 2012 while the 2% cap only allowed a 67% increase in taxes on homes that were not sold during this 26-year period.|$|E

50|$|Another very {{important}} concept used to understand mental accounting {{is that of}} modified utility function.

50|$|Woodford {{alleged that}} his removal {{was linked to}} several prior {{acquisitions}} he questioned, particularly the US$2.2 billion deal in 2008 to acquire British medical equipment maker Gyrus Group.

According to the Daily Telegraph, some of the sums paid out relating to the acquisition of a technology company ITX were also under examination.

30|$|As many {{motorways}} {{were built}} in the 1970 s and today’s traffic volume exceeds by far the numbers which have been forecasted in that period, significant parts of the infrastructure are ‘worn out’. Therefore, an increasing share of infrastructure funding has to be allocated to repairing and replacing infrastructure rather than expanding it (see section 4). The ‘level of modernity’ for the entire road infrastructure (defined as the relation between the current asset <b>value</b> and the <b>acquisition</b> <b>values)</b> decreased from 0.70 in 1991 to 0.66 in 2015 [13, 15].|$|R
5000|$|The {{individual}} {{capital gains}} tax in Norway is 27%. In most cases, there is no {{capital gains tax}} on profits from sale of your principal home. This tax was introduced in 2006 through a reform that eliminated the [...] "RISK-system", which intended to avoid the double taxation of capital. The new shareholder model, introduced in 2006, aims to reduce the difference in taxation of capital and labor by taxing dividends beyond a certain level as ordinary income. This means that focus was moved from capital to individuals and their level of income. This system also introduced a deductible allowance equal to the share's <b>acquisition</b> <b>value</b> times the average rate for Treasury bills with a 3-month period adjusted for tax. Shielding interest shall secure financial neutrality in that it returns the taxpayer {{what he or she}} alternatively would have achieved in a safe, passive capital placement exempt from additional taxation. The main purpose of the allowance is to prevent adverse shifts in investment and corporate financing structure {{as a result of the}} dividend tax. According to the papers explaining the new policy, a dividend tax without such shielding could push up the pressures on the rate of return on equity investments and lead Norwegian investors from equities to bonds, property etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} asset-based {{analysis}} of a business {{is equal to the}} sum of its parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation orted on the books of the subject company at their <b>acquisition</b> <b>value,</b> net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to fair market value wherever possible.The value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall enterprise value. For this reason, the asset-based approach is not the most probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the fair market value of the business.In considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell {{all or part of the}} assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore and understand better how consumers perceive the value of their shopping experiences in two key retail outlets—mass merchandisers and department stores—as well as how consumers ’ shopping orientations, recreational or functional, relate to consumer perceived value (CPV). An initial qualitative approach was used, i. e., in-depth, lightly structured interviews, to explore the perceptions consumers have of the value they gain during their shopping experiences in retail stores. Findings from the qualitative study were combined with an in-depth literature review to develop a survey to measure consumers ’ perceptions of transaction value, <b>acquisition</b> <b>value,</b> efficiency value, choice value, esthetic value, curiosity value, social interaction value, social status value, and self-gratification value when shopping in mass merchandisers and department stores. 800 surveys were disseminated, which resulted in 372 usable questionnaires for analysis, a 46. 5 % response rate.
