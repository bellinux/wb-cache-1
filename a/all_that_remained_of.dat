5|$|After Burgoyne's {{surrender}} on October 17, 1777 (part of {{the aftermath}} of the Saratoga Campaign), Ann Bleecker, her daughter and sister (<b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the family), and possibly a slave child returned to Tomhannock. Unfortunately, Caty Swits (1743–77) died during the return journey. Ann Bleecker was devastated by the loss of three generations of women in her family.|$|E
5|$|Contrasted {{with the}} flourishing {{state of trade}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century is the rapid and {{sustained}} decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely.|$|E
5|$|Following Deadstick, the engineers, glider {{pilots and}} 'B' Company men were {{returned}} to their parent formations. 'D' Company played their part in the 6th Airborne Division's defence of the Orne bridgehead, and advance to the River Seine. On 5 September, when the division was withdrawn to England, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the company were 40 men under the only remaining officer, Howard; the other officers, sergeants, {{and most of the}} junior NCOs having been among the casualties.|$|E

5|$|The Great Southern Group {{dismantled}} much of {{what remained}} of the company. Frederick W. Paine was detached from the LNC, along with the specialist division overseeing the exhumation and relocation of existing burial grounds to allow property development on formerly consecrated sites. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the LNC was Brookwood Cemetery itself, by this time moribund and becoming heavily overgrown. Considered virtually worthless, Great Southern sold the LNC to property speculators Maximillian Investments in July 1973 for £400,000.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Pixar {{continued}} its successful relationship with Walt Disney Feature Animation, a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become {{its most important}} partner. As 1991 began, however, the layoff of 30 employees in the company's computer hardware department—including the company's president, Chuck Kolstad, reduced {{the total number of}} employees to just 42, essentially its original number. Yet Pixar made a historic $26million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story. By then the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and IceMan, and Lasseter's animation department, which made television commercials (and four Luxo Jr. shorts for Sesame Street the same year), were <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> Pixar.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 6November 1995, a fire {{broke out in the}} Rova compound, {{destroying}} or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to douse the fire was hampered by the discovery that their fire hoses did not properly fit onto the nearby hydrants. In addition, the water pressure at the hydrants was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On {{the night of}} the fire, the body of one of the queens was found in the public square in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese had {{successfully}} evacuated {{a total of}} 10,652 men from Guadalcanal, about <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the 36,000 total troops sent to the island during the campaign. Six hundred of the evacuees succumbed to their injuries or illnesses before they could receive sufficient medical care. Three thousand more required lengthy hospitalization or recuperation. After receiving word of {{the completion of the}} operation, Yamamoto commended all the units involved and ordered Kondo to return to Truk with his warships. The 2nd and 38th Divisions were shipped to Rabaul and partially reconstituted with replacements. The 2nd Division was relocated to the Philippines in March 1943 while the 38th was assigned to defend Rabaul and New Ireland. The 8th Area Army and Southeast Area Fleet reoriented their forces to defend the central Solomons at Kolombangara and New Georgia and prepared to send the reinforcements, mainly consisting of the 51st Infantry Division, originally detailed for Guadalcanal to New Guinea. The 17th Army was rebuilt around the 6th Infantry Division and headquartered on Bougainville. A few Japanese stragglers remained on Guadalcanal, many of whom were subsequently killed or captured by Allied patrols. The last known Japanese holdout surrendered in October 1947.|$|E

25|$|<b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the Luftwaffe were {{scattered}} wrecks over airfields that were virtually aircraft 'graveyards'.

25|$|After the war {{the timber}} camp {{structures}} {{and the water}} pipeline and pumping equipment from Brown's Bay were sold to nearby Yarrabah Mission for removal. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the camp at Sunny Bay were the concrete slabs on which the timber buildings had been erected.

25|$|The {{transfer}} of Mason University College {{to the new}} University of Birmingham, with Chamberlain as its first chancellor and Sir Oliver Lodge as the first principal, was complete. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> Josiah Mason's legacy was his Mermaid in the sinister chief of the university shield and of his college, the double-headed lion in the dexter. It became the first civic and campus university in England.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the age, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> free Elves and Men in Beleriand was a {{settlement}} {{at the mouth of the}} River Sirion and another settlement on the isle of Balar. Eärendil had possession of a Silmaril, which his wife Elwing's ancestors Beren and Lúthien had taken from Morgoth. But the Fëanorians had a claim on the Silmaril still and so there was another Kinslaying. Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril across the Great Sea, to beg the Valar for aid against Morgoth.|$|E

25|$|Bedford School's Main School Building {{remained}} {{in this form}} until a disastrous fire on 3 March 1979 destroyed all but the west end where the Bell Room and the Headmaster's study were located. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> {{the rest of the}} building was the brick shell which was incorporated in the restored building. The restored Main School Building was opened on 10 September 1981. In the interim the school functioned in twenty-two temporary huts and by using the Howard and Craig buildings on the school estate.|$|E
25|$|<b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the school's {{furniture}} and fixtures after the fire were 3 tables, 3 dozen chairs, a Victor phonograph, a piano, and some desks and books. School continued on Monday in the nearby LDS ward chapel. On April 5, a bond issuance of $21,000 was approved {{for the construction of}} a new school building. However, there were difficulties with the results, and the final bond issuance was not approved until mid-August 1930. However, without waiting for final approval, bids for construction went out in the late Spring. By mid-June, eleven bids had been received, and the winning bid was from Albert Copeland of Mesa, for the sum of $21,125.|$|E

In 1990, these were <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> what was once {{believed to be a}} vast filigree of creekside Caraibeira woodland extending 50km into the Caatinga {{on either side of the}} Rio São Francisco along a significant stretch of its middle reaches.
