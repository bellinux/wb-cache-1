30|$|The {{variable}} “Number of enterprises” {{is positive}} and statistically significant {{which indicates that}} the higher the number of enterprises in the village, the higher the migration intensity or migrants’ intention {{to stay in the}} cities. This sounds like an unlikely result. However, {{an increase in the number}} of enterprises could provide rural households in the village a chance to improve their income, thus, causing migrants not to send <b>any</b> <b>remittances.</b> These migrants can focus on improving their living conditions in the cities. Therefore, improving living conditions is more important than providing job opportunities to attract migrants to return to their home villages. This is also in resonance with our finding that with an increase in the income gap between the origin and destination places, the duration of migration increases.|$|R
30|$|Another insight we gain is {{that new}} {{migrants}} pay relatively less for their migration than baseline migrants.

Furthermore, we observed that new migrants are in many aspects different from baseline migrants. Among the differences are for example the fact that new migrants are from a younger generation, coming straight from school and often not sending <b>any</b> <b>remittances</b> or only for special occasions. This also supports the zero effect we find for the housing quality index. Households with prior migration experience might not send a new migrant in expectation of future remittances and income diversification. Instead, the new migrants might move primarily to improve their own situation.|$|R

The third measure is the number of individuals who provided assistance to the household 7 in the past 12 months (henceforth, remitters) and who lived abroad or in Tajikistan. This measure includes people identified as remitters but for whom the household did not provide the amount received. Using these variables instead of remittances, should help us to capture a possible recall bias and measurement error in the amount of monetary and in-kind transfers reported by households, as it is possible that some households may fail to accurately estimate total amount of remittances.|$|R

While a few studies examined the remittances received or sent by migrants, there is little information about the variation in remittances received by households by migrant’s destination. Thus, this exploratory study attempts to answer: Does {{the extent to which}} households receive remittances vary by migrant’s destination? Using the data collected in 2013 from the western Chitwan Valley of Nepal, the findings from multivariate analysis reveal that net of controls, both the receipt (whether a household received <b>any</b> <b>remittance</b> or not) as well as the amount of remittances received by a household varied by migrant’s destination. Evidence suggests that households are less likely to receive remittances from migrants working in India (a country of low earning potential) as compared to those working in Nepal. On the other hand, households received significantly more amount of remittances from migrants working in countries with high earning potentials (such as Middle East, East or South East Asia, and America, Australia and Europe) as compared to the domestic migrants who were working inside of Nepal but outside of Chitwan. Adjusting for other factors, the largest amount of remittances was received from migrants working in the East or South East Asian countries (e. g. South Korea, Malaysia, Japan) followed by those in America, Australia, and Europe and the Middle East. The insights gained from this exploratory study are discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Remittances {{stand at}} the heart of the migration-development debate. However, they are {{overwhelmingly}} considered in financial and economic terms, neglecting important dimensions, such as gender and patriarchal family structures. This article contributes to rectifying this oversight by analyzing flows of remittances resulting from Albanian migration to neighboring Greece. We draw on a detailed questionnaire survey with 350 remittance-recipient households in rural southeast Albania and 45 in-depth interviews with a selection of these respondents and with remitters living in the Greek city of Thessaloniki. We found that gender is interlinked with generation and life-course stages within the context of Albanian patriarchal norms and that remittances are shaped accordingly. Although remitting to older parents is a filial duty for unmarried sons, upon marriage only the youngest son has this responsibility—other sons send small amounts as tokens of respect and love. Sending remittances is overwhelmingly seen as a “male thing. ” Single young women rarely migrate on their own for work abroad. Meanwhile <b>any</b> <b>remittances</b> sent by married daughters to their parents are considered “unofficial,” referred to as “coffee money. ” Within nuclear households, some increased power-sharing among husband remitters and wife recipients takes place. However, the latter are far from passive recipients, since they struggle to combine caring for children and the elderly with farmwork or day labor. We conclude that a deeper understanding of how remittances are gendered can be gained by placing their analysis within the migratory and sociocultural context into which they are embedde...|$|R

40|$|As {{the volume}} of the {{remittance}} inflow has increased remarkably in developing countries, it has attracted the interest of international organisations, academics, and policy makers. In this context, this study analyses the determinants of the receipt of remittances and its impact of on household expenditure and child welfare in Nepal using Nepal living standard survey (NLSSIII) data. It takes the receipt of remittances by households as the cause and their proportional expenditure on different bundles of goods, services (food, housing, consumer goods and durables, education, health and others) and child welfare as an outcome. This study divides the Nepalese households into two groups: one that does not receive <b>any</b> <b>remittances</b> is the control group, and the other receiving remittances from within the country or abroad is the treated group. To estimate the impact of remittances, the treatment effect model calculates potential outcome means (POMs) in the population. The difference between the two means is the average effect of the remittance. The study finds that the variables rural/urban region, ecological zone, family size, gender and education of head, the number of children, poverty of households, and migration network {{have a significant effect on}} the receipt of remittances. Although the probability of the receiving remittance is higher in rural households, they have received significantly less amount of remittances than the urban households. This study finds that households’ expenditure behaviour on food, consumer goods, health, and other bundles has not changed by the receipt of remittances in Nepal. However, there is an increase in the budget share of education and a decrease in the housing expenditure. It is highly likely that malnutrition in Nepalese children increases with the increase in their age. The research findings reveal that the receipt of remittances is helpful in reducing child malnutrition. The receipt of remittances does not increase the educational expenditure of school going children, and there is no difference in educational expenses between boys and girls. Finally, the study does not find any evidence to support that receipt of remittances increases conspicuous consumption of households as proposed by the findings of Chami et al. (2003). Instead, the research findings support the view that Nepalese households invest more in the education with the receipt of remittances. This higher investment may have been caused by the altruism towards the family members or by a knowledge gain...|$|R

However, legal migrants remitting money home increase their money outflows enough to offset <b>any</b> reductions in <b>remittance</b> payments from their undocumented counterparts.

40|$|Climate finance is a {{key issue}} at the UN climate negotiations, but {{explicit}} international funding possibilities for adaptation in developing countries remain limited. According to the recent Paris Agreement, climate finance will come from a ‘wide variety of sources, instruments and channels’. To the extent that these are understood, they {{do not seem to}} generate the USD 100 billion per annum that was repeatedly pledged by developed countries, and they flow to mitigation rather than adaptation. Remittances have potential to finance adaptation, because (1) the potential is huge and unexplored); (2) remittances directly reach to households, including in remote and vulnerable areas; (3) remittances are often employed for (climate-induced) disaster relief and sometimes also for investments in long-term adaptation strategies. Whilst not ignoring ethical arguments against poor migrants’ remittances as an alternative source of adaptation finance for developing countries under the UN climate negotiations, this chapter examines whether remittances could technically constitute such a source. It analyses empirical evidence from remittance literature against ten climate finance criteria from the UNFCCC Copenhagen Accord. Our analysis finds that remittances could match criteria such as ‘adequacy’ and ‘predictability’. However, ‘improved access’ can only be matched if developed and developing countries create the right incentives to reach out to potential diaspora investors. ‘Transparency’ is unlikely to be met. Whether remittances contribute to the USD 100 billion climate finance pledge is a controversial political decision, but in <b>any</b> case <b>remittances</b> can support adaptation at household and community level.

40|$|By {{assuming}} {{an economy}} that consists of labour sending and labour receiving countries, we investigate whether immigrants can actually improve their welfare by strategic <b>remittances</b> under asymmetric <b>information,</b> when wages are determined according to the efficiency wage hypothesis. For this purpose, we assume two types of workers in the labour sending country: workers with high effort and high productivity, and workers with low effort and low productivity. We also assume that information on effort and productivity of individual immigrants is symmetric between immigrants and firms in the labour receiving country if only one type of worker in the labour sending country migrates, whereas such information is asymmetric if both types of workers migrate simultaneously. We show that there are cases in which both types of workers have incentives for migration and strategic remittances at the same time, and thereby, neither of them can obtain higher wages. Therefore, strategic remittances can prevent both types of immigrants from improving their welfare. This result is in marked contrast with that by Stark (1995), which showed that only skilled immigrants have incentives for migration and strategic remittances and thereby both types of workers can realize higher wages.

30|$|Savings and {{remittances}} are two {{technologies to}} transfer {{resources to the}} future, but they differ in some important aspects. When migrants consider whether {{to stay in the}} host country or return, they view savings as completely mobile, in the sense that these may be withdrawn and used in either location. In contrast, remittances lead to investments which have location-specific returns. Indeed, a migrant eventually opting for a permanent stay in the host country will only enjoy part (if <b>any)</b> of the <b>remittance</b> investment. For instance, investments in physical capital (e.g. houses, small businesses, inheritance,…) will incur transaction costs to be repatriated in the host country. Other types of investments in the origin country, for example in social capital (prestige, social status) are simply immobile and illiquid and therefore sunk. These considerations have strong implications in terms of return plans under uncertainty. For instance, we show that migrants who tend to remit large amounts {{in the early stages of}} migration have, ceteris paribus, a higher probability of return. Also, ex-ante, returns to remittances are random since they depend on the uncertain final location. In other words, unlike savings, remittances affect the distribution of future consumption through (i) their different returns in each location and (ii) their impact on return migration.|$|R
