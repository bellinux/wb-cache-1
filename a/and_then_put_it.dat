5|$|Genghis Khan (also {{known as}} Chinggis Khan) lost his {{battle against the}} Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (khanlig) of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking {{protection}} in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to {{the spirits of the}} mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air and sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E

Alternatively, a diver can enter the water with the mask off <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on or use an entry method which does not result in fast water flow over the mask. Wearing the mask pushed up onto the forehead while {{out of the water}} or on the surface increases the risk of the mask falling or being knocked off.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} semi–main {{event of the}} evening, La Sociedad member Jeff Jarrett {{challenged}} El Zorro for the AAA Mega Championship. Like the other matches involving TNA workers, the match was refereed by La Sociedads own referee, Hijo del Tirantes, who showed bias towards Jarrett throughout the match. On several occasions Jarrett attempted to get El Zorro to submit with an ankle lock, the signature hold of his TNA rival Kurt Angle, but when {{he realized he was}} not going to succeed in his attempt, he took advantage of a distraction from his wife Karen and smashed El Zorro with his signature guitar, but to his surprise, only managed to get a two count out of the following pinfall. Jarrett then took a hold of El Zorro's kendo stick, hit him with it <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> across his throat and performed his finishing maneuver The Stroke to become the new AAA Mega Champion and the first ever American to hold the title. Jarrett left the ring as fans in attendance started to fill it with bottles.|$|E

500|$|There {{are plans}} {{to change to}} {{absolute}} primogeniture in Spain through a rather complicated process, as the change entails a constitutional amendment. Two successive parliaments will have to pass the law by a two-thirds majority <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to a referendum. As parliament has to be dissolved and new elections have to be called after the constitutional amendment is passed for the first time, the previous [...] José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero indicated he would wait {{until the end of}} his first term in 2008 before passing the law, although this deadline passed without the referendum being called. The amendment enjoys strong public support.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the album}} was {{completed}} in August 1981, its release was delayed {{for a whole year}} until the group felt ready to release it. Gartside defended the decision to hold back the album, saying that [...] "we could have released it then, and it would probably have got some nice reviews, sold a few thousand copies and disappeared. But we thought that if we held on to it, put out 'The [...] "Sweetest Girl"', built on that a bit, took some more singles off the album, built up the interest <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out, it would do a lot more.

2500|$|... {{written in}} about 1660. This account is {{particularly}} noteworthy as {{he refers to}} football by its correct name in English and {{is the first to}} describe the following: modern goals and a pitch ("a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals"), tactics ("leaving some of their best players to guard the goal"), scoring ("they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win") and the way teams were selected ("the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"). He is the first to describe a law of football: [...] "They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball". His account of the ball itself is also very informative: [...] "They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it as fast as they can, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into the skin of a bull's cod and sew it fast in". He adds: [...] "The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still". His book includes the first (basic) diagram illustrating a football pitch.|$|E
