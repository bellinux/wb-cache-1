5|$|In 1824 the Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> Act imposed one {{standard}} 'imperial' system of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> on the British Empire. The {{effect of this}} act was to standardise existing British units of measure rather than to align them with the metric system.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, the International Conference on Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> {{redefined the}} meter {{in terms of}} a red cadmium {{spectral}} line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). This definition has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|E

5|$|The International Prototype Kilogram was {{commissioned}} by the General Conference on Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (CGPM) {{under the authority of}} the Metre Convention (1875), and in the custody of the International Bureau of Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E
5|$|The Jewel Tower {{was taken}} over by the newly formed Standard Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> Department in 1869, who used it for storing and testing {{official}} weights <b>and</b> <b>measures.</b> The rising levels of London traffic made the tower increasingly unsuitable for this work, and by 1938 the department had abandoned it in favour of other facilities. In 1948, the building was placed into the care of the Ministry of Works, who repaired the damage inflicted to the tower during the Second World War, and extensively restored the building, clearing the surrounding area and opening the tower for tourists. In the 21st century, the Jewel Tower is managed by English Heritage, receiving around 30,000 visitors each year.|$|E

5|$|The metric system, that is {{the system}} of units based on the metre, was officially adopted in France on 10December 1799 (19frimaire AnVIII) and became the sole legal system of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> there from 1801.|$|E
5|$|A {{system of}} single weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> was {{introduced}} and in 1850 the Swiss franc became the Swiss single currency.

5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This {{makes it the}} smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E
5|$|Although the originators {{intended}} {{to devise a}} system that was equally accessible to all, it proved necessary to use prototype units {{in the custody of}} national or local authorities as standards. Control of the prototype units of measure was maintained by the later French governments until 1875, when it was passed to an international intergovernmental organisation, the General Conference on Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (CGPM).|$|E
5|$|An alloy of 90% {{platinum}} and 10% iridium {{was used}} in 1889 to construct the International Prototype Metre and kilogram mass, kept by the International Bureau of Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> near Paris.

5|$|In 1817, the Netherlands reintroduced {{the metric}} system, but used pre-revolutionary names—for example 1centimetre became the duim (thumb), the ons (ounce) became 100g and so on. Certain German states adopted similar systems and in 1852 the German Zollverein (customs union) adopted the zollpfund (customs pound) of 500g for intrastate commerce. In 1872 {{the newly formed}} German Empire adopted the metric system as its {{official}} system of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> and the newly formed Kingdom of Italy likewise, following the lead given by Piedmont, adopted the metric system in 1861.|$|E
