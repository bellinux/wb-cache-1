The flowers have 5 triangular lobes, and their corollas vary from white to light purple. The pappus consists of 2 to 3 series of slender bristles. One series of phyllaries fringe the flower head, which are fused at the base. The flower heads may be clustered or paniculate. The alternate leaves are nearly sessile and may clasp the stem (i.e. <b>amplexicaul).</b>|$|E
50|$|Kalanchoe fadeniorum is an {{herbaceous}} perennial plant lacking hairs {{that reaches}} about 10 cm in height. The branched stems have a creeping growth habit. Erect stems are densely leafy.

50|$|Leaf {{diversity}} is also notable in this genus. A few species possess highly succulent leaves (e.g., O. capensis, O. sedifolia) but most have bifacial leaves {{that are only}} slightly succulent. Size and shape is variable, with most species having leaves in the 1-10 cm long range, common shapes being elliptic, lanceolate, oblanceolate or spathulate. The leaf blades may be intricately divided (O. abrotanifolia) or lobed (O. cakilaefolia), <b>amplexicaul</b> or distinctly undulate. Often the leaves are sessile and the lamina is glaucous; leaf margins are entire to coarsely toothed. Some species are dimorphic in that the acaulescent juvenile leaves {{are very different from}} the adult leaves that are produced on the flowering stems.|$|E
50|$|Epilobium parviflorum reaches {{on average}} 30 - 80 cm in height. The stem is erect and densely covered with hairs, {{especially}} in the lower part. The leaves are opposite, unstalked but not <b>amplexicaul,</b> lanceolate and toothed, rounded at the base, 4 - 10 cm long. The tiny flowers are pale pink or pale purple, 6 - 7 mm in diameter, with four petals, eight stamens and a 4-lobed stigma. Flowering occurs from June to August. The hermaphroditic flowers are either self-fertilized (autogamy) or pollinated by insects (entomogamy). Fruit is a three-to seven-centimeter long capsule containing very small black seeds (about 1 mm long), with white fibres that allow the dispersal by wind. This species is quite similar to Epilobium hirsutum, but the flowers are much smaller.|$|E
5000|$|The plaited linear {{leaves are}} oblong lanceolate, with {{a length of}} 9 to 19 cm and a width of 0.8 to 1.5 cm. The [...] is acuminate.

They bloom in succession on the terminal racemes, which are 7 to 16 cm long. These flowers, 5 - 8 cm in diameter, are a rosy lilac and white disk with a purple lip. The bracts are wide triangular and surround the main stalk of the flower cluster. The occasional fertilized seed pods contain minute powdery seeds, and small plants often develop near the cane ends after flowering, and likely aid in propagation if allowed to reach the soil.|$|E
50|$|The tree {{typically}} {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 8 to 25 m. It blooms between June and July producing cream coloured flowers. The stem has a cream or pale brown colour with brittle stripes usually visible in the outer blaze. The stem is covered in flaky grey bark.

5000|$|Aristolochia littoralis is a {{climbing}} vine {{that can}} reach about 3 - 4.5 m in length. The slender stems are woody {{and the leaves}} are bright green, cordate, <b>amplexicaul,</b> 7 - 9 cm long and 5 - 10 cm wide, forming a dense attractive foliage. Flowers are heart-shaped, greenish yellow with intricate purplish-brown markings. These unusual flowers are about 7 - 8 cm long, grow solitary in the leaf axils and resemble Sherlock Holmes's pipe (hence the common name of [...] "Dutchman's pipe"). The inner surface of the flared mouth is completely purplish-brown. The flowering period extends through all summer. These plants are pollinated by flies which are attracted by the unpleasant carrion-like odor produced by the flowers. The numerous winged seeds are borne in dry dehiscent capsules that split like small parachutes. As the seeds are winged they are easily dispersed by wind. Plants in the related genus Pararistolochia differ by having fleshy moist fruit that do not split. This plant contains aristolochic acid, a toxic alkaloid.|$|E

40|$|Biscutella raphanifolia is {{a species}} {{distributed}} in N Algeria and Tunisia, {{characterized by the}} presence of large, lyrate basal leaves, <b>amplexicaul</b> cauline leaves, and paniculate-branched inflorescences. It has been traditionally considered the only perennial taxon from B. sect. Biscutella, lifespan being the strongest argument used to differentiate B. raphanifolia from other annual taxa such as B. algeriensis, B. confusa or B. didyma var. coriophora, with which it shares both morphological characters and distribution. Reevaluation of morphological characters in the light of phylogenetic trees from plastid (rpl 32 -trnL and trnV) and nuclear (ITS region) sequence data support a new circumscription of B. raphanifolia to include all those annual taxa. As a result, the new combination B. raphanifolia var. algeriensis is established, descriptions are provided for both varieties, and synonyms and lectotypes are indicated or designated for the names concerned.
