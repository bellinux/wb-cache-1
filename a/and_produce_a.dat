40|$|A {{system for}} {{encoding}} and decoding data words including an anti-analysis encoder unit for receiving <b>an</b> original plaintext <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> recoded data, a data compression unit for receiving the recoded data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> compressed recoded data, and an encryption unit for receiving the compressed recoded data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>an</b> encrypted data. The recoded data has an increased non-correlatable data redundancy {{compared with the}} original plaintext in order to mask the statistical distribution of characters in the plaintext data. The system of the present invention further includes a decryption unit for receiving the encrypted data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> decrypted data, a data decompression unit for receiving the decrypted data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>an</b> uncompressed recoded data, and an anti-analysis decoder unit for receiving the uncompressed recoded data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> recovered plaintext that corresponds with the original plaintext...|$|R

5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical, <b>and</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> thick layer of mucus, forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell {{is affected by the}} amino acid glycine which is present in the nutrient medium peptone.|$|E
5|$|Despite this form, his Test {{campaign}} started poorly with an ineffective 1/130 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston. He {{then broke}} {{down with a}} back injury in a match against Kent and looked unlikely to play. With Benaud already sidelined with a shoulder injury, Australia looked severely weakened without their two main bowlers. Despite again complaining about frailties of his body, Davidson vowed to play <b>and</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> special performance for friend and stand-in captain Neil Harvey in the Second Test at Lord's.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, RSM {{introduced}} an electric {{version of its}} SM3 car known as the SM3 Z.E., imported from Turkey.

In 2016, RSM also announced its intention to market the Twizy.

From there, they transfer to a female bee, {{and from there to}} the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.|$|E
5|$|Leigh became {{pregnant}} in 1956 and {{withdrew from the}} production of Coward's comedy South Sea Bubble. The day after her final performance in the play she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months. The same year Olivier decided to direct <b>and</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> film version of The Sleeping Prince, retitled The Prince and the Showgirl. Instead of appearing with Leigh, he cast Marilyn Monroe as the showgirl. Although the filming was challenging because of Monroe's behaviour, the film was appreciated by the critics.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, <b>and</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E

5|$|On 21 June 1940 the Central Landing Establishment {{was formed}} at Ringway {{airfield}} near Manchester. Although tasked primarily with training parachute troops, {{it was also}} directed to investigate the use of gliders to transport troops into battle. At the same time, the Ministry of Aircraft Production contracted General Aircraft Limited to design <b>and</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> glider for this purpose. The result was the General Aircraft Hotspur, an aircraft capable of transporting eight soldiers, that was used for both assault and training purposes.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation VR is {{a virtual}} reality device that is {{produced}} by Sony Computer Entertainment. It features a 5.7 inch 1920x1080 resolution OLED display, and operates at 120fps which can eliminate blur <b>and</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> smooth image; the device also has a low latency of less than 18ms. Additionally, it produces two sets of images, one being visible on a TV {{and one for the}} headset, and includes 3D audio technology so the player can hear from all angles. The PlayStation VR was released in October 2016.|$|E
5|$|Since {{receiving}} its startup funding, Florida Atlantic has secured {{additional funds}} from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, both centers {{have engaged in}} academic and industry partnerships, combining expertise in ocean engineering, marine biotechnology, functional genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Researchers, scientists, and students at the centers are designing technologies to explore the sea, harvest renewable energy, discover new medicines, and develop new therapeutics to combat agents of bioterrorism. As {{a result of this}} research, in 2007 the university and Lockheed Martin announced an exclusive licensing agreement to develop <b>and</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> rapidly deployable and autonomous mooring buoy system for military and scientific uses.|$|E

5|$|The spores of R.virescens are {{elliptical}} or ellipsoid with warts, translucent (hyaline), <b>and</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> white, pale or {{pale yellow}} spore print; the spore dimensions are 6–9 by 5–7µm. A partial reticulum (net-like pattern of ridges) interconnects the warts. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped and have dimensions of 24–33 by 6–7.5µm; they are colorless, and each hold {{from two to}} four spores. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are 40–85 by 6–8µm and end abruptly in a sharp point.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman later {{moved to}} Mansfield, where {{he began a}} law career before {{entering}} politics. Initially a Whig, Sherman was among those anti-slavery activists who formed what became the Republican Party. He served three terms in the House of Representatives. As {{a member of the}} House, Sherman traveled to Kansas to investigate the unrest between pro- and anti-slavery partisans there. He rose in party leadership and was nearly elected Speaker in 1859. Sherman was elevated to the Senate in 1861. As a senator, he was a leader in financial matters, helping to redesign the United States' monetary system {{to meet the needs of}} a nation torn apart by civil war. After the war, he worked to produce legislation that would restore the nation's credit abroad <b>and</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> stable, gold-backed currency at home.|$|E
5|$|Bulbs {{offered for}} sale are {{referred}} to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round bulbs are circular in cross section <b>and</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off of the exterior scales. To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower {{at the end of the}} winter or early spring, bulbs are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accepts partial shade exposure.|$|E
