5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests {{that young people}} were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were hopeful that the changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of skills and qualifications.|$|E
5|$|Film noir {{encompasses}} {{a range of}} plots: the central figure may be a private investigator (The Big Sleep), a plainclothes policeman (The Big Heat), an aging boxer (The Set-Up), a hapless grifter (Night and the City), a law-abiding citizen lured into <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> (Gun Crazy), or simply a victim of circumstance (D.O.A.). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, films now so described have been made around the world. Many pictures released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noir of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir. The clichés of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.|$|E

Sellers portrayed an ex-schoolmaster in a small French town who turns to <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> to obtain wealth. The film and Sellers's directorial {{abilities}} received an unenthusiastic response from the public and critics alike, and Sellers rarely referred to it again. The same year he starred in the Sidney Gilliat-directed Only Two Can Play, a film based on the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis. He was nominated for the Best British Actor award at the 16th British Academy Film Awards for his role as John Lewis, a frustrated Welsh librarian whose affections swing between the glamorous Liz (Mai Zetterling), and his long-suffering wife Jean (Virginia Maskell).|$|E

25|$|In Bunker's work, {{there is}} often an element of envy and disdain towards the normal people who live outside of this circle and hypocritically ensure that those caught in it have no way out. Most of Bunker's {{characters}} have no qualms about stealing or brutalizing others and, as a rule, they prefer <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> over an honest job, in great part because the only honest career options are badly paying and low-class jobs in retail or manual labor.|$|E

The intention {{is to give the}} prisoners the tools to deal with life outside, so that upon release from prison they will have the appropriate education to help them obtain jobs, and prevent them from returning to <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
