40|$|This {{comparative}} {{study examined the}} leadership role of <b>art</b> <b>department</b> chairpersons in selected midwestern four-year colleges and universities. It compared the leadership role of the <b>art</b> <b>department</b> chairperson to his/her immediate supervisor's perception of that same role. Literature relating to leadership and leader behavior for chairpersons in administration and art education administration was reviewed. The Leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire-Ideal (LBDQ-Ideal) and a demographic data survey were used. A {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) was used to measure statistical significance in Initiating Structure and Consideration. The population comprised forty-one colleges and universities with enrollments of 3500 or more students in eight midwestern states. Responses were needed from each <b>art</b> <b>department</b> chairperson and his/her immediate supervisor to have matched pairs for the study. <b>Art</b> <b>department</b> chairpersons were sent a demographic data survey to identify their specific environment and background. CONCLUSIONSThere is no significant statistical difference in the leadership role of <b>art</b> <b>department</b> chairpersons and their immediate supervisors' perceptions of that same role using the LBDQ-Ideal in the subscale areas of Initiating Structure and Consideration. RECOMMENDATIONS(1) A study is needed to develop and incorporate into existing art education specific programs for <b>art</b> <b>department</b> chairpersons and/or or art administrators and for those interested in becoming an <b>art</b> <b>department</b> chairperson. (2) A study is needed to develop strategies to increase the awareness of fellow staff and immediate supervisors as to the role and responsibilities of <b>art</b> <b>department</b> chairpersons. (3) A study is needed to develop in-service and pre-service training programs to emphasize the importance of skill development in both task-related (Initiating Structure) and people-related (Consideration) dimensions of effective educational leadership. (4) A study is needed to more fully examine the leadership differences between <b>art</b> <b>department</b> chairpersons with M. F. A. degrees and those with Ed. D/Ph. D. Degrees. (5) A study is needed to assess the leadership differences between <b>art</b> <b>department</b> chairpersons with prior public/private school experience and those with no prior public/private school experience. (6) A study is needed to determine the leadership role of <b>art</b> <b>departments</b> {{as a part of the}} total Fine Arts curriculum and program in most colleges and universities.
