5|$|After Boroughbridge Pembroke {{found himself}} in a {{difficult}} situation. The opponents of Hugh Despenser <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> lost all faith in him, {{but at the same time}} he found himself marginalised at court where the Despensers' power grew more and more complete. On top of this came his financial problems. On 24 June 1324, while on an embassy to France, he suddenly collapsed and died while lodging somewhere in Picardy.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to Joe Lillard and Annie Johnson, Lillard was {{the first}} of the couple's two children; Johnson also had a son from a {{previous}} marriage. Lillard took up baseball at the age of six; his other childhood hobbies included singing and tap dancing. His mother died when Lillard was nine, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> left about six years before that time. Afterwards, he moved in 1915, settling in Mason City, Iowa and moving in with relatives. Lillard attended Mason City High School, graduating in 1927. In basketball and football, Lillard won all-state honors, and claimed several Iowa track titles.|$|E
5|$|Driving past Silent Hill as a shortcut, Travis swerves {{his truck}} to avoid hitting a spirit manifestation of Alessa. While {{following}} the spirit manifestation, he stumbles upon a burning house and rescues the real Alessa, who was immolated in a ritual to impregnate {{her with the}} cult's god. Losing consciousness outside the house, he awakens in the town and resolves to learn if she survived. During his journey, Travis unlocks his repressed childhood memories and defeats monstrous forms of his parents: {{his mother had been}} committed to a local mental institution after attempting to kill him, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> killed himself, unable to live with the guilt of having his wife condemned. Additionally, Travis kills the Butcher, a monster that has been slaughtering other monsters.|$|E

5|$|Giovanni Battista Barbirolli {{was born}} in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British {{national}} from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1928), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.|$|E
5|$|During a CNR hockey tournament held in December 1922 in Montreal, Morenz scored nine {{goals in}} a game for Stratford. A friend of Léo Dandurand, {{the owner of the}} Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, {{refereed}} the game and told Dandurand how good Morenz was. Dandurand went to Stratford in January 1923 to watch Morenz play, and decided he wanted to sign him to the Canadiens. In April he met with William Morenz, because at the age of 20, Howie was still legally a minor. William told Dandurand that he wanted Howie to finish his apprenticeship at the CNR factory, which would take another two years. However, in July Dandurand learned that Morenz <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> been in contact with the Toronto St. Patricks, a rival team in the NHL. Fearing that Morenz would sign in Toronto, Dandurand sent his friend, Cecil Hart, to Stratford with instructions to sign Morenz at any cost. On July 7, 1923, Morenz signed a contract with the Canadiens for three years with a salary of $3,500 per year and a $1,000 signing bonus, a considerable amount for a first-year professional.|$|E
5|$|Riley's father {{returned}} from the war partially paralyzed. He was unable to continue working in his legal practice and the family soon fell into financial distress. The war had a negative physiological effect on him, and {{his relationship with his}} family quickly deteriorated. He opposed Riley's interest in poetry and encouraged him to find a different career. The family finances finally disintegrated and they were forced to sell their town home in April 1870 and return to their country farm. Riley's mother was able to keep peace in the family, but after her death in August from heart disease, Riley <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> a final break. He blamed his mother's death on his father's failure to care for her in her final weeks. He continued to regret the loss of his childhood home and wrote frequently of how it was so cruelly snatched from him by the war, subsequent poverty, and his mother's death. After the events of 1870, he developed an addiction to alcohol which he struggled with for the remainder of his life.|$|E

His grandfather set up shop as a merchant in New York City before moving to Chicago, Illinois, in 1854 and starting a meatpacking business. Richberg's father became a corporate attorney and later represented the City of Chicago. His grandmother, Mirenda Briggs Randall, and his mother were both physicians. His sister was the aviator Leda Richberg-Hornsby.|$|E
25|$|Symonds's {{mother died}} when he was only four years old, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> a {{powerful}} influence upon the formation of his character. The fashionable Freudian theory that a man's homosexuality is caused by a close-binding-intimate mother and a weak-or-absent father is put to rout by Symonds's childhood, in which the opposite was the case. Admittedly there were mostly women in the household, governesses, aunts, and eventually four sisters, but he records no sense of being overwhelmed by the feminine atmosphere, and was fairly indifferent to their presence.|$|E
25|$|In 1730 Hasse married Faustina Bordoni, and {{was also}} {{appointed}} Kapellmeister at the Dresden court, {{though he did not}} arrive at Dresden until July 1731; earlier in the year he had been active at Vienna, supervising a performance of his oratorio Daniello at the court of the Habsburgs. Soon after the couple's arrival in Dresden, Faustina performed before the court. In September Hasse's Cleofide (set to a highly adapted Metastasio text) was given its premiere; it seems possible that J. S. Bach attended the performance; certainly C. P. E.

25|$|Although Elrond was {{considered}} half-elven, {{that was not}} meant to be an exact percentage value. Through Lúthien, daughter of Melian the Maia, he and his brother Elros were also descended from the Maiar, angelic beings who had come to Middle-earth thousands of years before. Both his mother <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> mixed human-elf ancestry, and as a result Elrond himself was 6/16 human, 9/16 elf and 1/16 Maia. Elrond, along with his parents, his brother, and his children, were granted a choice between Elven or human fates by the Valar. Elrond chose to live as an immortal Elf, while his twin Elros chose the mortality of Men.|$|E

25|$|Earl Henry, son and heir of King David I of Scotland, {{had been}} in poor health {{throughout}} the 1140s. He died suddenly on 12 June 1152. His death occurred in either Newcastle or Roxburgh, both located in those areas of Northumbria which he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> attached to the Scots crown {{in the period of}} English weakness after the death of Henry I of England. Unlike {{in the case of the}} English king, who had been left without male heirs after the death of his only son in the Wreck of the White Ship, the King of Scots, David I, did not lack for immediate heirs upon the death of Earl Henry. This was because Earl Henry had left behind three sons to carry forward the lineage of his father.|$|E

25|$|Though Gore came {{in second}} in the electoral vote, he {{received}} 547,398 more popular votes than Bush, making him the first person since Grover Cleveland in 1888 to win the popular vote but lose in the Electoral College. Gore failed to win the popular vote in his home state, Tennessee, which both he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> represented in the Senate, making him the first major-party presidential candidate to have lost his home state since George McGovern lost South Dakota in 1972. Furthermore, Gore lost West Virginia, a state that had voted Republican only once in the previous six presidential elections, and Bill Clinton's home state of Arkansas, which had voted twice before to elect Gore vice president. A victory {{in any of these}} three states would have given Gore enough electoral votes to win the presidency.|$|E
25|$|In 1647, Shah Jahan moved Aurangzeb from Gujarat to be {{governor}} of Balkh, replacing a younger son, Murad Baksh, who had proved ineffective there. The area was {{under attack from}} Uzbek and Turkmen tribes. Whilst the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force, so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents. The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land, which was devastated by war. With the onset of winter, he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks, giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty. The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through snow to Kabul. By {{the end of this}} two-year campaign, into which Aurangzeb had been plunged at a late stage, a vast sum of money had been expended for little gain.|$|E

A native of Kentucky, he was a protégé of Winfield Scott, the general {{in chief of the}} Army, and was thought more capable of handling a crisis than the garrison's previous commander, Col. John L. Gardner, who was nearing retirement. Anderson had served an earlier tour of duty at Fort Moultrie <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> been a defender of the fort (then called Fort Sullivan) during the American Revolutionary War. Throughout the fall, South Carolina authorities considered both secession and the expropriation of federal property in the harbor to be inevitable.
