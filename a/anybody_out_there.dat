500|$|In 2002, Love began {{composing}} {{an album}} with songwriter Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes, titled America's Sweetheart, also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and began recording it in France in 2003. America's Sweetheart {{was released in}} February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of Spin called it a [...] "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" [...] and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while The Village Voice said: [...] " [...] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever {{wanted to have a}} glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there <b>anybody</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who fucks up better?" [...] The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame: [...] "America's Sweetheart was my one true piece of shit. It has no cohesive thread. I just hate it", she said in a 2014 interview. Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: [...] "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke." ...|$|E

Get all the fruits. Get everything. Become the biggest artist you can possibly be. Just don't get up there finally and start talking down on me, especially when we have no interaction." [...] Tory took shots at Drake again in the song, [...] "For Real". On June 27, 2016, Lanez talked to Ebro on the Ebro in the Morning show and he stated about Drake and said [...] "Hip-hop is a contact sport, I'm here to compete, I'm here to be #1." [...] He goes on to say, [...] "I was a fan of his music before, no one's ever took that from me. That doesn't mean I'm not here to take my crown." ...|$|R

2500|$|I {{even saw}} the Aurora take off one night - or an {{aircraft}} {{that matched the}} Aurora's reputed configuration, a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at two-thirty A.M. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the light went off {{and that was the}} last I saw of it. I didn't hear it because the wind was blowing from behind me toward the base." [...] I asked when this had taken place. [...] "February 1994. Obviously they didn't think <b>anybody</b> was <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> It was thirty below zero - probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV." [...] The author then asked, [...] "Where's the tape?" [...] "Locked away. That's a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I'll probably release the tape." ...|$|R
40|$|Although we {{have done}} {{extensive}} studies of the Solar System and thus far found over 300 extrasolar planets – planets outside our Solar System – {{we have not yet}} found life, even primitive life, on any planet other than Earth. Might there be life on some of these newly discovered extrasolar planets? Not likely, as most are gas giants or are too close or too far from their sun. However, of late we are finding more and more Earthlike planets. It is now estimated that about 15 percent of the planets in the galaxy are Earthlike, and many of these will likely orbit their suns at the right distance to support life as we know it. No one knows yet if radio searches or other means of detection will reveal that we are not alone in the universe. But if we do discover intelligent life elsewhere, how will we communicate with it? Are there some “universal” methods of communication we can use? Is music or mathematics a universal language? Are there alien intelligences right here on Earth we can use to help us figure out ways of communicating? The answers may surprise you. All of these issues and more are covered in this exciting, readable, and authoritative book on a subject that is not mere idle speculation anymore. We are certainly getting closer to finding <b>out</b> who, if <b>anybody,</b> is <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> This book will not only inform you about the search and the likelihood of finding life, it will also actually teach you how to talk to aliens...|$|R
