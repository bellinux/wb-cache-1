Groves delegated {{the authority to}} Nichols, except that contracts of $5 million or more required his authority. The written authority was only given in 1944 when Nichols was about to sign a contract with Du Pont, and {{it was found that}} Nichols original <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> project contracts from Colonel Marshall was based on a verbal authority from Styer, and Nichols only had the low delegated authority of a divisional engineer.|$|E

[...] Ethnic Poles from Silesia were also subject to pressure from Nazi <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> category III or IV. In many cases people were imprisoned, tortured and their close ones threatened if they refused to sign; deportation to concentration camps was also common.|$|R

50|$|Metropolitan Conon's most {{problematic}} stances {{were expressed}} during World War I, {{a period of}} political division. In 1916, Romania joined the Entente, but rapidly lost the Battle of Bucharest to the Central Powers: their armies occupied the city and forced the government to move the capital to Iași. Conon, who stayed behind in occupied Bucharest, was persuaded by the German <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a letter <b>to</b> the soldiers and the Orthodox faithful in Moldavia, urging them {{to give up the}} fight against Germany. The letter, written by author Gala Galaction at the request of collaborationist politician Virgil Arion, was later modified by the German authorities without Galaction's consent, and dropped as airborne leaflet propaganda over the Romanian trenches.|$|R
25|$|Although the Steelworkers {{would be}} taking a strike vote on December 17, the New York Times {{reported}} on that same day that the union would consider postponing its strike. The union's strike committee declined to give Murray the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a wage pact without approval of the union's membership, and set its next meeting for January 3, 1952. The strike committee's action, requested by Murray, was designed to make calling off a strike much more difficult and thus spur bargaining.|$|E
25|$|Section 92A of the Constitution Act, 1867 {{assigned}} to the provincial governments the exclusive authority to make laws in relation to non-renewable resources and electrical energy, while Section 125 prevented the federal government from taxing any provincial government lands or property. On the other hand, {{the federal government has}} the power to make treaties with foreign countries. This has important implications for treaties involving energy production, like the Kyoto Protocol, which the Canadian government signed in 2002. Although the federal government had the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> the treaty, it may require the cooperation of the provincial governments to enforce it.|$|E
25|$|The Republic's {{delegates to}} the Treaty Negotiations were {{accredited}} by President de Valera and his cabinet as plenipotentiaries (that is, negotiators with the legal <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a treaty without reference back to the cabinet), but were given secret cabinet instructions by de Valera that required them to return to Dublin before signing the Treaty. The Treaty proved controversial in Ireland insofar as it replaced the Republic by a dominion of the British Commonwealth with the King represented by a Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The Irish Treaty delegates Arthur Griffith, Robert Barton, and Michael Collins supported by Robert Erskine Childers as Secretary General set up their delegation headquarters at 22 Hans Place in Knightsbridge. It was there, at 11.15am on 5 December 1921, that {{the decision was made}} to recommend the Treaty to Dáil Éireann; the Treaty was finally signed by the delegates after further negotiations which closed at 02:20 on 6 December 1921.|$|E

25|$|In {{his essay}} Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation {{published}} by the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives at Dharamsala, S.L. Kuzmin, quoting the memoirs of Soviet diplomat A. M. Ledovsky, claims that on January 22, 1950, during his negotiations with Joseph Stalin in Moscow, Mao Zedong asked him to provide an aviation regiment because he was preparing to advance towards Tibet. Stalin approved these preparations and provided military support with Soviet pilots and airfield personnel dressed in Chinese clothes, because this aid was illegal. In 1950, the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China (PRC) entered Tibet and the US government made contact with the Dalai Lama's brother Gyalo Thondup, who was living in India, to offer US help, which was rejected. In May 1951, a delegation representing the Dalai Lama, 15 {{years old at the}} time, and led by Ngapoi Ngawang Jigmei, traveled to Beijing to be presented with the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, which established a PRC sovereignty over Tibet: assuming responsibility for Tibet's external affairs while leaving the domestic governance to the Lhasa government and assuring religious freedoms. The treaty was signed by the Lhasa delegation and the 10th Panchen Lama, who had already switched his loyalty to the PRC after flirting with the Kuomintang and conspiring against the central Tibetan government, which still refused to recognize him as the true Panchen Llama. Later there would be much controversy over the validity of the agreement stemming from claims it was signed under threat of arms and disagreements about whether the delegates had the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|E

They agreed that in order to avoid suspicion, Groves would {{continue}} to supervise the Pentagon project. He would be promoted to brigadier general, as it was felt that the title [...] "general" [...] would hold more sway with the academic scientists working on the Manhattan Project. Groves therefore waited until his promotion came through on 23 September 1942 before assuming his new command. His orders placed him directly under Somervell rather than Reybold, with Marshall now answerable to Groves. Groves was given <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> contracts for the project from September 1, 1942.|$|E

The Tibetans told them that only the absent Dalai Lama had <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> any accord. [...] The Amban [...] advised the Chinese emperor to depose the Dalai Lama. The Tibetan Council of Ministers and the General Assembly began to submit to pressure on the terms as August progressed, except on the matter of the indemnity which they believed impossibly high for a poor country. [...] Eventually however Younghusband intimidated the regent, Ganden Tri Rinpoche, and the Tsongdu (Tibetan National Assembly), into signing a treaty on 7 September 1904, drafted by himself, known subsequently as the Treaty of Lhasa.

The UNHRC has appointed a panel led by William Schabas to investigate war crimes allegations by both sides. Israel criticized Schabas as biased because he repeatedly made statements against Israel and in support of Hamas, and has announced its own investigations of both military and civilian leadership and the conduct during the war. Schabas denied any bias, but on 2 February 2015 resigned from the position.
