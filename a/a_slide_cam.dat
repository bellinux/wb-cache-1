The optical head is standard NAC Eye-Mark. This optical head was mounted on a magnesium yoke which in turn was attached to <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>cam</b> mounted on the flight helmet. The slide cam allows one to adjust the eye-to-optics system distance quite easily and to secure it so that the system will remain in calibration. The design of the yoke and slide cam is such that the subject can, in an emergency, move the optical head forward and upward to the stowed and locked position atop the helmet. This feature was necessary for flight safety. The television camera that is used in the system is a solid state General Electric TN- 2000 with a charged induced device imager used as the vidicon...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{innovations}} in refrigeration compressors and their mechanisms which were conceptualised (and {{some of these}} were commercialised) at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore {{over the past twenty}} years are discussed and presented. These {{innovations in}}clude piezo compressor [1 - 3], <b>sliding</b> <b>cam</b> compressor [4], rotaprocating compressor [5], revolving vane compressor and its variants [6 - 14], revolving vane expander [15] and cross-vane mechanism for expander-compressor unit [16]. The revolving vane compressor had won the World Best Technology Showcase, in Arlington, Texas, USA in 2009 and it has licensed to a Japanese compressor company for air-conditioning applications in automobile and private boats sectors, while the patent of the piezo compressor has sold to another Japanese compressor company. In this paper the working principles of each of these innovations, their uniqueness, advantages and challenges in applications will be shown, analysed and discussed. *References* 1. Ooi, K.

5000|$|... "Roller cam brakes" [...] are centre-pull {{cantilever}} brakes actuated by {{the cable}} pulling <b>a</b> single two-sided <b>sliding</b> <b>cam.</b> (First and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is {{most common and}} is described here.) Each arm has a cam follower. As the cam presses against the follower it forces the arms apart. As {{the top of each}} arm moves outward, the brake shoe below the pivot is forced inward against the rim.There is much in favor of the roller cam brake design. Since the cam controls the rate of closure, the clamping force can be made non-linear with the pull. And since the design can provide positive mechanical advantage, maximum clamping force can be higher than that of other types of brakes. They are known for being strong and controllable. On the downside, they require some skill to set up and can complicate wheel changes. And they require maintenance: like U-brakes, as the pad wears it strikes the rim higher; unless re-adjusted it can eventually contact the tyre's sidewall.|$|R
