5|$|The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and {{scapular}} {{area are}} a neutral grey colour. There is a brown {{spot on the}} nape. The top of the tail is brown, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of their breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown {{on the back and}} whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.|$|E
5|$|Eight centimeters {{wide and}} five tall, the Gevninge {{eyepiece}} was molded from bronze and then gilded. An oval eye opening is overlain by a sculpted eyebrow with grooves forming individual hairs, while grooves around the oval may represent eyelashes. The top <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the fragment each have three holes, presumably used to attach {{it to the}} helmet; the top three may have attached it to the helmet cap, the bottom three {{to some form of}} face protection such as a facemask or camail.|$|E
5|$|The NS-10 {{does not}} have a {{perfectly}} flat frequency response. The sound of the NS-10 is slightly heavy in the midrange, and like other sealed-box speakers of similar size its bass extension is limited. It has a +5dB boost in the midrange at around 2kHz, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> end starts rolling off at 200Hz. The midrange response is so open that it exposes the frequencies that are the most problematic and worst-sounding to the human ear.|$|E

5|$|According to Chapter I, Article 28, {{paragraph}} 2 of the Constitution, {{the national}} colors of Poland are white and red. The Coat of Arms Act, Article 4, further specifies that {{the colors are}} white and red in two horizontal, parallel stripes of equal width, of which the top one is white <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> one is red. If the colors are displayed vertically, the white stripe {{is placed on the}} left from the onlooker's viewpoint. Attachment no. 2 to the Act shows the national colors in both horizontal and vertical alignment, as well as the official shades of both colors expressed as coordinates in the CIE xyY (CIE 1931) color space with the tolerated color differences (ΔE) specified in the CIE 1976 (L*, u*, v*) color space (CIELUV).|$|E

Sky again controlled the head of the chase, with Vincenzo Nibali, Alejandro Valverde and Wilco Kelderman the notable riders distanced. Chris Froome launched an attack in the final , with Tejay van Garderen and Beñat Intxausti following. Van Garderen dropped Intxausti and passed Froome to take second place, thirty-six seconds behind stage winner Bardet. The new leaders in the classifications were Van Garderen in the general, Bardet in the young riders' and Sky in the team standings.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974, the Council bought Bridgwater Dock from British Railways. The {{concrete}} wall across the barge lock was removed, {{but there was}} no intention to restore the ship lock. By 1980, the Council had invested over £50,000 in the restoration, which included Kings and Standards locks, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> gates of Newtown Lock. Some bridges had been raised, but only to , which allowed canoeing, but prevented bigger boats from using the waterway. Work on the deep cutting between West Street and Albert Street started in September 1978, jointly funded by the County Council and Sedgemoor District Council, using direct labour, while a Manpower Services Commission scheme to dredge the canal from the dock to the cutting and to widen the towpath was funded by the District Council in 1981.|$|E

2500|$|The {{recovered}} NGL {{stream is}} sometimes processed through a fractionation train consisting of three distillation towers in series: a deethanizer, a depropanizer <b>and</b> a debutanizer. <b>The</b> overhead product from the deethanizer is ethane <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> are fed to the depropanizer. The overhead product from the depropanizer is propane <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> are fed to the debutanizer. The overhead product from the debutanizer {{is a mixture}} of normal <b>and</b> iso-butane, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> product is a C5+ mixture. The recovered streams of propane, butanes and C5+ may be [...] "sweetened" [...] in a Merox process unit to convert undesirable mercaptans into disulfides <b>and,</b> along with <b>the</b> recovered ethane, are the final NGL by-products from the gas processing plant. Currently, most cryogenic plants do not include fractionation for economic reasons, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> NGL stream is instead transported as a mixed product to standalone fractionation complexes located near refineries or chemical plants that use the components for feedstock. In case laying pipeline is not possible for geographical reason,or the distance between source and consumer exceed 3000km, natural gas is then transported by ship as LNG (liquefied natural gas) and again converted into its gaseous state {{in the vicinity of the}} consumer.|$|R
5|$|Like Vishnu's {{first two}} avatars - Matsya (fish) and Kurma (turtle), the third avatar Varaha is {{depicted}} either in zoomorphic form as an animal (a wild boar), or anthropomorphically. The main {{difference in the}} anthropomorphic form portrayal {{is that the first}} two avatars are depicted with a torso of a man <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> half as animal, while Varaha has an animal (boar) head and a human body. The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal.|$|E
5|$|Some {{distinctive}} {{characteristics in}} Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} eye and the bowl of the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters {{on the model of}} Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> right of the italic 'h' bends inwards.|$|E
5|$|The Ridge Route was {{official}}ly the Castaic-Tejon Route. The official {{limits of the}} Ridge Route, as built in the 1910s, were SR 126 at Castaic Junction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the grade at Grapevine. Until 1930–31 the road from San Fernando to Castaic Junction ran through the Newhall Tunnel at San Fernando Pass and along San Fernando Road, Magic Mountain Parkway (both part of SR126 until the early 2000s) and Feedmill Road to a former bridge over the Santa Clara River.

5|$|The pay of a praefectus of an {{auxiliary}} regiment {{in the early}} 2nd century has been estimated at over 50 times that of a miles (common soldier). (This compares to a full colonel in the British Army, who is currently paid about five times a private's salary). The reason for the huge gap between the top <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the pyramid is that Roman society was far more hierarchical than a modern one. A praefectus {{was not just a}} senior officer. He was also a Roman citizen (which most of his men were not) and, {{as a member of the}} equestrian order, an aristocrat. The social gulf between the praefectus and a peregrinus soldier was thus immense, and the pay differential reflected that fact.|$|E
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E

5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal.

In the top bracket the team of Máscara Dorada, Stuka, Jr. and Metro defeated Guerreros Tuareg (Arkangel de la Muerte, Loco Max, and Skándalo) in the first round and Los Cancerberos del Infierno (Virus, Euforia, and Pólvora) in the second round to qualify for the finals. The bottom bracket took place on December 29, 2009 and saw the team of Poder Mexica (Sangre Azteca, Dragón Rojo, Jr., and Misterioso, Jr.) defeat Fabian El Gitano, Máximo, and Rouge, and then Delta, Leono, and Valiente to qualify for the final. On January 6, 2010 Máscara Dorada, Stuka, Jr. and Metro defeated Poder Mexica to become the new Mexican National Trios Champions.|$|E
5|$|The English Football League {{comprises}} {{professional football}} clubs from England and Wales. It {{was established in}} 1888 as The Football League and in 1892 the Second Division was formed, with the existing division being renamed the First Division. The First World War caused the League to be postponed from 1915 to 1919 and two seasons following its resumption a Third Division was introduced for one season, before being regionalised as North and South. The 1958–59 season saw {{the introduction of a}} Fourth Division, with the top 12 clubs from the Third Division North and South from the previous season starting in a national Third Division, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> 12 starting in the Fourth Division. The introduction of the Premier League, which superseded the First Division as the top-flight of English football, caused a reorganisation of the English football league system in 1992, with the Fourth Division being disbanded. The First Division, Second Division and Third Division were rebranded as the Championship, League One and League Two respectively ahead of the 2004–05 season, which came as part of a then-sponsorship with Coca-Cola.|$|E

5|$|Tikal {{as a whole}} {{went into}} general decline during the Terminal Classic, with {{some parts of the}} city {{apparently}} being abandoned. The Mundo Perdido, however, continued to be a centre of vigorous ceremonial activity. Evidence of this continued activity in the complex includes burials and collections of ceramic and lithic artefacts, together with significant construction activity. The main Late Classic structures were fitted with new benches and a change to access routes to the complex took place. Activity was concentrated in the northern portion of the Mundo Perdido, perhaps because it was closest to the Temple Reservoir water supply. Some minor changes were made to the Talud-Tablero Temple at this time. The greatest residential activity during the Terminal Classic took place in the vaulted palace immediately to the east of the Talud-Tablero Temple (Structures 5C-45 through to 5C-47). This activity included complex construction projects and indicates that the elite were still in residence immediately prior to the complete abandonment of the city. Further construction activity, in the form of structural strengthening, also took place in other structures in the northern sector, including Structures 5D-77 and 5D-82. Ritual activity also continued, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> half of Early Classic Stela 39 was placed in Temple 5D-86 on the East Platform and worshipped.|$|E
