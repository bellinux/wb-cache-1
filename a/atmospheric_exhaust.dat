5000|$|The rescue chamber was a {{pear shaped}} steel chamber, the big end uppermost, seven {{feet at the}} {{greatest}} diameter and ten feet high. It is divided into an upper closed compartment and a lower open compartment by a horizontal bulkhead which has a water tight hatch in its middle. Surrounding the lower compartment is a ballast tank of a capacity just {{equal to that of}} the lower compartment. Inside the lower compartment is a reel with 400 ft of [...]5 in steel wire on it. The reel is operated by a shaft leading into the upper compartment. The shaft is rotated by an air motor. On the bottom edge of the lower compartment a rubber gasket is embedded into a circular groove, so that when the chamber is brought into contact with a flat surface (the hatch ring) a water tight joint may be effected with the application of pressure. Attached to the upper compartment is an air supply and an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>exhaust</b> hose, wire wound for strength. Also electric cables for telephone and light are attached. A wire pendant for hoisting and lowering is shackled into a pad-eye on top. This wire is also used for retrieving the chamber in case of emergency. The forward and after hatches of American submarines were fitted for attaching the rescue chamber. They have a flat doughnut shaped plate welded to the hatch coaming upon which the bottom of the chamber rests and a bail over the center of the hatch to which the haul down wire must be attached by the diver.|$|E

The plasma was observed as the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>exhaust</b> from a Mach 2 rocket test facility. Transverse {{profiles of the}} absolute integrated intensity were measured with the optically thin CsI lines (0. 5664 and 0. 5636 microns) at a range of axial positions downstream of the 5 -cm-diameter combustor nozzle exit. Radial profiles of the emission coefficient {{were obtained from the}} measured transverse profiles of intensity by Abel inversion. Temperatures were then determined from the emission coefficients for conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium using particle densities generated by a two-dimensional free jet computer program.

The correlation of microclimatic factors (precipitations, humidity, temperature, frequency and wind speed) with the physicalchemical measurements of environment pollution (powders, gases) has a special importance in the evaluation of the impact against the monuments degradation. The phenomenon degradation of the site analyzed is emphasized by its position within the city where the degree of pollution and the nature of pollutants are high. The church is exposed in the exterior to the physical-chemical attack of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas correlated with the microclimatic factors. The effects of this physical-chemical attack but also of the biological attack are seen on the exterior walls, on the stone lacery (Albesti calcite) of the monument. In addition, we present the sources and diversity of the biodegradation (lichens, fungi) of the exterior stone of the historic site, and the attenuation means...|$|E

The basic features and applications of open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for measuring <b>atmospheric</b> and process <b>exhaust</b> gases are discussed. Methods for modelling and in-terpreting the spectra used for in situ measurements are presented. As an example, a spectrum simulation was investigated using CO 2, a gas present in substantial quantities in various exhaust gases. The spectrum varied sig-nificantly with temperature allowing its use for diagnostics purposes. Thus, examples of measurements made using passive transmission with a heated object as a radiation source are presented. A baseline correction procedure was necessary to obtain a transmission (or absorbance) spectrum. The gas content and temperature were determined based on these measurements...|$|R
40|$|Removal of CO 2 from {{exhaust gas}} (CO 2 capture) {{has become a}} very {{important}} topic the last years. There is international agreement to limit the {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} to reduce the global warming problem, and CO 2 is regarded {{to be the most important}} greenhouse gas. One of the possible ways to reduce CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere is to perform large scale CO 2 capture and storage. There are several suggested methods for removal or capture of CO 2. The most mature method is to absorb CO 2 in an aqueous amine solution followed by desorption. Many calculation models for CO 2 removal by absorption have been developed. These models differ in accuracy, efficiency and robustness. In the case of absorption column calculations combined with flowsheet calculations, there will often be a question whether a detailed and complex model is better than a simple and robust model. In this work, calculation methods for CO 2 removal from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>exhaust</b> have been developed. To improve and validate these methods, some experimental work has also been included. Emphasis has been on calculation methods for an absorption and desorption process using MEA (monoethanolamine). One aim of the work has been to calculate cost optimum parameters in the process. Most of the calculations have been performed in combination with the process simulation tool Aspen HYSYS. Measured viscosities and densities in CO 2 loaded solutions of MEA and water up to 80 ºC have been correlated. The new viscosity data of CO 2 loaded MEA solutions at higher temperatures have reduced the uncertainty in the viscosity at typical absorption conditions. Pressure drop, liquid distribution and effective mass transfer area have been measured in a 0. 5 m diameter column in collaboration with NTNU/SINTEF. The experiments validate the performance of structured packing in columns at typical process conditions. Murphree efficiencies have been estimated for typical CO 2 absorption conditions in MEA solutions. According to calculations of absorption rates based on concentration profiles in the liquid film and approximation calculations, the deviation from pseudo first order conditions is less than 10 % for typical operation conditions below 50 ºC. Murphree efficiencies as a function of temperature for typical conditions at column top and column bottom have been calculated. These efficiencies are convenient to implement in stage to stage column calculation models. On the assumptions that pseudo first order conditions are met and the temperature at a stage is approximately constant, the accuracy in calculating overall CO 2 removal efficiency using Murphree efficiencies is the same as for more rigorous calculations. A CO 2 removal process from exhaust gas from a natural gas based power plant has been calculated in Aspen HYSYS. Total CO 2 removal grade and heat consumption have been calculated as a function of circulation rate, absorber temperature and other parameters. Simulations of the absorber have also been performed with Aspen Plus using both constant Murphree efficiencies and rate-based simulation and all the simulations give similar trends as a function of the varying parameters. Aspen HYSYS calculations using varying Murphree efficiencies give similar temperature profiles compared to Aspen Plus rate-based calculations. The process simulation calculations have also included split-stream configurations. A splitstream process using MEA with a heat consumption of only 3. 0 GJ/ton CO 2 removed has been calculated in Aspen HYSYS compared to approximately 4. 0 GJ/ton CO 2 for a standard process. However, cost estimation calculations show that it is uncertain whether a splitstream process is more economical than a standard process. Equipment dimensioning and cost estimation have also been included in the calculations. From a series of calculations, a cost optimum can be calculated. Optimum gas inlet temperature to the absorber has been calculated to values between 33 and 35 ºC which is lower than traditionally assumed values. Optimum minimum temperature difference in the main amine/amine heat exchanger has been calculated to values between 12 and 19 ºC which is higher than traditionally assumed. This optimum is very dependent on the ratio between investment and energy cost. Optimum rich loading has been calculated to 0. 47 mol CO 2 /mol MEA which is similar to earlier optimization calculations. Automatic calculation of these optimums is possible when using e. g. Aspen HYSYS with specified Murphree efficiencies...|$|E

40|$|Data from EPA's TEAM Study {{allow us}} to {{identify}} the major sources of exposure to benzene {{for much of the}} U. S. population. These sources turn out to be quite different from what had previously been considered the important sources. The most important source of exposure for 50 million smokers is the mainstream smoke from their cigarettes, which accounts for about half of the total population burden of exposure to benzene. Another 20 % of nationwide exposure is contributed by various personal activities, such as driving and using attached garages. (Emissions from consumer products, building materials, paints, and adhesives may also be important, although data are largely lacking.) The traditional sources of <b>atmospheric</b> emissions (auto <b>exhaust</b> and industrial emissions) account for only about 20 % of total exposure. Environmental tobacco smoke is an important source, accounting for about 5 % of total nationwide exposure. A number of sources sometimes considered important, such as petroleum refining operations, petrochemical manufacturing, oil storage tanks, urban-industrial areas, service stations, certain foods, groundwater contamination, and underground gasoline leaks, appear to be unimportant on a nationwide basis...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} cloud {{model was}} used to characterize the dominant influence of the environment on the Space Shuttle exhaust cloud. The model was modified to accept the actual heat and moisture from rocket exhausts and deluge water as initial conditions. An upper-air sounding determined the ambient atmosphere in which the cloud would grow. The model was validated by comparing simulated clouds with observed clouds from four actual Shuttle launches. Results are discussed with operational weather forecasters in mind. The model successfully produced clouds with dimensions, rise, decay, liquid water contents, and vertical motion fields very similar to observed clouds whose dimensions were calculated from 16 mm film frames. Once validated, the model was used {{in a number of}} different atmospheric conditions ranging from very unstable to very stable. Wind shear strongly affected the appearance of both the ground cloud and vertical column cloud. The ambient low-level atmospheric moisture governed the amount of cloud water in model clouds. Some dry atmospheres produced little or no cloud water. An empirical forecast technique for Shuttle cloud rise is presented and differences between natural <b>atmospheric</b> convection and <b>exhaust</b> clouds are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{thermodynamic}} characteristics of two proposed power generation systems (PGSs) : {{one is a}} CO 2 -capturing PGS with regenerative cycle based on an oxy-fuel combustion method {{and the other is}} a PGS with a similar structure but which uses air to combust fuel. In each of the proposed PGSs, steam (H 2 O), which is produced by utilizing a heat energy resource outside of the system, is used as the main working fluid for a kind of gas turbine: this feature is different from a conventional gas turbine in which air is used. Exergy efficiency is used in evaluating the thermodynamic characteristics of the PGSs, since energy with different qualities, fuel and steam, are used as input energy in each system. It is estimated under assumed conditions that the oxygen-combustion PGS (OCS) has higher exergy efficiency than the air-combustion PGS (ACS). The reasons are as follows. The turbine outlet pressure of the air-combustion PGS is higher than that of the oxygen-combustion PGS. Additional energy is consumed for the air-combustion PGS; power to compress nitrogen gas included in the air for injecting it into a combustor, heat energy to raise the nitrogen gas to the turbine inlet temperature, and power to compress the condenser outlet gas to the <b>atmospheric</b> pressure for <b>exhausting</b> it to the atmosphere. For example, from the simulation study performed, the exergy efficiency of the OCS is estimated to be 54. 4 %, higher by 0. 87 %, compared to the highest exergy efficiency (53. 8 %) of the ACS. CO 2 reduction characteristics of the two PGSs are also discussed. Key words: CO 2 -capture; Oxy-fuel combustion; Regenerative cycle; High efficiency; Simulatio...|$|R
40|$|Geochemical theory {{describes}} {{long term}} cycling of atmospheric CO 2 between {{the atmosphere and}} rocks at the Earth surface in terms of rock weathering and precipitation of sedimentary minerals. Chemical weathering of silicate rocks takes up atmospheric CO 2 , releases cations and HCO 3 &minus; to water, and precipitates SiO 2 , while CaCO 3 precipitation consumes Ca 2 + and HCO 3 &minus; and releases one mole of CO 2 to the atmosphere for each mole of CaCO 3 precipitated. At steady state, according to this theory, the CO 2 uptake and release should equal one another. In contradiction to this theory, carbonate precipitation in the present surface ocean releases only about 0. 6 mol of CO 2 per mole of carbonate precipitated. This {{is a result of}} the buffer effect described by Ψ, the molar ratio of net CO 2 gas evasion to net CaCO 3 precipitation from seawater in pCO 2 equilibrium with the atmosphere. This asymmetry in CO 2 flux between weathering and precipitation would quickly <b>exhaust</b> <b>atmospheric</b> CO 2 , posing a conundrum in the classical weathering and precipitation cycle. While often treated as a constant, Ψ actually varies as a function of salinity, pCO 2 , and temperature. Introduction of organic C reactions into the weathering-precipitation couplet largely reconciles the relationship. &psi; in the North Pacific Ocean central gyre rises from 0. 6 to 0. 9, as a consequence of organic matter oxidation in the water column. &psi; records the combined effect of CaCO 3 and organic reactions and storage of dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean, as well as CO 2 gas exchange between the ocean and atmosphere. Further, in the absence of CaCO 3 reactions, &Psi; would rise to 1. 0. Similarly, increasing atmospheric pCO 2 over time, which leads to ocean acidification, alters the relationship between organic and inorganic C reactions and carbon storage in the ocean. Thus, the carbon reactions and &psi; can cause large variations in oceanic carbon storage with little exchange with the atmosphere...|$|R
