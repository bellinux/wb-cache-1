40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the fraction of}} patients presenting with seizures and explore possible associations between seizure <b>as</b> <b>presenting</b> symptom and sex, age, tumor location, laterality, histology, Karnofsky performance score and prognosis. Materials and methods: All patients who underwent primary craniotomy for a meningioma at the Oslo University Hospital, in the time period 1990 – 2010 were included in this study. The patients operated during the years 1990 – 2002 were identified by reviewing operative protocols from this time period, while patients operated after 2002 were identified from our prospectively collected tumor database. All charts were studied retrospectively. The total number of patients identified with a histological verified intracranial meningioma was 1469. Results: The frequency of seizures, raised ICP and focal neurological deficits <b>as</b> <b>presenting</b> symptoms were 29. 6 %, 31. 7 % and 60. 2 %, respectively. Site of dural attachment, laterality of tumor, gender and Karnofsky score {{showed a significant association}} with seizures <b>as</b> <b>presenting</b> symptom, while age, WHO grade and right/left tumor location did not. Convexity- and parasagittal tumors most frequently presented with seizures. Falx-, lateral sphenoid wing- and supratentorial skull base had an intermediate frequency of seizures <b>as</b> <b>presenting</b> symptom, while tumors located in posterior fossa or brain ventricles rarely presented with seizures. Male gender and Karnofsky performance status > 70 were positively associated with seizure <b>as</b> <b>presenting</b> symptom. Overall survival (OS) at 1 -, 12 - and 60 - months were 98 %, 96 % and 88 %, respectively. Seizures <b>as</b> <b>presenting</b> symptom was not significantly associated with survival. Conclusions: 29. 6 % of the meningioma patients presented with seizures. Seizures <b>as</b> <b>presenting</b> symptom showed a significant positive association with convexity-/parasagittal tumor locations, male gender and high Karnofsky performance score. Seizures <b>as</b> a <b>presenting</b> symptom was not associated with survival...|$|R

5|$|Although it {{has since}} been {{replaced}} {{with a number of}} smaller displays available to the public in the reception area showing some traditional Scouting skills, a notable collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia has been on display in the past for visitors in 'The story of B-P' exhibition. This included many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his , Laws for me when I am old and several first editions of his books. The former exhibition also displayed the original painting by David Jagger, <b>as</b> <b>presented</b> to Baden-Powell on 29 August 1929 at the 'Coming of Age' 3rd World Scout Jamboree. This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement. The Baden-Powell memorabilia has since been moved to the headquarters for Scouting in the UK, Gilwell Park.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Wang's {{only hope}} for rescue was an {{intervention}} by Dou Jiande, to whom he had sent envoys already in late 620. For Dou, the situation, <b>as</b> <b>presented</b> by his councillor Liu Bin, offered both danger and opportunity: if Luoyang fell, the Tang would next turn against Dou, but if Dou intervened and saved Luoyang, {{it would be easy}} to oust the weakened Wang and annex Henan to his own Xia state. It was therefore probably by design that Dou waited until April, when Wang's situation was critical, before he began marching west to relieve the siege of Luoyang. Dou's army was a huge force, reportedly over 100,000 strong, and the two earliest sources report 120,000 men. Although possibly exaggerated, an army of this size was well within the capabilities of the time. The Xia army was accompanied by a similarly large supply train, comprising both carts and boats.|$|E

5|$|The victim, <b>as</b> <b>presented</b> by Goya, is as {{anonymous}} as his killers. His entreaty {{is addressed}} not to God {{in the manner}} of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as a hallmark of the modern condition.|$|E
5|$|While {{the series}} retells the real {{events of the}} gangland war, several {{inaccuracies}} have been pointed out and some deliberate fictionalizations have been made. The Purana Taskforce, <b>as</b> <b>presented</b> in this series, is not a portrayal of the real taskforce, as laws in Victoria do not allow real police officers, including those who previously served and were not sacked, to be portrayed by actors in the media. As a result, the characters presented are entirely fictional characters vaguely based on the real officers, leading to some major differences such as the series suggesting that a senior officer died due to a heart attack, which never in fact occurred.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{crossed the}} Black Sea at the Bosphorus Straits using a bridge of boats. Darius conquered large {{portions}} of Eastern Europe, even crossing the Danube to wage war on the Scythians. Darius invaded European Scythia in 513 BC, where the Scythians evaded Darius's army, using feints and retreating eastwards while laying waste to the countryside, by blocking wells, intercepting convoys, destroying pastures and continuous skirmishes against Darius's army. Seeking to fight with the Scythians, Darius's army chased the Scythian army deep into Scythian lands, {{where there were no}} cities to conquer and no supplies to forage. In frustration Darius {{sent a letter to the}} Scythian ruler Idanthyrsus to fight or surrender. The ruler replied that he would not stand and fight with Darius until they found the graves of their fathers and tried to destroy them. Until then, they would continue their strategy as they had no cities or cultivated lands to lose. Despite the evading tactics of the Scythians, Darius' campaign was so far relatively successful. <b>As</b> <b>presented</b> by Herodotus, the tactics used by the Scythians resulted in the loss of their best lands and of damage to their loyal allies. This gave Darius the initiative. As he moved eastwards in the cultivated lands of the Scythians in Eastern Europe proper, he remained resupplied by his fleet and lived to an extent off the land. While moving eastwards in the European Scythian lands, he captured the large fortified city of the Budini, one of the allies of the Scythians, and burnt it.|$|E

5|$|Scholars such as Herman TeVelde, I. E. S. Edwards and Toby Wilkinson {{believe the}} {{inscription}} {{of the famous}} Annal stone of Fifth dynasty, a black olivin-basalt slabstone displaying a very detailed king list, argues against {{the division of the}} realm. On the stone the kings from 1st to 7th dynasty are listed by their Horus name, their gold name and their cartouche name, their name banderoles end with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of king's coronation up to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called Palermo Stone and Cairo Stone. On the Cairo stone, in line IV, the nine last years of king Nynetjer are preserved (but most of the year windows are illegible now). The date of Nynetjer's death is followed by a new king. Recent investigations reveal that the serekh of that new king is surmounted by a four-legged animal, not by the Horus-falcon. Since the only four-legged heraldic serekh animal in early Egypt was the chimera of the god Seth, despite passionate disagreement, the indicated ruler is likely to be Peribsen. Egyptologists such as TeVelde, Barta and Edwards do not agree; Peribsen might have not been the only king with a Seth-name. The year events under Nynetjer show increasing references to Seth, suggesting the tradition of a Horus name as the sole name of kings might have already evolved. The rise of a king allied with Seth was thus unsurprising. TeVelde, Barta and Edwards think that, in addition to Peribsen, the rulers Wadjenes, Nubnefer or Sened might have been Seth-kings as well; one of them surely was the true direct successor of Nynetjer. The comparatively large amount of archaeological finds from Peribsen's reign contradict the brief estimated length of rulership, only 10 to 12 years, <b>as</b> <b>presented</b> on the Annal stone.|$|E
