50|$|Plastic {{spiral binding}} is a three-step process: punch, insert, crimp. First, a punch creates holes {{along the edge}} of the document. Second, a coil {{inserter}} spins the coils through the holes. Third, a pair of coil crimping pliers or <b>a</b> <b>crimping</b> <b>machine</b> is used to cut off the excess coil and crimp the end to prevent the coil from coming loose from the document. There are also more automated systems that will insert and cut and crimp the coil in one process and even some fully automated systems that will punch, insert, and crimp for the very high volume users. Light volume or personal users may choose to buy a single machine that does all of these features or may even choose to spin the coils onto their books by hand. Higher volume users will often choose to separate these three functions to help increase productivity.|$|E
50|$|On 13 June 1997 {{at about}} 6.55 a.m. the bigger {{of the two}} {{transformers}} installed and maintained by DVB {{on the ground floor}} of the Uphaar Cinema building caught fire. At around 7 a.m, an explosion had been heard by the security guard, Sudhir Kumar, who along with his friend found smoke in the transformer room. The fire brigade and the Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) were informed and the fire was brought under control by 7.25 a.m. Inspection of the transformer by the Superintendent of the DVB and his team revealed that three of the low tension cable leads of the transformer had been partially burnt. At about 10.30 a.m., Inspectors from DVB along with Senior Fitter, conducted repairs on the transformer by replacing two aluminium sockets on the B-Phase of the low tension cable leads. The repairs, it appears, were carried out with the help of a die and hammer without the use of <b>a</b> <b>crimping</b> <b>machine.</b> DVB completed their repairs between 10:30 am and 11 am. The transformer was recharged for resumption of electric supply by 11.30 a.m. on 13 June 1997.|$|E

One of his employees who was working [...] "under the table" [...] due to her visa restrictions, asked Almrei if he knew any men who might enter a marriage of convenience if she offered them C$4,000 {{to allow her to}} remain in the country. Knowing that Ishak, whom he'd met a year earlier at the mosque, was in need of money, Almrei informed him of the proposal, and the pair had a civil marriage at city hall as well as a formal Islamic marriage at the mosque, and Almrei served as a witness to both marriages. Almrei also drafted a fake reference letter from his restaurant to indicate that Ishak was an employee, to help support his case for sponsoring his new wife to become a Canadian. On September 13, 2000, Almrei's residence was searched and the forged passport was discovered. Ishak was stopped in Detroit while flying back to Canada on January 14, 2001 and charged with carrying bundles of fake identification and <b>a</b> <b>crimping</b> <b>machine.</b> Ishak returned to Bosnia, withdrawing his sponsorship of Almrei's former cashier. Feeling personally responsible, Almrei paid her back the C$4,000 Ishak had taken, out of his own pocket in October 2001, when he learned that Ishak was convicted of scamming prospective emigrants in Bosnia.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{automatic}} optical inspection system for checking {{the sequence of}} colored wires in electric cable is presented. The system is able to inspect cables with flat connectors differing in the type and number of wires. This variability is managed in {{an automatic}} way {{by means of a}} self-learning subsystem and does not require manual input from the operator or loading new data to the machine. The system is coupled to <b>a</b> connector <b>crimping</b> <b>machine</b> and once the model of a correct cable is learned, it can automatically inspect each cable assembled by the machine. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) the self-learning system; (ii) a robust segmentation algorithm for extracting wires from images even if they are strongly bent and partially overlapped; (iii) a color recognition algorithm able to cope with highlights and different finishing of the wire insulation. We report the system evaluation {{over a period of several}} months during the actual production of large batches of different cables; tests demonstrated a high level of accuracy and the absence of false negatives, which is a key point in order to guarantee defect-free productions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Metered Dose Inhaler plant of {{pharmaceutical}} industries of Bangladesh, clamp sleeve spare part used in <b>crimping</b> <b>machine</b> collected from foreign countries. The clamp sleeve presses the crimping tong containing aluminium can to crimp {{the body with}} head. Due to the continuous action of the clamp sleeve to the crimping tong the inner surface of the clamp sleeve get corroded. The clamp sleeve is replaced when crimping appearance fails to meet compliance. In this Research an experimental work relating to improve the mechanical properties of locally available low carbon steel material by heat treatment process {{have been carried out}} to replace the spare parts of clamp sleeve which is collected from foreign countries. The mechanical properties have been studied on before and after heat treatment. After heat treatment, it is found that hardness, impact and compressive strength of heat treated specimen has been developed drastically as compared to that of before heat treatment. Finally, the properties of improved material has been determined and used to the machine functional area to check the performance of the clamp sleeve. After consecutive operation of the machine it can be concluded that the improved clamp sleeve meets the user requirement with compliance of smooth crimping quality and locally available low carbon steel material can be used for the preparation of clamp sleeve spare parts of <b>crimping</b> <b>machine</b> for pharmaceutical industry using the proper heat treatment process which might be helpful to save huge cost and time rather than collected from foreign countries...|$|R

50|$|Termination of modular {{connector}} cables is very similar, {{regardless of}} the number of positions and contacts in the plug. To prevent damage to the plug (and the expensive crimp die-set), the crimp tool must be carefully matched to the plug being attached. For example, termination of a cable with an 8P8C plug involves using a hand crimper or <b>crimp</b> <b>machine</b> containing <b>an</b> 8P8C die-set or an A67T standard die-set. An 8P8C crimp die-set usually looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around the 8P8C plug. As the die compresses, these teeth force the plug contacts down into the conductors of the cable being terminated, permanently attaching the plug to the cable.|$|R
