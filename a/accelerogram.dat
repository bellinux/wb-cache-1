It has been widely used in recent years on the evaluation of the seismic vulnerability of bridges. The selection of seismic motions {{is one of the most}} important issues for the time-history analysis. This thesis discusses four different methods for obtaining spectrum-compatible acceleration time histories (i. e., <b>accelerograms)</b> of seismic motions. Based on these methods, four sets of <b>accelerograms</b> compatible with the design spectrum for Montreal were selected for this study. These included (i) scaled real <b>accelerograms,</b> (ii) modified real <b>accelerograms,</b> (iii) simulated <b>accelerograms,</b> and (iv) artificial <b>accelerograms.</b> The selected sets were used as excitation motions in the nonlinear analysis of two existing bridges in Montreal. The bridges included a three-span continuous concrete slab bridge and a three-span continuous slab-girder type bridge. These two bridges are considered to be representative of typical highway bridges in Quebec. A number of response parameters, such as, the deck displacement, bearing displacement, column curvature ductility, and base shear were used for the evaluation of the effects of the selected sets on the response of the bridges. Based on the results from the analysis, simulated <b>accelerograms</b> are recommended for use in the time-history analysis of the bridges. Furthermore, a study was conducted on the investigation of the minimum number of <b>accelerograms</b> required for both linear and nonlinear time-history analyses. Two different scaling methods, i. e., partial area under the spectrum and the spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the bridge, were used to obtain the bridge responses. It was found that 5 <b>accelerograms</b> are sufficient for the linear time-history analysis and 10 <b>accelerograms</b> are required for the nonlinear time-history analysis based on the results from the two bridges considered in this study...|$|R

A version (version 1) of this <b>accelerogram</b> has been used by several investigators for analysis purposes (Jai Krishna et al., 1969; Guha et al., 1970). Another possible version (version 2) of this <b>accelerogram</b> was prepared by the authors and is given in Figure 1. The <b>accelerogram</b> of the Koyna earthquake of December 11, 1967 showed a peak acceleration of about 0. 6 g in the epicentral region of the earthquake. This was the highest value of acceleration ever re-corded for an earthquake before the San Fernando earthquake of February 9, 1971, of magnitude 6. 6, which gave an acceleration fabout 1 g in its epicentral region (Hudson, 1971), and, therefore, is of unique importance for seismologists and engineers. A close study of versions 1 and 2 reveals that there is a marked ifference with respect to amplitudes and frequency content of the seismic waves. Response spectra, generally used for engineering purposes, also differ significantly (about 30 per cent).

40|$|The {{existing}} building stock in Azores islands (Portugal) was severely damaged during 1980 and 1998 earthquakes. Structural failure was probably {{caused by a}} combination of factors that are not yet well understood. Earthquake source characteristics, site effects and structural vulnerability may be some of those factors. However, {{it is very difficult to}} assess the influence of each factor on structural failure, mainly because recorded <b>accelerograms</b> used in nonlinear structural analysis are influenced by both source characteristics and site conditions. The only way to overcome this problem is to control each factor individually which can be done by using simulated <b>accelerograms.</b> In our previous work, stochastic ground motion simulations results were compared with earthquake records. Results seem to indicate that simulated <b>accelerograms</b> can match recorded <b>accelerograms</b> if proper source characteristics and geological site conditions are selected.

40|$|This paper aims {{at finding}} the {{features}} of an artificial <b>accelerogram</b> {{which can be used}} to assess the seismic safety of large and slender rigid masonry blocks. The most important of these features derives from a simple observation: well-known uncertainties on time variations of seismic actions imply that seismic risks analyses must be developed without privileging any detailed description of expected accelerograms. It follows that the best choice to build an artificial <b>accelerogram</b> is to represent it with sequences of instantaneous Dirac impulses. Obviously, in order to be effectively used, the <b>accelerogram</b> must cover the widest range of situations with a few parameters. This implies the {{need to look at the}} most unfavourable effects, also because of the large uncertainties that still exist about future seismic actions. With this aim, an artificial limit <b>accelerogram</b> is proposed to represent the most unfavourable effects of the intense phase of an earthquake. This consists of a sequence of instantaneous impulses, all applied right after the impact of the blocks on the ground. A secondary sequence of intermediate impulses is then introduced to reduce the resonance effects and to cover a broad range of conditions. Approximate equations of motion of the rocking blocks are also proposed and the accuracy of the proposed formulations is estimated.

40|$|A new {{strategy}} of analysis is presented {{here for the}} rocking motion dynamics of a rigid and thin block with damping represented by the coefficient of restitution. This {{is based on the}} construction of the "limit" artificial <b>accelerogram</b> which involves an upper bound of the block response and on its subsequent correction to consider more realistic situations. The "limit" artificial <b>accelerogram</b> is characterized by a particular sequence of instantaneous pulses and a simplified equation of motion is adopted for the analysis. It is firstly underlined that the amplitude resonance for the block is much more intense and frequent than that for the linear elastic oscillator. A "reduced" <b>accelerogram</b> is then defined by means of two criteria: 1) increasing the frequency of the pulses and 2) considering the limited duration of the stronger phase of an earthquake. The results are discussed with reference to the influencing parameters such as the coefficient of restitution and the size and slenderness of the block.
