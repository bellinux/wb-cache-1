5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs <b>and</b> <b>meanings</b> are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E
5|$|Every May since 1987, the University of Chicago {{has held}} the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, in which large teams of {{students}} compete to obtain notoriously esoteric items from a list. Since 1963, the Festival of the Arts (FOTA) takes over campus for 7–10 days of exhibitions and interactive artistic endeavors. Every January, the university holds a week-long winter festival, Kuviasungnerk/Kangeiko, which include early morning exercise routines and fitness workshops. The university also annually holds a summer carnival and concert called Summer Breeze that hosts outside musicians, and is home to Doc Films, a student film society founded in 1932 that screens films nightly at the university. Since 1946, the university has organized the Latke-Hamantash Debate, which involves humorous discussions about the relative merits <b>and</b> <b>meanings</b> of latkes and hamantashen.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine {{differences}} in volunteering experiences between middle-aged and older aged persons participating in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. Erik Erikson’s (1959 / 1994) concept of generativity is applied {{in order to test}} hypotheses pertaining to age-related associations between a pre-existing community volunteer role <b>and</b> <b>meaning,</b> self-esteem <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> as well as sense of belonging <b>and</b> <b>meaning.</b> Data were utilized from the Older Olympic Volunteer Project which contained a dataset on aspects of volunteering experiences before and after an intensive and episodic volunteering event among 282 middle-aged and older adults. It was found that the association between a pre-existing community volunteer role <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> in life was significant only for older adults, the association between self-esteem <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> in life was discovered to be stronger for middle age adults, whereas the association between sense of belonging <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> in life was found to be more robust among older adults. The results are discussed with respect to the concept of generativity <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> in life...|$|R

In brief, sound {{is the most important}} and irreplaceable manifestation of the relationship between grammar <b>and</b> <b>meaning.</b> This paper discusses the latent rhythm habits in the understanding of grammatical structures through an analysis of sounds withdrawn from the sections separated from the ambiguity structure in Chinese. In the paper, by analysing Chinese sounds of the different grammatical <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> structures of ambiguous sentences and conducting a listening and perceptive experiment, it is confirmed that the relationship between the understanding of the ambiguous grammatical structure <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> the variation of the duration of words and phrases is very close...|$|R

Hintikka argues on the contrary that truth can be defined through an IF logic <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> through a game-theoretical semantics. Without putting ito question here these technical results, I argue that Hintikka's conception of truth <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> is still quite close to some Wittengsteinian assumption and that he still holds a minimalistic theory of <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> truth...|$|R

40|$|Purpose <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> are primary {{facets of}} eudaimonic well-being, yet are understudied in {{adolescent}} development.

Although no generational or gender differences in purpose <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> were found, Asians reported higher search for meaning than did Latin Americans and Europeans. Presence of meaning was positively associated with self-esteem, academic attitudes and motivation, daily well-being, and ethnic affirmation and exploration, whereas search for meaning was related to lower self-esteem and less stability in daily well-being. Presence of meaning mediated associations between ethnic identity and adjustment, explaining 28 - 52 % of the initial effect of ethnic identity and providing one mechanism to account for ethnic identity’s protective effect on development.

Guru Har Rai, for example, disowned one of his sons, Ram Rai, because he had attempted to alter the wording of a hymn by Guru Nanak Dev. Guru Har Rai had sent Ram Rai to Delhi in order to explain Gurbani to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. To please the Emperor he altered the wording of a hymn, which was reported to the guru. Displeased with his son, the guru disowned him and forbade his Sikhs to associate with him or his descendants.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{points out}} that beliefs <b>and</b> <b>meanings</b> are inseparable. A person holds a {{sentence}} true {{based on what he}} believes and what he takes the sentence to mean. If the interpreter knew what a person believed when that person held a sentence to be true, the meaning of the sentence could then be inferred. Vice versa, if the interpreter knew what a person took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred. So Davidson doesn't allow the interpreter to have access to beliefs as evidence, since the interpreter would then be begging the question. Instead, Davidson allows that the interpreter can reasonably ascertain when a speaker holds a sentence true, without knowing anything about a particular belief or meaning. That will then allow the interpreter to construct hypotheses relating a speaker and an utterance to a particular state of affairs at a particular time.|$|E
