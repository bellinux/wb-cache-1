A teaching hospital based population study of Hepatitis B surface antigen is strong indicator of true HBV infection rate in the community as large number of patients from different backgrounds attend the hospital. Objectives: The study was conducted to know the prevalence of HBV infection in Bijapur, Karnataka. Methodology: A one step immunochromatographic method for detection of HBsAg was performed to diagnose HBV infection. 4283 sera samples were tested for HBsAg over a period of one year. Results: 1. 63 % samples were found with HBsAg. Age, gender, month wise and rural: urban distribution was studied.

40|$|Controllable solid {{propulsion}} systems have distinctive combustion and acoustic environments that require enhanced testing and analysis techniques to progress {{this new technology}} from development to production. In a hot gas valve actuating system, {{the movement of the}} pintle through the hot gas exhibits complex acoustic disturbances and flow characteristics that can amplify induced pressure loads that can damage or detonate the rocket motor. The geometry of a controllable solid propulsion gas chamber can set up unique unsteady flow which can feed acoustic oscillations patterns that require characterization.

40|$|Thirty adult {{patients}} with aortic stenosis had Doppler echocardiography within 1 day of cardiac catheterization. Noninvasive {{measurement of the}} mean transaortic pressure gradient was calculated by applying the simplified Bernoulli equation to the continuous wave Doppler transaortic velocity recording. Stroke volume was measured noninvasively by multiplying the systolic velocity integral of flow in the left ventricular outflow tract (obtained by pulsed Doppler ultrasonography) by the cross-sectional area of the left ventricular outflow tract (measured by two-dimensional echocardiography). Noninvasive measurement of aortic valve area was calculated by two methods. In method 1, the Gorlin equation was applied using Doppler-derived mean pressure gradient, cardiac output and systolic ejection period. Method 2 used the continuity equation. These noninvasive measurements were compared with invasive measurements using linear regression analysis, and mean pressure gradients correlated well (r = 0. 92). Aortic valve area by either noninvasive method also correlated well with cardiac catheterization values (method 1, r = 0. 87; method 2, r = 0. 88). The sensitivity of Doppler detection of critical aortic stenosis was 0. 86, with a specificity of 0. 88 and a positive predictive value of 0. 86. Cardiac output measured nonsimultaneously showed poor correlation (r = 0. 51). Doppler echocardiography can distinguish critical from noncritical aortic stenosis {{with a high degree}} of accuracy. Measurement of aortic valve <b>area</b> <b>aids</b> interpretation of Doppler-derived mean pressure gradient data when the gradients are in an intermediate range (30 to 50 mm Hg) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{landscape}} {{of water in}} Utah is changing due to population growth, conversion of agricultural land to urban development, and increasing awareness of water scarcity. The Utah Division of Water Resources forecasts that the currently developed water supplies {{will not be enough}} to provide for Utah’s future population, and is pursuing conservation and new development to meet the state’s anticipated needs. Along with the urban growth Utah is experiencing a growing urban and small farm agricultural sector, but knowledge of water use in these operations is limited. Further research in this <b>area</b> <b>aids</b> in understanding the impact of land use change on the state’s hydrology, aids the state water authorities in water use estimates, assists farmers in moving towards wiser water management, and helps Utah State University Extension better meet the needs of small irrigators. My research creates a clearer picture of urban and small farm agricultural irrigation in Utah. For the 2015 growing season I performed irrigation evaluations for 24 urban and small farms in Cache Valley, and I explore the results from both case study and statistical perspectives. My results show a great degree of heterogeneity with irrigation efficiencies ranging from 6 % to 100 %. In general, small fields had greater irrigation depths than large fields, and surface irrigated fields applied higher depths than sprinkle and drip irrigated fields. Yet a big influence on efficiency was management, as fields relying on a set schedule had higher depths than fields that were irrigated inconsistently due to other factors. Therefore, water conservation programs focused on reducing irrigated area or providing technological alternatives may not result in true water savings if the effect of management is ignored. In particular, urban and small farmers need increased awareness of how management can result in savings of time and money, and improved knowledge of how to measure application rates, improve application uniformity, and scheduling techniques. With improvements in these areas, water management on urban and small farms can be improved, therein helping the urban and small farm irrigators themselves as well as the state in meeting its future water needs...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the experience of family caregivers of patients with AIDS-related conditions in Malawi. The study used qualitative and quantitative methods. The sample was comprised of caregivers from rural areas as well as urban areas that included a major hospital and a non-governmental organization (NGO). Convenience sampling was used to recruit the sample. The study investigated: caregivers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions about their patients 2 ̆ 7 illness; how their roles as caregivers were acquired; role preparedness and role performance of caregivers; resources and support available to the caregivers, and satisfaction with support; whether or not caregivers experienced role strain; and correlations among variables. A comparison was made between the rural and urban caregivers; and between qualitative and quantitative findings. Data were analyzed by thematic analysis, t-test, chi-square and Spearman rho correlation. The findings included that role acquisition was mostly out of obligation. Mothers were a majority of caregivers in the rural setting while wives were a majority in the urban <b>area.</b> <b>AIDS</b> was seen as a secret disease by patients and caregivers. Non-disclosure of diagnosis occurred even with spouses. Education of caregivers by health personnel was poor, and there was no significant difference in role preparation between the rural caregivers and caregivers of patients who received healthcare at a major urban hospital. ^ The caregivers experienced various strains with the rural caregivers experiencing significantly more strain than the urban caregivers. Very few patients were abandoned by relatives. Although the disease itself had stigma, many caregivers had moral support, though not necessarily with physical care. Caregivers from the NGO had better support. The functions performed by rural and urban caregivers were similar, but the rural caregivers were more financially deprived. Most caregivers did not use any protection when touching patients 2 ̆ 7 body fluids, such as cleaning wounds. Recommendations include: the need for improved preparation of patients for homecare; promotion of sharing diagnosis with spouse and caregivers because of risk of transmission; promotion of homecare support groups even in rural areas. Further studies were also recommended such as the effects on children of having a parent with AIDS. ...|$|E
