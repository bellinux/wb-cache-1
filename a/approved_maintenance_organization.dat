40|$|In {{this study}} survey data {{was used to}} assess employees’ {{perceptions}} of Safety Management System (SMS) implementation in an <b>Approved</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Organization</b> (AMO) in the aviation industry. AMOs in Nigeria were used as a case study. Results show that over 80 % of the population used for this study accord to the existence of plans to implement SMS. However, results indicated a lack of safety management education, training and motivation, which are key concepts that influence all the safety management implementation process. Furthermore, results reveal the lack of skills to analyze risk associated with identified hazard. Internal audit and safety investigation are the main means of safety performance monitoring within the AMO. Hypothetical test was conducted using Chi-square statistic. The results show that there is no significant relationship between the appointment of key personnel and management commitment within an AMO safety management system. Overall, the findings suggest that AMO need to do more to improve the implementation and understanding of SMS within the AMO...|$|E
