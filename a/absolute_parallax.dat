40|$|SS Cygni {{is one of}} the {{brightest}} dwarf novae (DNe), and one of the best-studied prototypes of the cataclysmic variables. Astrometric observations with the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), published in 2004, gave an absolute trigonometric parallax of 6. 06 +/- 0. 44 mas. However, recent very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), obtained during radio outbursts of SS Cyg, has yielded a significantly larger <b>absolute</b> <b>parallax</b> of 8. 80 +/- 0. 12 mas, as well as a large difference {{in the direction of the}} proper motion compared to the HST result. The VLBI distance reduces the implied luminosity of SS Cyg by about a factor of two, giving good agreement with predictions based on accretion-disk theory in order to explain the observed DN outburst behavior. This discrepancy raises the possibility of significant systematic errors in FGS parallaxes and proper motions. We have reanalyzed the archival HST/FGS data, including (1) a critical redetermination of the parallaxes of the background astrometric reference stars, (2) updated input values of the reference-star proper motions, and (3) correction of the position measurements for color-dependent shifts. Our new analysis yields a proper motion of SS Cyg that agrees well with the VLBI motion, and an <b>absolute</b> <b>parallax</b> of 8. 30 +/- 0. 41 mas, also statistically concordant with the VLBI result at the ~ 1. 2 sigma level. Our results suggest that HST/FGS parallaxes are free of large systematic errors, when the data are reduced using high-quality input values for the astrometry of the reference stars, and when instrumental signatures are properly removed.

We obtain member parallaxes from six {{individual}} Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) fields and use the field containing van Altena 622 and van Altena 627 (= HIP 21138) as an example.

The parallax of vA 627 is significantly improved by including a perturbation orbit for this previously known spectroscopic binary, now an astrometric binary. Compared to our original (1997) determina- tions, a combination of new data, updated calibration, and improved analysis lowered the individual parallax errors by an average factor of 4. 5. Comparing parallaxes of the four stars contained in the Hipparcos catalog, we obtain an average factor of 11 times improvement with the HST.

40|$|Abstract-Using {{the head}} motion procedure, the {{apparent}} {{distance of a}} point of light in an otherwise dark visual field was measured under conditions in which oculomotor cues (accommodation, convergence) and <b>absolute</b> motion <b>parallax</b> were varied together and separately. It was concluded that <b>absolute</b> motion <b>parallax</b> is almost as effective a cue to distance as are oculomotor cues from monocular observation, but is not as effective as oculomotor cues from binocular observation. Evidence was also presented that the null adjustment method, {{used in conjunction with}} the head motion procedure, provides an unbiased measure of apparent distance. In a series of articles (Gogel, 1976, 1977; Gogel and Newton, 1976; Gogel and Tietz, 1973, 1974, 1977) a new method of measuring apparent distance called the head motion procedure has been described and applied to the measurement of perceived distance from several distance cues. With the head motion procedure, the head is moved in a frontoparallel plane and judgments are obtained of the apparent motio...|$|R
40|$|We present multi-epoch astrometric {{observations}} of the M 9 ultra-cool dwarf TVLM 513 - 46546 that is placed at the brown dwarf boundary. The new observations have been performed with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 6 cm band. The target has been detected at 7 ~epochs spanning three years, with measured quiescent emission flux in the range 180 - 300 muJy. We identified four short-duration flaring events (0. 5 - 2 mJy) with very high circular polarization (~ 75 %- 100 %). Properties of the observed radio flares support the physical model of the source that {{is characterized by the}} electron cyclotron maser instability responsible for outbursts of radio emission. Combined with Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) earlier data, our detections make it possible to refine the <b>absolute</b> <b>parallax</b> pi= 93. 27 (+ 0. 18,- 0. 17) mas. Our measurements rule out TVLM 513 - 46546 companions more massive than Jupiter in orbits with periods longer than ~ 1 yr.

40|$|Like Hipparcos, Gaia is {{designed}} to give <b>absolute</b> <b>parallaxes,</b> independent of any astrophysical reference system. And indeed, Gaia's internal zero-point error for parallaxes {{is likely to be}} smaller than any individual parallax error. Nevertheless, due in part to mechanical issues of unknown origin, there are many astrophysical questions for which the parallax zero-point error σ(π_ 0) will be the fundamentally limiting constraint. These include the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Galactic Center. We show that by using the photometric parallax estimates for RR Lyrae stars (RRL) within 8 kpc, via the ultra-precise infrared period-luminosity relation, one can independently determine a hyper-precise value for π_ 0. Despite their paucity relative to bright quasars, we show that RRL are competitive due to their order-of-magnitude improved parallax precision for each individual object relative to bright quasars. We show that this method is mathematically robust and well-approximated by analytic formulae over a wide range of relevant distances. Comment: 5 pages, 1 Figure, submitted to JKA...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of spectral type and luminosity classification of reference stars in the Allegheny Observatory MAP parallax program, using broadband and intermediate-band photometry. In addition to the use of UBVRI and DDO photometric systems, the uvbyH-beta photometric system was included for classification of blue (B - V less than 0. 6) reference stars. The stellar classifications made from the photometry are used to determine spectroscopic parallaxes. The spectroscopic parallaxes are used in turn to adjust the relative parallaxes measured with the MAP to <b>absolute</b> <b>parallaxes.</b> A new method for dereddening stars using more than one photometric system is presented. In the process of dereddening, visual extinctions, spectral types, and luminosity classes are determined, as well as a measure of the goodness of fit. The measure of goodness of fit quantifies confidence in the stellar classifications. It is found that the spectral types are reliable to within 2. 5 spectral subclasses...|$|R
