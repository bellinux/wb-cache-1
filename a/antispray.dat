Miron with coauthors in [6], [9], [10] gave a comprehensive theory of higher order geometry and the spray theory. In [2] I. ƒomi ¢ reported the relation between J structure, Liouville vector elds and the S-vector eld as a more general basis than used by R. Miron and with the di erent variable y kα = dkx α dtk (y kα = 1 d k! k x α dtk in Miron's papers). Here, the adapted basis is changed {{in such a way}} that the mentioned relations have a new, simpler and more elegant form. The combinatorial aspect was also used and the notion of <b>antispray</b> is introduced. Using the specially adapted bases the spray and <b>antispray</b> theories in the subspaces of Osc k M were established...|$|E
