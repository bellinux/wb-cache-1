500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club {{wrote that the}} episode was [...] "a good introduction to the show, establishing the characters and the premise quickly and cleanly, before ending on a cliffhanger". Murray, however, did note that it contained a [...] "dialogue that sounds more faux-clever than actually clever" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "an overall flatness to the action/horror sequences" [...] that would continue until the second season. John Levesque, writing for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, called the fledgling series [...] "witty, intelligent and thoroughly entertaining" [...] and dubbed it [...] "the best thing I've seen on The WB". He praised the acting of Sarah Michelle Gellar, noting that she [...] "plays Buffy to perfection". Phil Kloer of The Atlanta Journal and the Atlanta Constitution called the show a [...] "kicky little mix of camp comedy, high school hi-jinks and monsters" [...] and likened its plot to the Fox sci-fi series The X-Files and the Nickelodeon horror-themed anthology series <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Afraid</b> of the Dark?. He ultimately gave the episode a B. Nikki Stafford, in her book Bite Me!, called the first episode [...] "excellent" [...] and complimented the strengths of the main cast as well as the show's unique approach. She contrasted it with the earlier movie, noting that [...] "the movie version [...] was like Clueless, but near the end suddenly tried to be a serious film. The television show carries comedy, action, and drama simultaneously and features a far superior ensemble cast." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Zooropa" [...] {{begins with}} a two-minute-long introduction. As the song fades in, {{sustained}} chords are played, and a noisy collage of mainly indecipherable human voices from radio signals fades in at 0:19. The background voices include a clip of George H. W. Bush saying [...] "Peace talks", and are referenced in the album notes as [...] "courtesy of the advertising world". A quiet piano and bass guitar are heard above the voices, which get louder with each beat. At 1:30, {{the volume of the}} voices rises suddenly and the bass part changes. The introduction then begins to fade out fifteen seconds later, while a guitar riff played with a delay and wah-wah effect joins the mix. The riff is briefly played on its own before the bass guitar and drums join in at 2:03. This is followed by background voices saying, [...] "What do you want?" [...] in both English and French ("Qu'est-ce que tu veux?"), and [...] "De quoi as-tu peur?" [...] ("What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>afraid</b> of?"). In response to the questions, the lyrics in the first three verses of the song consist of various advertising slogans. At 3:45, following the first three verses, a break in the song's instrumentation occurs, except for guitar, and the song returns to a state similar to the introduction's end. A rapid rhythmic synthesiser fades in and at 4:03, the drums and bass re-enter and the song assumes an increased tempo. The theme of moral confusion and uncertainty becomes present in the remaining lyrics.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, {{at the age}} of 12, Gosling {{attended}} an open audition in Montreal for a revival of Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club. He was given a two-year contract as a mouseketeer and moved to Orlando, Florida. He appeared on-screen infrequently because other children were considered more talented. Nonetheless, he has described the job as the greatest two years of his life. Fellow cast members included Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. Gosling has credited the experience with instilling in them [...] "this great sense of focus." [...] He became particularly close friends with Timberlake and they lived together for six months during the second year of the show. Timberlake's mother became Gosling's legal guardian after his mother returned to Canada for work reasons. Gosling has said that, even though he and Timberlake are no longer in touch, they are still supportive of each other. Following the show's cancellation in 1995, Gosling returned to Canada and continued to appear in family entertainment television series including <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Afraid</b> of the Dark? (1995), Goosebumps (1996) and starred in Breaker High (1997–98) as Sean Hanlon. At the age of 18, he moved to New Zealand to film the Fox Kids adventure series Young Hercules (1998–1999) as the title character. In 2002, he told the Vancouver Sun that he initially enjoyed working on the show, but began to care too much about the series, so it was no longer fun for him. He wanted to spend more time sitting with and devising a character as well as play a variety of roles, so he chose to enter film and not accept any more television work.|$|E
