5|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> {{from the}} US Navy tables {{is that the}} {{repetitive}} group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment. The Huggins repetitive group indicates {{a percentage of the}} M0 for the most saturated tissue, and this is intended to make the tables more applicable to multilevel diving procedures.|$|E

The bog turtle is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> {{between it and the}} spotted turtle is that the bog turtle has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|E

5|$|The Soviets did {{not simply}} {{replicate}} the Vickers 6-Ton. However, like its British counterpart, the T-26 mod. 1931 had a twin-turreted configuration and {{was designed to}} carry two machine guns, mounting one in each turret. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> was that the Soviet T-26 mod. 1931 had higher turrets (with an observation slit) than the British 6-Ton. Soviet turrets had a round firing port for the DT tank machine gun, {{as opposed to the}} rectangular ports used by the original British design for the Vickers machine gun. The front part of the hull was also slightly modified.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon {{pointed out}} {{was that in}} the former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to {{integrate}} clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|In early 1174, Henry's enemies {{appeared}} to have tried to lure him back into England, allowing them to attack Normandy in his absence. As part of this plan, William of Scotland attacked the south of England, supported by the northern English rebels; additional Scottish forces were sent into the Midlands, where the rebel barons were making good progress. Henry refused the bait and instead focused on crushing opposition in south-west France, and William's campaign began to falter as the Scots failed to take the key northern royal castles, {{in part due to}} the efforts of Henry's illegitimate son, Geoffrey. In an effort to reinvigorate the plan, Philip, the Count of Flanders, announced his intention to invade England and sent an advance force into East Anglia. The prospective Flemish invasion forced Henry to return to England in early July. Louis and Philip could now push overland into eastern Normandy and reached Rouen. Henry travelled to Becket's tomb in Canterbury, where he announced that the rebellion was a divine punishment on him, and took appropriate penance; this made <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> in restoring his royal authority at a critical moment in the conflict. Word then reached Henry that King William had been defeated and captured by local forces at Alnwick, crushing the rebel cause in the north. The remaining English rebel strongholds collapsed and in August Henry returned to Normandy. Louis had not yet been able to take Rouen, and Henry's forces fell upon the French army just before the final French assault on the city began; pushed back into France, Louis requested peace talks, bringing an end to the conflict.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} a rigorous empirical comparison of structural and reduced-form credit risk frameworks. <b>As</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> {{we focus on}} the discriminative modeling of default time. In contrast to previous literature, we calibrate both approaches to bond and equity prices. By using same input data, applying comparable estimation techniques, and assessing the out-of-sample prediction quality on same time series of CDS prices we are able to judge whether empirically the model structure itself makes an important difference. Interestingly, the models' prediction power is quite close on average. Still, the reduced-form approach outperforms the structural for investment-grade names and longer maturities.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> between Novial and Esperanto/Ido {{concerns}} noun endings.

These endings {{may be taken}} to indicate natural sex according to the custom in Romance languages. Also there is no grammatical gender or requirement for adjectives to agree with nouns.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> {{between the}} RN vessels and the RCN, USN, and other navies' vessels was the {{provision}} of upgraded ASDIC and radar. The RN was a world leader in developing these technologies, and thus RN Flowers were somewhat better-equipped for remote detection of enemy submarines. A {{good example of this}} is the difficulty that RCN Flowers had in intercepting U-boats with their Canadian-designed SW1C metric radar, while the RN vessels were equipped with the technologically advanced Type 271 centimetric sets. In addition, RCN vessels were incapable of operating gyrocompasses, making ASDIC attacks more difficult.|$|E

SWIFT also acts as the registration authority for the SWIFT system, which is used by most countries that have not adopted IBAN. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> between the two systems is that under SWIFT there is no requirement that BBANs used within a country be of a pre-defined length.|$|E
