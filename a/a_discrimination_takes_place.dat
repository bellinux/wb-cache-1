The suggestion is that the problem can be resolved by either introducing greater competition, as for instance in certain Western European nations under the Telecoms Framework 2002 (as proposed for amendment 2007), or closely policing conditions for vertically integrated service, such as VOIP. This assumes that competition in the ?local loop? or ?last mile? to the end-user subscriber provides a choice of platform, and therefore rigorous telecoms competition regulation resolves the issue in Europe.

In the second part we approach the real estate agency from the demand-side, conducting situational tests by visiting vacant houses. Our results suggest that different home seekers are treated differently.

I argue that the treatment of minority that remains in the new states {{is a function of the}} interaction of the dual threat posed by the minority itself domestically on one hand and the international threat coming from the mother state to protect its kin abroad on the other hand. Specifically, I argue that there is a curvilinear relationship between domestic and international threat and the extent of discrimination against the politically relevant minority. Most <b>discrimination</b> <b>takes</b> <b>place</b> when domestic and international threats are moderate because in this case there is a balance of power between the government, the minority, and the rump state.

Territorial concentration of the minority and the ratio of national capabilities between the mother and the seceded states prove to be especially important predictors of minority treatment.
