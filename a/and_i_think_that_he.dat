60|$|The {{young man}} stepped back. My fingers were itching {{to take him}} by the throat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> read the desire in my face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Irma naïvely, [...] "Béla {{promised me}} all that if I gave you to him: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is honest and will keep to his promise." ...|$|E
2500|$|That's all gonna be deconstructed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that's {{why this}} {{regulatory}} thing is so important." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{comes from}} them being easy to wear,” said Glamour Magazine’s Anne Christensen. “I know that {{simplifies}} it, but it’s like shapes {{that are easy}} to wear and colors that are fun to wear… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> what her shows always have is a real sense of optimism <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> what we all need today <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> came through in the bright patterns <b>and</b> colors <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> something that she does so well.” ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good way to deal with it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a good model for other states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states call it civil unions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would {{be the best way to}} deal with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{business}} is with Mr. Paul de Vaux," [...] I said. [...] "Will {{you tell him}} that it is some one from the Hermitage, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will see me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} me. He {{knew that}} I was {{one who would}} act up to my word. I told him that Orley Farm should belong to our babe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said nothing, but he {{had caught}} me once with his keys, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> suspected. I read in his eyes that he suspected. As you know, he never held up his head again." ...|$|E
5000|$|Farrell, {{who is a}} Christian, {{believes}} that marriage is {{between a man and}} a woman but has said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have the right or anybody has a right to tell somebody who they can or can't love. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is a civil rights issue. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the right thing to do is let the voters decide." ...|$|R
2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's <b>I</b> <b>think</b> being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it was such a}} time when you didn't talk about issues <b>that</b> were personal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> made him much more secretive <b>and</b> reclusive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had many}} friends amongst the schoolboys, whom <b>I</b> loved dearly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> my {{disposition}} was then very affectionate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I pray, sir, to Jehovah, the God of the Jews, {{that for}} every grain of these ashes He may take a life in payment for that of my murdered husband, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> will listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, it is {{the home}} of Death, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> travels to us thence. And not only I, not only I; half the folk in Venice think the same, though why, they cannot tell. Listen." ...|$|E
60|$|Here the Zulu's {{voice broke}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wept, {{for in the}} faint light I saw him draw his long hand across his eyes, whereon I took the {{opportunity}} to turn my back and light a pipe.|$|E
6000|$|... "I call it human <b>and</b> reasonable; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is {{compatible}} with duty and affection. Have you consulted her wishes?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> heard <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> another heard also, {{at least}} once more the stony smile shone {{in the eyes of}} the Shaman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I know he {{was very}} sick about his brother looking too closely into his concerns. He has a little affair on just now {{that he wants to}} keep to himself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that is the reason he went off so quietly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I see, Umbezi, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will do it. But what I {{do not see}} is how I am {{to prevent}} him. Remember that you let Mameena grow into his heart and behaved badly to him, Umbezi." ...|$|E
60|$|David did {{not move}} from his post near the three burglars, but he turned toward Alice and looked at her. We {{knew that he had}} tender {{feelings}} toward the girl, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not approve of her being there.|$|E
6000|$|... "She blamed me, of course," [...] he said slowly, [...] "because I {{had never}} told her. It was his own desire, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was right. I have telegraphed {{for him to come}} over. He will be here to-night or to-morrow." ...|$|E
50|$|Problem solution: My girlfriend {{wants to}} make up with me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> better {{for both of us}} (thinking about the other's {{intended}} actions).|$|R

6000|$|... "An iron will is an {{integral}} part of such a temperament. How else could he be a leader? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you are mistaken in--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} now, with Monsieur Kennedy, to the palace, Anne," [...] he said, as she entered. [...] "I do not suppose {{that we shall}} be absent very long. I have been talking matters over with him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> agrees with my view of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks like}} it, Rajah," [...] Harry admitted, [...] "but I should hardly fancy that Lord Lake will {{take such a}} step. He has tried to take the town by a sudden assault, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will not retreat until he has {{attempted}} {{to do so by}} a regular siege operation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I think so, Roger. I was to {{ascertain}} the earl's real intentions regarding certain matters, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> means honestly to adhere to an offer he made. The very fear that he has shown, lest his intentions should be betrayed, seems {{to prove that he}} is most anxious that naught should occur to interfere with his plans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{it may be}} <b>that</b> you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{upon the}} whole they may be worn with advantage. What does the country say to that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{answered}} her husband, [...] "you have often {{told me that}} you were sure no harm would come to Rachel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{that big}} guy--that big {{man with the}} rimless {{spectacles}} looks like {{he might be a}} good civil engineer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> lady opposite him--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can explain}} that, madam," [...] said the tall burglar, quickly. [...] "This man by his {{criminal}} course of life has got {{himself into a}} good many scrapes, and is frequently obliged to change his name. Since I accidentally became acquainted with him he has had several aliases, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> very often forgets that his real name is James Barlow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so sorry," [...] he said softly, [...] "that {{you should}} have been disturbed, Mr. Hamel. We have been a little anxious about our mysterious guest. Doctor Sarson fetched me an hour ago. He {{discovered}} that it was necessary to perform a very slight operation, merely the extraction of a splinter of wood. It is all over now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will do very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And papa {{has told}} me. I still see papa almost every day. You must call upon him. Mind you do." [...] Phineas {{said that he}} {{certainly}} would. [...] "Papa is very lonely now, and I sometimes feel that I have been almost cruel in deserting him. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has a horror of the house,--especially later in the year,--always fancying that he will meet Oswald. I am so unhappy about it all, Mr. Finn." ...|$|E
