6000|$|He went on trying. In {{those first}} days she {{sometimes}} asked him, [...] "Did {{you do it}} out of love, or was it pity only?" [...] And he always said it was love. He said it adoringly.

60|$|At {{this point}} {{the young man was}} interrupted, in a very uncivil manner, by the stranger, who desired to hear nothing about the scandal, but who had another {{question}} to <b>ask.</b> <b>This</b> <b>question</b> seemed rather a difficult one to put; for he began it two or three times, in two or three different forms of words, and failed to get on with it. At last, he ended by asking, generally, whether any other members of old Mr. Grice's family were still alive.|$|E
60|$|I <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> now, but I {{could not}} ask it then. I could say nothing whatever; not {{possessing}} a phrase of speaking French: {{and it was}} French, and French only, the whole world seemed now gabbling around me. What should I do? Approaching the conductor, I just laid my hand on his arm, pointed to a trunk, thence to the diligence-roof, and tried to express a question with my eyes. He misunderstood me, seized the trunk indicated, {{and was about to}} hoist it on the vehicle.|$|E
6000|$|He had {{an awful}} longing {{to find out}} from Corey how he ought to go. He {{formulated}} and repeated over to himself an apparently careless question, such as, [...] "Oh, by the way, Corey, {{where do you get}} your gloves?" [...] This would naturally lead to some talk on the subject, which would, if properly managed, clear up the whole trouble. But Lapham found that he would rather die than <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> or any question that would bring up the dinner again. Corey did not recur to it, and Lapham avoided the matter with positive fierceness. He shunned talking with Corey at all, and suffered in grim silence.|$|E

"But {{a report}} has reached {{us, and we}} may say more than a report, which makes it our duty to <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> Were those {{expenses}} paid out of the private pocket of the present Prime Minister? If so, we maintain that we have discovered a blot in that nobleman's character which it is our duty to the public to expose. We will go farther and say that if it be so,--if these expenses were paid out of the private pocket of the Duke of Omnium, it is not fit that that nobleman should any longer hold the high office which he now fills.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{finished}} my Ballad, it is 340 lines; I am {{going on with}} my [...] "Visions": altogether (for I shall print two scenes of my Tragedy, as fragments) I can add 1500 lines; {{now what do you}} advise?

6000|$|One more illustration. Is the Englishman {{prepared}} {{to admit that}} the American is his superior as a human being? I <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> because the scarcity of labor in America relatively to the demand for it has led to a development of machinery there, and a consequent [...] "increase of command over Nature" [...] which makes many of our English methods appear almost medieval to the up-to-date Chicagoan. This means that the American has an advantage over the Englishman of exactly the same nature that the Englishman has over the contemporaries of Cicero. Is the Englishman {{prepared to}} draw the same conclusion in both cases? I think not. The American, of course, will draw it cheerfully; but I must then ask him whether, since a modern negro has a greater [...] "command over Nature" [...] than Washington had, we are also to accept the conclusion, involved in his former one, that humanity has progressed from Washington to the fin de siecle negro.|$|E
