25|$|The Undertaker {{then began}} a storyline where he teamed with Big Show in a tag team known as The Unholy Alliance, which held the WWF World Tag Team Championship twice. After their victory at SummerSlam, The Undertaker {{suffered}} a groin tear and was seen limping in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches {{in the following}} weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, {{it would have been}} as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation. To compensate for his lack of physical action, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making smart-aleck remarks and providing commentary. In September 1999, on SmackDown!, Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the Unforgiven main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against Triple H. Undertaker retorted that he did not care <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would not be participating in anything, thus walking out of the WWF. In reality, Calaway went on a hiatus from the WWF in order to treat his groin injury. On December 14 he made his return to action, teaming with Viscera in a losing effort against Kane and The Godfather at a house show in Caomo, Puetro Rico. The Undertaker was advertised on the Armageddon promotional poster to return, but meanwhile also tore his pectoral muscle, making him take almost eight months out of action.|$|E
500|$|Connor again {{returns for}} Angel:After the Fall. Brian Lynch was {{initially}} confused {{about how to}} incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, [...] "Connor's a young kid, he's got powers, he doesn't {{have any of the}} bad things, he's not a vampire, so maybe he would enjoy it, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would be {{the closest thing to a}} superhero hell has". Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown [...] "fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero" [...] for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor's story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel went on to become a much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor's upcoming role in Angel & Faith, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser 's recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor's appearance with [...] "otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Le diplôme": David Gervais {{says that}} he doesn't only think about [...] "the diploma", {{he wants to know}} what you know how to do, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> can arrange a little something, if you..., but, embarrassed about what he appears to say, adds it's not in that sense... not sexual. (September 13, 2006) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look sharp, now; {{the current}} sets in the closest here, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> washed ashore <b>and</b> got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge. I hope so, anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{just like}} this, Nappy. Of course, they haven't {{admitted}} it, {{but you know}} {{just as well as}} I do that Colonel Colby must have punished them pretty severely for the trick they played on Lemm. What he did to them, we don't know, but probably he has given 'em some extra lessons to do, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> punished 'em in other ways." ...|$|R

2500|$|All that {{is known}} about him comes from the {{writings}} of a later student at the cathedral known as Anonymous IV, an Englishman who left a treatise on theory and who mentions Léonin as the composer of the Magnus Liber, the [...] "great book" [...] of organum. [...] Much of the Magnus Liber is devoted to clausulaemelismatic portions of Gregorian chant which were extracted into separate pieces where the original note values of the chant were greatly slowed down and [...] a fast-moving upper part is superimposed. [...] Léonin {{might have been the}} first composer to use the rhythmic modes, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> invented a notation for them. According to W.G. Waite, writing in 1954: [...] "It was Léonin's incomparable achievement to introduce a rational system of rhythm into polyphonic music for the first time, and, equally important, to create a method of notation expressive of this rhythm." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Humph, maybe he's sorry <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> isn't," [...] muttered Stanley. [...] "I {{guess he}} ought to have a thrashing. Anyway, I am done with him," [...] and he flung back the coat Tom had offered him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I'll do. Your remarks, ma'am, has some weight in them. The dog's worked hard, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> earned a soft berth an' has got a right to choose. Anyway, we'll {{leave it up to}} him. Whatever he says, goes. You people stay right here settin' down. I'll say good-by and walk off casual-like. If he wants to stay, he can stay. If he wants to come with me, let 'm come. I won't call 'm to come an' don't you call 'm to come back." ...|$|R
50|$|Rodulf was a Roman Catholic {{bishop and}} Norman kinsman of Edward the Confessor. After {{working as a}} missionary for Olaf II of Norway in Norway <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> Iceland, <b>he</b> was {{appointed}} by Edward as an Abbot of Abingdon in 1051, but died in 1052 (Kelly 2000).|$|R
5000|$|The Competition's demise, when Madden retired, {{was greatly}} lamented among its fans. In August 2000, the {{magazine}} published {{a letter from}} an Irish contestant, John O'Byrne, who wrote: [...] "How I'll miss the fractured definitions, awful puns, conversation stoppers, one-letter misprints, ludicrous proverbs, openings of bad novels, near misses, et al. (what a nice guy Al is!)." [...] Many entrants have since migrated to The Washington Posts similar [...] "Style Invitational" [...] feature. Three volumes of Competition winners were published, titled Thank You for the Giant Sea Tortoise, Son of Giant Sea Tortoise, <b>and</b> <b>Maybe</b> <b>He's</b> Dead: <b>And</b> Other Hilarious Results of New York Magazine Competitions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nix on {{the rough}} stuff, Mamie," [...] pleaded the embarrassed pugilist. [...] "How was I {{to know what}} kids feed on? <b>And</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would have passed up the lobster at that and stuck to the sardines." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s a hard matter, lad, to know men’s ways, I find, {{since the}} {{settlers}} {{have brought in}} their new fashions, But is there nothing to be found out in the place? <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> is troubled with his longings after other people’s business, as he often is” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will send}} word {{up to the}} governor," [...] the officer said.

It will be a good hour before the answer comes." ...|$|E
50|$|Belus {{was the son}} of Poseidon <b>and</b> Libya. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> is also Busiris, son of Libya, {{ruler of}} Egypt, killed by Heracles, {{although}} Heracles was born many generations after Belus since he was a grandchild of Perseus; see Argive genealogy below. According to Pausanias, Belus founded a temple of Heracles in Babylon.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's naught, gentlemen," [...] said Scott, {{leaning forward}} on the railing,--"there's naught as that man hez said as isn't true. I was run outer Cairo; I did belong to the Regulators; I did desert from the army; I did leave a wife in Kansas. But thar's one thing he didn't charge me with, <b>and,</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>he's</b> forgotten. For three years, gentlemen, I was that man's pardner!--" [...] Whether he {{intended}} to say more, I cannot tell; a burst of applause artistically rounded and enforced the climax, and virtually elected the speaker. That fall he went to Sacramento, York went abroad; {{and for the first}} time in many years, distance and a new atmosphere isolated the old antagonists.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>he’s</b> more opinionated than {{he used to}} be, but {{in terms}} of Polish {{politics}} I don’t think he changed much.

6000|$|In his cell, James Turner laid {{himself on}} his cot, ruminating. [...] "Maybe he's got the money, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> ain't. But if he has or he ain't, {{what does he want}} to go 'round butting into other folks's {{business}} for? When a man knows what he wants, and can get it, it's the same as $40,000,000 to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Dale. [...] "I rather {{think the}} captain is sore over the reply {{he got from}} the head of that school, over the carryall affair, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> won't let us play them." [...] And in this Dale was correct. Pornell was cut out that season, but it played Putnam Hall the year following.|$|E
5000|$|After the loss, Curry went to Valley Hospital in Las Vegas {{and learned}} that he had fought Linton with acute pancreatitis. [...] "That {{condition}} pre-existed the fight," [...] said Phil Hamilton, Curry's manager.

5000|$|Sometimes in boxing, a guy trains on {{hot dogs}} and beer, <b>and</b> then <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> injures his shoulder. A guy {{everybody}} expects to win, doesnt win.

6000|$|... "I {{should be}} sorry {{if it were}} so," [...] said honest Meg Dods, whose {{hereditary}} respect for the family always kept her from joining in any scandal affecting {{the character of the}} young Laird--"My forbears, sir, have had kindness frae his; <b>and</b> although <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> may have forgotten all about it, it wad ill become me to say ony thing of him that should not be said of his father's son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] {{says the}} seaman, [...] "you {{may very well}} tell to a dry-lander, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> will believe you; but you cannot so easily pull the wool over the eyes of Captain Benny Willitts. And what, if I may be so bold as for to ask you, {{was the reason for}} their attacking so {{harmless}} a man as you proclaim yourself to be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me see," [...] Tom said thoughtfully. [...] "You know {{my cousin}} Arthur went away {{last year to}} a broker's office there; of course he knows lots of clerks in other offices.

6000|$|... "All {{who heard}} him agreed {{that he was}} a good man," [...] Joab assented. [...] "I have never known one of those who heard him say otherwise, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was a prophet. Certainly, he called upon the people to repent and turn from their sins and, had they done as he taught them, these evils might not have fallen upon us, and God would doubtless have been ready to aid his people, as of old.|$|E
5000|$|The title song [...] "The Voyage" [...] {{was one of}} {{the last}} songs of the {{collection}} to come to him. After exposing the raw nerves of the marriage struggle in many of the other lyrics - <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>he</b> was open enough to give full expression to these familial difficulties - he felt empowered to write and sing of the more positive side of the marriage adventure with deep conviction and sincerity.|$|R
50|$|While {{walking to}} his car, a fan asks for his autograph; as Barry signs it, the fan {{pulls out a}} gun and shoots him several times, killing him. As the film ends, callers to Barry's show, then his {{co-workers}} and Ellen, speak on air about him. They say that Barry was a talented, smart and funny man, but that he loved to push people's buttons <b>and</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> finally pushed someone a little too far.|$|R
6000|$|... "He and {{his partner}} are mighty {{independent}} chaps," [...] grumbled the pretended doctor, as he gazed after Matt, with a scowl on his face.

6000|$|... "This is {{certainly}} worthy of an investigation," [...] he said, {{after they had}} finished.

6000|$|... "She's a {{beautiful}} woman--a very beautiful woman," [...] said MacDonald thoughtfully, after {{the door had}} closed behind her. [...] "This man Barker has certainly been down here a good deal. He {{is a man who}} might be attractive to a woman.

The man who tears a wedding ring off a dead man's--What do you say to it, Mr. Holmes?" ...|$|E
60|$|When he {{got away}} and looked back, all the boys had their clothes off and were dancing round the fire like Indians, {{and he would have}} liked to turn back after he got to the top, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> might have done so if he had not found Jim Leonard hiding in a hole up there and peeping over at the boys. Jim was crying, and said his tooth ached awfully, and he was afraid to go home and get {{something}} to put in it, because his mother would whale him as soon as she caught him.|$|E
50|$|The sole {{remaining}} McLaren of Lewis Hamilton {{posted the}} fastest time with over five minutes remaining. Not much happened {{for the entire}} session as only 'banker' laps were set as a benchmark for the final two frantic minutes of action. Vettel went out on track for another lap with under two minutes left, but later decided to pit without a lap time as he thought of saving tyres for the race <b>and</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> {{did not have the}} pace of the top five cars.|$|R
5000|$|Chris Nibley {{returns home}} just wishing {{to be normal}} — {{to start a family}} and have a lot of kids. However, he finds himself {{depressed}} and soon realizes that he does not fit into this concept of [...] "normal". As a result, he is left feeling isolated and without direction. Attempts to find happiness leaves him hopeless of ever finding his sense of purpose in America again. Nibley decides to volunteer for a second tour in Iraq, knowing, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> hoping, <b>he</b> will die.|$|R
500|$|Anarky's {{introduction}} {{during the}} late 1980s {{was part of a}} larger shift among supervillains in the Batman franchise of the time. While many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned, and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership, some were introduced to challenge readers to [...] "question the whole bad/good guy divide." [...] Falling into [...] "the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast. In a review of the Anarky miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an [...] "anti-villain", as opposed to [...] "antihero", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: [...] "In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the Punisher, an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but what he really wants is to save the world... <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> right." ...|$|R
