5|$|Obesity {{is mostly}} {{preventable}} {{through a combination}} of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.|$|E

The seven items of the Game Addiction Scale were used to construct a latent variable representing video gaming disorder. Level of sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> was also self-reported.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims {{to measure}} the {{associations}} of physical activity {{and one of its}} components, sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise,</b> with at-risk substance use in a population of young men. METHOD: Baseline (2010 - 2012) and follow-up (2012 - 2013) data of 4748 young Swiss men from the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF) were used. Cross-sectional and prospective associations between at-risk substance use and both sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> physical activities were measured using Chi-squared tests and logistic regression models adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: At baseline, logistic regression indicated that sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> is negatively associated with at-risk use of cigarettes and cannabis. A positive association was obtained between physical activity and at-risk alcohol use. At baseline, sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> was negatively associated with at-risk use of cigarettes and cannabis at follow-up. Adjusted for sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise,</b> physical activity was positively associated with at-risk use of cigarettes and cannabis. CONCLUSION: Sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> is cross-sectionally <b>and</b> longitudinally associated with a low prevalence of at-risk use of cigarettes and cannabis. This protective effect was not observed for physical activity broadly defined.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of hypoxic living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training on obesity and adipose tissue leptin/leptin receptor in dietary-induced obese rats. Methods: One hundred and thirty high-fat diet fed Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into one of the following groups (n= 10 each) : control, sedentary hypoxic living for 1 to 4 weeks (SH 1, SH 2, SH 3, and SH 4), living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in normoxic conditions for 1 to 4 weeks (TN 1, TN 2, TN 3, and TN 4), <b>and</b> living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in hypoxic conditions for 1 to 4 weeks (TN 1, TN 2, TN 3, and TN 4). Epididymal adipose tissue expression levels of leptin and leptin receptor were determined. Results: Compared to hypoxic living <b>and</b> living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in normoxic conditions, living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in hypoxic conditions for 3 - 4 weeks resulted in lower Lee index (P< 0. 05 to P< 0. 01), and higher expression of leptin and leptin receptor (P< 0. 05 to P< 0. 01) in adipose tissue. Conclusion: In a rodent model of altitude training, living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in hypoxic conditions resulted in greater alterations in obesity and adipose tissue leptin/leptin receptor than hypoxic living alone <b>and</b> living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in normoxic conditions...|$|R
