60|$|So soon as {{the seizure}} of the {{existing}} supplies of atomic ammunition and the apparatus for synthesising Carolinum was assured, the disbanding or social utilisation of the various masses of troops still under arms had to be arranged, the salvation of the year's harvests, and the feeding, housing, and employment of the drifting millions of homeless people. In Canada, in South America, and Asiatic Russia there were vast accumulations of provision that was immovable {{only because of the}} breakdown of the monetary and credit systems. These had to be brought into the famine districts very speedily if entire depopulation was to be avoided, and their transportation and the revival of communications generally absorbed a certain proportion of the soldiery and more able unemployed. The task of housing assumed gigantic dimensions, and from building camps the housing committee of the council speedily passed to constructions of a more permanent type. They found far less friction than might have been expected in turning the loose population on their hands to these things. People were extraordinarily tamed by that year of suffering and death; they were disillusioned of their traditions, bereft of once obstinate prejudices; they felt foreign in a strange world, and ready to follow any confident leadership. The orders of the new government came with the best of all credentials, rations. The people everywhere were as easy to control, one of the old labour experts who had survived until the new time witnesses, 'as gangs of emigrant workers in a new land.' And now it was that the social possibilities of the atomic energy began to appear. The new machinery that had come into existence before the last wars increased and multiplied, and the council found itself not only with millions of hands at its disposal but with power and apparatus that made its first conceptions of the work it had to do seem pitifully timid. The camps that were planned in iron and deal were built in stone and brass; the roads that were to have been mere iron tracks became spacious ways that insisted upon architecture; the cultivations of foodstuffs that were to have supplied emergency rations, were presently, with synthesisers, fertilisers, <b>actinic</b> <b>light,</b> and scientific direction, in excess of every human need.|$|E

2500|$|In a saltwater/reef aquarium, color {{temperature}} {{is an essential}} part of tank health.

Because coral typically live in shallow water and receive intense, direct tropical sunlight, the focus was once on simulating this situation with 6500K lights. In the meantime higher temperature light sources have become more popular, first with 10000K and more recently 16000K and 20000K.

50|$|Typically, {{integrated}} chlorophyll fluorometers {{consist of}} a leaf chamber in which the sample to be measured is sealed.

This chamber is part of an gas exchange system, typically used to measure photosynthesis and transpiration of leaves. It is also common to have a programmable <b>actinic</b> <b>light</b> source to allow various types of research including the use of A/Q curves or photosynthetic rate at different <b>actinic</b> <b>light</b> levels. This highly specialized light unit is held above the clear window of the chamber.

In both chloroplast types, fluorescence induction (O to P) was similar under actinic {{blue and green}} light. In slow transients from mesophyll cell chloroplasts, blue and green light induced identical, typical rapid quenching from P to S, and the M peak. In contrast, the P to S transient from guard cell (GC) chloroplasts irradiated with blue light showed a much slower quenching rate, and the P to T transition showed no M peak. <b>Actinic</b> green <b>light</b> induced mesophyll-like transients in GC chloroplasts, including rapid quenching from P to S and the M peak. Detection of these transients in single pairs of GC and isolated protoplasts ruled out mesophyll contamination as a signal source.

The effect of CO 2 concentration on the fluorescence transients was investigated {{in the presence of}} HCO 3 − at pH 6. 8 and 10. 0.

Steady-state maximal fluorescence yield (Fm′, measured during a saturating light pulse) declined with increasing irradiance at all O 2 levels. In contrast, the steady-state minimal fluorescence yield (Fo′, measured during a brief dark interval) increased with irradiance relative to that recorded for the fully dark-adapted leaf (Fo) or that observed after 5 minutes of darkness (Fo*). The relative magnitude of this increase was somewhat greater and extended to higher irradiances at the elevated O 2 levels compared with 1. 6 % O 2. Suppression of Fo′ was only observed consistently at saturating irradiance. The results are interpreted {{in terms of the}} occurrence of photosystem II units possessing exceedingly slow turnover times (i. e. “inactive” units).

Yet the reason some diurnal insects visit is entirely unknown.|$|E
40|$|International audienceLight-response curves (LCs) of {{chlorophyll}} fluorescence {{are widely used}} in plant physiology. Most commonly, LCs are generated sequentially, exposing the same sample to a sequence of distinct <b>actinic</b> <b>light</b> intensities. These measurements are not independent, as the response to each new light level {{is affected by the}} light exposure history experienced during previous steps of the LC, an issue particularly relevant {{in the case of the}} popular rapid light curves. In this work, we demonstrate the proof of concept of a new method for the rapid generation of LCs from nonsequential, temporally independent fluorescence measurements. The method is based on the combined use of sample illumination with digitally controlled, spatially separated beams of <b>actinic</b> <b>light</b> and a fluorescence imaging system. It allows the generation of a whole LC, including a large number of <b>actinic</b> <b>light</b> steps and adequate replication, within the time required for a single measurement (and therefore named “single-pulse light curve”). This method is illustrated for the generation of LCs of photosystem II quantum yield, relative electron transport rate, and nonphotochemical quenching on intact plant leaves exhibiting distinct light responses. This approach makes it also possible to easily characterize the integrated dynamic light response of a sample by combining the measurement of LCs (<b>actinic</b> <b>light</b> intensity is varied while measuring time is fixed) with induction/relaxation kinetics (<b>actinic</b> <b>light</b> intensity is fixed and the response is followed over time), describing both how the response to light varies with time and how the response kinetics varies with light intensity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPhycobilisomes (PBS) are {{the major}} {{photosynthetic}} antenna complexes in cyanobacteria and red algae. In the red microalga Galdieria sulphuraria, action spectra measured separately for photosynthetic activities of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) demonstrate that PBS fraction attributed to PSI is more sensitive to stress conditions and upon nitrogen starvation disappears from the cell earlier than the fraction of PBS coupled to PSII. Preillumination of the cells by <b>actinic</b> far-red <b>light</b> primarily absorbed by PSI caused {{an increase in the}} amplitude of the PBS low-temperature fluorescence emission that was accompanied by the decrease in PBS region of the PSI 77 K fluorescence excitation spectrum. Under the same conditions, fluorescence excitation spectrum of PSII remained unchanged. The amplitude of P 700 photooxidation in PBS-absorbed light at physiological temperature was found to match the fluorescence changes observed at 77 K. The far-red light adaptations were reversible within 2 – 5 min. It is suggested that the short-term fluorescence alterations observed in far-red light are triggered by the redox state of P 700 and correspond to the temporal detachment of the PBS antenna from the core complexes of PSI. Furthermore, the absence of any change in the 77 K fluorescence excitation cross-section of PSII suggests that light energy transfer from PBS to PSI in G. sulphuraria is direct and does not occur through PSII. Finally, a novel photoprotective role of PBS in red algae is discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{have found}} that the sign of phototaxis, i. e. the {{direction}} of phototactic migration either towards or away from the light source, of wild-type Chlamydomonas reinhardtii depends on its photosynthetic activity. This accounts for the frequently reported transient positive phototaxis that precedes a negative phototaxis of wild-type cells, as well as the earlier observations that preillumination affects the sign of phototaxis. The bases for our conclusion are as follows. (1) The transient nature of phototaxis was preferentially observable with blue-green <b>actinic</b> <b>light</b> rather than with green <b>actinic</b> <b>light.</b> (2) Red background light induces negative phototaxis under the actinic-light conditions in which, without background light, Chlamydomonas cells show exclusively positive phototaxis.

40|$|The light-driven proton pump {{bacteriorhodopsin}} (BR) from Halobacterium salinarum is tightly {{regulated by}} the [H +] gradient and transmembrane potential. BR exhibits optoelectric properties, since spectral changes during the photocycle are kinetically controlled by voltage, which predestines BR for optical storage or processing devices. BR mutants with prolonged lifetime of the blue-shifted M intermediate would be advantageous, but the optoelectric properties of such mutants are still elusive. Using expression in Xenopus oocytes and two-electrode voltage-clamping, we analyzed photocurrents of BR mutants with kinetically destabilized (F 171 C, F 219 L) or stabilized (D 96 N, D 96 G) M intermediate in response to green light (to probe H + pumping) and blue laser flashes (to probe accumulation/decay of M). These mutants have divergent M lifetimes. As for BR-WT, this strictly correlates with the voltage dependence of H + pumping. BR-F 171 C and BR-F 219 L showed photocurrents similar to BR-WT. Yet, BR-F 171 C showed a weaker voltage dependence of proton pumping. For both mutants, blue laser flashes applied during and after green-light illumination showed reduced M accumulation and shorter M lifetime. In contrast, BR-D 96 G and BR-D 96 N exhibited small photocurrents, with nonlinear current-voltage curves, which increased strongly {{in the presence of}} azide. Blue laser flashes showed heavy M accumulation and prolonged M lifetime, which accounts for the strongly reduced H + pumping rate. Hyperpolarizing potentials augmented these effects. The combination of M-stabilizing and -destabilizing mutations in BR-D 96 G/F 171 C/F 219 L (BR-tri) shows that disruption of the primary proton donor Asp- 96 is fatal for BR as a proton pump. Mechanistically, M destabilizing mutations cannot compensate for the disruption of Asp- 96. Accordingly, BR-tri and BR-D 96 G photocurrents were similar. However, BR-tri showed negative blue laser flash-induced currents even without <b>actinic</b> green <b>light,</b> indicating that Schiff base deprotonation in BR-tri exists in the dark, in line with previous spectroscopic investigations. Thus, M-stabilizing mutations, including the triple mutation, drastically interfere with electrochemical H + gradient generation...|$|R
