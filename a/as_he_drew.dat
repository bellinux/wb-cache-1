In the animated adaptations of the manga, Sasuke has been voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in English.|$|E

Courtright's inability to fire off a shot was due {{to a number of}} possible reasons; one was that his pistol got caught on his watch chain for a second <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> it, and another was that his pistol broke when one of Short's bullets struck it and his thumb.|$|E

Since Jarrett's team was a brand new team and had no owner points, and due to a rule change, he was eligible to use the Past Champion's Provisional five times as his 1999 championship was the most recent among past champions who were driving for teams not in the top 35 in owner points; prior to the rule change {{the use of a}} Past Champion's Provisional was not limited.|$|E

Eventually, even Castle Urquhart fell. Little of Moray's spectacularly successful campaign is recorded. Indeed, some of his deeds were apparently co-opted by 'Blind Hary' and attributed to William Wallace. One such event was Wallace's attack on the port of Aberdeen, in which, according to Hary, he burned English ships moored in the harbour. There is no evidence that Wallace actually ever attacked Aberdeen and it has been recognised that this deed is {{more likely to have been}} the work of Andrew Moray.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{situation}} with Muhammad had been resolved, 'Ali took no action for a while. Eventually he decided to attack the stronghold of Mattuth and marched against it. When he arrived, however, he saw that it had strong fortifications and numerous defenders, {{so he decided to}} make further preparations before assaulting it. He withdrew and began assembling ladders and tools for scaling walls; once this was completed, he ordered his army to again approach the city. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> near Mattuth this time, however, he was suddenly attacked by Masrur al-Balkhi, who had learned of 'Ali's plans. The sight of Masrur's cavalry caused 'Ali's men to abandon their equipment and flee, and 'Ali was forced to retreat.|$|E
25|$|In October 1649, he {{published}} Eikonoklastes, an explicit defence of the regicide, {{in response to}} the Eikon Basilike, a phenomenal best-seller popularly attributed to Charles I that portrayed the King as an innocent Christian martyr. Milton tried to break this powerful image of Charles I (the literal translation of Eikonoklastes is 'the image breaker'). A month later, however, the exiled Charles II and his party published the defence of monarchy Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo, written by leading humanist Claudius Salmasius. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the Council of State. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic's desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{opened with}} several battles in May and June 1864 as Sherman pressed Johnston southeast through mountainous terrain. Sherman avoided frontal assaults against most of Johnston's positions, instead maneuvering in flanking marches around the Confederate defenses. When Sherman flanked the defensive lines (almost exclusively around Johnston's left flank), Johnston would retreat to another prepared position. The Battle of Kennesaw Mountain (June 27) was a notable exception, in which Sherman attempted a frontal assault, against {{the advice of}} his subordinates, and suffered significant losses, losing 7,000 men versus 700 for Johnston. Both armies took advantage of the railroads as supply lines, with Johnston shortening his supply lines <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> closer to Atlanta, and Sherman lengthening his own. However, Davis was becoming frustrated with Johnston, who he viewed was needlessly losing territory and was refusing to counterattack or even discuss his plans with Davis.|$|E

Ocon could not resist a {{challenge}} from Sainz and lost tenth while the struggling Jaafar was overtaken by Korjus on the next lap. Mason was black-flagged as he opted to continue racing and not take his penalty. Rosenqvist concentrated on not allowing Marciello get close to him while Félix da Costa and Derani was waiting to capitalise on any mistakes. Sainz gained a further place by overtaking Coletti for ninth. Giovinazzi battled Gelael for seventeenth with ended in Giovinazzi's favour. Giovanazzi then gained a further place by getting ahead of Wolf for sixteenth. Coletti lost ninth to Ocon in the closing stages of the race while Korjus pulled {{to the side of the}} track at Fisherman's Bend with smoke bellowing from his engine. Lynn opened up a two-second advantage over the rest of the field and maintained the lead to win the qualification race and pole position for the main race. He was joined on the front row by Rosenqvist while Marciello completed the podium in spite of being caught by the former as Rosenqvist felt a loss in tyre grip. Behind the two, Félix da Costa followed with Derani in fifth. Sims, King and Bulller were in close formation for positions six to eight and Sainz and Ocon completed the top ten. Coletti, Jaafar, Latifil, Sekiguchi, Giovnazzi, Wolf, Gelael, Nakayama, Chiyo, Bryant-Meisner, Sun, Mason and Korjus rounded out the classified finishers.|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants {{was created}} and {{designed}} by cartoonist and marine biologist Stephen Hillenburg, who began developing the show {{shortly after the}} cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life in 1996.

Hillenburg compared the character's personality to Laurel and Hardy and Pee-wee Herman. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> the character, he decided that a [...] "squeaky-clean square" [...] like a kitchen sponge fit the concept. The character's name is derived from [...] "Bob the Sponge", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip The Intertidal Zone that he originally drew in the 1980s while teaching marine biology to visitors of the Ocean Institute.

Reminiscing about his work on the show, Snow said that much of the music had not changed during the series and agreed with Larson that it was [...] "more [...] maintaining the heroic concept and the mythology than progressing through specific changes". Louis Febre, who worked closely with Snow from the beginning, became the sole composer for Smallville in season seven. Febre said that since he began composing for Smallville there was a shift to [...] "thematic development" [...] in the score, paralleling the characters' growth: [...] "As Clark grew emotionally and intellectually more complex, I found a need to comment musically on his growth, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> closer to his Superman persona, it became obvious that a 'Superman' theme would be required." ...|$|E

Buddy dressed {{and headed toward the}} house. He took a shortcut off Texas highways 77 and 83 to reach the house, and recalled going over [...] at some point, and brushing off a few cars along the way by gesturing with his left hand. Once he reached Rancho Viejo, he ignored the entrance and drove instead through a field of palm trees. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> closer to Fischer's house, he heard police sirens at a distance.

Kathy then phoned one of Fischer's closest friends before school started and asked him if he knew if Fischer had any enemies.

The race was in wet conditions and Räikkönen stayed third at the first corner behind Hamilton and Kovalainen. He kept pace and got up to second when Kovalainen spun. He then chased after Hamilton, and set the fastest lap <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> up directly behind the McLaren. During the first pitstop, Ferrari did not change the intermediates on his car {{in the hope that the}} track would become dry.

2500|$|His autobiography, I Had a Hammer was {{published}} in 1990. The book's title is a play on his nickname, [...] "The Hammer" [...] or [...] "Hammerin' Hank", and {{the title of the}} folk song [...] "If I Had a Hammer". Aaron now owns Hank Aaron BMW of south Atlanta in Union City, Georgia, where he gives an autographed baseball with every car sold. Aaron also owns Mini, Land Rover, Toyota, Hyundai and Honda dealerships throughout Georgia, as part of the Hank Aaron Automotive Group. Aaron sold all but the Toyota dealership in McDonough in 2007. Additionally, Aaron owns a chain of 30 restaurants around the country. During the 2006 season, San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds passed Babe Ruth and moved into second place on the all-time home run list, attracting growing media coverage <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> closer to Aaron's record. Playing off the intense interest in their perceived rivalry, Aaron and Bonds made a television commercial that aired during Super Bowl XLI, shortly {{before the start of the}} 2007 baseball season, in which Aaron jokingly tried to persuade Bonds to retire before breaking the record. As Bonds began to close in on the record during the 2007 season, Aaron let it be known that, although he recognized Bonds' achievements, he would not be present when Bonds broke the record. [...] There was considerable speculation that this was a snubbing of Bonds based on the widespread belief that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs and steroids to aid his achievement. However, some observers looked back on Aaron's personal history, pointing out that he had downplayed his own breaking of Babe Ruth's all-time record and suggesting that Aaron was simply treating Bonds in a similar fashion. In a later interview with Atlanta sportscasting personality Chris Dimino, Aaron made it clear that his reluctance to attend any celebration of a new home run record was based upon his personal conviction that baseball is not about breaking records, but simply playing to the best of one's potential. After Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run on August 7, 2007, Aaron made a surprise appearance on the JumboTron video screen at AT Park in San Francisco to congratulate Bonds on his accomplishment:Aaron lives in the Atlanta area. In July 2013, media reported that his home was burglarized. Jewelry and two BMW vehicles were stolen. The cars were later recovered.|$|E
