50|$|An <b>anaphrodisiac</b> (also antaphrodisiac or antiaphrodisiac) is a {{substance}} that quells or blunts the libido. It {{is the opposite of}} an aphrodisiac, something that enhances sexual appetite. The word <b>anaphrodisiac</b> comes from the Greek privative prefix , denoting negation, and aphrodisiac, from the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite. Some people use anaphrodisiacs due to having a libido that is very high or due to hypersexuality. However anaphrodisiacs are also used by those with an average sex drive, at times due to having incessant schedules.|$|E

5000|$|The {{name comes}} from the Greek ἀφροδισιακόν, aphrodisiakon, i.e. [...] "sexual, aphrodisiac", from aphrodisios, i.e. [...] "pertaining to Aphrodite", the Greek goddess of love. The {{opposite}} substance is an <b>anaphrodisiac.</b>|$|E
50|$|Herbal <b>anaphrodisiacs</b> {{have been}} {{employed}} by various religious sects and orders throughout history. Most commonly, chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus) {{has been used}} to normalize hormones in both men and women. An over-active libido is very often treated herbally by addressing poor adrenal function.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the active component of some plant-based <b>anaphrodisiacs</b> may be the induction of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of sex-hormone precursors into androstenedione, which promotes the reduction of sexual urges. Studies have demonstrated {{that some of these}} products inhibit 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17,20-lyase, which catalyzes the conversion of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone of androstenedione to testosterone.|$|R
50|$|Some people purposefully {{attempt to}} reduce their libido through the usage of <b>anaphrodisiacs.</b> Aphrodisiacs, such as dopaminergic psychostimulants, are a class of drugs which can {{increase}} libido. On the other hand, a reduced libido is also often iatrogenic and {{can be caused by}} many medications, such as hormonal contraception, SSRIs and other antidepressants, antipsychotics, opioids and beta blockers.|$|R
5000|$|The Heliconius charithonia {{butterfly}} uses a mating plug in {{the form}} of a spermatophore that provides predatory defense chemicals and protein sources for developing eggs. [...] It also acts as an <b>anaphrodisiac</b> that prevents other males from mating with the female.|$|E
5000|$|In {{ancient times}} it was {{believed}} to be an <b>anaphrodisiac,</b> hence the name chaste tree. Pliny, in his Historia Naturalis, reports the use of stems and leaves of this plant by women as bedding [...] "to cool the heat of lust" [...] {{during the time of the}} Thesmophoria, when Athenian women left their husbands' beds to remain ritually chaste. At the end of the thirteenth century John Trevisa reports of it [...] "the herbe agnus-castus is always grene, and the flowre therof is namly callyd Agnus Castus, for wyth smel and vse it maketh men chaste as a lombe". [...] Chaucer, in [...] "The Flower and the Leaf," [...] refers to it as an attribute of the chaste Diana, and in the 16th century the English herbalist William Turner reports the same <b>anaphrodisiac</b> properties of the seed, both fried and not fried. More recently, this plant has been called monk's pepper in the thought that it was used as anti-libido medicine by monks to aid their attempts to remain chaste. There are disputed accounts regarding its actual action on libido, with some claims that it is <b>anaphrodisiac</b> and others that it is aphrodisiac. Because of the complex mechanism of action it can be probably both, depending on concentration of the extract and physiologic variables (see below).|$|E

5000|$|Aphrodisiacs, <b>anaphrodisiacs,</b> contraceptives, and abortifacients are {{preserved}} by both medical handbooks and magic texts; potions {{can be difficult}} to distinguish from pharmacology. In his Book 33 De medicamentis, Marcellus of Bordeaux, a contemporary of Ausonius, collected more than 70 sexually related treatments—for growths and lesions on the testicles and penis, undescended testicles, erectile dysfunction, hydrocele, [...] "creating a eunuch without surgery", ensuring a woman's fidelity, and compelling or diminishing a man's desire—some of which involve ritual procedures: ...|$|R
50|$|When used on women, {{the effects}} are similar, though there isn't much (if any) {{research}} about chemically lowering women's sex drives or female-specific <b>anaphrodisiacs,</b> since most research focuses on the opposite, but anti-androgenic hormone regimens would lower testosterone in women which can impact sex drive or sexual response. These drugs also deflate the breast glands and expand {{the size of the}} nipple. Also seen is a sudden shrink in bone mass and discoloration of the lips, reduced body hair, and muscle mass.|$|R
5000|$|Hypersexuality may {{negatively}} impact an individual. The {{concept of}} hypersexuality as an addiction {{was started in}} the 1970s by former members of Alcoholics Anonymous who felt they experienced a similar lack of control and compulsivity with sexual behaviors as with alcohol. [...] Multiple 12-step style self-help groups now exist for people who identify as sex addicts, including Sex Addicts Anonymous, Sexaholics Anonymous, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, and Sexual Compulsives Anonymous. Some hypersexuals may treat their condition with the usage of medication or any foods considered to be <b>anaphrodisiacs.</b> Other hypersexuals may choose a route of consultation, such as psychotherapy, self-help groups or counselling.|$|R
5000|$|Popularization of mashua may {{be limited}} by its strong flavor, and its {{reputation}} as an <b>anaphrodisiac.</b> However, mashua tubers roasted in traditional earthen field ovens, built at harvest, are considered a delicacy. Also, the raw tubers can be shredded thinly and added to salads, to confer a spicy flavour and crunchy texture.|$|E
5000|$|Some common anaphrodisiacs are ethanol (alcohol) and tobacco, {{but this}} is {{typically}} an unintended consequence and not often {{the main reason for}} use. While alcohol is used socially because it initially reduces mental inhibitions, studies have shown that over time alcohol physically decreases arousal and makes achieving climax more difficult. [...] For this reason alcohol is considered an <b>anaphrodisiac.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mashua has {{putative}} <b>anaphrodisiac</b> effects. [...] It {{has been}} recorded by the Spanish chronicler Cobo that mashua was fed to their armies by the Inca Emperors, [...] "that they should forget their wives". [...] Studies of male rats fed on mashua tubers have shown a 45% drop in testosterone levels due {{to the presence of}} isothiocyanates.|$|E
5000|$|Sigmund Freud was {{the first}} to use the term widely, and argued {{that it was one of}} the roots of many {{problems}} in Western society. Freud believed that people's naturally strong instincts toward sexuality were repressed by people in order to meet the constraints imposed on them by civilized life. However, Freud's ideas about sexual repression have not been without their critics. According to sex therapist Bernard Apfelbaum, Freud did not base his belief in universal innate, natural sexuality on the strength of sexual desire he saw in people, but rather on its weakness. In some periods of Indian history <b>anaphrodisiacs</b> were utilised in order to lower libidos.|$|R
50|$|The rhizome {{is used as}} an anodyne, antiscrofulatic, astringent, cardiotonic, demulcent and sedative. If used in {{combination}} with slippery elm (Ulmus rubra) or flax (Linum usitatissimum), {{it has been used}} to make a poultice that treats boils and abscesses. As for the flowers, they are an <b>anaphrodisiac</b> and sedative. The complete cure of uterine cancer by a decoction and uterine injection has been recorded.|$|E
50|$|In {{most species}} of butterflies, pheromones {{play a role}} in {{courtship}} and mate recognition, and can {{play a role in}} deterring mates. Spermatophores contain anaphrodisiacs, pheromones that reduce the attractiveness of the females to subsequent males, indicating evolution driven by intrasexual selection between males. These reduce male harassment of mated females. Spermatophores contain nonfertile sperm (apyrene) to increase the <b>anaphrodisiac</b> effect. The transfer of anaphrodisiacs thus reduces female mating choice.|$|E
50|$|In {{one study}} {{a group of}} men were given an <b>anaphrodisiac</b> and the effect on the {{metabolism}} of mineralocorticoids in these men was recorded. During the period of administration, the testosterone concentrations decreased and the serum 17α-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations increased. Testosterone levels fell by about 40% after administration and returned to normal after usage was discontinued. However, the actual effect of these medicines on sexual desire was not measured in the study.|$|E
50|$|Barrister Sir Edward Marshall Hall theorised that murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen {{was using}} hyoscine {{on his wife}} as an <b>anaphrodisiac</b> but accidentally gave her an {{overdose}} and then panicked when she died. Various forms of anaphrodisiacs have been promulgated at various periods {{in an attempt to}} cure hypersexuality in both humans and non-human animals. In both medieval history and modern times, anaphrodisiacs have been used as a tool intended to reduce the sex drive of sex offenders.|$|E
50|$|Vitex agnus-castus, {{also called}} vitex, chaste tree, chasteberry, Abraham's balm, lilac chastetree, or monk's pepper, {{is a native}} of the Mediterranean region. It {{is one of the few}} temperate-zone species of Vitex, which is on the whole a genus of {{tropical}} and sub-tropical flowering plants. Theophrastus mentioned the shrub several times, as agnos (άγνος) in Enquiry into Plants. It has been long believed to be an <b>anaphrodisiac</b> but its effectiveness remains controversial. This is a cross-pollinating plant. However self-pollination may also occur now and then.|$|E
50|$|It {{contains}} the active alkaloids nupharine and nymphaeine, {{and is a}} sedative and an aphrodisiac/anaphrodisiac depending on sources. Although roots and stalks are used in traditional herbal medicine along with the flower, the petals and other flower parts are the most potent. Alcohol {{can be used to}} extract the active alkaloids, and it also boosts the sedative effects. The root of the plant was used by monks and nuns for hundreds of years as an <b>anaphrodisiac,</b> being crushed and mixed with wine. In the earliest printed medical textbooks, authors maintained this use, though warning against consuming large and frequent doses.|$|E
50|$|The {{second day}} of the festival was called the nesteia. This was a day of fasting, imitating Demeter's {{mourning}} for the loss of her daughter. On this day, the women at the festival sat on the ground on seats made of plants which were believed to be <b>anaphrodisiac.</b> Angeliki Tzanetou says that ritual obscenity (aischrologia) was a feature of the {{second day of}} the festival; however, Dillon says that the aischrologia would have taken place on another day, not than the subdued second day, and Radek Chlup argues that the aischrologia was on the third day of the festival.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amino acid}} 5-HTP, or 5-hydroxytryptophan, has been anecdotally {{reported}} to be a mild <b>anaphrodisiac,</b> as has the serotonergic empathogen MDMA, popularly known as [...] "ecstasy". However, systematic study of these chemicals is lacking, due to the off-patent nature of 5-HTP, and the legal control of MDMA. In addition, other serotonergic euphoriant drugs, like the psychedelic LSD, have been reportedly used to drastically increase sexual pleasure. MDMA in combination with a PDE5 inhibitor (trade names Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis) is termed [...] "sextasy". This combination increases libido and performance simultaneously. A PDE5 inhibitor taken alone {{has no effect on}} sex drive, suggesting that serotonergic euphoriants like MDMA may actually increase libido while decreasing performance, similar to alcohol.|$|E
40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: In {{the folk}} {{medicine}} Humulus lupulus L. (hops) is mainly recommendedas a mild sedative with antispasmodic and digestive properties. It is also reputed to exert an anaphrodisiaceffect {{but it is}} still lacking the experimental evidence of this activity. Aim of the study: To evaluate the influence of Humulus lupulus extract on sexual behavior of both naïveand sexually potent male rats; thereafter to investigate the role of 8 -prenylnarigenin (8 -PN) in the effectdisplayed by the hop extract. Materials and methods: Sprague–Dawley male rats both naïve and sexually potent were acutely administeredwith the hop extract dosed at 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg. In addition the extractwas administered dailyfor 10 consecutive days at the dose of 0. 25 mg/kg/day in sexually potent animals. The pure compound 8 -PN was acutely administered in naïve rats at the dosages of 5, 12. 5 and 25 g/kg. All the animals werescreened for their sexual behavior manifestation during the mating test. Results: In naïve rats the acute administration of Humulus lupulus extract at the doses of 25 and 50 mg/kgsignificantly reduced the percentage of mounting and ejaculating animals, in comparison to vehiclecontrols. The other parameters recorded during the mating test were not affected by the hop extract. In sexually potent rats nor the acute neither the repeated administration of the extract modified theircopulatory behavior. The pure compound 8 -PN failed to influence male sexual behavior of naïve rats. Conclusion: Humulus lupulus extract exerted an <b>anaphrodisiac</b> effect only in naïve rats by inhibiting theirmounting and ejaculating behavior. The presence of 8 -PN in the extract could be only partially involvedin the observed <b>anaphrodisiac</b> effect...|$|E
