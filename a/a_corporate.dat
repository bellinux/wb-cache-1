40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigate}} how <b>a</b> firm's <b>corporate</b> strategic action portfolios, defined as bundles of key corporate strategic actions, relate to deregulatory and technological changes, and to firm performance. I hypothesize that frequency {{and variety of}} <b>a</b> firm's <b>corporate</b> strategic action portfolios increase when environmental changes {{take place in the}} marketplace. I also hypothesize that the nature of <b>a</b> firm's <b>corporate</b> strategic action portfolios will be different depending on whether the changes are due to deregulation or technology. After establishing the relationship between environmental changes and <b>a</b> firm's <b>corporate</b> strategic action portfolios, this study measures the relationship between <b>a</b> firm's <b>corporate</b> strategic action portfolios and firm performance. All else being equal, it is hypothesized that a firm with higher levels of frequency and variety on corporate strategic action portfolios will perform better. The US telecommunications service industry provides the empirical background for testing these hypotheses...|$|R
