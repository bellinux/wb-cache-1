40|$|Locally based and volunteer-based {{monitoring}} {{approaches have}} recently received greater attention as a cost-effective way {{to collect data}} on the environment and/or involve stakeholders in management. The present study compared three monitoring methods based on an underwater visual census (UVC) of reef fish in a customary area in Navakavu (Viti Levu Island, Fiji). Two non-scientific approaches involved (1) snorkellers from the village using vernacular names for five local focal fish taxa and (2) non-resident volunteers using the Reef Check target list of fish for the Indo-Pacific (nine focal taxa). These approaches were cross-checked with a comprehensive scientific survey (all fish recorded at the species level across 12 families). The three methods were compared in terms of accuracy, precision, and ability to highlight changes in fish abundance between the community-managed no-take zone (NTZ) and the fished area. We found that scientific and volunteer-based data were consistent in terms of means <b>and</b> <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> estimates but that Reef Check focal taxa would not be suitable for monitoring the Navakavu marine area. On the contrary, the locally selected target taxa were appropriate but overestimates and imprecision were noticed in the fish counts made by the community members. Differences in abundance of two major target taxa (Lethrinidae and Mullidae) between the NTZ and the harvest area were not validated by the scientific observations. Calibration of community-based UVC is thus needed especially if information from the local biological monitoring program is used to guide management actions...|$|E
40|$|Local <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> adult trees impedes {{growth of}} conspecific {{seedlings}} through host-specific enemies, a mechanism first proposed by Janzen and Connell to explain plant diversity in forests. While several studies suggest {{the importance of}} this mechanism, there is still little information <b>of</b> how the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> negative density dependence (NDD) affects diversity of forest communities. With computer simulations, we analyzed the impact <b>of</b> strength <b>and</b> <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> NDD within tree communities on species diversity. We show that stronger NDD leads to higher species diversity. Furthermore, lower range of strengths of NDD within a community increases species richness <b>and</b> decreases <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> species <b>abundances.</b> Our results show that, beyond the average strength <b>of</b> NDD, the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> NDD is also crucially important to explain species diversity. This can explain the dissimilarity of biodiversity between tropical and temperate forest: highly diverse forests could have lower NDD variance. This report suggests that natural enemies and the variety of the magnitude of their effects can contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new algorithm for hyperspectral image unmixing. Most of the unmixing algorithms {{proposed in the}} literature do {{not take into account}} the possible spatial correlations between the pixels. In this work, a Bayesian model is introduced to exploit these correlations. The image to be unmixed is assumed to be partitioned into regions (or classes) where the statistical properties <b>of</b> the <b>abundance</b> coefficients are homogeneous. A Markov random field is then proposed to model the spatial dependency of the pixels within any class. Conditionally upon a given class, each pixel is modeled by using the classical linear mixing model with additive white Gaussian noise. This strategy is investigated the well known linear mixing model. For this model, the posterior distributions of the unknown parameters and hyperparameters allow ones to infer the parameters of interest. These parameters include the abundances for each pixel, the means <b>and</b> <b>variances</b> <b>of</b> the <b>abundances</b> for each class, as well as a classification map indicating the classes of all pixels in the image. To overcome the complexity of the posterior distribution of interest, we consider Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that generate samples distributed according to the posterior of interest. The generated samples are then used for parameter and hyperparameter estimation. The accuracy of the proposed algorithms is illustrated on synthetic and real data.

40|$|Extrapolating across scales is a {{critical}} problem in ecology. Explicit mechanistic models of ecological systems provide a bridge from measurements of processes at small and short scales to larger scales; spatial patterns at large scales {{can be used to}} test the outcomes of these models. However, it is necessary to identify patterns that are not dependent on initial conditions, because small scale initial conditions will not normally be measured at large scales. We examined one possible pattern that could meet these conditions, the relationship between mean <b>and</b> <b>variance</b> in <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> a parasitic tick in an individual based model of a lizard tick interaction. We scaled discrepancies between the observed and simulated patterns with a transformation of the variance–covariance matrix of the observed pattern to objectively identify patterns that are “close”. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} generate patterns that are independent of initial conditions, verifying that the small scale processes in the model are able to reproduce the large scale patterns observed in real data. The pattern analysis also indicates that we have a poor understanding of the density dependent effect of larval engorgement success and host refuge use...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Marine {{phenomena}} such as algal blooms can {{be detected}} using in situ measurements onboard autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), but understanding plankton ecology and community structure requires retrieval and analysis of water specimens. This process requires shipboard or manual sample collection, followed by onshore lab analysis which is time-consuming. Better {{understanding of the relationship}} between the observable environmental features and organism abundance would allow more precisely targeted sampling and thereby save time. In this work, we present an approach to learn and improve models that predict this relationship. Coupled with recent advances in AUV technology allowing selective retrieval of water samples, this constitutes a new paradigm in biological sampling. We use organism abundance models along with spatial models of environmental features learned immediately after AUV deployments to compute spatial distributions of organisms in the coastal ocean purely from in situ AUV data. We use Gaussian process regression along with the unscented transform to fuse the two models, obtaining both the mean <b>and</b> <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> the organism <b>abundance</b> estimates. The uncertainty in organism abundance predictions is used in a sampling strategy to selectively acquire new water specimens that improves the organism abundance models. Simulation results are presented demonstrating the advantage of performing hierarchical probabilistic regression. After the validation through simulation, we show predictions <b>of</b> organism <b>abundance</b> from models learned on lab-analyzed water sample data, and AUV survey data. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMeasurements of acetone, methanol, {{acetaldehyde}} and a {{range of}} non-methane hydrocarbons have been made in North Atlantic marine air at the Mace Head observatory. Under maritime conditions the combination of OVOCs (acetone, methanol and 5 acetaldehyde) contributed up to 85 % of the total mass of measured non methane organics in air and up to 80 % of the OH radical organic sink, when compared with the sum of all other organic compounds including non-methane hydrocarbons, DMS and OH-reactive halocarbons (trichloromethane and tetrachloroethylene). The observations showed anomalies in the <b>variance</b> <b>and</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> acetaldehyde and acetone 10 over that expected for species with a remote terrestrial emission source and OH controlled chemical lifetime. A detailed model incorporating an explicit chemical degradation mechanism indicated in situ formation during air mass transport was on timescales longer than the atmospheric lifetime of precursor hydrocarbons or primary emission. The period over which this process was significant was similar to that of airmass mo 15 tion on intercontinental scales, and formation via this route may reproduce that of a widespread diffuse source. The model indicates that continued short chain OVOC formation occurs many days from the point of emission, via longer lived intermediates of oxidation such as organic peroxides and long chain alcohols...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of the infectious stages of parasites with a direct life cycle {{is one of the}} most important factors influencing infectious disease dynamics, and acquisition rates will generally increase as the contact time between parasite and host increases. For animal species that are constrained by feeding opportunities, one might expect disease patterns to be highly skewed within confined systems. The aim of the present study was to identify to what extent, if any, eggs of avian parasites are aggregated within the release pen, and to evaluate what effect, if any, this aggregation had on the distribution of the adult stages within the host species. The <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> Syngamus trachea eggs were highly aggregated within pens, with high levels of contamination driven by a combination of feeder placement, soil moisture and host-mediated heterogeneities in immuno-competence. The log mean <b>and</b> log <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> egg <b>abundance</b> was highly linear (R(2) = 0. 97 - 0. 99), with an estimated slope (b) of between 1. 79 and 1. 97 for individual sites, and 2. 11 when sites were combined, which indicated aggregation relative to an estimated Poisson slope of unity. Although the placement of feeders and environmental moisture could be contributing to parasite aggregation, density-dependent processes appear to be ensuring the population does not become too over or under-dispersed, in order to maintain the transmission-virulence equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to explicitly demonstrate the high spatial aggregation of eggs around feeding sites and the first to suggest possible density-dependent regulatory mechanisms stabilising disease dynamics between S. trachea and ring necked Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) ...|$|R
40|$|Periphyton {{communities}} {{are often the}} dominant primary producers and an important energy source to higher trophic levels in rivers and streams. Empirical models of periphyton biomass (chlorophyll a) that have high predictive power are generally lacking. The goal {{of this research was}} to assess and improve the predictability of periphyton in rivers. A historical river monitoring data set from Alberta showed that, in general, land use in the drainage basin was a good surrogate for instream nutrient concentrations in regression models of periphyton biomass. Land use explained up to 34 % of the variability in chlorophyll a whereas models based on instream nutrients explained up to 24 % of the variability in chlorophyll a. A field study showed that bacterial abundance in periphyton explained an additional 26 to 29 % <b>of</b> residual <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> chlorophyll a, after taking nutrients into account. The relationships between algal and bacterial abundance and production estimates were positive, suggesting bacteria and algae coexist in a mutually dependent association. The sampling design for bacteria in the field study was based on the relationships between sample means <b>and</b> <b>variances</b> <b>of</b> published bacterial <b>abundance</b> <b>and</b> production data. The number of replicates needed to sample periphytic bacterial abundance and production was determined from these relationships. A meta-analysis of published periphyton regression models was used to evaluate model predictive power. Once corrected for the number of observations, terms, and sampling replicates in the models, predictive power of periphyton models has not improved over the last 30 years. Geographic extent of the study area and the type of predictor variables used also had almost no effect on predictive power. The theoretical limit of model precision has approximately been reached for models predicting temporally averaged periphyton biomass. In contrast, residual <b>variances</b> <b>of</b> models predicting instantaneous mean chlorophyll a were, on average, 4. 5 times higher than theoretical pure error. Precision of temporal mean models will only be improved by obtaining more precise estimates of mean chlorophyll a. Models that predict instantaneous chlorophyll a may be made more precise by including variables that better reflect the recent site history...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of 3 methods for sampling spiders in grape vineyards was tested. The sampling methods were as follows: (1) a drop-cloth method in which spiders were dislodged from a 5. 1 -m 2 area of grapevine onto a drop cloth, (2) a funnel method in which spiders were dislodged into a 0. 74 -m 2 funnel, and (3) a D-vac method in which 50 sections of grapevine (30 -cm sections, total area of 5. 4 m 2) were suctioned with a gasoline-powered vacuum. Data from all sampling methods were adjusted for area sampled and {{compared with an}} absolute control, in which foliage from an entire vine was removed and searched for spiders. Analyses were made on the following 8 most abundant spider species: Allyphaella pacifica Banks, Metaphidippus vitis (Cockerell), Theridion dilutum Levi and Theridion melanurum Hahn (grouped as Theridion spp.), Cheiracanthium inclusum (Hentz), Hololena nedra Chamberlin 2 ̆ 6 Ivie, Trachelas pacificus (Chamberlin 2 ̆ 6 Ivie), and Erigone dentosa (O. P. -Cambridge). Mean spider abundance from each sampling method differed significantly from the absolute control in (≥ 1) species. The funnel method often overestimated spider abundance while the drop-cloth and D-vac methods often underestimated spider <b>abundance.</b> Estimates <b>of</b> spider species composition were most accurately measured by the drop-cloth method and were significantly altered by the D-vac method. We tested 3 data transformations (ln[x + 1], √ [x + 0. 5], and x 1 -b/ 2) to stabilize the <b>variance</b> <b>and</b> satisfy the requirements <b>of</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> (ANOVA). No single transformation uncoupled the mean <b>and</b> <b>variance</b> for all spider species over the 3 sampling methods. Using mean <b>and</b> <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> mean spider <b>abundance,</b> sample size and dispersion parameters were created {{by way of the}} Taylor power law. Sample sizes were determined for each sampling method; estimates of sample size and sampling costs varied considerably among spider species and sampling methods. All but 1 spider species collected with the drop-cloth method had a clumped distribution, the funnel method produced variable dispersion indexes, and all spider species collected with the D-vac method had a random distribution pattern. Whereas no single sampling method was best for all spider species, the funnel method is favored because of its efficiency in estimating spider densities and its reduced cost...|$|R
