25|$|For most of history, {{regional}} tradition largely dictated {{what type}} of vine training would {{be found in a}} given area. In the early 20th century, many of these traditions were codified into specific wine laws and regulations such as the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> <b>system.</b> The widespread study and utilization of various training systems began in the 1960s when many New World wine regions were developing their wine industry. Without the centuries of tradition that influenced Old world winemaking and viticulture, vine growers in areas like California, Washington, Australia and New Zealand conducted large scale research into how particular vine training systems, pruning and canopy management techniques impacted wine quality. As research in this area continued into the 21st century, new vine training systems were developed that could be adapted to the desired wine making style the grapes were destined for as well as the labor needs and particular mesoclimate of the vineyard.|$|E
25|$|Spanish wine laws {{created the}} Denominación de Origen (DO) system in 1932 and were later revised in 1970. The system shares many {{similarities}} with the hierarchical Appellation d'origine contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> <b>system</b> of France, Portugal's Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) and Italy's Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) system. As of 2009, there were 79 Quality Wine areas across Spain. In addition there is Denominación de Origen Calificada (DOCa or DOQ in Catalan) status for DOs {{that have a}} consistent track record for quality. There are currently two DOCa/DOQ regions: Rioja and Priorat. Each DO has a Consejo Regulador, which acts as a governing control body that enforces the DO regulations and standards involving viticultural and winemaking practices. These regulations govern everything from the types of grapes that are permitted to be planted, the maximum yields that can be harvested, the minimum length of time that the wine must be aged and what type of information is required {{to appear on the}} wine label. Wineries that are seeking to have their wine sold under DO or DOC status must submit their wines to the Consejo Regulador laboratory and tasting panel for testing and evaluation. Wines that have been granted DO/DOC status will feature the regional stamp of the Consejo Regulador on the label.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Agiorgitiko was {{the most}} widely planted red grape variety in Greece with [...] in Attica, [...] in Peloponnese and {{additional}} plantings in Macedonia and Epirus. The grape is most widely associated with the dry and sweet red wines of Nemea in northeastern Peloponnese.

2500|$|Drafted in 1973, the [...] "Wine of Origin" [...] (WO) {{programme}} legislates how wine {{regions of}} South Africa are defined and can appear on wine labels. While {{some aspects of}} the WO are taken from the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> <b>system,</b> the WO is concerned primarily with accuracy in labelling and does not place any additional regulations on wine regions such as permitted varieties, trellising methods, irrigation and crop yields. Wine regions under the WO system fall under one of four categories - the largest and most generic are geographical units (such as the Western Cape region) which include the smaller, but still largely defined regions (such as Overberg), followed by districts (like Walker Bay) and then finally wards (such as Elgin). The Eastern Cape province is South Africa's most recent wine region. While geographical units, regions and districts are largely defined by political boundaries - wards are the level of origin designation that is most defined by unique terroir characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{devastation of}} the war did bring a silver lining. In 1919, the French {{government}} passed a series of laws that would {{lay the groundwork for}} the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> <b>system</b> that would strictly define winemaking laws and regional boundaries. Measures were taken to eliminate fraud and illegal additives such as rhubarb and apple juice. Only grapes grown from the delineated Champagne region, which would eventually include the Aube, could be legally called [...] "Champagne". The decimation of the region's vineyards provided the opportunity for vine growers to replant with phylloxera resistant rootstock and in more ideal locations for quality grape production. But amidst this silver lining, more dark clouds would emerge as the full effects of the Russian Revolution hit home and the lucrative Russian market was closed to Champagne imports. The 1920 declaration of prohibition in the United States closed off yet another market and the global economic downturn of the Great Depression lead to a further decrease in sales. World War II would bring more troops marching through the vineyards of Champagne. While the devastation brought to the region was not as severe as the previous war, World War II was still a troubling time for the region. It was in Reims, on May 7, 1945 that the German military commander Alfred Jodl offered an unconditional surrender to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The following morning, the signing was celebrated with 6 cases of the 1934 vintage of Pommery. Wine historians Don and Petie Kladstrup noted that a World War II historian would later comment that [...] "the last explosions {{of the war}} were the popping of Champagne corks".|$|E

Many of these actions came in response to declining domestic consumption and slumping sales that followed through the close of the 20th century. Heading into the 21st century, some parts of French wine industry have thrived while others have been faced with a crisis of confidence.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} an Autonomy Oriented Computing (AOC) approach to color image segmentation. Basic elements in <b>AOC</b> <b>systems</b> are an environment and autonomous entities. Environment, in our case, {{consists of the}} three layer 2 D lattice which contains color images in RGB and HSI color spaces as well as storage cells through which entities interchange information. Environment serves as the place where autonomous entities roam and operate. Entities exhibit a number of reactive behaviors such as diffusing, self-reproduction, waiting or dying. Goal of each entity is to locate and label image pixels whose color satisfies skin-like criteria. Entities which are successful in locating such pixels {{have an opportunity to}} produce offspring entities and place them within their neighborhood, where they are most likely to find other skin color-like pixels. The entities that don’t succeed in locating any skin color like pixel vanish from the system when their ages exceed their lifespan. Results of all entity families are combined into regions. Experiments, based on a program simulator, were run over set of frontal face images from the XM 2 VTS database...|$|R

5000|$|The {{influence}} of terroir means that wines {{from a particular}} region are unique, incapable of being reproduced outside that area, even if the grape variety and winemaking techniques are painstakingly duplicated. Winemakers in Burgundy {{do not believe that}} they are producing Pinot noir that happens to be grown in Burgundy, but that they are producing unique Burgundian wines that happen to be made from Pinot noir. Appellation systems, such as the French <b>AOC</b> <b>systems,</b> have developed around the concepts of [...] "unique wines from a unique area". These systems have also developed into protected designation of origin across the European Union so that, for example, winemakers from outside a region like Tuscany can not produce a Sangiovese wine and call it a Chianti. While the wine may be made from the same clonal variety of Sangiovese, in the same soil composition as found in the Chianti region with winemakers using the Tuscan method of production, there is an assumption that the two wines will be different due to terroir.|$|R

40|$|Biofouling {{of reverse}} osmosis (RO) {{membranes}} {{is one of}} the most serious problems encountered for seawater desalination. This problem is commonly associated with a significant decline in flux, elevated energy requirement, and increased cost of operation. As the biofouling of the membranes is due to bacteria growing on the membrane, which is supported by assimilable organic carbon (AOC), a good <b>AOC</b> monitoring <b>system</b> is essential and crucial for RO biofouling prediction. This study focuses on the development of a new biosensor that is online, robust, and allows accurate quantification of AOC concentrations in seawater based on a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) principle. The biosensor is based on the quantification of the current generated by bacteria in the presence of AOC. The biosensor response to AOC was rapid (within 10 min) and sensitive (detection limit = 10 μM acetate) in seawater samples. The results reproducibly showed a linear relationship between trace amounts of AOC and electrochemical signals (R 2 > 0. 99). The MEC-based biosensor developed can be effectively used as an online and rapid measure of AOC concentrations and hence as an indicator for biofouling potential of influent seawater prior to RO membrane...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines how, after World War Two, the French {{state and}} powerful interest groups shifted {{the debate over}} drink from an issue of personal morality into a battle of political economy. Contrary to the widely held Tocquevillian assumption that France has had weak and fragmented interest groups with little capacity to influence state policy, this dissertation argues that a relatively weak public health movement became influential when it struck alliances with powerful state and economic interests. Working together, the different and sometimes antagonistic interests of doctors, French and European technocrats, luxury winegrowers, and automobile and insurance groups combined to issue alarms about France's allegedly rising alcoholism and mobilize public opinion against the country's alcohol producers and industrial, mono-cropping winegrowers. This movement was abetted by important structural transformations: {{the fall of the}} Fourth Republic (1946 - 1958) and the foundation of the Fifth (1958 -), where a strong executive branch circumvented the industrial wine lobby and Parliament; the end of empire, which meant the eventual termination of cheap Algerian wine imports; and the creation of the European Community, which adopted France's luxury Appellation d'origine contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> labeling <b>system</b> and discouraged industrial wine production and consumption. In short, I maintain that this anti-alcohol campaign helped prepare appellation wine producers and the state for competition in the world economy. This dissertation uses drink as a prism through which to understand France's dramatic economic modernization after World War Two. It contributes to our understanding of France and Europe's so-called "Economic Miracle," particularly {{the role of the state}} and the wine industry in shaping European market integration. Against the common view that the wine industry has been a conservative force in French society, this dissertation argues that it played an active role in its own modernization in order to compete internationally in the context of European integration and, by the 1970 s, globalization...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the production process of wine in Burgundy are {{the small size of}} the viticultural holdings and the fact that each vine-grower cultivates several patches in different villages, which permits them to produce wines belonging to one of the four hierarchical levels in the "guaranteed vintage" <b>system</b> (<b>AOC).</b> Such an organization incites to define the concept of "vintage portfolio" associated with each viticultural holding.

Le système de production du vin en Bourgogne est caractérisé par des propriétés de petites tailles, chaque viticulteur exploitant plusieurs parcelles de plusieurs villages associées à l'une des AOC classées selon 4 niveaux hiérarchiques. Cette organisation nous amène a définir le concept de "portefeuille d'appellations" attache à chaque exploitation. L'objectif de la réflexion est de vérifier si les comportements des viticulteurs les conduisent à avoir des couts de production (ici le coût du raisin sur pied) qui dépendent d'une part de leur portefeuille d'appellations et d'autre part de leur politique stratégique appréhendée au niveau technique par le rendement moyen ou la politique de rendement, et au niveau commercial par leur engagement dans la vente directe en bouteilles à la propriété. Quelques résultats exploratoires sont tires de l'utilisation de données d'enquêtes obtenues pour 1994 auprès de 30 viticulteurs représentant les différentes situations des exploitations dans la zone étudiée.
