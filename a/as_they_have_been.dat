5|$|As {{departments}} {{have changed over}} the years, some are no longer present <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> abolished or merged, with most departments present being mainly based in Brussels while retaining a minor presence in Luxembourg. There are however some departments which are still entirely based in the city per the 1965 agreement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the first {{vascular}} plant was found growing on the northern shore of Surtsey, mosses became visible in 1967, and lichens were first found on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant colonisation on Surtsey has been closely studied, the vascular plants in particular <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> of far greater significance than mosses, lichens and fungi {{in the development of}} vegetation.|$|E
5|$|When {{they reach}} the {{coordinates}} shown on the parchments, there is no island in sight. Frustrated, Haddock ponders turning back, but Tintin soon realizes the problem: If Sir Francis had used a French chart instead of an English chart to calculate the position, the coordinates would have been measured on the Paris Meridian rather than the Greenwich Meridian. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> using the Greenwich Meridian, they realise that they are too far west.|$|E

5|$|A 2017 {{histological}} {{study of}} growth lines {{found that the}} Portuguese Baryonyx specimen had died between the age of 23 and 25 years old, and was close to its maximum size and skeletal maturity. This contradicted a younger age indicated by the neurocentral sutures not being fused, {{and the presence of}} both mature and sub-adult traits may be due to paedomorphosis (where juvenile traits are retained into adulthood). Paedomorphic traits may be related to swimming locomotion, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> suggested in other extinct animals thought to have been aquatic (such as plesiosaurs and temnospondyls). The study also found that the animal had reached sexual maturity at the age of 13 to 15 years, due to a decrease in growth rate at this point.|$|E
5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, {{and the number of}} Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E
5|$|For the Narnians, Berger envisioned them as more wild in appearance, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{forced into}} the forests. He also decided to {{increase}} the portrayal of various ages, sizes and races. The black dwarfs are distinguished from the red dwarfs as they have more leather and jewellery, and a darker colour scheme in their costumes. Each race of creatures also had their fighting styles made more distinguishable. The minotaurs have maces, and the centaurs use swords. The satyrs were redesigned, as their creation on the first film had been rushed. 4,600 make-up jobs were performed, which Berger believes is a record.|$|E

5|$|To {{assist the}} new government, since February 2000 the United Nations {{has had the}} United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (now called MONUSCO), which {{currently}} has a strength of over 16,000 peacekeepers in the country. Its principal tasks are to provide security in key areas, such as the South Kivu and North Kivu in the east, and to assist the government in reconstruction. Foreign rebel groups {{are also in the}} Congo, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{for most of the last}} half-century. The most important is the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), against which Laurent Nkunda's troops were fighting, but other smaller groups such as the anti-Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army are also present.|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow nests either {{alone or}} in a small, loosely {{connected}} colony of three to five nests. It is monogamous and may form a lifelong pair bond. The bushcrow occasionally has a third bird, or in rare cases two to four more, help the breeding couple both build the nest {{and care for the}} young. The helpers may also not be restricted to helping one nest at a time, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> seen at nests across the loose colonies. Allofeeding and allopreening, where the birds feed or preen each other, takes place both between the pair and with the other bushcrows in the colony. The bushcrow lays its eggs shortly after the first rains, which normally occur in late February and early March, leading to its eggs being laid in late March and early April.|$|E
