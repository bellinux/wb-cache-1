5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Guys and Dollss success, Feuer <b>and</b> <b>Martin</b> were interested in adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row into a musical. They felt {{that some of the}} characters, such as marine biologist Doc, would work well in a musical, but that many of the other characters would not. Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer <b>and</b> <b>Martin.</b> Based on suggestions for the story line by Feuer <b>and</b> <b>Martin,</b> Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E

40|$|Babenyshev <b>and</b> <b>Martins</b> {{proved that}} two hidden multi-sorted {{deductive}} systems are deductively equivalent if {{and only if}} there exists an isomorphism between their corresponding lattices of theories that commutes with substitutions. We show that the -institutions corresponding to the hidden multi-sorted deductive systems studied by Babenyshev <b>and</b> <b>Martins</b> satisfy the multi-term condition of Gil-Férez. This provides a proof of the result of Babenyshev <b>and</b> <b>Martins</b> by appealing to the general result of Gil-Férez pertaining to arbitrary multi-term -institutions. The approach places hidden multi-sorted deductive systems in a more general framework and bypasses the laborious reuse of well-known proof techniques from traditional abstract algebraic logic by using “off the shelf” tools...|$|R

5|$|In November 1987, Kai <b>and</b> <b>Martin</b> {{became known}} as The Glamour Girls, and she {{underwent}} an image change that involved bleaching her dark hair platinum blonde {{at the suggestion of}} their manager Jimmy Hart. The duo appeared at the first Survivor Series in 1987 as part of then champion Sherri Martel's team to face the Fabulous Moolah's team. Martel's team—Martel, the Glamour Girls, Dawn Marie, and Donna Christanello—lost to The Fabulous Moolah's team—Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki).
