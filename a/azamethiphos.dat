40|$|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is {{the primary}} target for {{organophosphates}} (OP). Several mutations {{have been reported in}} AChE {{to be associated with the}} reduced sensitivity against OP in various arthropods. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such reports are available for Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to determine the association of AChE(s) gene(s) with resistance against OP. We screened the AChE genes (L. salmonis ace 1 a and ace 1 b) in two salmon lice populations: one sensitive (n= 5) and the other resistant (n= 5) for <b>azamethiphos,</b> a commonly used OP in salmon farming. The screening led to the identification of a missense mutation Phe 362 Tyr in L. salmonis ace 1 a, (corresponding to Phe 331 in Torpedo californica AChE) in all the samples of the resistant population. We confirmed the potential role of the mutation, with reduced sensitivity against <b>azamethiphos</b> in L. salmonis, by screening for Phe 362 Tyr in 2 sensitive and 5 resistant strains. The significantly higher frequency of the mutant allele (362 Tyr) in the resistant strains clearly indicated the possible association of Phe 362 Tyr mutation in L. salmonis ace 1 a with resistance towards <b>azamethiphos.</b> The 3 D modelling, short term survival experiments and enzymatic assays further supported the imperative role of Phe 362 Tyr in reduced sensitivity of L. salmonis for <b>azamethiphos.</b> Based on all these observations, the present study, for the first time, presents the mechanism of resistance in L. salmonis against <b>azamethiphos.</b> In addition, we developed a rapid diagnostic tool for the high throughput screening of Phe 362 Tyr mutation using High Resolution Melt analysis...|$|E

Residual toxicities and persistence of these insecticide mixtures were assessed at 30 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 2 % r. h., and a photoperiod of 12 : 12 (L:D) h from 1 day after treatment (0 week) and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8, and then every 4 weeks up to week 40. Mortality was recorded at exposure periods of 6 h and then every 24 h until end-point was achieved.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{of a range}} of anti-parasitic chemotherapeutic agents against the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis following topical application was studied in vitro and in vivo. In general, adult and preadult lice were susceptible {{to a wide range of}} compounds with dose rates, following 1 hour exposures, ranging several orders of magnitude (10. 0 - 0. 001 mg/L). Overall the pyrethroid compounds which were tested were found to have the widest therapeutic ratios, indicating the potential of this group of chemotherapeutants for sea lice control. Resistance to the organophosphorus (OP) compounds dichlorvos and <b>azamethiphos</b> was detected in isolated populations of lice. Field trials with <b>azamethiphos</b> indicated that the compound was highly efficacious against sensitive lice (@ 0. 1 mg/L; however, where resistance was present, efficacy (@ 0. 2 mg/L) was highly variable. When used at the above dose rates, <b>azamethiphos</b> was found to be well tolerated by fish as indicated by a lack of significant brain acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Results on cross resistance (between pyrethroids and OPs) were inconclusive which was believed to be, primarily, due to the overall high toxicity of the group; but also to the variable responses from exposed lice. In a series of preliminary trials, one of the pyrethroid compounds, PHRDL-D, was found to effectively remove lice when administered orally to infected salmon, indicating the potential of pyrethroids as oral chemotherapeutants. A comparison of the relative toxicity of <b>azamethiphos</b> (OP), resmethrin (pyrethroid), ivermectin (avermectin) and the structurally similar compound SKB 7 (milbemycin), indicated that chalimus stages were only susceptible to ivermectin and SKB 7 following topical and intra-peritoneal injection to lice infected fish. In contrast, <b>azamethiphos</b> and resmethrin were found to be non toxic to chalimus larvae at dose rates which were highly toxic to both adult lice and treated fish. Preliminary studies on the uptake of r 4 C]azamethiphos in adult lice indicated that uptake was both concentration and time dependant, reaching a plateau at the onset of toxicity. Uptake appeared to be primarily associated with frontal plates, 1 st antennae and anus. The fmdings indicated that several compounds/compound classes are highly active against lice and, given the limited number of compounds available for sea lice control and the development of resistance to OPs, might be considered as alternatives.

40|$|Resistance towards {{antiparasitic}} {{agents in the}} salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is a widespread problem along the Norwegian coast, reducing treatments efficacies and slowing down the envisioned expansion of Norwegian salmon production. The present {{study was conducted in}} order to assess the efficacies of two of the most widely used anti-parasitic substances-azamethiphos and deltamethrin-as well as assessing the benefit of having a resistant genotype compared to being fully sensitive when exposed to one of these substances. Atlantic salmon were exposed to a mix of salmon lice copepodids from a fully sensitive, a double resistant and a multi-resistant strain. Once the lice reached pre-adult stages, one group was exposed to 100 μg/L <b>azamethiphos</b> for 60 minutes, the other to 2 μg/L deltamethrin for 30 minutes, and the last was kept in a seawater control. Detached lice were collected at a series of time points following exposure, and all lice (immobilized and surviving) were analysed for both pyrethroid (sensitive "S" and resistant "R") and <b>azamethiphos</b> (fully sensitive "SS", heterozygous resistant "RS" and fully resistant "RR") resistance markers. We found that the efficacies of deltamethrin on parasites with genotype S and R were 70. 3 and 13. 2 %, respectively. The overall efficacy of the deltamethrin treatment was 32. 3 %. The efficacies of <b>azamethiphos</b> on parasites with genotype SS, RS and RR were 100, 80 and 19. 1 %, respectively. The overall efficacy of the <b>azamethiphos</b> treatment was 80. 4 %.

On the other hand, no resistance to diflubenzuron and cyromazin has been detected. The stability of resistance to <b>azamethiphos,</b> bendiocarb,and deltamethrin was investigated during 4 years (60 laboratory generations) under laboratory conditions in flies not exposed to the selection pressure by insecticides. The highest stability of resistance was observed for bendiocarb, which decreased considerably starting with the 35 th laboratory generation. The decrease in resistance to deltamethrin occurred in four stages, characterized by alternative decrease and increase in resistance factor values. In the case of <b>azamethiphos,</b> a marked decrease in resistance was recorded starting from the fourth laboratory generation. The results obtained in laboratory tests were compared with those obtained under practical conditions in pig houses. An intensive use of insecticides induced resistance {{in the course of}} 2 to 3 seasons in dependence on the number of residual spray applications during the season, i. e., from May to September. After cessation of selection pressure, resistance to bendiocarb during 7 years and deltamethrin during 4 years remained at a high level. However, the decrease of resistance to moderate or low level did not solve the problem because a repeated use of insecticides resulted in development of high resistance in about one season.

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} {{evidence of the}} importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of multiple biological processes, the molecular bases supporting this regulation are still barely understood in crustaceans. Therefore, the molecular characterization and transcriptome modulation of the miRNA biogenesis pathway were evaluated in the salmon louse Caligus rogercresseyi, an ectoparasite that constitutes one of the biggest concerns for salmonid aquaculture industry. Hence, RNA-Seq analysis was conducted from six different developmental stages, and also after bioassays with delousing drugs Deltamethrin and <b>Azamethiphos</b> using adult individuals. In silico analysis evidenced 24 putative genes involved in the miRNA pathway such as biogenesis, transport, maturation and miRNA-target interaction. Moreover, 243 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, 15 of which showed non-synonym mutations.

40|$|Organophosphates (OP) {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{treatments}} used against the salmon louse (Lepeophtherius salmonis) in Norwegian salmonid aquaculture. The use of OP since the late 1970 s has resulted in widespread resistant parasites. Recently, we reported a single mutation (Phe 362 Tyr) in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as the major mechanism behind resistance in salmon louse towards OP. The present study was carried out to validate this mechanism at the field level. A total of 6658 salmon louse samples were enrolled from 56 different fish farms across the Norwegian coast, from Vest Agder in the south to Finnmark in the north. All the samples were genotyped using a TaqMan probe assay for the Phe 362 Tyr mutation. A strong association was observed between areas with frequent use of the OP (<b>azamethiphos)</b> and the Phe 362 Tyr mutation. This was confirmed at 15 sites where results from independently conducted bioassays and genotyping of parasites correlated well. Furthermore, genotyping of surviving and moribund parasites from six bioassay experiments demonstrated a highly significant negative correlation between the frequency of resistance alleles and the probability of dying when exposed to <b>azamethiphos</b> in a bioassay.

The research was aimed {{to point out}} differences in the expression of pesticide-resistant acetylcholinesterase forms in organisms living in different ecosystems such as the Ross Sea (Antarctica) and the Mediterranean Sea. In A. colbecki, distinct acetylcholinesterase molecular forms were purified and characterized from spontaneously soluble, low-salt-soluble and low-salt-Triton extracts from adductor muscle and gills. They consist of two non-amphiphilic acetylcholinesterases (G 2, G 4) and an amphiphilic-phosphatidylinositol-membrane-anchored form (G 2); a further amphiphilic-low-salt-soluble G 2 acetylcholinesterase was found only in adductor muscle. In the corresponding tissues of P. jacobaeus, we found a non-amphiphilic G 4 and an amphiphilic G 2 acetylcholinesterase; amphiphilic-low-salt-soluble acetylcholinesterases (G 2) are completely lacking. Such results are related with differences in cell membrane lipid compositions. In both scallops, all non-amphiphilic AChEs are resistant to used pesticides.

40|$|Globally, house flies (Musca domestica) play an {{important}} role by disturbing livestock and by transmitting disease pathogens. The modern and intensively managed pig farms offer house flies optimal conditions for their survival and reproduction. The floating layer of manure in the current, completely slatted floor system for keeping fattening pigs or sows – together with constantly high temperatures – allows fly reproduction throughout the year regardless of external climatic influence. During recent years there have been reports on an increase of insecticide resistance (IR) in animal husbandry management systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the eventual occurrence and the distribution of insecticide resistance in M. domestica on pig farms of the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. A cross sectional survey assessing occurrence and distribution of IR was conducted on 40 pig farms based on the results of a preliminary questionnaire survey. The susceptibility of M. domestica against the contact insecticide deltamethrin was evaluated by using the FlyBox®-method. Commercial formulations of thiamethoxam, imidacloprid and <b>azamethiphos</b> – all of them feed-through insecticides – were tested under pen side conditions as were the larvicides cyromazine and triflumuron. The results allowed selecting 19 conspicuous fly populations, which were subsequently assessed following their establishment as laboratory strains. Additionally, the topical application was used for an evaluation of pyrethrum, deltamethrin, phoxim, <b>azamethiphos,</b> thiamethoxam and imidacloprid as pure active ingredients. While the exposure for feed-through insecticides lasted for one hour during the on-farm assays, the exposure lasted for 48 hours under laboratory conditions in order to ensure an optimal intake of the active ingredient. The efficacy of both larvicides was also assessed by using other than commercial concentrations. Analysis of the questionnaires revealed that highest fly numbers were observed from July to September. Use of chemical products constituted the mainstay of pest management. Products against adult insects as well as larvicides were routinely used and their efficacy judged as mostly satisfactory by the farmers. On-farm assays showed distinct differences between the feed-through insecticides <b>azamethiphos,</b> thiamethoxam and imidacloprid after an exposure of 1 hour. At the end of an observation period of 24 hours thiamethoxam was found to be the most effective with an average paralysis rate of 91 % contrasting with, respectively, 66 % for <b>azamethiphos</b> and 62 % for imidacloprid. Trials with the pyrethroid deltamethrin by using the FlyBox®-method indicated considerable resistance of the field populations. Following an exposure for 10 seconds, 20 (50 %) of the populations displayed a paralysis inferior to 40 % after 60 minutes. Despite treatment with triflumuron of the larval medium at the commercially recommended dose (5 mg/kg), about 30 % flies were able to emerge from egg deposits. Cyromazine proved to be 100 % effective at the commercially recommended dose of 5 mg/kg. Repetition of the tests with feed-through insecticides under laboratory conditions showed after 3 hours thiamethoxam to achieve the fastest and highest paralysis. The average paralysis rate after 48 hours amounted to 94 %. When exposed to <b>azamethiphos,</b> the highest average paralysis rate was recorded after 4 hours (62 %). Exposure for 48 hours resulted in a paralysis of 96 %. Imidacloprid was found to be the least effective, thereby confirming the results of the on-farm assays. Natural pyrethrum showed little effect when topically applied. Application of the discriminating dose (DD) of 2. 200 ng per fly resulted in an average paralysis of 38 % after 24 hours. However, the same dose resulted in an average paralysis of 86 % when the pyrethroid deltamethrin was used, which contrasted with the results of the on-farm assays when the FlyBox® method had been used. A reduction of the amount of the active ingredient should be considered in future work dealing with an assessment of IR. It is expected that this approach would help to better understand the range of IR. The topical application of the DD of the phosphoric acid phoxim resulted in an average paralysis rate of 28 %. A 16 -fold increase of the DD increased the average paralysis to 93 %. When applying the DD for <b>azamethiphos</b> of 310 ng per fly, 12 (71 %) displayed a medium resistance but three populations proved to be highly resistant. Both thiamethoxam und imidacloprid did not induce notable paralysis when topically applied despite their mixture with acetone and oil as solvent. Thiamethoxam showed an average paralysis of 37 % after 24 hours when the DD of 320 ng per fly was applied. A 16 -fold increase of the DD yielded an average paralysis of only 76 %. Imidacloprid proved even less effective. The 16 -fold DD only produced an average paralysis of 54 %. The larvicidal tests confirmed prior results of the on-farm evaluations: cyromazine used in a dose of 4 mg/kg resulted in 100 % inhibition. The commercially recommended dose amounts to 5 mg/kg. Even a further reduction to 1 mg/kg prevented the emergence by 79 % on average. This contrasted with the findings when triflumuron was used: 4 mg/kg medium merely inhibited the development of 5 out of the 19 tested populations (26 %). It can be concluded that an eventual IR has to be ruled out before the selection of a specific insecticide for the control of adult flies. The use of persistent pyrethroids should be avoided. Preference should be given to natural derives of pyrethrum that are reinforced by synergists like piperonyl butoxide (PBO). A strategic application of chemical products is recommended taking into account seasonal population dynamics, which might assist in avoiding an exacerbation of already existing IR and to prevent new resistance. Further sensible approaches are a rotational scheme of still effective ingredients and a regular mechanical dung removal at weekly intervals.

To assess current status and development of L. salmonis sensitivity towards different pesticides used for parasite control in Norwegian salmon farming, a national surveillance programme was implemented in 2013. The programme aims to summarize data {{on the use of}} different pesticides applied to control L. salmonis and to test L. salmonis sensitivity to different pesticides in farms along the Norwegian coast. Here we analyse two years of test-data from biological assays designed to detect sensitivity-levels towards the pesticides <b>azamethiphos</b> and deltamethrin, both among the most common pesticides used in bath-treatments of farmed salmon in Norway in later years. The focus of the analysis is on how different variables predict the binomial outcome of the bioassay tests, being whether L. salmonis are immobilized/die or survive pesticide exposure. We found that local kernel densities of bath treatments, along with a spatial geographic index of test-farm locations, were significant predictors of the binomial outcome of the tests. Furthermore, the probability of L. salmonis being immobilized/dead after test-exposure was reduced by odds-ratios of 0. 60 (95 % CI: 0. 42 - 0. 86) for 2014 compared to 2013 and 0. 39 (95 % CI: 0. 36 - 0. 42) for low concentration compared to high concentration exposure. There were also significant but more marginal effects of parasite gender and developmental stage, and a relatively large random effect of test-farm. We conclude that the present data support an association between local intensities of bath treatments along the coast and the outcome of bioassay tests where salmon lice are exposed to <b>azamethiphos</b> or deltamethrin. Furthermore, there is a predictable structure of L. salmonis phenotypes along the coast in the data, characterized by high susceptibility to pesticides in the far north and far south, but low susceptibility in mid Norway. The study emphasizes the need to address local susceptibility to pesticides and the need for restrictive use of pesticides to preserve treatment efficacy...|$|E
40|$|Licensed {{medicines}} {{available in}} the U. K. for treating Atlantic salmon infested with sea lice, dichlorvos, <b>azamethiphos,</b> and hydrogen peroxide, can only be administered by bath application. Adverse reactions {{have been reported to}} bath treatments including mortalities, inappetance, reduction in growth and reduced louse sensitivity to dichlorvos. The physical constraints of bath treatments are examined and improvements recommended. Oxygen saturation was adequate during treatments but declined rapidly when the tarpaulin was removed. A chemical marker dispersed uniformally both horizontally and vertically in a cage within 5 mins of dispensing indicating dispersal of a medicine is rapid and adequate during treatment. The range in enclosed volumes in 86 treatments was 46 to 146 % of theoretical, suggesting potential toxicity due to high concentrations at low volumes and the risk of reduced sensitivity at high volumes. Residual concentrations of hydrogen peroxide varied from 50 to 400 ppm from 5 to 15 mins after the tarpaulin was removed. Water exchange should be encouraged by aerating the cage and flushing at the end of treatment...|$|E
40|$|An {{international}} survey {{revealed that}} eleven compounds representing five pesticide types {{are currently being}} used on commercial salmon farms for sea lice control. These include two organophosphates (dichlorvos and azamethiphos); three pyrethrin/pyrethroid compounds (pyrethrum, cypermethrin, deltamethrin); one oxidizing agent (hydrogen peroxide); three avermectins (ivermectin, emamectin and doramectin) and two benzoylphenyl ureas (teflubenzuron and diflubenzuron). The number of compounds available in any one country is highly variable, ranging from 9 (Norway) to 6 (Chile, United Kingdom) to 4 (Ireland, Faeroes, Canada) to 2 (US)). Dichlorvos, <b>Azamethiphos</b> and cypermethrin were {{the most widely used}} compounds (5 countries) followed by, hydrogen peroxide, ivermectin and emamectin (4 countries each), teflubenzuron (3 countries), diflubenzuron (2 countries), and deltamethrin, pyrethrum and doramectin (1 country each). Although, like trichlorfon, dichlorvos use is being discontinued in several countries notably Norway and the Faeroes. In most instances the availability of sea lice chemotherapeutants is limited, many being used under extra-label veterinary prescription or exemption, and special investigation permits. Access to a broad range of compounds with different modes of action, as well as application methods, has only recently been acquired making assessment of chemotherapy, and therefore integrated pest management, difficult...|$|E
40|$|Field trials {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} visual cues on catches of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) at toxic targets impregnated with the female sex pheromone (Z) - 9 -tricosene, were conducted in a caged-layer deep-pit poultry unit in southern England. Targets treated with <b>azamethiphos</b> and baited with 2. 5 g of 40 % (Z) - 9 -tricosene impregnated beads caught significantly greater numbers of M. domestica than control targets. The greater attractiveness of the pheromone impregnated targets persisted for at least 5 weeks. The addition of longitudinal black stripes, or a regularly spaced pattern of black spots, to the white targets {{had no effect on}} catch rates. However, a pattern of clustered black spots, designed to imitate groups of feeding M. domestica, significantly increased target catches; this effect was particularly pronounced in the targets impregnated with (Z) - 9 -tricosene. Trials comparing the attractiveness of white and fluorescent yellow pheromone-treated targets under two different lighting regimes indicated that M. domestica does not have a significant preference for either colour. The implications of these results in relation to the control of M. domestica populations in poultry units are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{efforts to}} {{elucidate}} {{the mechanisms of}} chemical communication between organisms in marine environments are increasing. This study applied novel molecular technology to outline the effects of two xenobiotic drugs, deltamethrin (DM) and <b>azamethiphos</b> (AZA), on the neurotransmission system of the copepod ectoparasite Caligus rogercresseyi. Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics {{analyses were conducted to}} evaluate treatment effects on the glutamatergic synaptic pathway of the parasite, which is closely related to chemoreception and neurotransmission. After drug treatment with DM or AZA, stochastic mRNA expression patterns of glutamatergic synapse pathway components were observed. Both DM and AZA promoted a down-regulation of the glutamate-ammonia ligase, and DM activated a metabotropic glutamate receptor that is a suggested inhibitor of neurotransmission. Furthermore, the delousing drugs drove complex rearrangements in the distribution of mapped reads for specific metabotropic glutamate receptor domains. This study introduces a novel methodological approach that produces high-quality results from transcriptomic data. Using this approach, DM and AZA were found to alter the expression of numerous mRNAs tightly linked to the glutamatergic signaling pathway. These data suggest possible new targets for xenobiotic drugs that play key roles in the delousing effects of antiparasitics in sea lice...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} use of organophosphates and pyrethroids in the aquaculture industry has negatively impacted parasite sensitivity to the delousing effects of these antiparasitics, especially among sea lice species. The NOTCH signaling pathway is a positive regulator of ABC transporter subfamily C expression and {{plays a key role}} in the generation and modulation of pesticide resistance. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind pesticide resistance, partly due to the lack of genomic and molecular information on the processes involved in the resistance mechanism of sea lice. Next-generation sequencing technologies provide an opportunity for rapid and cost-effective generation of genome-scale data. The present study, through RNA-seq analysis, determined that the sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi (C. rogercresseyi) specifically responds to the delousing drugs <b>azamethiphos</b> and deltamethrin at the transcriptomic level by differentially activating mRNA of the NOTCH signaling pathway and of ABC genes. These results suggest that frequent antiparasitic application may increase the activity of inhibitory mRNA components, thereby promoting inhibitory NOTCH output and conditions for increased resistance to delousing drugs. Moreover, data analysis underscored that key functions of NOTCH/ABC components were regulated during distinct phases of the drug response, thus indicating resistance modifications in C. rogercresseyi resulting from the frequent use of organophosphates and pyrethroids...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety of}} <b>azamethiphos</b> (AZA), an organophosphorous {{insecticide}} and {{the active ingredient}} of Salmosan(,) ((R)) was evaluated in the European eel, seabass and rainbow trout. Fish were bathed in 0. 1 ppm AZA {{for a period of}} 60, 120 or 240 min. After termination of each treatment fish were transferred to clean aquaria and randomly sampled over 21 days. Compared to controls, brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was inhibited up to 44, 56 and 62 % in eels, seabass and trout, respectively, with the inhibition being significant for up to 4 days in eels and seabass and 7 days in trout. As result of the AChE depression, fish displayed motor hyperactivity and erratic jumping at the onset of treatment. Mortality was observed only in trout following exposure for 240 min. A variable correlation observed among species between the level of exposure, the reduced activity of brain AChE and the signs of toxicity suggest that brain AChE should be considered as an indicator of exposure rather than as an index of toxicity of AZA. The present data indicate that at the therapeutic dosage of 0. 1 ppm AZA for I h can be safely used in eels, seabass and trout. The extended treatment times up to 240 min were equally safe for eels and seabass but not for trout. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The published article can be found at: [URL] publisher and the author(s) have made this article open access. An increasing number of studies suggest an important role of host immunity {{as a barrier to}} tumor formation and progression. Complex mechanisms and multiple pathways are involved in evading innate and adaptive immune responses, with a broad spectrum of chemicals displaying the potential to adversely influence immunosurveillance. The evaluation of the cumulative effects of low-dose exposures from the occupational and natural environment, especially if multiple chemicals target the same gene(s) or pathway(s), is a challenge. We reviewed common environmental chemicals and discussed their potential effects on immunosurveillance. Our overarching objective was to review related signaling pathways influencing immune surveillance such as the pathways involving PI 3 K/Akt, chemokines, TGF-β, FAK, IGF- 1, HIF- 1 α, IL- 6, IL- 1 α, CTLA- 4 and PD- 1 /PDL- 1 could individually or collectively impact immunosurveillance. A number of chemicals that are common in the anthropogenic environment such as fungicides (maneb, fluoxastrobin and pyroclostrobin), herbicides (atrazine), insecticides (pyridaben and <b>azamethiphos),</b> the components of personal care products (triclosan and bisphenol A) and diethylhexylphthalate with pathways critical to tumor immunosurveillance. At this time, these chemicals are not recognized as human carcinogens; however, it is known that they these chemicals can simultaneously persist in the environment and appear to have some potential interfere with the host immune response, therefore potentially contributing to promotion interacting with of immune evasion mechanisms, and promoting subsequent tumor growth and progression...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-In {{the early}} spring Lasius niger may be a {{nuisance}} indoors. These ants often originate from nests {{right next to the}} foundation, below the house or sometimes even directly under the flo. or. The ants raise the humidity, which may result in severe damage to the woodwork, due to rot. The same applies to an even greater extent to other species: L. umbratus and L. juliginosus. The present method was developed for the evaluation of insecticidal bait formulations in the field. Special emphasis was put on maintaining the colony members ' ability to communicate mutually. The study evaluated the response of L. niger to seven bait formulations, five containing <b>azamethiphos,</b> one containing chlorpyrifos, and a reference with no insecticide. The primary interest of the experiment was to develop a method where the palatability of the bait formulations, the ability of the baits to attract L. niger, and the ants ' acceptance of the baits could be investigated. Thirty-four ant nests were used. When the number of ants on a jam bait indicated high activity, the test was initiated. A new jam bait was put into position for fifteen minutes and then replaced by the test bait for fifteen minutes. This was repeated three times. The number of ants visiting each bait was counted, and a small portion was collected by a sucking device when leaving the bait. The latter was observed for up to 24 hours to estimate the mortality. The results with the reference bait showed that the ants were only slightly affected by the method, while the palatability of the test baits ranged from as good as the controls to complete repellence. This result was confirmed by the percentage of ants killed. And both results indicate that the method could be used to establish comparable data for the efficacy of ant baits...|$|E
40|$|Imidacloprid is a {{neonicotinoid}} insecticide that {{is effective}} against house fly, Musca domestica L., {{which is a}} major pest {{with the ability to}} develop resistance to insecticides. In the present study, we investigated the inheritance mode, the cross-resistance pattern and the mechanisms of resistance to imidacloprid. A near-isogenic house fly line (N-IRS) with 78 -fold resistance to imidacloprid was used to demonstrate the mode of inheritance. The overlapping confidence limits of LC 50 values and the slopes of the log concentration-probit lines between the reciprocal F 1 and F 1 ' progenies suggest that imidacloprid resistance is inherited autosomally in the house fly. There was incomplete dominant inheritance in the F 1 and F 1 ' progenies, based on dominance values of 0. 77 and 0. 75, respectively. A monogenic inheritance model revealed that imidacloprid resistance is governed by more than one factor. Compared to the field strain (CFD), the N-IRS strain developed more cross-resistance to chlorfenapyr and no cross-resistance to chlorpyrifos and acetamiprid, but showed negative cross-resistance to beta-cypermethrin and <b>azamethiphos.</b> Three synergists, diethyl malate (DEM), s,s,s-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF), and piperonyl butoxide (PBO), showed significant synergism against to imidacloprid (4. 55 -, 4. 46 - and 3. 34 -fold respectively) in the N-IRS strain. However, both DEM and PBO had no synergism and DEF only exhibited slight synergism in the CSS strain. The activities of carboxylesterase (CarE), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P 450 in the N-IRS strain were significantly higher than in the CSS strain. But similar synergistic potential of DEF to imidacloprid between the CSS and N-IRS strain suggested that GSTs and cytochrome P 450 played much more important role than esterase for the N-IRS strain resistance to imidacloprid. These results should be helpful for developing an improved management strategy to delay the development of imidacloprid resistance in house fly...|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} plasma albumin to provide a sensitive biomarker of exposure to commonly used organophosphorus pesticides in order to complement the widely used measure of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. Rat or human plasma albumin binding by tritiated-diisopropylfluorophosphate ((3) H-DFP) was quantified by retention of albumin on glass microfibre filters. Preincubation with unlabelled pesticide in vitro or dosing of F 344 rats with pesticide in vivo resulted in a reduction in subsequent albumin radiolabelling with (3) H-DFP, the decrease in which was used to quantify pesticide binding. At pesticide exposures producing approximately 30 % inhibition of AChE, rat plasma albumin binding in vitro by <b>azamethiphos</b> (oxon), chlorfenvinphos (oxon), chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon-oxon and malaoxon was reduced from controls by 9 +/- 1 %, 67 +/- 2 %, 56 +/- 2 %, 54 +/- 2 % and 8 +/- 1 %, respectively. After 1 h of incubation with 19 microM (3) H-DFP alone, the level of binding to rat or human plasma albumins reached 0. 011 or 0. 039 moles of DFP per mole of albumin, respectively. This level of binding could be further increased by raising the concentration of (3) H-DFP, increasing the (3) H-DFP incubation time, or by substitution of commercial albumins for native albumin. Pesticide binding to albumin was presumed covalent since it survived 24 h dialysis. After dosing rats with pirimiphos-methyl (dimethoxy) or chlorfenvinphos (oxon) (diethoxy) pesticides, the resultant albumin binding were still significant 7 days after dosing. As in vitro, dosing of rats with malathion {{did not result in}} significant albumin binding in vivo. Our results suggest albumin may be a useful additional biomonitor for moderately low-level exposures to several widely used pesticides, and that this binding differs markedly between pesticides...|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} farming of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, typically {{requires the}} periodic application of copper-based anti-foulants and chemotherapeutic treatments, including Slice®, Excis®, Salmosan® and Aquatet®/Tetraplex® {{to reduce the}} effects of biological pests. Information on the environmental safety of any chemical agent released into the aquatic environment must be obtained before a product can be licensed for use, but such information typically exists only in confidential technical reports which {{can be difficult to}} obtain. Furthermore, different test organisms, experimental protocols and reporting procedures make comparison of the various compounds/studies difficult. Here we present a series of 10 -day, whole sediment bioassay tests that determined the concentrations of emamectin benzoate (EB), cypermethrin (CP), <b>azamethiphos</b> (AZ) and oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC), the active ingredients of the aforementioned chemotherapeutants, and copper, that caused 50 % mortality (LC 50) in the non-target benthic crustacean, Corophium volutator. Additional whole sediment bioassays of identical design were conducted with the non-target polychaete worm, Hediste diversicolor exposed to copper and EB. C. volutator demonstrated similar sensitivity to EB and AZ, with LC 50 s of 153 (95 % confidence intervals, CI = 119 – 198) and 182 (95 % CI = 152 – 217) µg active ingredient [kg wet sediment]− 1 respectively. OTC caused 50 % mortality of C. volutator at a concentration of 414 (95 % CI = 233 – 734) µg OTC [kg wet sediment]− 1. The LC 50 for H. diversicolor exposed to EB was 1368 (95 % CI = 744 – 2516) µg EB [kg wet sediment]− 1, an order of magnitude greater than that for C. volutator. Conversely, C. volutator was able to tolerate much higher concentrations of copper than H. diversicolor, with LC 50 s of 193, 326 (95 % CI = 171, 034 – 218, 523) and 74, 988 (95 % CI = 61, 192 – 91, 895) µg Cu [kg wet sediment]− 1 respectively. CP was the most toxic to C. volutator of all compounds investigated, causing 50 % mortality at a concentration of 5 (95 % CI = 4 – 6) µg CP [kg wet sediment]− 1.

40|$|To {{address the}} {{potential}} role of cholinesterase enzymes in the invasive capacity of species, {{the present study}} investigated ChE activity in the invasive freshwater bivalve Anodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834) comparing it with that of the indigenous species, Anodonta sp. (Linnaeus, 1758). The invasive capacity of pests has often been linked to their ecological plasticity and high intrinsic genetic variability; however the role played by molecular and cellular mechanisms, generally known as an organism's response to pollution, is unclear. Different substrates and selective ChE enzyme inhibitors were investigated in digestive gland, foot, gonad, adductor muscle and gill tissues while sensitivity to four organophosphate (OP) insecticides was investigated in vitro only in adductor muscle. The invasive species (A. woodiana) showed significantly greater (at least one order of magnitude) ChE activity than the endemic species (Anodonta sp.) (pb 0. 05) using acetylthiocholine (ASCh) as substrate and the activity was more widely distributed in tissues involved in movement (adductor muscle and foot), respiration, feeding (gills) and reproduction (gonads). Moreover, only the invasive species, A. woodiana, showed detectable ChE (vs. ASCh) activity in gill tissue. No substrate specificity was observed in any tissue of either species as already described for other bivalve species. ChE activity was not inhibited by Iso-OMPA but showed high sensitivity to BW 248 c 51 and eserine. Both species showed moderate to low sensitivities in vitro to OP insecticides in the range 10 − 7 – 10 − 2 M. Calculated IC 50 for fenitrothion and chlorpyrifos was in the range 10 − 6 – 10 − 3 M in muscle of A. woodiana while a higher inhibition was observed for fenitrothion (10 − 7 M) and lower for chlorpyrifos (10 − 2 M) in the indigenous species Anodonta sp. Similar IC 50 of 10 − 5 – 10 − 6 M were observed for DFP and <b>azamethiphos</b> in both species. The hypotheses of other authors that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is involved in the control of many essential functions, such as frontal ciliary activity of gill epithelium, temperature resistance, ciliary activity for transport of suspended particulate, valve opening and embryo development, suggest that the high catalytic efficiency of the invasive species may endow it with a competitive advantage over the endemic species. In view of the peculiar reproductive strategy of these mussels, higher ChE vs. ASCh activity in gonads of the invasive species could also favour glochidium production and embryo development under a wider range of environmental conditions...|$|E
