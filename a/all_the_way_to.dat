5|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1954, when the Independent Subway System (IND) started operating D trains on the Culver Line. At the time, the tracks had lettered names (i.e. Track A, Track B, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Track H {{from east to}} west). However, the IND also used lettered designations for its routes (i.e. A, B, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> H as well). The BMT had used numbered route designations up to this point, so this {{had not been a}} problem. However, the D route was now using the Culver Line, which departed from tracks E and F. To avoid confusion, the tracks were renamed with numbered designations, which they still carry.|$|E

When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the heavy s-block elements, {{including}} strontium, a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger.|$|E
