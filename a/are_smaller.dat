5|$|The {{first product}} {{release of the}} MX series was the MX960, a 14-slot, 480 Gbit/s switch and router. In late 2006, Juniper {{introduced}} the MX240 and MX480, which <b>are</b> <b>smaller</b> versions of the 960. They had a throughput of 240 Gbit/s and 480 Gbit/s respectively.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, {{with a pair}} or small group of birds maintaining and defending a territory year-round.

5|$|The spores <b>are</b> <b>smaller</b> {{than the}} typical variety, usually 39–42 by 1.5–2µm; the paraphyses are irregularly {{branched}} on the upper portion. Fruit bodies in this variety are club-shaped and flattened compared to the typical tongue-shape of the typical variety.|$|E
5|$|The {{three major}} {{producers}} of strontium as celestine as of 2015 are China (150,000t), Spain (90,000t), and Mexico (70,000t); Argentina (10,000t) and Morocco (2,500t) <b>are</b> <b>smaller</b> producers.

5|$|The two Crex crakes are {{unlikely}} to be confused with other rails, since most sympatric short-billed rails <b>are</b> <b>smaller,</b> with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills.

50|$|Eurycoma <b>is</b> a <b>small</b> genus {{of three}} or four species of {{flowering}} plants in the family Simaroubaceae, native to tropical southeastern Asia.

5|$|As an {{independent}} company, Obsidian believes {{that they must}} act and react quickly to market changes and not stagnate on any certain point. While the core focus of Obsidian was still developing character-driven role-playing games, the team were willing to try out projects that <b>are</b> <b>smaller</b> and are in different genres. The decision to develop Armored Warfare is one result of this strategy.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males <b>are</b> <b>smaller,</b> they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E

5|$|Banksia cuneata is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its brighter flowers and duller leaves. It further differs from B.ilicifolia in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes. The leaves, flowers and fruit of B.oligantha <b>are</b> <b>smaller</b> still, and its foliage is not as prickly as that of B.cuneata.|$|E

A {{number of}} large parks lie outside the city centre, {{including}} Hampstead Heath and the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the south-east and Bushy Park and Richmond Park (the largest) to the south-west, Hampton Court Park is also a royal park, but, because it contains a palace, it {{is administered by the}} Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks.|$|E
5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production {{rate of the}} comet was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), which may have made the inner coma optically thick.
