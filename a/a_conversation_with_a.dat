5|$|Although Finn {{has chosen}} {{to stay on the}} {{football}} team, all the other dual members instead quit to remain in the glee club. Ken reverses his ultimatum after <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dismayed Finn and cancels the extra practice, allowing the football players to again do both activities. Meanwhile, Will and Emma spend more time together while Will prepares the mash-up, and soon realize they have strong feelings for one another. Will decides to remove himself from the equation and later tells Emma and Ken that he {{will not be able to}} create their mash-up.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Liz Friedlander and debuted on MTV's Total Request Live on March 7, 2000. It consists of performance footage of the trio in a warehouse {{in front of a}} wall decorated with photographs. In between verses, the photos' origins are explored through the different perspectives of individuals near the band. As the band prepares to play a show, a man has <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl and is subsequently left alone. In another, while DeLonge and Hoppus read magazines inside a late-night convenience store, a melancholy woman attempts to make a call via a pay phone. Other montages show the trio in the company of friends and practicing, a man looking out upon the sea, and a solitary man deserted by others at an outdoor restaurant. The final montage consists of personal photos from the band's past.|$|E
25|$|Piaget {{recognized}} that psychometric tests had its limitations, as {{children were not}} able to provide the researcher with their deepest thoughts and inner intellect. It was also difficult to know if the results of child examination reflected what children believed or if it is just a pretend situation. For example, {{it is very difficult to}} know with certainty if a child who has <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending.|$|E

25|$|Homer and Bart use {{fireworks}} {{to accomplish}} things Marge has {{told them to}} do: fix a stuck shelf, demolishing Santa's Little Helper's doghouse (while promising him another one would be built by January 2007), and attempting to fix Lisa's VCR, but end up destroying her room with fireworks instead. To {{make it up to}} her, the family spends a day at the Springfield Festival of Books. There, they encounter famous authors such as Stephen King, Tom Wolfe, John Updike, and Amy Tan. While waiting in line for an autograph from Krusty, Bart strikes up <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl named Sophie.

25|$|Sex {{education}} may be taught informally, {{such as when}} someone receives information from <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> parent, friend, religious leader, or through the media. It may also be delivered through sex self-help authors, magazine advice columnists, sex columnists, or sex education web sites. Formal sex education occurs when schools or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person {{what he or she}} should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others. Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{a similar}} case, {{in that it}} {{involved}} an assistant district attorney in a large city challenging a nationally known superior over a job action, came before the Court. In Garcetti v. Ceballos, a Los Angeles County prosecutor claimed the office of Gil Garcetti had retaliated against him {{with a series of}} adverse personnel moves after he questioned the veracity of a search warrant affidavit following <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> defense attorney, to the point of testifying to them in a hearing. It was initially argued with O'Connor's seat vacant following her retirement, and the justices deadlocked. Following the appointment of Samuel Alito, it was reargued and he cast the deciding vote to reverse the Ninth Circuit and find that Ceballos had not been unduly deprived of his First Amendment rights.|$|E

25|$|Turing’s machine, {{which he}} names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot {{determine}} the Enigma settings before the Germans reset the Enigma encryption each day. Denniston orders it destroyed and Turing fired, {{but the other}} cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> female clerk about messages she receives, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate; however, Turing realises they cannot act on every decoded message or the Germans will realise Enigma has been broken.|$|E
25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; {{they were his}} own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets {{for a piece of}} evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E
25|$|Two other Italians wrote rather {{different}} works that centre on the animal within the human. One was Niccolò Machiavelli in his unfinished long poem, L'asino d'oro (The golden ass, 1516). The author meets a beautiful herdswoman surrounded by Circe’s herd of beasts. After spending {{a night of}} love with him, she explains {{the characteristics of the}} animals in her charge: the lions are the brave, the bears are the violent, the wolves are those forever dissatisfied, and so on (Canto 6). In Canto 7 he is introduced to those who experience frustration: a cat that has allowed its prey to escape; an agitated dragon; a fox constantly on the look-out for traps; a dog that bays the moon; Aesop’s lion in love that allowed himself to be deprived of his teeth and claws. There are also emblematic satirical portraits of various Florentine personalities. In the eighth and last canto he has <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pig that, like the Gryllus of Plutarch, {{does not want to be}} changed back and condemns human greed, cruelty and conceit.|$|E

25|$|In July 1894, Holmes {{was arrested}} and briefly incarcerated for the first time, on the charge of selling mortgaged goods in St. Louis, Missouri. He was {{promptly}} bailed out, but while in jail he struck up <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> convicted outlaw named Marion Hedgepeth, who was serving a 25-year sentence. Holmes had concocted a plan to swindle an insurance company out of $10,000 by taking out a policy on himself and then faking his death. Holmes promised Hedgepeth a $500 commission {{in exchange for the}} name of a lawyer who could be trusted. Holmes was directed to a young St. Louis attorney named Jeptha Howe. Howe was in practice with his older brother, Alphonso Howe, who had no involvement with Holmes or Pitezel or their fraudulent activities. Jeptha Howe, however, found Holmes' scheme brilliant. Nevertheless, Holmes' plan to fake his own death failed when the insurance company became suspicious and refused to pay. Holmes did not press the claim; instead, he concocted a similar plan with Pitezel.|$|E
500|$|He {{noted that}} [...] "thinking" [...] is {{difficult}} to define and devised his famous Turing Test. If a machine could {{carry on a conversation}} (over a teleprinter) that was indistinguishable from <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> human being, then it was reasonable to say that the machine was [...] "thinking". This simplified version of the problem allowed Turing to argue convincingly that a [...] "thinking machine" [...] was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition. The Turing Test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Chief lyric writer Rhys {{has stated}} that, whereas he might [...] "empty parts of [...] {{emotional}} state" [...] into some songs, Ice Hockey Hair's title track {{was written in}} the [...] "instant pop music" [...] tradition. The track was originally called [...] "Naff Gan" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "The Naff Song") as the band felt it [...] "had so many naff, cheesy things about it" [...] before being renamed [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] following <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Swedish football player who said that having 'ice hockey hair', an alternative name for the mullet hairstyle, was a really naff thing to do in his home country. Rhys has described the song as a [...] "Badfinger-style power ballad" [...] and claimed that it is about [...] "someone who's sunk so low they're asking advice off a woman with ice hockey hair". The track was recorded at Orinonco Studios, London.|$|E

500|$|Barlow {{dissected}} the Anarchist League and [...] "the contradictory {{nature of}} their organization" [...] which patrolled a [...] "poor and dirty" [...] world, and juxtaposed this with the [...] "opulent organization of the (state)". In particular, he highlighted dialogue by the robot master, Bors, as illustrating the importance of his leadership {{to the success of}} the micro-state. In the story, <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mechanic leads the robot to state, [...] "You know I'm the only one who can keep all this together. I'm the only one who knows how to maintain a planned society, not a disorderly chaos! If it weren't for me, all this would collapse, and you'd have dust and ruins and weeds. The whole outside would come rushing in to take over!" [...] Barlow concluded that while the story ended in triumph for the anarchists, the story did not go so far as to validate their society. [...] "Dick does not vindicate them," [...] writes Barlow, [...] "keeping it clear that the robot had certainly accomplished something in that valley, though it had eventually gone too far." ...|$|E
500|$|Life Begins was {{inspired}} by Bullen's re-evaluation {{of the lives of}} people around him as they approached 40 years old. During <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend he realised that three women he knew had had failed marriages {{by the time they reached}} 40. The series was designed as a vehicle for actress Sarah Lancashire, who had signed an exclusive [...] "golden handcuffs" [...] deal with ITV. Two months after the series was announced, Lancashire left Life Begins, feeling unable to commit to a potentially long-running series. ITV replaced Lancashire with Caroline Quentin. Life Begins concerns Maggie Mee, who believes she is in a loving relationship with her husband Phil (Alexander Armstrong). When Phil announces on a family holiday that he is leaving her, she realises that she must begin her life again. Bullen wrote the series with John Forte. The first series was broadcast in 2004. As with Cold Feet, he integrated events from his own life into the storylines; Maggie's father suffers from Alzheimer's disease as does one of Bullen's own relatives. He researched Maggie's travel agency job by spending a week at a travel agents' in Bristol.|$|E
500|$|After {{their mother}} Paula (Maeve Quinlan) {{takes on a}} new job, the Carlin family moves {{from a small town}} in Ohio to Los Angeles, California. The three Carlin {{siblings}} start at King High School, where they each try to fit in. Glen (Chris Hunter), a talented basketball player, tries out for the school basketball team, upsetting the star player Aiden Dennison (Matt Cohen) and his cheerleader girlfriend Madison Duarte (Valery Ortiz). Tensions between Glen and Aiden escalate into a locker room fight over Aiden's ex-girlfriend Ashley Davies (Mandy Musgrave), and Glen takes the spotlight in his first game, leaving Aiden on the bench. Glen's sister Spencer (Gabrielle Christian) joins the cheerleading squad but ends up doing little more than take orders from Madison. She befriends the rebellious Ashley, but when Ashley indicates her interest in girls, Spencer starts to avoid her, only to admit later that she enjoyed their time spent together. That night, though, she dreams of being taunted by the cheerleaders and called gay, although she denies it. Glen and Spencer's adopted African American brother Clay (Danso Gordon) is smart but naïve, and he finds himself facing the racial tensions of LA that he never experienced in Ohio. After Clay strikes up <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl named Chelsea Lewis (Aasha Davis), he is beaten up by her ex-boyfriend Dallas (Marcus Brown) when Clay tries to defend her. He then earns the respect of Sean Miller (Austen Parros), who is cynical about the way African Americans are treated in society, and when they go driving they are pulled over by the police for [...] "driving while black".|$|E
