5|$|Achaea {{was now in}} turmoil, {{and some}} cities were close to revolt; many {{residents}} were angered at Aratus' decision to invite the Macedonians into the Peloponnese. Some also hoped that Cleomenes would introduce constitutional changes in their cities. Encouraged by this development, Cleomenes invaded Achaea and seized the cities of Pellene, Pheneus and Penteleium, effectively splitting the Achaean League in half. The Achaeans, concerned <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> treachery in Corinth and Sicyon, dispatched their mercenaries to garrison the cities {{and then went to}} Argos to celebrate the Nemean Games.|$|E
5|$|After {{developer}} MachineGames was founded, {{the employees}} all began brainstorming ideas, and pitching them to publishers. In June 2009, MachineGames owner ZeniMax Media acquired id Software {{and all of}} its property, including Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein. Bethesda Softworks, who had previously declined a pitch from MachineGames, suggested that they develop a new game from a franchise acquired by ZeniMax. MachineGames inquired <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> a new game in the Wolfenstein series; the studio visited id Software, who approved of MachineGames' request for a new Wolfenstein game. By November 2010, paperwork was signed, allowing MachineGames to develop Wolfenstein: The New Order. Preliminary development lasted approximately three years.|$|E

40|$|The aspect-oriented {{programming}} approach claims {{to make it}} easier to reason <b>about,</b> <b>develop,</b> and maintain certain kinds of application code while maintaining highly efficient code. To better understand the usefulness and usability of the aspect-oriented approach, we have been conducting a series of experiments. These experiments are designed to investigate such characteristics of aspect-oriented development as the creation and ease of debugging programs built in this style. This paper provides an overview of the experiments we have conducted to date. 1 Introduction Aspect-oriented programming[1] is in its infancy. The approach claims {{to make it easier}} to reason <b>about,</b> <b>develop</b> and maintain certain kinds of application code while maintaining highly efficient code. To better understand the usefulness and usability of the aspect-oriented approach, we are currently conducting three "experiments" 1 : one to investigate the ease of creating aspect-oriented programs, another to inv [...] ...|$|R

Piers Wenger {{referred to them}} as four extra episodes in the series and everything included {{was part of the}} Doctor Who universe. The game was developed by Charles Cecil and Sheffield-based game company Sumo, while the games were written by Phil Ford and James Moran and overseen by Moffat and the producers of the show. Cecil was contacted by BBC Wales Editor of Interactive Iain Tweedale, who asked him <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> a Doctor Who game. Smith and Gillan's movements and actions were captured by rotoscoping.|$|E
5|$|Though an {{absentee}} landlord, Leicester, who {{was also}} Baron of Denbigh, regarded the lordship {{as an integral part}} of a territorial base for a revived House of Dudley. He set <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> the town of Denbigh with large building projects; the church he planned, though, was never finished, being too ambitious. It would not only have been the largest, but also the first post-Reformation church in England and Wales built according to a plan where the preacher was to take the centre instead of the altar, thus stressing the importance of preaching in the Protestant Church. In vain Leicester tried to have the nearby episcopal see of St. Asaph transferred to Denbigh. He also encouraged and supported the translation of the Bible and the Common Prayer Book into Welsh.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, Wallenstein is more <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> territories rather than conquering them. However, it can {{certainly}} {{be beneficial to}} take another player's territory after they have already spent resources to develop it. Because of the reliability of receiving victory points from buildings and the uncertainties of battles due to the cube tower, most players tend to avoid conflict {{in the first year}} in order to amass larger armies for the second year.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} on 24 May 2011 that ITV was {{in discussions with}} ITV Studios <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> an adaptation of Lindy Woodhead's biography Shopping, Seduction & Mr Selfridge. Andrew Davies was confirmed {{to be working on}} the script. Beginning in London in 1908, during a time period when women were enjoying an ever-increasing amount of freedom, it tells the story of Harry Gordon Selfridge, the founder of Selfridges department store and includes members of his family, particularly his wife Rose Selfridge.|$|E
25|$|Like the Germans, the Soviets were {{influenced}} by experience showing most combat happens within 400 meters and that their soldiers were consistently outgunned by heavily armed German troops, especially those armed with the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifles. On July 15, 1943, a Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the People's Commissariat of Arms of the USSR. The Soviets were so impressed with the Sturmgewehr, that they immediately set <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> an intermediate caliber automatic rifle of their own, to replace the badly outdated Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifles and PPSh-41 submachine guns that armed most of the Soviet Army.|$|E

25|$|On 14 September, Johnsson {{posted a}} {{statement}} on the band's website <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> a rock metal opera, and that the band will not be doing any major tours or releasing studio albums. According to this, in 2013 the band was to play only at three minor summer festivals in Europe. In April 2013 this statement was reconsidered by Johnsson itself, and the Rock Opera Unveiled Tour was scheduled for December 2013 with 15 European gigs, to test the fans' acceptance of the new material. The main framework of these shows didn't only include excerpts from the future rock opera, but also the entire Vovin album due to its 15th anniversary.|$|E
25|$|After falling at {{the final}} hurdle {{two years in a}} row, the Wildcats went <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> a new look squad and style that would seriously {{challenge}} for a sixth NBL title in 2013/14. The 2013 off-season saw the departure of Rob Beveridge (coach), Kevin Lisch (shooting guard) and Cameron Tovey (small forward). As a result, the Wildcats appointed Trevor Gleeson as head coach, and signed two new imports in small forward James Ennis and shooting guard Jermaine Beal. The trio joined the team with the core group of players—new captain Damian Martin, Shawn Redhage, Jesse Wagstaff, Matthew Knight and Greg Hire—still intact. Further additions to Gleeson's new squad included centre Tom Jervis and guards Drake U'u and Erik Burdon.|$|E
25|$|WHP {{was first}} {{established}} in 2008 and immediately set <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> a new flywheel energy-recovery {{system for the}} Williams F1 Team after the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) into Formula One for the 2009 season. While other teams were pouring their efforts into electric battery systems, Williams F1 opted {{to go down the}} flywheel route because of a strong belief in the technology's wider applications. While it was never raced in Formula One due to technical changes, WHP has since seen its technology adapted for a range of applications. For example, the Audi R18 hybrid car that won the 2012 Le Mans 24 Hours used a WHP flywheel. WHP has also seen its flywheel technology introduced into a series of buses as part of a deal with the Go-Ahead Group, one of the UK's biggest transport operators. In April 2014, Williams Hybrid Power was sold to GKN.|$|E

25|$|Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) {{achieved}} significant {{advances in}} techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved laryngoscope blade in 1943. The Macintosh blade remains {{to this day}} {{the most widely used}} laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation. In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a gum elastic urinary catheter as an endotracheal tube introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation. Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Bros. & Walsh, Ltd.) set <b>about</b> <b>developing</b> an endotracheal tube introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and {{what became known as the}} Eschmann endotracheal tube introducer went into production later that year. The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from polyester threads and an outer resin layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was , which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35° curved tip, permitting it to be steered around obstacles.|$|E
