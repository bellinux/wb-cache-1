5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though a button on the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with <b>audible</b> <b>warnings,</b> sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|R
25|$|Warning {{indicators}} are provided whenever {{there is a}} reduction in permissible speed of a third or more, and are placed at the service braking distance {{from the start of}} the lower speed. There is also an AWS magnet placed before the indicator to give an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> to the train driver. Colloquially known as 'Morpeth boards', after the 1969 derailment at Morpeth, Northumberland that led to their introduction.|$|E
500|$|The automaker {{conducted}} a test {{with a group}} of the visually challenged at Milford Proving Grounds in order to evaluate the <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> systems on the Volt when a pedestrian is in the car's proximity. The system uses the car's horn to emit a series of warning chirps, like a low tone of a horn, enough to provide an alert but not to startle. According to GM engineers, the biggest challenge is [...] "developing an active system that can distinguish a pedestrian from another vehicle"; otherwise, the sound will go off frequently, producing noise pollution instead.|$|E
500|$|The 1993 VR Commodore {{represented}} a major facelift {{of the second}} generation architecture leaving only the doors and roof untouched. Approximately 80percent of car was new {{in comparison to the}} preceding model. Exterior changes brought an overall smoother body, semicircular wheel arches and the [...] "twin-kidney" [...] grille—a Commodore styling trait which remained until the VY model of 2002 and remains a permanent staple on the HSV variants to this day. The rear-end treatment saw raised tail lights, implemented for safety reasons, and a driver's side airbag was introduced as an option: a first for an Australian-built car. Other safety features such as anti-lock brakes and independent rear suspension were only available with the new electronic GM 4L60-E automatic transmission. Along with a driver's airbag and cruise control, these features were packaged into a new Acclaim specification level: a family-oriented safety spec above the entry-level Executive. Holden's strong focus on safety {{can be seen in the}} Used Car Safety Ratings. The findings show that in an accident, VN/VP Commodores provide a [...] "worse than average" [...] level of occupant protection. However, the updated VR/VS models were found to provide a [...] "better than average" [...] level of safety protection. Holden issued a Series II revision in September 1994 bringing <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> chimes for the handbrake and fuel level among other changes.|$|E

2500|$|A train horn is a {{powerful}} air horn that serves as an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> device on electric and Diesel locomotives. [...] The horn's primary purpose is to alert persons and animals to an oncoming train, especially when approaching a grade crossing. The horn is also used for acknowledging signals given by railroad employees, such as during switching operations.|$|E
2500|$|Near railway lines, {{on which}} [...] "fog working" [...] was implemented, loud explosions {{similar to the}} report of a shotgun were a common feature. The explosions were made by [...] "detonators" [...] – a form of large {{percussion}} cap placed on the track and activated by the wheels of trains. These devices were placed by certain signals to provide an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> to match the visual indication provided by the signal for the driver.|$|E
5000|$|... "Mind the gap" [...] <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> are {{prominently}} {{played on}} the Central line platforms at Bank, the Northern line northbound platform at Embankment, and the Bakerloo line platforms at Piccadilly Circus. There are markings on the platform edge which usually line up with the doors on the cars.|$|R
25|$|Traffic police cars, {{known in}} the UK as Road Policing Units, are cars {{designed}} {{for the job of}} enforcing traffic laws, and as such usually have the highest performance of any of the police vehicles, as they must be capable of catching most other vehicles on the road. They may be fitted with special bumpers designed to force vehicles off the road, and may have visual and <b>audible</b> <b>warnings,</b> with special <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> which can be heard from a greater distance. In some police forces, the term traffic car may refer to cars specifically equipped for traffic control in addition to enforcing traffic laws. As such, these cars may differ only slightly from a patrol car, including having radar and laser speed detection equipment, traffic cones, flares, and traffic control signs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, most appliances are also fitted with <b>audible</b> <b>warnings,</b> sometimes known as sirens, which can alert {{people to the}} presence of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen. The first <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> were mechanical bells, mounted on the front or roof of the truck. Most vehicles are now fitted with electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different sounds. Fire service driving training often includes the use of different sounds depending on traffic conditions and maneuver being performed. For instance, on a clear road, approaching a junction, the [...] "wail" [...] setting may be used, which gives a long up and down variation, with an unbroken tone, whereas, in heavy slow traffic, a [...] "yelp" [...] setting may be preferred, which is like a wail, but faster.|$|R
2500|$|In Hungary, level {{crossings}} mostly {{do not have}} audible tones, and some also do not have lights. Full barriers usually don't have lights, but have an <b>audible</b> <b>warning.</b> Crossings equipped with lights are common. The newest, and best solution is [...] a crossing equipped with half-barriers and LED-lights. A unique type of {{level crossings}} in Hungary have a sign saying [...] "10 percen túl is zárva tartható" [...] (can be kept closed for more than 10 minutes).|$|E
2500|$|After the new {{sounds were}} publicized, the U.S. National Federation of the Blind commented that [...] "while it {{was pleased that}} the alert existed, it was unhappy that the driver could turn it off." [...] The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound {{had to be removed}} for cars delivered in the UK, as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., and the Leaf's <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> system does not allow for such temporary deactivation.|$|E
2500|$|While {{on final}} {{approach}} for landing, the aircraft was about 2,000ft (610m) above ground, when the left-hand (captain's) radio altimeter suddenly changed from [...] to read [...] altitude, although the right-hand (co-pilot's) radio altimeter functioned correctly. The voice recording {{showed that the}} crew was given an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> signal ("TOO LOW!, GEAR!") that indicated that the aircraft's landing gear should be down, as the aircraft was, according to the radio altimeter, flying too low. Later, the safety board's preliminary report modified this analysis, indicating that the flight data recorder history of the captain's radio altimeter showed 8191 feet (the maximum possible recorded) until the aircraft descended through 1950, then suddenly showed negative 8 feet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{car that}} replaces walking for the 'beat' police officer. [...] Their primary {{function}} is to convey normal police officers between their duties (such as taking statements or visiting warnings). Patrol cars are also {{able to respond to}} emergencies, and as such are normally fitted with visual and <b>audible</b> <b>warnings.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{speakers}} {{for modern}} sirens can be {{integral to the}} lightbar, {{or they may be}} hidden in or flush to the grill to reduce noise inside the ambulance that may interfere with patient care and radio communications. Ambulances can additionally be fitted with airhorn <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> to augment the effectiveness of the siren system.|$|R
50|$|The {{stability}} of a crib {{is affected by}} a variety of factors: the material used (often a soft wood which gives <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> before failure), the number of contact points between the crib and the supported surface, the ratio of the footprint of the crib to its height, and the area of contact made between the crib and the ground and supported surface.|$|R
2500|$|The Terrain Awareness Warning System (abbreviated TAWS, {{although}} more correctly {{referred to as}} an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System or EGPWS) fired its first <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> [...] "terrain ahead!" [...] at 10:40:06. This was because the Smolensk airport, as a former military airfield not open to international flights, {{was not in the}} system's database and therefore the system did not recognize that the airplane was approaching an airport. Six seconds later, someone (most likely the captain or navigator) pressed a button on the captain's FMS panel commanding standard barometric pressure be set on the captain's main electronic altimeter. This had the effect of increasing the altimeter's reading by as the TAWS takes readings from this particular altimeter, this had the additional effect of silencing the warning. The captain's secondary (mechanical) and the copilot's main electronic pressure altimeters continued to read correctly. As the descent continued, the crew realized they had started descent too late. To compensate for this, they increased their vertical speed to , twice the prescribed rate for a normal approach. The aircraft did not have enough drag to maintain speed with this rate of descent, so even though the autothrottles commanded idle power from the engines, the speed of the aircraft increased to approximately [...] higher than specified.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, most police cars are also fitted with <b>audible</b> <b>warnings,</b> sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen. The first <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the car. A later development was the rotating air siren, which made noise when air moved past it. Most modern vehicles are now fitted with electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different noises. Police driving training often includes the use of different noises depending on traffic conditions and maneuver being performed. In North America for instance, on a clear road, approaching a junction, the [...] "wail" [...] setting may be used, which gives a long up and down variation, with an unbroken tone, whereas, in heavy slow traffic, a [...] "yelp" [...] setting may be preferred, which is a sped up version of the [...] "wail". Some vehicles may also be fitted with airhorn <b>audible</b> <b>warnings.</b> Also in some European countries, where a hi-lo two tone siren is the only permitted siren for emergency vehicles, a [...] "stadt" [...] siren will be used in cities where it has loud echo that can be heard from blocks away to warn the traffic an emergency vehicle is coming, or a [...] "land" [...] siren will be used on highways to project its noise to the front to produce more penetration into the vehicles ahead to alert the drivers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{speakers}} {{for modern}} sirens can {{be located in}} several places on the vehicle, including being integral to the lightbar, or hidden in the grille. Some vehicles may also be fitted with airhorn <b>audible</b> <b>warnings.</b> The [...] "acoustic" [...] or [...] "air" [...] traditional sirens are still in wide use, most notably on North American-type fire apparatus but other countries such as Japan have fitted their apparatus with these types of warning systems as well, as its overtones help the public [...] "locate" [...] and avoid the fire truck—the newer electronic signals disperse almost pure electronic sine wave tones, which are hard to locate, especially in city [...] "canyons" [...] of buildings. Furthermore, [...] "air" [...] sirens are generally much, much louder. In Chile, many vehicles are fitted with three types of <b>audible</b> <b>warnings,</b> which are sounded all at once: the classic [...] "air" [...] siren, the electronic [...] "yelp", and the European two-tone air horns (sometimes newer vehicles are fitted with the electronic version of the latter, commonly called [...] "Hi-Lo").|$|R

5000|$|A {{stall warning}} is an {{electronic}} or mechanical device that sounds an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain {{some form of}} this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a stall warning horn, which consists of either a pressure sensor or a movable metal tab that actuates a switch, and produces an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> in response.|$|E
50|$|All {{vehicles}} {{must also}} be equipped with an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> system (siren) which meets specified standards for both sound pattern and volume.|$|E
50|$|Kia Motors {{offered the}} 2011 Cadenza premium sedan with an {{optional}} Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) in limited markets. This system uses a flashing dashboard icon and emits an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> when a white lane marking is being crossed, and emits a louder <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> when a yellow-line marking is crossed. This system is canceled when a turn signal is operating, or by pressing a deactivation {{switch on the}} dashboard; it works by using an optical sensor {{on both sides of}} the car.|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{system of}} portable illuminated signs, electronic monitoring equipment, and radio-communication equipment for preventing (or taking corrective action in response to) improper entry of aircraft, pedestrians, or ground vehicles onto active airport runways is described. The main overall {{functions of the}} proposed system would be to automatically monitor aircraft ground traffic on or approaching runways and to generate visible and/or <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> to affected pilots, ground-vehicle drivers, and control-tower personnel when runway incursions take place...|$|R
50|$|The NG900 {{introduced}} the Saab Information Display, or SID (available on S or SE models only), {{which gave the}} driver real-time information while driving, such as fuel efficiency and outside temperature. Base specification cars had a digital clock {{in place of the}} SID and a non-digital instrument panel with a mechanical odometer (as opposed to the digital odometer on higher spec models). The SID also controls other vehicle components, including but not limited to <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> for turn signals and the vehicle's horn.|$|R
