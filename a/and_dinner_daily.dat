40|$|Background: Warfarin is an {{effective}} oral anticoagulant which exert its effect by blocking the utilization of vitamin K. Warfarin therapy requires ongoing monitoring using the international normalized ratio (INR). In this study, effect of modest increase in vitamin K intake from vegetables on INR values was evaluated in warfarin treated patients. Methods: A single-center study involving 24 outpatients (mean age, 62 years) with two last INR in therapeutic range in which INR variations was less than 0. 5. Patients were selected based on their VKORC 1 1639 G→A polymorphism so that 8 patients from each of GG, AA or GA genotypes were recruited. Patients were asked to consume a vegetable mix (including lettuce, peeled cucumber and tomato) containing approximately 100 µg vitamin K (divided in two meals, lunch <b>and</b> <b>dinner)</b> <b>daily</b> for one week when INR response was measured. Results: Daily consumption of vegetable mix decreased patient’s INR from 2. 43 ± 0. 51 to 2. 08 ± 0. 46 (P< 0. 001). INR value had {{a significant decrease in}} each VKORC 1 genotypes (from 2. 55 ± 0. 55 to 2. 21 ± 0. 54 in GG, 2. 35 ± 0. 33 to 2. 00 ± 0. 25 in AA, and   2. 39 ± 0. 65 to 2. 00 ± 0. 25 in GA) but the values did not differ between genotypes. Conclusions: Daily increase in vegetable salad containing approximately 100 µg, decreased INR of patients. Therefore, avoiding variation in consumption of foods with even moderate content of vitamin K could help to prevent INR fluctuations in warfarin treated patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: The insulin action {{profiles}} of subcutaneously injected short acting insulin analogues are still slow compared to physiologically released human insulin. Thus, postprandial glucose excursions cannot be avoided. InsuPad {{is a medical}} device designed to accelerate insulin delivery rate by applying local heat at the insulin injection site. Whenever an insulin injection is given, the skin surface temperature is heated up locally to 38. 5 C° for 30 minutes. This pilot-study examines {{the impact of the}} InsuPad use on postprandial glucose excursions after breakfast <b>and</b> <b>dinner</b> in <b>daily</b> life conditions. Materials and methods: Insulin resistant diabetic patients were instructed to use the InsuPad when injecting bolus insulin prior to breakfast <b>and</b> <b>dinner</b> for one month and to measure their blood glucose at least five times per day (pre- and post-breakfast, pre-lunch and pre- and post-dinner). In the other study phase patients were instructed to maintain the same blood glucose measurement schedule for one month, without using the InsuPad. The order of the study phases was randomized. All blood glucose data were transmitted to a central computer using the DIASEND System. A valid pre-post-prandial measurement time difference was 75 - 135 minutes. An ANOVA, controlling for order of study phase, patient and meal (breakfast vs. dinner) was used to analyze the effect of the InsuPad on postprandial glucose excursions. In this study 10 diabetic patients took part (30...|$|R
