25|$|Executive {{functioning}} is {{a theoretical}} construct representing a domain of cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes. Executive functioning {{is not a}} unitary concept; it is <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>description</b> of the set of processes involved in certain areas of cognitive and behavioural control. Executive processes are integral to higher brain function, particularly {{in the areas of}} goal formation, planning, goal-directed action, self-monitoring, attention, response inhibition, and coordination of complex cognition and motor control for effective performance. Deficits of the executive functions are observed in all populations to varying degrees, but severe executive dysfunction can have devastating effects on cognition and behaviour in both individual and social contexts.|$|E
500|$|M. H. Abrams wrote <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>description</b> of {{the works}} in 1965. He {{observed}} that in each, the speaker [...] "begins {{with a description of}} the landscape; an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied by integral process of memory, thought, anticipation, and feeling which remains closely intervolved with the outer scene. In the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight, faces up to a tragic loss, comes to a moral decision, or resolves an emotional problem. Often the poem rounds itself to end where it began, at the outer scene, but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which {{is the result of the}} intervening meditation." [...] In fact, Abrams was describing both the conversation poems and later works influenced by them. Abrams' essay has been describes as a [...] "touchstone of literary criticism". As Paul Magnuson wrote in 2002, [...] "Abrams credited Coleridge with originating what Abrams called the 'greater Romantic lyric', a genre that began with Coleridge's 'Conversation' poems, and included William Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey, Percy Bysshe Shelley's Stanzas Written in Dejection and John Keats's Ode to a Nightingale, and was a major influence on more modern lyrics by Matthew Arnold, Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and W.

50|$|The {{original}} theory, {{proposed by}} Mitchell, Keller, and Kedar-Cabelli in 1986 and called explanation-based generalization, is that learning occurs through progressive generalizing.

When applied to human cognition, it translates as follows: the mind actively separates information {{that applies to}} more than one thing and enters it into <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>description</b> of <b>a</b> category of things. This is done by identifying sufficient conditions for something to fit in a category, similar to schematizing.|$|R

The author writes {{that it is necessary}} to be armed with a vorpal sword or a winxy pistol, because one never can tell what a Bandersnatch might do. The hero describes the creature as being extremely long-legged with a long tail and the ability to fly. It could be understood that the Bandersnatch perhaps camouflages itself as a tree.

30|$|These {{opportunities}} {{are necessary for}} students and HEIs alike, as they are reciprocal, with students gaining valuable employability skills while still at university (Higson 2012); according to Helyer & Lee (2014), ‘graduates will need to distinguish themselves by strategically using the experiential learning they gain from in-course workplace experiences {{if they wish to}} be considered by graduate recruiters’ (p. 351). Similarly, having their graduates in graduate jobs boosts the HEIs’ profile and potentially increases their numbers of students. We are effectively being called upon to imagine a different notion of curriculum, which perhaps includes social engagement and experiential learning (Millican 2014). According to Speight et al.

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, multiobjective {{optimization}} has received growing attention: the number of publications related to this subject between 1974 and 1979 exceeds 120. There are many approaches, techniques and tools related to multiobjective decision making and optimization; however, not all approaches are equally developed, and the resulting tools are often applied because of certain traditions rather than their suitability for solving a given problem. Therefore, this paper is devoted to a comparative evaluation of various approaches and tools.
