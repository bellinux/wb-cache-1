Apps developed so far, however, are concentrated in exhibition information, experimental programs, or the collection information of an individual museum. If the Jongno museum unified app, which could be universally used in Jongno district where museums are concentrated develops and contains information about different museums, it would reduce the cost and provide useful information to visitors. Based on location information and the regional route, this app would be comprised of information concerning <b>admission,</b> <b>opening</b> hours, exhibitions, collections, trial and educational programs.

40|$|Background Crisis {{resolution}} teams (CRTs) provide intensive alternative care {{to hospital}} admission {{for patients with}} mental health crises. The aims {{of this study were}} to describe the proportions and characteristics of patients admitted to in-patient wards from CRTs, to identify any differences in admission practices between CRTs, and to identify predictors of admissions from CRTs. Methods A naturalistic prospective multicentre design was used to study 680 consecutive patients under the care of eight CRTs in Norway over a 3 -month period in 2005 / 2006. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected on the patients, and on the organization and operation of the CRTs. Logistic regression analysis for hierarchical data was used to test potential predictors of admission at team and patient level. Results One hundred and forty-six patients (21. 5 %) were admitted to in-patient wards. There were significant differences in admission rates between the CRTs. The likelihood of being admitted to an in-patient ward was significantly lower for patients treated by CRTs that operated during extended opening hours than CRTs that operated during office hours only. Those most likely to be admitted were patients with psychotic symptoms, suicidal risk, and a prior history of <b>admissions.</b> Conclusions Extended <b>opening</b> hours may help CRTs to prevent more admissions for patients with moderately severe and relapsing mental illnesses. Patients with severe psychosis seem to be difficult to treat in the community by Norwegian CRTs even with extended opening hours...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{traces the}} debate about desegregation on the campuses of five elite private universities in the South {{from the end of}} World War II to the early 1960 s. The presidents of Duke, Emory, Rice, Tulane, and Vanderbilt, charged with leading these schools to national prominence, quickly grasped that postwar realities [...] -including pressure from federal grantmakers and national philanthropic foundations [...] -would require some measure of racial change if the schools were to advance. In the interest of progress the presidents were willing to accept limited participation by "exceptional" blacks {{in the life of the}} university. The critical issue in their eyes was who would control the process of racial change. While acknowledging, some more grudgingly than others, that "outside" pressure for desegregation should be heeded, the presidents insisted that the pace and manner of loosening racial restrictions must remain the decisions of educated southern whites. Many powerful trustees and alumni staunchly opposed even this. These traditionalists strongly defended southern racial customs and fought any attempts to alter them for any reason, even the advancement of the schools they served. With varying degrees of energy and success, the presidents mediated between the proponents of progress and tradition, trying to avoid open conflict while gradually improving each school's academic quality. Only Vanderbilt took steps towards <b>opening</b> <b>admissions,</b> allowing black graduate students to enroll in its School of Religion beginning in 1953. The debate over the place of talented blacks on these campuses remained subdued until 1954, when Brown v. Board of Education and the growing grass-roots civil rights movement brought increased turmoil to the South. Although many trustees vowed not to bend to this pressure, the costs of maintaining segregation on campus became too high to bear. By the early 1960 s, snowballing loss of faculty, student discontent, and above all, the threat of a funding cut-off by the federal government and the foundations led all these schools to abandon segregated admissions policies...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we study}} several {{problems related to}} the management of healthcare and the cure of disease. In each chapter a hospital capacity distribution problem is analyzed using techniques from operations research, also known as mathematical decision theory. The problems considered are inspired by logistical challenges faced by Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). Several of the solutions we present in this dissertation have been implemented at LUMC. Considering our aging population, shrinking workforce and the current hospital efficiency levels it will be difficult, if not impossible, to provide an appropriate level of care for the sick and the elderly in the coming decades. Given what is currently at stake, {{it is hard to}} understand that it is quite common in hospitals to avoid explicit decisions on resource allocation and capacity distribution and just anticipate on ad-hoc basis on problems that occur. This is sometimes accompanied with very undesirable system outcomes such as patient cancellations and extremely long access (the time the patient spends on the waiting list) or waiting (the time the patient spends in the hospital waiting) times. The models we present allow for a quantification of consequences of capacity distribution decisions. The item that is distributed can either be time, or another kind of resource such as staffed beds. With the models a clear and succinct understanding of the problem, its possible solutions, and implications of these solutions can be obtained. This dissertation consists of three parts. The first part serves as an introduction and contains the Introduction Chapter, 1, which discusses recent developments in the healthcare sector and the role of Operations Research therein, and Chapter 2, which provides an introduction to queues, networks of queues, and their applications in healthcare. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation we focus on challenges for outpatient clinics and diagnostic facilities. In Chapter 3 we study the reorganization of an outpatient clinic. We demonstrate how the involvement of essential employees combined with a queuing network model designed to support the decision making process results in a successful intervention. Key points in the intervention are the rescheduling of appointments and the reallocation of tasks. Chapter 4 presents a methodology to develop appointment schedules for outpatient clinics with unscheduled (walk-in) and scheduled (appointment) patients. The goal is an appointment schedule that keeps waiting time at the facility for unscheduled patients below an acceptable level, while controlling the access time for scheduled patients. A cyclic queuing and a Markov decision model are combined with an algorithm to determine an appointment schedule that satisfies all requirements. Chapter 5 is motivated by the increasing popularity of care pathways in outpatient clinics. Hospitals aim to optimize the flow of patients in a care pathway by prioritizing them in the appointment planning process. As a result, regular patients who are not in a care pathway may experience increased waiting times. We develop a queuing model with a reservation scheme that allows for a trade-off between the accessibility for patients from the care pathway and waiting time for regular patients at an outpatient clinic. In Chapter 6 we consider an MRI scanning facility run by a Radiology department. Several medical departments compete for capacity and have private information regarding their demand for scans. The fairness of the capacity allocation by the Radiology department depends on the quality of the information provided by the medical departments. We employ a game-theoretic approach that stimulates the disclosure of true demand, so that capacity can be allocated fairly. In the last part we study challenges that evolve when urgent and elective patient flow meet. Chapter 7 studies the trade-off between cancellations of elective surgeries due to semi-urgent surgeries, and unused operating room (OR) time due to excessive reservation of OR time for semi-urgent surgeries. Semi-urgent surgeries, to be performed soon but not necessarily today, pose an uncertain demand on available hospital resources, and interfere with the planning of elective patients. For a highly utilized OR, reservation of OR time for semi-urgent surgeries avoids excessive cancellations of elective surgeries, but may also result in unused OR time, since arrivals of semi-urgent patients are unpredictable. We use a discrete-time queuing and a Markov decision model to smooth the planning process. Using the methodology presented in Chapter 7, part of the OR capacity of the Neurosurgery department at LUMC was allocated to semi-urgent surgeries. In Chapter 8 we study the implementation process and the effect of dedicating OR slots to semi-urgent surgeries on elective patient cancellations and OR utilization. A recent development to reduce Emergency Department crowding and increase urgent patient <b>admissions</b> is the <b>opening</b> of an Emergency Observation and Assessment Ward (EOAWard). At these wards urgent patients are temporarily hospitalized until they can be transferred to an inpatient bed. In Chapter 9 we present an overflow model to evaluate the effect of employing an EOA Ward on elective and urgent patient admissions. All models presented in parts II and III allow for a quantitative analysis of resource distribution problems in healthcare. We can conclude that mathematical modeling contributes to higher quality, more sound decision making in healthcare...|$|R
