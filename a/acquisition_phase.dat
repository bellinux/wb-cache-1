25|$|Generalization is the {{expansion}} of a student's performance ability beyond the initial conditions set for acquisition of a skill. Generalization can occur across people, places, and materials used for teaching. For example, once a skill is learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the skill is taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial <b>acquisition</b> <b>phase.</b> For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, the teacher may take the student around the house or his school and then generalize the skill in these more natural environments with other materials. Behavior analysts have spent considerable amount of time studying factors that lead to generalization.|$|E

Materials and Methods:Retrospective and prospective review of reports on radiation dose from abdominal CT scans performed three months before (group A – 551 studies) and three months after (group B – 788 studies) implementation of new scan protocols proposed as a function of clinical indications. Also, the images acquisition parameters were adjusted to reduce the radiation dose at each scan phase. The groups were compared for mean number of <b>acquisition</b> <b>phases,</b> mean CTDIvol per phase, mean DLP per phase, and mean DLP per scan. Results:A significant reduction was observed for group B as regards all the analyzed aspects, as follows: 33. 9 %, 25. 0 %, 27. 0 % and 52. 5 %, respectively for number of <b>acquisition</b> <b>phases,</b> CTDIvol per phase, DLP per phase and DLP per scan (p < 0. 001). Conclusion:The rational use of abdominal computed tomography scan phases based on the clinical suspicion in conjunction with the adjusted images acquisition parameters allows for a 50 % reduction in the radiation dose from abdominal computed tomography scans...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the many}} demonstrations of {{blocking}} in animals, {{there is still}} little evidence of blocking with human subjects, which is problematic for general learning and behavior theory. The purpose {{of this research was}} to examine blocking with human subjects using a design and behavioral procedure (conditioned suppression) similar to those commonly used in animal research. First, subjects learned an operant task. Later, they were instructed to suppress responding when a visual US was presented. Two Pavlovian <b>acquisition</b> <b>phases</b> and a test phase occurred while the subjects were performing the operant task. In the first Pavlovian phase, CS A predicted the US for the experimental group, but was uncorrelated with the US for the control group. In the second Pavlovian phase, a compound CS AX predicted the US for both groups. At test, CS X was presented to all subjects and suppression ratios were assessed. Experimental subjects suppressed responding in the presence of CS X less than did control subjects, thereby demonstrating a blocking effect. This research, in demonstrating blocking in humans, adds to the known similarities in animal and human behavior. � 1997 Academic Press Since Kamin described the blocking effect in 1968, this effect has been investigated primarily with rats and other nonhuman animals as experimental subjects. In a traditional blocking procedure, there are two <b>acquisition</b> <b>phases.</b> In the first phase, the experimental group is exposed to a conditioned stimulu...|$|R

30|$|Although {{synchronization}} {{is a tough}} task {{to accomplish}} in any communication system, it becomes much more challenging in IR-UWB due to the need of nanosecond-level precision and low-power impulsive UWB pulses. Indeed, the fine resolution obtained thanks to the wide signal bandwidth, results in large search space for the synchronization while extremely low power transmission means long sequence to be processed {{in order to develop}} a reliable synchronization criterion. Many resolvable multipaths due to short UWB pulses can also cause the receiver to lock with more than one arriving multipath component, thus resulting in multiple <b>acquisition</b> <b>phases.</b> Last but not the least, the transmitted signal is distorted by antennas and unknown frequency selective dense multipath channels [3, 4], which further intricate the already challenging task.|$|R

Here we describe our scenario, competency questions, results, and milestones for each methodological stage, use of CMs, vision for a collaborative environment for ontology development.
