The investigation considers three specific forest management regimes including a regime under complete state control, traditional community regime and a co-management regime known as Joint Forest Management. Communities with higher incidence of land poverty have lower forest <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> for grazing and fodder extraction, whereas communities with a higher incidence of land-rich households have higher forest <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> for fodder extraction.

We model, at flow level, the way a finite population of users with heterogeneous <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> and traffic demands shares the capacity of this common backhaul link. We then evaluate several practically interesting use cases, focusing particularly {{on the performance of}} users subscribing to recent FTTH offers in which the user <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> may be of the same order of magnitude as the backhaul link capacity. We show that, despite such high <b>access</b> <b>rates,</b> reasonable performance can be achieved as long as the total offered traffic is well below the backhaul link capacity. The obtained performance results are used to derive simple dimensioning guidelines for backhaul networks. I...|$|R

Unfairness in a large CSMA system caused by the unfair advantage of border nodes at high <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> was analyzed in[8].

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{multiple sensors}} randomly accessing a shared wireless medium to transmit measurements {{of their respective}} plants to a controller. To mitigate the packet col-lisions arising from simultaneously transmitting sensors, we appropriately design the sensor <b>access</b> <b>rates.</b> This is posed as an optimization problem, where the total transmit power of the sensors is minimized, and control performance for all control loops needs to be guaranteed. Control performance of each loop is abstracted as a desired expected decrease rate of a given Lyapunov function. By establishing an equivalent convex optimization problem, the optimal <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> are shown to decouple among sensors. Moreover, based on the Lagrange dual problem, we develop an easily implementable distributed procedure to find the optimal sensor <b>access</b> <b>rates.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|As {{residential}} high-speed Internet access {{has become}} more prevalent, {{the nature of the}} rural-urban digital divide in access has shifted. In 2000, dial-up <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> in rural households lagged behind their urban counterparts by 11 percentage points. By 2003, however, dial-up <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> were equal in rural and urban areas, but high-speed <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> were 14 percentage points higher in urban areas. This article uses a nested logit model to explore the household decision between no Internet access, dial-up access and high-speed access. A decomposition technique is then used to estimate the contributions of various factors, including education, income and infrastructure levels, to differences in Internet access among rural and urban households. The results suggest that policies which solely promote infrastructure in rural areas fail to address the dominant factors in the emerging high-speed digital divide. ...|$|R

TITLE: Institutional Repository Access Patterns of Nontraditionally Published Academic Content: What Types of Content are Accessed the Most? OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of posting nontraditionally published academic content, such as materials supplementary to peer-reviewed publications, poster images, graduate course research papers, and presentation slides to an institutional repository (IR). SETTING: A major, state-run university’s IR that has been operational since 2005 and that is actively supported by the institution’s library. METHODS: Using the “Statistics” functionality of the open-source IR software, DSpace, the monthly <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> were collected and analyzed for the following academic content types: 1) materials supplementary to journal articles published in traditional peer-reviewed journals, 2) slide images from presentations given at national or regional meetings, 3) research papers from a graduate student course in biomedical informatics in a Master of Science in Clinical Research program, and 4) poster images {{with or without the}} associated abstracts that were accepted for presentation at national or regional professional meetings. The analysis focused on both the <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> over time as well as comparing overall <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> between content types. RESULTS: The most frequently posted content type was poster images (24 items), followed by slide images (16), papers from the CTSC course (6) and supplementary materials (3). The most accessed content type during the first year after IR posting was supplementary materials to peer reviewed articles, papers from the CTSC informatics course, slide images then poster images. The average first year <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> were similar (from 17. 3 to 25. 7). After the first year, <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> decreased but did not completely stop. CONCLUSIONS: The average first year <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> were similar across content types, illustrating the utility of using IRs for the posting of nontraditional academic material. This is academic output that would not likely be otherwise captured and made freely available were it not for publication in an IR. Authors should be encouraged to post nontraditional content to IRs because it will likely be accessed for years to come. University of New Mexico Health Sciences Library and Informatics Cente...|$|R

Although per-capita GDP is correlated with <b>access</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>access</b> still varies significantly at comparable income levels.

2500|$|Methodologies {{and data}} sources. The Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of WHO and UNICEF, {{which is the}} internationally {{accepted}} source for the measurement to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for water supply and sanitation, relies on the compilation of various surveys (Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Cluster Indicators Surveys (MCIS)) to establish <b>access</b> <b>rates.</b> These surveys typically assess the availability of infrastructure, not service quality. The 2017 estimates for Burkina Faso thus indicate <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> to an at least basic water source of 79 percent in urban areas and 43 percent in rural areas. The Government relies on an entirely different approach, based {{on the concept of}} [...] "reasonable access". This concept differs from the JMP approach by taking into account aspects of service quality, such as waiting time and water quality. According to the government approach, the water <b>access</b> <b>rates</b> in 2005 were lower than under the JMP approach, standing at 74 percent in urban areas and 60 percent in rural areas. While the “reasonable access” approach is more sophisticated, it also faces greater challenges in terms of availability of data.|$|R
