5|$|Although many {{leaders of}} the Congress sought a strong central {{government}} for an Indian state, some Muslim politicians, including Jinnah, were unwilling to <b>accept</b> <b>this</b> without powerful protections for their community. Other Muslims supported the Congress, which advocated a secular state upon independence. Nevertheless, the Congress enjoyed considerable Muslim support up to about 1937.|$|E
5|$|Disagreement {{over who}} {{would lead the}} 10,000 Chetnik exiles in Italy {{escalated}} into a feud between Jevđević, Đujić and General Miodrag Damjanović in mid-1947. Damjanović had been appointed by Mihailović in March 1945 to lead the Chetniks into northwestern Italy. Jevđević and Đujić refused to <b>accept</b> <b>this</b> and claimed that they were Mihailović's only successors as leaders of the Chetnik movement.|$|E

Sir Danvers joins his daughter, and they talk about their time in Mangalore, India. When Hyde suddenly enters, Sir Danvers tells Agnes to leave the room. The men argue, and Hyde strangles Sir Danvers.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{had always}} found it {{difficult}} to intercept high-flying German reconnaissance aircraft. The latest Rumpler C.VII which had entered service proved particularly elusive. With a 240 horse power engine, it could reach 24,000 feet and was thus beyond the reach of any prospective adversary. The average S.E.5, at that point, could reach only 17,000 feet. While most pilots were prepared to <b>accept</b> <b>this</b> tactical-technological situation, McCudden was not.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, Samutsevich's new lawyer, Irina Khrunova, {{argued that}} her client had {{not in fact}} {{committed}} the acts of hooliganism in the church as she was prevented from accessing the soleas by church security.

However, the judges rejected the appeals of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, upholding their convictions and sentences.|$|E

Palpatine feigns reluctance to <b>accept</b> <b>this</b> authority, promising to {{return it to the}} Senate once the crisis has ended. His first act is to allow the creation of a clone army to counter the Separatist threat; this results in the opening salvo of the Clone Wars. With the galaxy now at war as Sidious planned, Dooku brings him the secret plans for a new superweapon.|$|E

Refusing to <b>accept</b> <b>this,</b> he bolts past security and argues with the judges to let him audition. When they refuse, he throws a crying tantrum. Later, he journeys to Poor Richard's Pub, where he meets his former office workers. All together, the office watches the official airing of the documentary on PBS's Scranton affiliate station, WVIA-TV.|$|E

The Japanese replied that they could not <b>accept</b> <b>this</b> unless the number of battleships was also limited; they wanted the United States and the United Kingdom to agree to having an equal number of battleships with Japan, but this was a condition that the two countries refused to accept. On 24 June, the two North Carolinas were ordered with the 14-inch weapons, but on 10 July, Roosevelt directed that they be armed with triple 16-inch instead.|$|E

5|$|Legal {{victories}} in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component of medical school curricula, but the medical community was slow to <b>accept</b> <b>this</b> new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After World War II, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link is based on the interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars <b>accept</b> <b>this</b> interpretation, since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E
5|$|Luís Alves would {{normally}} have begun the fourth-year {{classes at the}} Royal Military Academy in March 1822. Instead, he dropped out in December 1821 and enlisted in the 1st Fusilier Battalion. Prince Dom Pedro, son and heir of King JoãoVI, had just embarked upon the struggle against Portugal {{that would lead to}} the independence of Brazil on 7 September 1822. The prince was later acclaimed Dom PedroI, the first Brazilian emperor, on 12 October. Those Brazilian and Portuguese forces who remained loyal to Portugal refused to <b>accept</b> <b>this</b> outcome, which led to a war fought on several fronts across Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Ponsford {{began his}} working {{life at the}} State Savings Bank. On his return from England in 1926, the bank advised him {{that they might not}} {{tolerate}} so much leave for cricket in the future. Ponsford received a lucrative offer to play for Blackpool Cricket Club, which he was inclined to <b>accept.</b> <b>This</b> news was received with dismay by Australian fans, who had earlier seen players such as Ted McDonald leave Australia and accept contracts in the professional English leagues. To keep Ponsford in Melbourne, The Herald—a local newspaper—employed him on the basis that he would remain available for all representative cricket. The new role included writing articles for the paper.|$|E
5|$|Richard's posthumous {{reputation}} {{has been}} shaped {{to a large extent}} by William Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not <b>accept</b> <b>this</b> interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic, the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.|$|E
5|$|The 1660 Restoration {{was popular}} in Scotland since it ended the Union and an {{expensive}} military occupation, although ironically it was welcomed in England {{for the same}} reasons. Scottish Parliamentary elections installed a Royalist majority which passed a series of acts giving greater power to the Crown, the most significant being the Rescissory Act of March 1661. This returned Scotland to the constitutional position of 1633, restoring the legal system and Parliament but imposing the Episcopalian structure on the Kirk rejected in 1638. Many were prepared to <b>accept</b> <b>this</b> since continuing divisions within the Presbyterian Kirk made it seem impossible they could create a unified church.|$|E
