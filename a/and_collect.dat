5|$|Insurers {{claimed that}} because {{they have access to}} <b>and</b> <b>collect</b> patient data that allow {{evaluations}} of interventions, they are essential to ACO success. Large insurers formed their own ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices.

5|$|According {{to popular}} tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was {{lord of the}} manor in the mid-14thcentury and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord.

This gave Duyệt control over the vast economic resources in the fertile agricultural and lumber-rich region and most importantly, land development.
