He then booked her in a match with Kurt Angle out of spite, and Maria was laid out with the Angle Slam. As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, who was being fired because of his {{controversial}} actions as General Manager.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing from}} Whitlam, Kerr called Fraser. According to Fraser, Kerr <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> he, if {{commissioned}} Prime Minister, could secure supply, would immediately thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and {{investigations of the}} Whitlam Government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those questions were asked {{later in the day}} before Kerr commissioned Fraser as Prime Minister. According to Kerr, Fraser was supposed to come to Yarralumla at 1.00pm.|$|E
5|$|However, {{through the}} written {{dialogue}} in his diary, Choe did express slight {{differences between the}} cultures of China and Korea. For example, when the Chinese <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> or not the Korean education system offered degrees for specialists who dealt with {{only one of the}} Five Classics, Choe wrote that a Korean student who only studied one of the Classics and not all five of them was doomed to failing his exam and never attaining the rank of a full-fledged Confucian scholar.|$|E

5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1561, cannons {{were fired}} in Leith to {{announce}} Queen Mary's arrival in Scotland. When she attended Mass being {{celebrated in the}} royal chapel at Holyrood Palace five days later, this prompted a protest in which one of her servants was jostled. The next day she issued a proclamation {{that there would be}} no alteration in the current state of religion and that her servants should not be molested or troubled. Many nobles accepted this, but not Knox. The following Sunday, he protested from the pulpit of St Giles'. As a result, just two weeks after her return, Mary summoned Knox. She accused him of inciting a rebellion against her mother and of writing a book against her own authority. Knox answered that as long as her subjects found her rule convenient, he was willing to accept her governance, noting that Paul the Apostle had been willing to live under Nero's rule. Mary noted, however, that he had written against the principle of female rule itself. He responded that she should not to be troubled by what had never harmed her. When Mary <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> subjects had a right to resist their ruler, he replied that if monarchs exceeded their lawful limits, they might be resisted, even by force.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the detectives}} left his store that day, Gauci remembered {{something}} else. Just as the Libyan-looking customer reached the door, {{it had started}} to rain. Gauci had <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> he also wanted to buy an umbrella, and he did. The detectives bought an identical umbrella from Gauci, took it back to Lockerbie, and searched through {{the remains of the}} black umbrellas that were found at the crash site, until they found parts of one that seemed to match Gauci's.|$|E

25|$|Bose's {{interpretation}} {{is now called}} Bose–Einstein statistics. This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of quantum statistics, and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac. When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> he had been aware that he had invented {{a new type of}} statistics, and he very candidly said that no, he wasn't that familiar with Boltzmann's statistics and didn't realize that he was doing the calculations differently. He was equally candid with anyone who asked.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Bittaker {{was arrested}} for assault with attempt to commit murder. This charge arose from an {{incident}} in which he stabbed a young supermarket clerk named Gary Louie following a confrontation in a supermarket parking lot: Louie had observed Bittaker steal a steak from the supermarket in which he (Louie) worked. Upon observing Bittaker's actions, Louie had followed Bittaker into the car park and calmly <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> he had forgotten to pay for anything. In response to this question, Bittaker stabbed Louie once in the chest, narrowly missing his heart. Bittaker attempted to flee {{the scene of the}} stabbing, but was restrained by two of Louie's fellow employees.|$|E

Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child, and the angel told him that they should do what he had told Manoah's wife: She was not to eat any product of the grapevine, drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing.|$|E

25|$|During the {{negotiations}} regarding the succession to the throne, she supported the Gustavian Party, who wished for the deposed King's son, the former Crown Prince Gustav, {{to be acknowledged}} as heir to the throne. During a dinner, General Baron Georg Adlersparre told her that Jean Baptiste Bernadotte had <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> her spouse (Charles XIII) had any issue, and was interested when he found that he had not. When she remarked that the throne had an heir in the deposed King's son, Adlersparre stated {{that none of the}} instigators of the coup would accept this, as they feared that the boy would avenge his father when he became King, and that to prevent this they would go as far as to take up the old rumor that the deposed King was in fact the illegitimate son of Queen Sophia Magdalena and Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila.|$|E
25|$|Orwell married Eileen O'Shaughnessy on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the {{political}} crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At {{the end of}} the year, concerned by Francisco Franco's military uprising, (supported by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and local groups such as Falange), Orwell decided to go to Spain {{to take part in the}} Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on John Strachey's recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell's political reliability; he <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> he would undertake to join the International Brigade and advised him to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris. Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation in situ, Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to John McNair in Barcelona.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of May 15, Waco's {{courthouse}} quickly filled to capacity {{in anticipation of the}} trial: the crowd nearly prevented some jurors from entering. Observers also filled the sidewalks around the courthouse; over two thousand spectators were present. Attendees were almost entirely white, but a few quiet members of Waco's black community were present. As Washington was led into the courtroom, one audience member pointed a gun at him, but was quickly overpowered. As the trial commenced, the judge attempted to keep order, insisting that the audience remain silent. Jury selection proceeded quickly: the defense did not challenge any selections of the prosecution. Bernstein states that the trial had a [...] "kangaroo-court atmosphere". [...] The judge asked Washington for a plea, and explained the potential sentences. Washington muttered a response, possibly [...] "yes", interpreted by the court as a guilty plea. The prosecution described the charges, and the court heard testimony from law enforcement officers and the doctor who examined Fryer's body. The doctor discussed how Fryer died, but did not mention rape. The prosecution rested, and Washington's attorney <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> he had committed the offense. Washington replied, [...] "That's what I done [...] " [...] and quietly apologized. The lead prosecutor addressed the courtroom and declared that the trial had been conducted fairly, prompting an ovation from the crowd. The jury was then sent to deliberate.|$|E
