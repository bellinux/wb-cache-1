5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel tank pressure release valve and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E
25|$|The charioteer {{would have}} had to use great skill to ensure that the radius of each turn of the chariot was correct to make one of the wheels exactly stop rotating. Unless he did this correctly, the {{pointing}} doll would not have kept aiming to the south. He {{would have been able to}} adjust the direction in which it aimed by making turns that were more or less sharp. This would sometimes have given him opportunities to use the chariot dishonestly. If it was being demonstrated to spectators, for example, and was being driven <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them, making many turns, the charioteer, who would have known which way was south, would have been able to make the chariot appear to work extremely accurately as a compass for long periods. The spectators could have been shown the machinery, and would have seen that the charioteer could not manipulate the doll. They would presumably have been impressed by the apparent accuracy of the mechanism. It is possible that this type of chariot was sometimes constructed with the prime purpose of fraudulently impressing spectators. Possibly, people who built these chariots deceived their own employers with them, which could have gained them fame and fortune provided nobody tried using the chariots for real navigation.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2011, and {{concluded}} {{in the late}} summer (from the Northern Hemisphere's perspective). Filming largely took place in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, but also in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape. Outside South Africa the series was also filmed in Budapest, Hungary, and the UK. Among the separate locations the series takes place in, the New Delhi hotel in the first two episodes were shot in Cape Town, and the suburbs of Hout Bay doubled as Mozambique. Throughout the shoot the actors were allowed to perform the majority of their own stunts. Military advisors were on hand to teach the actors how to perform certain stunts, and to tell them what they did wrong during the take. The series includes a number of sex scenes, many of which were performed by Stapleton. In an interview with the British newspaper Metro, the actor stated [...] "I've done my fair share of nude scenes in the past {{but not as much as}} this – not as risqué, anyway," [...] adding that while he got used to it, he was always [...] "a bit nervous running <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> 50 people with no clothes on. The sex scenes were usually with an actress I'd just met, so it's like: 'How's it going? I'm Sullivan and this is me nude.' It's nerve-racking at first but you have as much fun as you can with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Although the two fleets {{both had}} eight ships in their lines, the British had an {{advantage}} in firepower: the 90-gun [...] was the largest ship of either fleet (compared to the 84-gun Duc de Bourgogne), while the French fleet also included the recently captured 44-gun Romulus, the smallest vessel on either line. [...] When Arbuthnot spotted the French fleet to his northeast at 6 am on March 16, they were about [...] east-northeast of Cape Henry. [...] Arbuthnot came about, and Destouches ordered his ships to form a line of battle heading west, with the wind. [...] Between 8 and 9 am the winds began shifting, but visibility remained poor, and the two fleets manoeuvred for several hours, each seeking {{the advantage of the}} weather gage. [...] By 1 pm the wind had stabilised from the northeast, and Arbuthnot, with superior seamanship, was coming up on the rear of the French line as both headed east-southeast, tacking against the wind. [...] Destouches, in order to escape this position, gave orders to wear ship in sequence, and brought his line <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the advancing British line. [...] With this manoeuvre he surrendered the weather gage (giving Arbuthnot the advantage in determining the attack), but it also positioned his ships relative to the wind such that he could open his lower gundecks in the heavy seas, which the British could not do without the risk of water washing onto the lower decks.|$|E
