5|$|Sadler {{was born}} June 24, 1875, in Spencer, Indiana, to Samuel Cavins Sadler and Sarah Isabelle Wilson. Of English and Irish descent, {{he was raised}} in Wabash, Indiana. Samuel did not enroll his son in public schools. Despite his lack of formal education, Sadler read many books <b>about</b> <b>history</b> as a child and became a skilled public speaker at a young age. Samuel was a convert to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and William was baptized into the {{denomination}} in 1888 and became devoutly religious.|$|E
5|$|Another {{branch of}} Kingsley {{descendants}} {{lives in the}} Dominican Republic near where John Maxwell Kingsley lived in Haiti. Kingsley and Anna Jai are the great grandparents of Mary Kingsley Sammis, who married Abraham Lincoln Lewis, one of Florida's first black millionaires and an original investor in the all-black American Beach. The Kingsley-Sammis-Lewis-Betsch family {{has been active in}} Jacksonville's black community for decades. Spelman College's first black female president, Johnnetta Betsch Cole, is descended from Lewis and Sammis. The Heritage Celebration was moved to Black History Month in February 2008; Cole was the keynote speaker of the 2009 Kingsley Heritage Celebration. Interpretive events such as music, storytelling, and ranger-led talks <b>about</b> <b>history</b> and archeology regularly occur during the Heritage Celebration.|$|E
5|$|Hominid {{takes place}} several {{million years ago}} in the Central African {{transitional}} region between rainforest and savanna. The main characters are Australopithecus afarenses, an extinct, mostly tree-dwelling hominid that existed before the use of tools and fire. The story is told through first-person narration by the protagonist, Pitar. In deliberating his social and natural environment, Pitar decides to lead his band to civilization: “Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness, to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on.” His linguistic capacity, thoughts and speech correspond to those of modern man, and he also is knowledgeable <b>about</b> <b>history,</b> politics, philosophy and literature. Intermittent comments made by Pitar concerning a particular prospect or artifact that has not been invented or developed yet add to the humor of the grotesque scenario. Pitar's close friends are Carpediem, who enunciates Latin phrases and quotes the writers of Classical Antiquity, and Lao, who frequently refers to Chinese philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Over time {{he became}} {{increasingly}} involved in various dissident organizations. In December 1959 {{he became a}} vice president of the Union of Polish Writers (Związek Literatów Polskich, ZLP). He also published in the magazine Świat (1951–1969). In 1962 he was the last president of the literary discussion society, Klub Krzywego Koła. In 1966 he was {{a vice president of}} the PEN Club. While in the late 1940s and 1950s he focused mostly on journalistic activity, later he turned to writing popular history in book format. In the 1960s he wrote his most famous works, historical books <b>about</b> <b>history</b> of Poland – the Kingdom of Poland in the times of the Piast dynasty, the Jagiellonian dynasty, and the era of elected kings (the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth). His book on Jagiellonian Poland was recognized as the best book of the year by the readers.|$|E

25|$|During the 1920s, {{a series}} of papers by J. B. S. Haldane applied {{mathematical}} analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths. Haldane established that natural selection could work even faster than Fisher had assumed. Both workers, and others such as Dobzhansky and Wright, explicitly intended to bring biology up to the philosophical standard of the physical sciences, making it firmly based in mathematical modelling, its predictions confirmed by experiment. Natural selection, once considered hopelessly unverifiable speculation <b>about</b> <b>history,</b> was becoming predictable, measurable, and testable.|$|E
25|$|Traveling {{certainly}} {{helped make}} him a geographer, but he also was forced to become a true cartographer during his travels.

He published word maps in Esperanto and edited a professional review «Geografia Revuo» between 1956 and 1964.

25|$|Both unschooling {{and natural}} {{learning}} advocates believe that children learn best by doing; {{a child may}} learn reading to further an interest <b>about</b> <b>history</b> or other cultures, or math skills by operating a small business or sharing in family finances. They may learn animal husbandry keeping dairy goats or meat rabbits, botany tending a kitchen garden, chemistry to understand the operation of firearms or the internal combustion engine, or politics and local history by following a zoning or historical-status dispute. While any type of homeschoolers may also use these methods, the unschooled child initiates these learning activities. The natural learner participates with parents and others in learning together.|$|E
25|$|Born in Iași, {{his parents}} were the army officer Vasile Panu and his wife Ana (née Gugora), who was of Bulgarian origin. Vasile, whose family {{originated}} in Vaslui and was reportedly called Brânză, attended a cadets' school in Odessa and rose {{to the rank of}} major. He married Ana in Galați; the couple had four sons and two daughters. George attended primary school at Trei Ierarhi Monastery, followed by the National College. His teachers included Petru Poni, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Titu Maiorescu, while he was classmates with Alexandru Lambrior and Vasile Conta. He was passionate <b>about</b> <b>history</b> and read well beyond what was expected, and was a devoted admirer of Simion Bărnuțiu, whose ascetic figure he saw several times while the latter was teaching in Iași. From the early days of Junimea literary society, in 1864, he began hearing its lectures. When Alexandru Ioan Cuza was overthrown in 1866, he and other pupils backed the idea of a native prince to reign over the country, rather than the foreign-born one Junimea backed, and eventually personified by Carol I. He subsequently studied at the Literature faculty of Iași University from 1868 to 1870. His professors included Maiorescu, Iacob Negruzzi, Nicolae Ionescu and Gheorghe Mârzescu, and he read widely. Panu's classmates included Lambrior and Calistrat Hogaș, who had also gone to high school with him.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} Al-Biruni’s {{analysis}} is his summary of why many Hindus hate Muslims. Biruni {{notes in the}} beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture. He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which—claimed Al-Biruni—contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, {{and did not want to}} share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents. He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity <b>about</b> <b>history</b> and religion. Al-Biruni's translations as well as his own original contributions reached Europe in 12th and 13th century, where they were actively sought.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Auden's style became less rhetorical while its range of styles increased.
