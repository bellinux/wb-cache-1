25|$|In cold weather, {{the outdoor}} unit of an <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> {{needs to be}} {{intermittently}} defrosted. This will cause the auxiliary or emergency heating elements (located in the air-handler) to be activated. At the same time, the frost on the outdoor coil will quickly be melted due to the warm refrigerant. The condenser/evaporator fan will not run during defrost mode.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> {{requires}} an outdoor unit containing moving mechanical components including fans which produce noise. In 2013, the CEN started work on standards {{for protection from}} noise pollution caused by heat pump outdoor units. Although the CEN/TC 113 Business Plan outset was that [...] "consumers increasingly require a low acoustic power of these units as the users and their neighbours now reject noisy installations", no standards for noise barriers or other means of noise protection had been developed by January 2016.|$|E
2500|$|When {{used for}} heating a {{building}} with an outside temperature of, for example, 10°C, a typical air-source heat pump (ASHP) has a COP of 3 to 4, whereas an electrical resistance heater has a COP of 1.0. That is, one joule of electrical energy {{will cause a}} resistance heater to produce only one joule of useful heat, while under ideal conditions, one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place. Note that an <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones, so {{when the weather is}} much warmer the unit will perform with a higher COP (as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge). [...] When there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs, the COP is lower (worse). In extreme cold weather the COP will go down to 1.0.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> (ASHP) is {{a system}} which {{transfers}} heat from outside to inside a building, or vice versa. Under the principles of vapor compression refrigeration, an ASHP uses a refrigerant system involving a compressor and a condenser to absorb heat at one place and release it at another. They {{can be used as}} a space heater or cooler, and are sometimes called [...] "reverse-cycle air conditioners".|$|E
50|$|Direct {{exchange}} geothermal <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> function {{similarly to}} <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{according to the}} principles of vapor compression refrigeration, except they take advantage of the relatively constant ground temperatures, which are less variable than outdoor air temperatures. Ground temperature is cooler than the outdoor air temperature in summer - making for a better heat sink - and warmer in the winter - making for a better <b>heat</b> <b>source.</b> Direct exchange geothermal <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are therefore more efficient than <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> They are also quieter, more durable and require less maintenance since they don’t have any outdoor fan or outdoor coil. Furthermore, the uniformity of the underground temperature compared to the outdoor air translates into less stress on the systems.|$|R

25|$|According to the US EPA, {{geothermal}} <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> {{can reduce}} energy consumption up to 44% compared with air-source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> {{and up to}} 72% compared with electric resistance heating. The COP for <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> range from 3.2 to 4.5 for <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> to 4.2 to 5.2 for ground <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "standard" [...] {{domestic}} <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> can extract {{useful heat}} {{down to about}} -15 C. At colder outdoor temperatures the heat pump is less efficient; it could be switched off and the premises heated using only supplemental heat (or emergency heat) if the supplemental heating system is large enough. There are specially designed heat pumps that, while giving up some performance in cooling mode, will provide useful heat extraction to even lower outdoor temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|Air source {{heat pumps}} can provide fairly low cost space heating. A high {{efficiency}} heat pump can provide {{up to four}} times as much heat as an electric heater using the same energy. [...] In comparison to gas as a primary heat source, however, the lifetime cost of an <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> may be affected by the price of electricity compared to gas (where available). Use of gas may be associated with higher carbon emissions, depending upon how the electricity is generated.|$|E

40|$|Energy and exergy {{analysis}} is employed {{to compare the}} relative thermodynamic performance of low-carbon domestic energy systems based on <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> and micro-combined <b>heat</b> and power (cogeneration) units. A wide range of current units are modelled under different operating conditions representative of the United Kingdom to determine the energy and exergy flows from primary energy inputs through to low-carbon heating system and then to end use. The resulting performances are then analysed {{in order to provide}} insights regarding the relative merits of the systems under the different operating constraints that may be experienced both now and into the future. Although current mid-range systems achieve comparable performance to a condensing gas boiler, the state-of-art offers considerable improvements. Micro-combined heat and power units and <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> have the technical potential to improve the energy performance of dwellings. The relative performance and potential of the systems is dominated by the electrical characteristics: the grid electrical generation efficiency, the power-to-heat demand ratio and the availability of electrical export. For total power-to-heat demands below 1 : 1. 5, <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> have greater improvement potential as their energy efficiency is not constrained. At higher power-to-heat ratios, micro-combined heat and power units offer the potential for higher overall efficiency and this generally occurs irrespective {{of whether or not the}} thermal energy from them is used effectively...|$|R
50|$|The 'Efficiency' of <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> is {{measured}} by the Coefficient of performance (COP). A COP of 3 means the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> produces 3 units of heat energy for every 1 unit of electricity it consumes. Within temperature ranges of -3 °C to 10 °C, the COP for many machines is fairly stable at 3-3.5.|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{air source}} heat pumps lose their {{capacity}} as the external temperatures fall below 5 degrees Celsius (about 41 degrees Fahrenheit). CC-ASHPs (see above) may operate efficiently in temperatures {{as low as}} -30C, although {{they may not be}} as efficient in cooling during the summer season as conventional air source heat pumps. If a conventional <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all.|$|E
50|$|In very mild weather, the COP of an <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> can {{be up to}} 4. However, on a {{cold winter}} day, it takes more work to move {{the same amount of}} heat indoors than on a mild day. The heat pump's {{performance}} is limited by the Carnot cycle and will approach 1.0 as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases, which for most air source heat pumps happens as outdoor temperatures approach −18 °C / 0 °F. Heat pump construction that enables carbon dioxide as a refrigerant may have a COP of greater than 2 even down to -20 °C, pushing the break-even figure downward to -30 °C (-22 °F). A ground source heat pump has comparatively less of a change in COP as outdoor temperatures change, because the ground from which they extract heat has a more constant temperature than outdoor air.|$|E
50|$|In mild climates an <b>air</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> {{can be used}} to air {{condition}} the building during hot weather, and to warm the building using heat extracted from outdoor air in cold weather. Air-source heat pumps are generally uneconomic for outdoor temperatures much below freezing. In colder climates, geothermal heat pumps {{can be used to}} extract heat from the ground. For economy, these systems are designed for average low winter temperatures and use supplemental heating for extreme low temperature conditions. The advantage of the heat pump is that it reduces the purchased energy required for building heating; often geothermal source systems also supply domestic hot water. Even in places where fossil fuels provide most electricity, a geothermal system may offset greenhouse gas production since most of the heat is supplied from the surrounding environment, with only 15-30% as electrical consumption.|$|E
