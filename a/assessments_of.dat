5|$|<b>Assessments</b> <b>of</b> {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E

5|$|Because {{judicial}} decisions {{are subject to}} the sometimes arbitrary <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> the CCP, citizens who attempt {{to make use of the}} legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their cause is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed.

40|$|Major {{changes are}} {{currently}} afoot {{as to how}} practical work will be assessed in highstatus examinations (GCSEs for 16 -year-olds and A-levels for 18 -year-olds) in England.

5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity.

Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Ã…land Islands, to ask for their <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> the electoral campaigns.
