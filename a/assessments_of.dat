There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. <b>Assessments</b> <b>of</b> RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E

5|$|<b>Assessments</b> <b>of</b> {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E

5|$|Because {{judicial}} decisions {{are subject to}} the sometimes arbitrary <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> the CCP, citizens who attempt {{to make use of the}} legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their cause is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed.

40|$|Major {{changes are}} {{currently}} afoot {{as to how}} practical work will be assessed in highstatus examinations (GCSEs for 16 -year-olds and A-levels for 18 -year-olds) in England.

5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts.
