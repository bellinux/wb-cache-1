The Girls title was inspired by Hitchcock's alleged nickname for Hedren.|$|E

25|$|Valhalla is {{an afterlife}} {{destination}} where {{half of those}} who die in battle gather as einherjar, a retinue gathered for one sole purpose: to remain fit for battle {{in preparation for the}} last great battle, during Ragnar√∂k. In opposition to Hel's realm, which was a subterranean realm of the dead, it appears that Valhalla was located somewhere in the heavens. Odin's kingdom was primarily an abode for men, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> live there are the valkyries who gather the fallen warriors on the battle field and bring them to Odin's hall where they pour mead for them.|$|E

2500|$|However it {{is unclear}} whether the [...] "sex symbol" [...] {{actually}} had sexual intercourse with most of the women he dated. His early girlfriends Judy Spreckels and June Juanico say that they had no sexual relationships with Presley, and there were several women with whom Elvis quickly bypassed sexuality altogether, settling into comfortable friendships. Spreckels, singer Betty Amos, hairstylist Patti Parry, and others close to Presley all filled sisterly roles for Elvis. Despite claiming no sexual relationship with Elvis, June Juanico did say in an interview for the movie Elvis 1956, [...] "I will not say what happened between us. It is personal." [...] Byron Raphael and Alanna Nash have stated that the star [...] "would never put himself inside one of these girls..." [...] (for a number of reasons). Albert Goldman speculated that Elvis preferred voyeurism over normal sexual relations with women. Goldman went on to suggest that during his military service, Elvis had [...] "discovered prostitutes and picked up the intense fear of sexually transmitted diseases which led to claims that he had a morbid fear of sexual penetration."
