5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown {{has suggested that}} because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant {{to be affected by}} the gravitational <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached object is accepted in recent publications.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> the Andriyivskyy Descent is the baroque Saint Andrew's Church. It {{is located}} atop a hill {{overlooking}} the Podil neighborhood from the Andriyivskyy Descent. The idea {{to construct the}} Saint Andrew's Church came from the Russian Tsaress Elizabeth Petrovna. When she visited Kiev in 1747–1754, she laid the foundation brick of the church with her own hand, after which the church was constructed, to a design by the imperial architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli.|$|E

5|$|HD 28185 b was {{discovered}} by detecting small periodic variations in the radial velocity of its parent star caused by the gravitational <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> the planet. This was achieved by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. In 2001 {{it was announced that}} HD 28185 exhibited a wobble along the line-of-sight with a period of 383 days, with an amplitude indicating a minimum mass 5.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|The Minor Planet Center classifies the trans-Neptunian object 90377 Sedna as a scattered-disc object. Its {{discoverer}} Michael E.

5000|$|Multiple {{research}} studies {{have investigated the}} sexual <b>attraction</b> patterns <b>of</b> hebephilic and pedophilic men. The sexual attraction to children appears to fall along a continuum instead of being dichotomous. The <b>attractions</b> <b>of</b> hebephiles and pedophiles are less focused on the child's sex than are the <b>attractions</b> <b>of</b> [...] "teleiophiles" [...] (people who sexually prefer adults)—i.e., much larger proportions of hebephiles and pedophiles than teleiophiles report being attracted to both males and females.|$|R

5|$|The Roman invasion, and {{possibly}} the preceding period {{of involvement in the}} internal affairs of the south of England, was inspired in part by the potential of the Mendip Hills. A great deal of the <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> the lead mines may have been the potential for the extraction of silver.|$|E
5|$|The Tabularium, located {{underground}} {{beneath the}} piazza and hilltop, occupies a {{building of the}} same name built in the 1st century BC to hold Roman records of state.

5|$|The town {{voted in}} October 2007 {{to secede from}} the region of Veneto and join the {{neighbouring}} region, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. This was motivated by improved cultural ties with the small Ladin-speaking community in South Tyrol and the <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> lower taxes. The referendum is not executive and a final decision on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige.|$|E
5|$|Cormorant {{fishing is}} the {{representative}} tourist <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> Gifu. Though {{it occurs in}} many places in Japan, cormorant fishing on the Nagara River dates back more than 1,300 years. This is also the largest display of cormorant fishing in all of Japan, with six fishing masters going down the river at the same time, using their birds to catch ayu sweetfish. The season lasts from May 11 to October 15 every year and occurs each night, except during high water levels and the harvest moon.|$|E

5|$|Crucial to the {{attractiveness}} to investors of all MIS schemes is their taxation treatment. The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front tax deductions {{of the costs of}} investment. Investors paid Great Southern a fee to lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct the cost of the lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The tax deductible status of the investment was widely regarded as the main <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> MIS schemes to investors.|$|E
5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> adhesion, made me feel that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E

Alabama was transferred to the USS Alabama Battleship Commission, which had acquired the ship in order to turn her into a memorial. She was towed out of Bremerton on 2 July 1964, to Mobile, Alabama, where she currently resides as a museum ship, the main <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> Battleship Memorial Park.|$|E
5|$|Sitakunda {{is renowned}} for its {{numerous}} Islamic, Hindu and Buddhist shrines. It has 280 mosques, 8 mazars, 49 Hindu temples, 4 ashrams, and 3 Buddhist temples. Among its notable religious sites are the Chandranath Temple (a Shakti Peetha or holy pilgrimage site), Vidarshanaram Vihara (founded by the scholar Prajnalok Mahasthavir), and the Hammadyar Mosque (founded by Sultan Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah). The <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> Sitakunda as a tourist destination is elevated by these pilgrimage sites along with the hill range and the eco-park. Despite its diverse population, the area has gone through episodes of communal strife, including attacks on places of worship. There have been reports of activity by the Islamic militant group Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh since the early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary <b>attraction</b> <b>of</b> meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E
