We interviewed six site creators {{to understand the}} motivations they felt and the challenges they encountered. We found that these challenges ultimately resulted {{from a lack of}} information visibility, particularly concerning work in progress. Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective site’s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R

5|$|Oils {{that are}} used include heavy {{residual}} oil (HRO), animal fats, vegetable fats, and synthetic fats. HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, they form a thin film. Other substances <b>are</b> <b>added</b> to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation.

5|$|Ottawa has {{complex systems}} of both inflectional and derivational {{morphology}}. Inflectional morphology has {{a central role}} in Ottawa grammar. Noun inflection and particularly verb inflection indicate grammatical information through the use of prefixes and suffixes that <b>are</b> <b>added</b> to word stems.|$|E
5|$|Person {{and number}} are {{indicated}} by suffixing the oblique {{case of the}} relevant pronoun. The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from grammatical particles, which <b>are</b> <b>added</b> to the stem.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{transcript}} RNAs {{are often}} modified by enzymes after transcription. For example, a poly(A) tail and a 5' cap <b>are</b> <b>added</b> to eukaryotic pre-mRNA and introns are removed by the spliceosome.|$|E

5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl <b>are</b> <b>added</b> to aqueous HCl, they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
5|$|Chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) is a {{magnetic}} compound. Its ideal shape anisotropy, which imparts high coercivity and remnant magnetization, {{made it a}} compound superior to the γ-Fe2O3. Chromium(IV) oxide is used to manufacture magnetic tape used in high-performance audio tape and standard audio cassettes. Chromates can prevent corrosion of steel under wet conditions, and therefore chromates <b>are</b> <b>added</b> to drilling muds.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. The pieces are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces <b>are</b> <b>added</b> to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E

5|$|For the 1893 version a {{baritone}} solo, two bassoons, four {{horns and}} two trumpets <b>are</b> <b>added</b> {{to the original}} scoring.
