5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. <b>Allergy</b> shots can successfully treat an <b>allergy</b> to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E

5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple <b>allergy</b> also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of <b>allergy</b> can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have {{the highest levels of}} the protein that causes this reaction.|$|E
5|$|The immune {{response}} {{can be manipulated}} to suppress unwanted responses resulting from autoimmunity, <b>allergy,</b> and transplant rejection, and to stimulate protective responses against pathogens that largely elude the immune system (see immunization) or cancer.|$|E

50|$|Diets {{for those}} dogs {{allergic}} to food {{are made from}} limited ingredients or hypoallergenic recipes. Limited ingredients {{make it easier to}} identify the suspected allergens. In hypoallergenic recipes, manufacturers use those ingredients which are less likely to cause <b>allergies</b> to the dogs such as chicken, lamb, fish, and corn. Food <b>allergies</b> account for about 10% of all the <b>allergies</b> seen in dogs, being the most common cause after flea bite <b>allergies</b> and atopy (inhalant <b>allergies).</b> Food <b>allergies</b> generally account for 20% of the causes of itching and scratching in dogs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Allergies</b> in {{children}} are those causes, pathophsiology, treatments, management, practices {{and control of}} <b>allergies</b> that develop {{in children}}. [...] Up to 40 percent of children suffer from allergic rhinitis. And {{children are more likely}} to develop <b>allergies</b> if one or both parents have <b>allergies.</b> <b>Allergies</b> differ between adults and children. Part of the reason for this that the respiratory system in children is smaller. The bronchi and bronchioles are narrower so even a slight decrease in diameter of these airways can have serious consequences. In addition, children often 'outgrow' their <b>allergies.</b>|$|R
5|$|For a {{small number}} of people, taking aspirin can result in {{symptoms}} resembling an allergic reaction, including hives, swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true <b>allergy,</b> but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an overdose.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers require regular grooming. Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential.

Some Giant Schnauzers have an <b>allergy</b> to shampoo.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, O~3 Entertainment {{announced}} that it would be localizing Radirgy in February for North America exclusively for the GameCube under the new title of Radio <b>Allergy.</b> The company had previously localized MileStone's other shooter, Chaos Field. However, the release date was pushed back several times, and was eventually cancelled by June 2007 {{due to a lack of}} interest from retailers in stocking GameCube titles. MileStone began looking into options to include the game in a compilation for the Wii. Radio <b>Allergy</b> was finally localized for the Wii in the Ultimate Shooting Collection compilation along with Chaos Field and Karous. A sequel, Radirgy Noa, was released in 2009. Another title, Radirgy De Gojaru, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2014 in Japan.|$|E

5000|$|Food <b>allergies</b> to fish, {{unlike most}} <b>allergies,</b> often begin in adulthood. [...] The {{greatest}} risk from fish <b>allergies</b> is anaphylaxis, {{which can cause}} life-threatening breathing, cardiac, and gastrointestinal symptoms. [...] Pollock, salmon, cod, tuna, snapper, eel, and tilapia are among the fish that commonly elicit fish <b>allergies.</b> People often determine which fish {{to which they have}} <b>allergies</b> and avoid those types of fish. However, with common substitution of certain fish, avoiding certain species of fish can be difficult.|$|R
5|$|One form {{of apple}} <b>allergy,</b> {{often found in}} {{northern}} Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples {{that is similar to}} birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral <b>allergy</b> syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.|$|E

5|$|As a young child, Thorpe was sidelined by an <b>allergy</b> to chlorine. As a result, {{he did not}} swim in {{his first}} race until a school {{carnival}} {{at the age of}} seven. The <b>allergy</b> forced Thorpe to swim with his head out of the water; despite this ungainly technique, he won the race, primarily because of his significant size advantage. Thorpe gradually overcame the ailment and progressed to the captaincy of New South Wales for the Australian Primary Schools Championships in 1994. He subsequently won nine individual gold medals at the New South Wales Short Course Age Championships in September of the same year. In 1995, Thorpe started his secondary education at East Hills Boys Technology High School and switched coaches to swim alongside his sister under the tutelage of Doug Frost. It was a busy year for the family; Christina was selected for the Australian team to compete at the 1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Atlanta. Now six feet tall, Ian competed at his first Australian Age Championships, winning bronze medals in the 200m and 400m freestyle. He won all ten events at the New South Wales Age Championships.|$|E

40|$|TITLE: Food <b>allergies</b> and its {{influence}} on nutrition of contemporary Czech family AUTHOR: Barbora Vanišová DEPARTMENT: Department of Education SUPERVISOR: PaedDr. Eva Marádová, CSc. ABSTRACT: This bachelor thesis deals {{with the issue of}} food <b>allergies</b> and their effect on the nutrition of contemporary czech family, along with the possibilities how to handle the negative impact that <b>allergies</b> could have on the composition of the diet. The theoretical part predominantly concentrates on the food <b>allergies</b> as a whole, their symptoms, types, prevention, diagnosis and treatment; the practical part uses a questionnaire survey to investigate the condition of <b>allergies</b> in czech families, knowledge of them among families with an allergic member and also in general public, and the attitude to diet in terms of its change in families with allergic members. In the practical part the thesis as well researches, if there is a positive or negative impact of food <b>allergies</b> on the composition of czech families' diet, and evokes possible solutions, how the diversification of the diet considering the food <b>allergies</b> could be attained.

5|$|June Kim, {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily drew the artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate <b>allergy,</b> are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E
