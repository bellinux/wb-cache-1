5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We were talking <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> sometimes know that you would be better at love if only you were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

I’m curious <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> are, how your health is. We are well and plan {{to go to the}} camp. Today is a {{gorgeous}} day, we are in the best of spirits and have great hopes for the future…Don’t worry, girl, it’ll be fine. Be brave, stay well. Warm regards from my entire family and our Bernhard.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{described}} the performance as [...] "very cordial", {{with the audience}} close to performers, and that [...] "one show is never {{the same as the}} next because of the songs, of what they are. Blues is <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel today. One day, you're down; another day is real happy and giddy. We're all laughing. Randy's direction captures that. It's always so personal, bringing the audience into the piece." [...] As well as African music, the revue includes [...] "country, gospel, the old blues, Appalachian music," [...] featuring music by Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee, Mahalia Jackson, Jimmy Rogers, Nina Simone and Muddy Waters.|$|E

She commented [...] "If you {{want to create a}} waist, there's a dress that's going to do that for you too. We've designed it very much around the female body." [...] She also stated [...] "It's not about what size you are, it's <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> can minimise or accentuate parts of your body with clothing. That's what we've created." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2011, Jones and Burton reconvened at Burton's {{studio to}} finish Little Broken Hearts. At that time, Jones brought {{a handful of}} raw, emotionally charged new tunes she penned {{in the wake of}} a harsh breakup with her fiction-writer boyfriend. In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, she said, [...] "I always heard the old stories <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> write better songs when you go through some shit.

2500|$|She {{spoke about}} her {{research}} on women who come out as lesbians after living as a heterosexual, and their reluctance to talk about this, in the Observer newspaper: [...] "There {{is likely to be}} a fear of judgment from lesbians. There's a thing called heterosexual privilege that the heterosexual community doesn't know about. It's the ability to move freely in the world in a way that assumes that heterosexuality is natural. You don't have people asking you questions <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> got to be that way. You don't have to watch your back when you hold your lover's hand in public." ...|$|E

2500|$|McKinsey & Company asked Mulally how he {{maintained}} his {{mental and physical}} stamina, to which he responded: [...] "Everybody always talks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> need to manage your time. You need to manage your energy as well. You first have to ask, 'What gives me energy?' There can be lots of sources: your family, exercise, your spiritual well-being... In our house, we had a family meeting every week—the family BPR —where we reviewed what {{we needed to do}} and the support required to get us through the week. It is another kind of process step, and a really important one." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{movie is}} based on Sully's {{autobiography}} , rights to which were optioned by producers Frank Marshall and Allyn Stewart in 2010. They developed the screenplay with Stewart's partner executive producer Kipp Nelson, hiring screenwriter Todd Komarnicki. From the start, Sullenberger wanted the film to encompass [...] "that sense of our common humanity", noting that the incident had taken place shortly after the 2008 Great Recession. He explains: [...] "People were wondering if everything was about self-interest and greed. They were doubting human nature. Then all these people acted together, selflessly, to get something really important done. In a way, I think it gave everyone {{a chance to have}} hope, {{at a time when we}} all needed it." [...] Komarnicki said the difficulty was not depicting the landing in the river, but the investigation afterwards: [...] "It wasn't really a challenge of what to do with the event since that is the thing everyone knows about, it was more <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> parse out the information about the man slowly falling apart and becoming a hero in the eyes of the world when internally and with the investigators it was actually seemingly going the other way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rob Reiner {{said in a}} 2014 {{interview}} about his on- and off-screen chemistry with O'Connor, [...] "We did over 200 shows {{in front of a}} live audience. So I learned a lot about what audiences like, what they don't like, how stories are structured. I would {{spend a lot of time}} in the writing room and I actually wrote some scripts. And from Carroll O'Connor I learned a lot <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesn't have to push things. You can let the story and the dialogue support you if it's good. I had great people around me and I took from all the people who were around." [...] He also stated, when he compared Carroll O'Connor's character to his acting mentor's real-life persona: [...] "Carroll O'Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. He's still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I don't think anybody's all good or all bad." ...|$|E
