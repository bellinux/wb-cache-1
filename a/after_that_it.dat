5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 {{article on}} the origin of the Magnificat, and for some authors still <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> was {{generally}} assumed that Bach had composed his Magnificat in the quiet time of Advent 1723 for a first performance at the Christmas vespers. For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise partly in German, partly in Latin to be inserted at certain points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E

5|$|During {{most of the}} 18th century, {{the penny}} was a small silver coin rarely seen in circulation, and that was principally struck {{to be used for}} Maundy money or other royal charity. Beginning in 1787, the chronic {{shortage}} of good money resulted in the wide circulation of private tokens, including large coppers valued at one penny. In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies over the next decade. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for circulation, and the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.|$|E

5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|This river {{valve system}} {{was one of}} the first parts of the dam to be built when the dam project started in 1961, because its initial purpose was to divert the river while the dam was under construction. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> served various purposes, {{including}} as a possible emergency release valve. Since the accident, DWR had implemented a standing order that prohibited the operation of the river outlet system and significantly limited access to the river valve chamber. Following the accident, DWR entered into a 2012 Agreement with CalOSHA to hire a third party expert to improve the safety of the River Valve Outlet System (RVOS) and make it operational again. In 2014, DWR embarked on an accelerated refurbishment program to respond to concerns about operational needs during the ongoing drought. The system was mostly refurbished and was used during 2014 and 2015 to meet Endangered Species Act temperature requirements for the Feather River. Some additional refurbishments were being made to portions of the RVOS and were expected to conclude in early 2017.|$|E
5|$|Wheel of Fortune premiered on January 6, 1975, at 10:30am (9:30 Central) on NBC. Lin Bolen, {{then the}} head of daytime programming, {{purchased}} the show from Griffin to compensate him for canceling the original Jeopardy! series, which had one year remaining on its contract. Jeopardy! aired its final episode on the Friday before Wheels premiere. The original Wheel aired on NBC, in varying time slots between 10:30 am and noon, until June 30, 1989. Throughout that version's run, episodes were generally 30 minutes in length, except for six weeks of shows aired between December 1975 and January 1976 which were 60 minutes in length. NBC announced the cancellation of the show in August 1980, but it stayed on the air following a decision to cut the duration of The David Letterman Show from 90 to 60 minutes. The network Wheel moved to CBS on July 17, 1989, and remained there until January 14, 1991. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> briefly returned to NBC, replacing Let's Make a Deal, but was canceled permanently on September 20 of that year.|$|E

In March 2009, it was announced that the Department of Indigenous Affairs had given the City of Swan more than A$500,000 to develop the park.|$|E
