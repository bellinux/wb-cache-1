40|$|Should {{environmental}} policy be {{set at the}} federal level to counter incentives for "environmental dumping" when states act non-cooperatively? Assuming that environmental damage costs are known only by state governments, I ask whether this asymmetry of information could rationalize a federal government harmonizing environmental policies <b>across</b> <b>states.</b> I show that asymmetric information narrows the difference in environmental policies <b>across</b> <b>states,</b> relative to full information, but does not justify harmonization. The welfare loss from harmonization rises sharply with the variance in damage costs <b>across</b> <b>states,</b> and can erode the benefit of setting policy {{at the federal level}} to counter environmental dumping...|$|R

This led him to transfer to the West Lafayette, Indiana, campus of Purdue University, which graduated him in 1942 with a bachelor of Science degree.

The organization was able to get the money rescinded, and in November 1910, worked with the city to increase their maintenance fund for the library. Carnegie then raised the grant to $27,500 at the lobbying of Lulu Bush (daughter-in-law to Asahel Bush) and the Woman’s Club deeded the lot and the other library assets to the city of Salem.|$|E

He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by Gun Owners of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of guns or ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyze whether {{regional}} economic integration <b>across</b> U. S. <b>states</b> conditions local labor-market adjustment. We examine the mechanisms through which states absorb changes in labor supplies and whether industry production techniques are similar <b>across</b> <b>states.</b> There are two main findings. First, states absorb changes in employment primarily through changes in production techniques that are common <b>across</b> all <b>states</b> and through changes in the output of traded goods, with the former mechanism playing the larger role. In contrast, state-specific changes in production techniques, which are one indication of state-specific changes in relative factor prices, account for relatively little factor absorption. Second, industry production techniques are very similar <b>across</b> <b>states,</b> especially for neighboring states and states with similar relative labor supplies. Both sets of {{results are consistent with}} productivity-adjusted FPE <b>across</b> either all <b>states</b> or groupings of related states...|$|R

In Game 2, Talbot scored {{to take the lead in}} the third period, and Staal added an empty-net goal to give the Penguins a 4–2 win and a 2–0 series lead. The win was the Penguins' seventh consecutive home playoff win, a franchise record, improving on a six-game streak in the 1992 playoffs. The Penguins also became only the fifth team to start the playoffs with a 10–1 record, and the first since the Detroit Red Wings in 1995. Game 3 saw the series move <b>across</b> <b>state</b> to Philadelphia; the Penguins struck quickly with goals from Ryan Whitney and Hossa within the first eight minutes. Hossa added his second goal on an empty net to seal the victory. With the win, the Penguins become the first team since the 1983 Edmonton Oilers to start the playoffs 11–1. The Penguins failed to close out the Eastern Conference Finals with a sweep of the Flyers in Game 4, losing 4–2. The Flyers jumped out to a 3–0 lead in the first period. The Penguins fought back getting two goals from Jordan Staal in the third period, but Joffrey Lupul's second goal on an empty net sealed the win for the Flyers. The series returned to Pittsburgh for Game 5, where the Penguins won their eighth consecutive home game by a final score of 6–0, the Prince of Wales Trophy, and a trip to the Stanley Cup Final.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} variations in Medicare expenditures <b>across</b> <b>states.</b> METHODS: 1992 data on average Medicare expenditures per enrollee, users of services per 1000 enrollees, service use per user, and payment {{per unit of}} service were compared <b>across</b> <b>states</b> for various services. Weighted least squares regression analysis {{was employed to examine}} total Medicare expenditures per enrollee by state. RESULTS: Variation in Medicare expenditures <b>across</b> <b>states</b> is driven more by average number of service users per 1000 enrollees and average service units per user than by average payment per service unit. Medicare expenditures per enrollee by state are primarily a function of Medicare HMO penetration rate (P =. 000), urban area (P =. 001), hospital bed supply (P =. 005), elderly mortality rate (P =. 012), Medicare physician assignment rate (P =. 026), percentage of primary care practitioners (P =. 042), and interactions between urban elderly and percentage of primary care physicians (P =. 005) and Black elderly and nursing home bed supply (P =. 012).
