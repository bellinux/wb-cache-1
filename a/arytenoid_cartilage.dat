2500|$|The {{next three}} layers {{comprise}} lamina LPs, which is stratified by their histological composition of elastin and collagen fibers, with fibroblast, myofibroblast and macrophages interspersed sparsely. The superficial layer LPs (SLLPs), {{also known as}} Reinke's space, is composed of amorphous substance and microfibrils which allows this cover layer to “slide” over the deep layer easily. The vibratory and viscoelastic characteristics of human VFs are mainly attributed to the molecular composition of SLLPs. In normal vocal fold, the jelly-like “Reinke's space” is very loose and abundant with interstitial proteins such as hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, proteoglycan like fibromodulin, decorin and versican. All these ECM components together regulate the water content of vocal fold and render the viscous shear property for it. [...] The squamous epithelium and superficial lamina propria form the vocal mucosa which serves as vibratory component in phonation. The mucosa layer vibrates at a frequency range of 100–1000Hz and displacement at 1mm approximately. The intermediate layer of LPs consists primarily of elastic fiber while the deep layer LP consists of fewer elastin and more collagen fibers. These two layers have poor differentiated boundary but are increasingly stiffer than SLLPs. The intermediate and deep layers of LPs compose the vocal ligaments which are enclosed within the vocal folds and are responsible for strain in phonation. Within the ECM community of vocal ligament, fibrous proteins such as elastin and collagen are pivotal in maintaining the proper elastic biomechanical property of vocal fold. Elastin fibers impart the flexibility and elasticity of the vocal folds and, collagen {{is responsible for the}} resistance and resiliece to tensile strength. The normal strain level of vocal ligament ranges from 0–15% during phonation These fibrous proteins exhibit distribution variations spatially and temporally due to fibroblast turnover during tissue maturation and aging. Each vocal ligament is a band of yellow elastic tissue attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the vocal process of the <b>arytenoid</b> <b>cartilage.</b>|$|E
50|$|The arytenoid {{adduction}} procedure alleviates {{these symptoms}} by manually positioning the paralyzed vocal cord towards the midline.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} whether {{trauma to the}} larynx caused by nasotracheal intubation induced mucosal ulceration of the <b>arytenoid</b> <b>cartilages</b> of adult horses, and to determine the incidence of such ulceration in yearling Thoroughbred horses {{and its effect on}} athletic performance. METHODS: Laryngeal trauma was induced in a group of 21 adult horses by introduction of a nasogastric tube into the trachea three times within 5 min. Injury to the <b>arytenoid</b> <b>cartilages</b> or vocal cords was subjectively assessed immediately after intubation, and thereafter at weekly intervals for 10 weeks. The outcome and athletic performance of 33 Thoroughbred yearling horses with idiopathic disease of the <b>arytenoid</b> <b>cartilages,</b> diagnosed at the yearling sales, were evaluated and compared to those of control horses of the same gender and age, from the same sale. RESULTS: Mucosal injury was noted immediately after intubation in every horse.

40|$|Abstract. In {{a random}} sample of 30, 444 larynges from {{slaughtered}} beef cattle, 441 (1. 4 %) had chronic diphtheria and 1, 345 (4. 4 %) had papillomatosis. Both types of lesions were centered in mucous membranes over the vocal processes and medial angles of the <b>arytenoid</b> <b>cartilages.</b> Since they are found in the same anatomical locations as laryngeal contact ulcers, we hypothesize that ulcers are primary and diphtheria and papillomatosis are secondary. Diphtheria, an acute or chronic infectious noncontagious disease, is characterized clinically by fever, dyspnea and stertor, and pathologically by bilateral necrosis in mucous membranes over <b>arytenoid</b> <b>cartilages.</b> The infection is an invasion of non-covering tissues by Fusobacterium necrophorum. Laryngeal papillomatosis, a chronic infectious disease, is characterized clinically by stertor and pathologically by epithelial fronds on the mucous membranes covering the <b>arytenoid</b> <b>cartilages.</b> This infection is a penetration of deep tissues by papovavirus. F. necrophorum and papovavirus are common, and possibly ubiquitous, pathogens in feedlot environments. Beginning in summer 1977 and continuing through the next four seasons, we examined larynges from fatally diseased cattle for acute diphtheria, and fro...|$|R
5000|$|In {{infantile}} laryngomalacia, the supraglottic larynx (the part {{above the}} vocal cords) is tightly curled, {{with a short}} band holding the cartilage shield in the front (the epiglottis) tightly to the mobile cartilage {{in the back of}} the larynx (the arytenoids). These bands are known as the aryepiglottic folds. The shortened aryepiglottic folds cause the epiglottis to be curled on itself. This is the well known [...] "omega shaped" [...] epiglottis in laryngomalacia. Another common finding of laryngomalacia involves the posterior or back part of the larynx, where the <b>arytenoid</b> <b>cartilages</b> or the mucosa/tissue over the <b>arytenoid</b> <b>cartilages</b> can collapse into the airway and cause airway obstruction.|$|R
