METHODS:After cutting 2 mm of the distal extremities, the polyethylene crownswere placed on the mandibularincisors. In contrast to the original model, we used flow composite instead of wire in order to maximize the retention ofcrowns. Different concentrations of capsaicin (10, 25 and 100 mg/ml) and formalin were administrated into the cavitiesunder the crowns. The algesic agent-induced behaviors were evaluated. RESULTS:The modified model had no liquid leakage. Furthermore, composite allowed the crowns to remain for <b>alonger</b> period of time. Capsaicin 25, 100 mg/ml and formalin applications induced significantly more painfulstimulation compared with control groups (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{possible}} role of medications in {{the occurrence of}} neuropsychiatric damage in patientswith systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Material and methods: SLE patients from the LUMINA (Lupus inMinorities: Nature vs. Nurture) cohort (ACR criteria, ≥ 16 years of age at enrollment and ≤ 5 years of diseaseduration) were studied. Time-to-neuropsychiatric damage [defined according with the Systemic Lupus CollaboratingClinics (SLICC) Damage Index (SDI) : neurocognitive impairment or psychosis, seizures, cranial or peripheralneuropathy, stroke or surgical resection not due to malignancies and transverse myelitis] was examined by univariableand multivariable Cox regression analyses. Propensity score analyses were done to further determine the possibleprotective role of hydroxychloroquine in neuropsychiatric damage occurrence. Results: Six-hundred and thirtytwopatients were studied. Age, Caucasian ethnicity, disease activity over time, diabetes and abnormal illness-relatedbehaviors were associated with a shorter time-to-the occurrence of neuropsychiatric damage whereas photosensitivity,anemia, Raynaud’s phenomenon, hydroxychloroquine and a medium dose of prednisone were associated with <b>alonger</b> time.

40|$|The ultrafast {{response}} of singly negatively charged C 60 fullerene in solution {{has been investigated}} by femtosecond pump-probe absorption spectroscopy and transient anisotropy in the visible and near-infrared region. Pump excitation within the near-infrared band demonstrates that this spectral feature {{can be described as}} avibrational progression associated with asingle electronic transition. Relaxation of the first electronically excited state occurs primarily by internal conversion with atime constant of 3 ps, slightly depending on the solvents, tetrahydrofuran or o-dichlorobenzene, and also on the excitation wavelength. An excitation of the second electronically excited state around 530 nm leads to an ultrafast internal conversion to the first excited state with apulse-limited time constant of less than 100 fs. As aminor channel, stimulated emission in the spectral regime of 1150 - 1300 nm was observed from the first electronically excited state both after near-infrared and visible excitation. After internal conversion to the electronic ground state, C 60 − dissipates its excess internal energy into the solvent on <b>alonger</b> timescale of 40 - 70 ps.

We assessed concordance in spatial genetic variation between the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and one of its fungal symbionts, Grosmanniaclavigera, in western Canada using neutral genetic markers. We examined how spatial heterogeneity affects genetic variation within beetles and fungi and developed a novel integrated landscape genetics approach to assess reciprocal genetic influences between species using constrained ordination. We also compared landscape genetic models built using Euclidean distances based on allele frequencies to traditional pair-wise Fst. Both beetles and fungi exhibited moderate levels of genetic structure over the total study area, low levels of structure in the south, and more pronounced fungal structure in the north. Beetle genetic variation was associated with geographic location while that of the fungus was not. Pinevolume and climate explained beetle genetic variation in the northern region of recent outbreak expansion. Reciprocal genetic relationships were only detectedin the south where there has been <b>alonger</b> history of beetle infestations. The Euclidean distance and Fst-based analyses resulted in similar models in the north and over the entire study area, but differences between methods in the south suggest that genetic distances measures should be selected based on ecological and evolutionary contexts.

40|$|International audienceRip {{currents}} are wave-driven intense seaward-flowing jets {{of water}} {{that are important to}} both beach morphodynamics and the overall ecosystem. Rip currents are also the leading deadly hazard to recreational beach users worldwide. More specifically, the African region is reported to have the highest rates of drowning in the world, yet both the occurrence and the type of rips developing along the African beaches are unknown. In February 2013, a 12 -day field experiment was performed at the high-energy low-tide-terraced sandy beach of Grand Popo beach (Benin, West Africa). Human drifter data and video imagery are combined to address wave-driven circulation and rip current activity. Results show two prevailing rip current types. (1) Low-energy (~ 0. 2 - 0. 4 m/s) swash rips, with short life-spans of about 1 minute, extend about 5 - 10 m offshore and occur preferably at mid to high tide at fixed locations in the center of beach cusps. (2) Higher-energy (0. 2 - 0. 8 m/s) surfzone flash rips become active with the onset of intense wave breaking across the low-tide terrace. They tend to migrate downdrift with <b>alonger</b> time-span of about 2 - 5 minutes. The relatively weak longshore current (0. 2 - 0. 55 m/s) measured during the experiment suggests that flash rips were driven by vorticity generated by wave breaking rather than shear instabilities of the longshore current. Swash rips and flash rips are common at Grand Popo and often co-exist. We propose a conceptual model of both flash and swash rip activity on this stretch of the West African coast...|$|E

This position has been reached {{by a combination of}} naturalresources, political determination and technology development. A major contributor to this is the extensive utilization of district heatingwhich amounts to around 50 TWh per year, and which covers about half of thetotal need for industrial and domestic buildings. The district heating is basedmainly on combustion of bio fuels together with waste and some peat. This practice is generally very positive from a sustainability perspective forthe following reasons: (1) bio fuels are renewable, and so is peat, although over <b>alonger</b> time span; (2) waste is being recovered for energy purposes; and (3) ashmaterial is, in many cases, re-circulated and recycled. However, sustainability is not only about total percentages, but also on thequality in the processes, especially in terms of qualification of fuels and ashesand the associated possibilities for more efficient combustion and incinerationprocesses as well as ash utilization.

Withmammography screening, breast cancer can be detected in an early stage which improves theoverall survival (OS). 20 - 30 % of the breast cancer tumors are overexpressing humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2), which is a protein that stimulates cell proliferation. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) is a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets the HER 2 -proteinand prevent the signals for cell proliferation. Trastuzumab has earlier been used for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

40|$|An {{alternative}} way {{to invest}} {{on the stock}} market is to invest in IPO’s. An IPO (InitialPublic Offering) is the first time a company goes public on a stock market, giving outshares to private investors and financial institutions. However, there might be someuncertainties about the share price as it never has been traded on the stock exchangebefore and it could therefore be difficult to determine a reasonable value for the shareprice. Consequently, if the offering price for the investor is significantly lower thanthe “correct valued” price it will generate positive initial return during the first tradingday and this phenomenon is labelled as underpricing, generating more “money on thetable”. Still, previous researches display an underperformance among IPO’s during <b>alonger</b> period after the introduction compared to already established companies withinthe same sector, arguing that investors should sell their shares early after the firsttrading day.

A final objective for thestudy is to determine if the level of underpricing is affected by some explanatoryvariables.

Recently, the value university leaders by and large place on their dental schools was demonstrated at the October 1998 Summit Conference held by the American Association of Dental Schools (AADS) —the first time in health professions education that deans and senior university administrators gathered to discuss the future of the profession. The good relationship between dental schools and their universities is not one that dental educators can afford to take for granted. In this article, the evolution of dental education as part of the university is presented, as well as the definition of value according to the university. Dental schools add value to the university by 1) establishing a curriculum that integrates both basic and clinical sciences and skills related to diagnosis and treatment that require dexterity as well as knowledge; 2) featuring an extremely wide variety of types of faculty members, diversifying the environment, and providing a source of constant invigoration of the curriculum; and 3) advancing a mission of oral health research that has led to tremendous progress in primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of disease.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the global aspects of plasmaconvection in the {{magnetosphere}} {{as measured by the}} low-altitudepolar orbiting Astrid- 2 and FAST satellites. The major focus ison the electric field measurements, but they are alsocomplemented by magnetic field, ion and electron particle data,which is fundamental for the understanding of theelectrodynamics of the high-latitude auroral ovals and polarcap, which are the regions analysed here. The essential subjectof this thesis is the so-called magnetic reconnection processthat drives plasma convection in the Earth's magnetosphere. Itis shown that the ionospheric convection, being intimatelycoupled to the magnetospheric convection, responds in about 15 - 25 min depending on geomagnetic activity after the arrivalof the solar wind at the magnetopause. It also responds on <b>alonger</b> time scale, around 55 - 75 min, which is interpreted asthe unloading of solar wind energy previously stored in thelarge-scale current system of the magnetotail. These resultshave been found previously using ionospheric parameters such asthe auroral electrojet AL index. What is new is that these sameresults are reproduced by using a discrete set of cross-polarpotential measurements. Using an extensive set of electric andmagnetic field data combined with particle precipitation datafrom the FAST satellite, it is shown that the reconnectionprocess can also be applied to explain features of sunwardplasma convection in the polar cap with a likely antiparallelmerging site in the lobe magnetopause region. The lobereconnection is found to depend strongly on IMF Byand to coexist with dayside subsolar merging. Finally, a comparison is performed between the Weimer electricfield model and Astrid- 2 electric field data. Empiricalelectric field models are important in understanding thecomplete convection pattern at any one time, something, whichcannot be provided by measurements from single satellites.

The existing housing stock represents a largeamount of the bought energy need for heating and a simple method forquickly determining the energy performance is needed. There are many different methods for estimating the energyperformance of buildings. In this report the feasibility of using asingle-variate steady state method to investigate energy performancehas been tested. Bought energy need in single-family houses in a coldclimate has been observed during the cold period. The observationshave been made {{with the help of}} a measurement system requiring aminimal installation. The heat loss factor of the observed buildingshas been determined using the energy signature approach and differenttime scales have been tried. The result shows that to determine the heat loss factor of single-familybuildings, a single-variate method is valid. Daily averages are a goodtime scale for houses using radiators under the windows to heat thebuilding. Buildings with floor heating in concrete slab need to have <b>alonger</b> time scale, around 3 days. The method does not account for occupancy levels and separateenergy use in specific installations is not easy to estimate with theminimalized measurement setup. A combination of heat sources suchas district heating, electrical heating, heat recovery and/or fire stove isproblematic to handle with the energy signature method if enoughobservations for al heat sources can be achieved.

40|$|Purpose of the study: Basic {{life support}} (BLS) and {{automated}} externaldefibrillation (AED) represent important {{skills to be}} acquired duringpregraduate medical training. Since 3 years, our medical school hasintroduced a BLS-AED course (with certification) for all second yearmedical students. Few reports about quality and persistence over timeof BLS-AED learning are available to date in the medical literature. Comprehensive evaluation of students' acquired skills was performedat {{the end of the}} 2008 academic year, 6 month after certification. Materials and methods: The students (N = 142) were evaluated duringa 9 minutes «objective structured clinical examination» (OSCE) station. Out of a standardized scenario, they had to recognize a cardiac arrestsituation and start a resuscitation process. Their performance wererecorded on a PC using an Ambuman(TM) mannequin and the AmbuCPR software kit(TM) during a minimum of 8 cycles (30 compressions: 2 ventilations each). BLS parameters were systematically checked. Nostudent-rater interactions were allowed during the whole evaluation. Results: Response of the victim was checked by 99 % of the students(N = 140), 96 % (N = 136) called for an ambulance and/or an AED. Openthe airway and check breathing were done by 96 % (N = 137), 92 % (N = 132) gave 2 rescue breaths. Pulse was checked by 95 % (N= 135), 100 %(N = 142) begun chest compression, 96 % (N = 136) within 1 minute. Chest compression rate was 101 ± 18 per minute (mean ± SD), depthcompression 43 ± 8 mm, 97 % (N = 138) respected a compressionventilationratio of 30 : 2. Conclusions: Quality of BLS skills acquisition is maintained during a 6 -month period after a BLS-AED certification. Main targets of 2005 AHAguidelines were well respected. This analysis represents one of thelargest evaluations of specific BLS teaching efficiency reported. Furtherfollow-up is needed to control the persistence of these skills during <b>alonger</b> time period and noteworthy {{at the end of the}} pregraduatemedical curriculum...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{simulations}} play {{a profound}} and fundamental role inmodern theoretical physics, chemistry and materials science. Tounderstand the complex physics of metally liquids, metals,quasicrystals and metally glasses a working model imposing thelocal and global order is needed. Experiments and theory havepredicted the local order in liquid metals to beicosahedral. The current {{work has been}} done using molecular dynamicscomputer simulations of a monatomic system using a simplepair-potential for the interactions. Two new pair-potentialshas been developed, the Zetterling- 1 (Z 1) and Zetterling- 2 (Z 2) potentials. They are specifically modeled to impose icosahedralorder. The basis {{for the development of the}} potentials was theold Dzugutov potential which is known to freeze into adodecagonal quasicrystal. The new Zetterling potentials have <b>alonger</b> interaction range and a narrower first minimum. The morenarrow first minimum will enhance the local icosahedralordering and the longer interaction range was introduced toincorporate a second maximum in the potential mimicing theFriedel oscillations found in metallic systems. These Friedeloscillations are due to the singularity which arises at theFermi surface due to the screening of the positive charge bythe electron gas. Five papers are included in the study. The first two papersare studies of icosahedral clustering in the liquid andsupercooled liquid. The simulations in Paper I was done usingthe old Dzugutov potential while the new potentials were usedin Paper II using both molecular dynamics and the Basin Hoppingalgorithm presented in Chapter 5. Paper III considers theconcept of dynamical ergodicity in the context of thesuper-cooled liquid behaviour. The simulations were made usingthe old Dzugutov potential. Paper IVr eports a moleculardynamics simulation using the Dzugutov potential undersuper-cooling. A formation of icosahedrally structured domainswith distinctly slow diffusion which grows with cooling in alow-dimensional manner and percolate around Tc, the criticaltemperature of the mode-coupling theory. A sharp slowing downof the structural relaxation relative to diffusion is observed. It is concluded that this effect cannot be accounted for by thespatial variation in atomic mobility. The low-dimensionalclustering is discussed as a possible mechanism of fragility. Paper Vin vestigates the crystallization of a simple monatomicliquid model which utilizes the Zetterling- 1 potential. Thesystem forms a thermodynamically stable solid phase exhibitingcubic symmetry. Its diffraction pattern is identified as thatof γ-brass, a tetrahedrally packed crystalline structurewith 52 atoms in the unit cell.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{operations}} regarding the tubing hanger crown plugs {{and the internal}} tree cap are studied and analyzed based on experience data collected from the Statoilo perated fields of Norne, Gullfaks, Åsgard and Heidrun. The Internal Tree Cap (ITC) has been analyzed considering operations involving puling of the lower Tubing Hanger Crown Plug (THCP) through the ball valve. Due {{to the extent of}} the problems seen with operating the ball valve, the cap is recommended pulled before pulling the lower crown plug. A contingency procedure is described in form of a decision tree, and should be use if the cap for some reason is not pulled. For the lower THCP problems have been identified for both pulling and setting operations. Problems with the Upper Wireline Plug (UWLP) are mostly during setting operations. For the lower THCP premature setting of the plug {{is one of the main}} problems. The premature setting is seen in connection with use of a brass pin as the upper shear pin in the CPHRT. A steel-steel combination for the two shear pins in the hydraulic running tool is therefore recommended. The CPHRT should also always be checked for water intrusion in order to ensure that the pistons in the RT are free to move all theway down when trying to lock the dogs into the tubing hanger nipple profile. It is recommended that the number of pistons in the running tool and the setting pressure should follow the table given in the Halliburton manual. Different methods have been used for pulling the THCP. Equalizing across the plug isseen as a necessity for a successful pulling operation. The pulling method with the highest success rate is the”Pressure up above” method. This method is currently just in use for the RLWI system but it is recommended that it be adapted and used for pulling through the WOR. Braided wire should be used when pulling the plug. Displacing fluid through the ¼” TCI-line between the upper and lower plug is seen asone of the challenges when trying to set the UWLP. Calculations done for setting inthe WOR and MR show that the pressure needed in the riser is dependent on the displacement velocity. The higher the pressure in the riser the faster the fluid willdisplace through the TCI-line. In the MR only hydrostatic pressure is available so <b>alonger</b> displacement time should be accounted for. A design failure with the UWLP setting tool has been investigated. When the runningtool is set in compression, a premature energizing of the plug locking dogs can occurand the plug is not able to set. It is recommended that the running tool should be held in tension until the plug has landed and it should be evaluated if a re-design of the tool is needed. New technology regarding the crown plugs is presented. This new technology includes an equalizing crown plug, a motorized setting tool and a pulling/jetting toolall under development for FMC Technologies. Best practice guidelines are developing for the installation and retrieval of the crown plugs based on the analyses performed. Best practice guidelines and recommendations are also made for operating the ITC. The analysis and recommendations given in this thesis should be used as a basis for developing a finalized best practice for crown plug operations. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis reports the theoreticalinvestigations on the geometrical and electronic structures of small siliconclusters doped with some representative main group elements, including Li, Mg,B, Al and also C by using quantum chemical calculations. Deep understanding oftheir geometric and electronic structures, energetics and bonding phenomenaconstitutes a necessary {{step in the}} extensive and intensive search forpromising clusters {{that could be considered}} as building blocks for furtherassemblies. Our searches for minima on thepotential energy surfaces were performed using two different approaches. In thefirst, we used a stochastic genetic algorithm to generate as many guessstructures as possible. Equilibrium structures that were initially detectedusing low-level computations, were then reoptimized using higher level methods. In the second approach, we made use of a chemical intuition, in that initialstructures of clusters SinXm were manually constructedby either substituting Si-atoms of the corresponding silicon frameworksby other element atoms, or adding dopant-atoms at various positions on surfacesof the Sin clusters. Theuse of the genetic algorithm is less effective for producing singlydoped-clusters having small sizes because most of relevant structures in Si clustersare relatively well known. On the contrary, the multi-doped and larger sizeclusters imply a huge number of initial guess structures and thus make thegenetic search necessary and more effective, even though such a search is oftentedious and computationally demanding. Nevertheless, only a combination ofdifferent search approaches allows a consistent set of lower-energy structuresto be obtained. We are confident that the isomers reported in this thesis atleast correspond to the lower-energy equilibrium structures. However, not onlya careful search is required, but the accuracy of the computational methodsused is equally crucial in the determination of global minima. The low-lying isomers of the clusterswere identified on the basis of theoretical results obtained by hybrid (U) B 3 LYPfunctional in conjunction with the 6 - 311 +G(d) basis set (d polarization plus spdiffuse functions), and then the ground states are assigned by high accuracy computationalmethods such as the composite G 3 B 3 and G 4 methods and when possible also the coupled-clustertheory extrapolated to the complete basis set CCSD(T) /CBS protocol. Concerningthe energetics, different basic thermochemical parameters of the clustersconsidered including total atomization energies (TAE), standard enthalpies offormation (&# 916;Hf),ionization energies (IE), electron affinities (EA), binding energies (Eb), embedded energy (EE) anddissociation energies (De) were determined using the Gn (G 3 B 3 and G 4) and CCSD(T) /CBS approaches. For bare silicon clusters, a uniform set of standard heats offormation for the cationic and anionic Sinclusters were determinedfor up to n = 13. Insome cases, variations between G 4 and CBS TAE values are relatively large. The differences of energeticproperties between both G 4 and CBS methods can be understood from the ways ofcomputing single point electronic energies, as well as the geometries ofclusters used. Geometry is beyond any doubt an important factor in thethermochemical evaluation. For these systems, experimentalresults in the current literature were also characterized by large uncertainties,including the actual uncertainty of the standard heat of formation of the Siatom. For otherparameters such as IE s and EAs,they were better predicted, in part due to a certain mutual cancellation oferrors in the evaluation of relative energies. The corresponding G 4 results areexpected to be accurate to, or even better than, ± 0. 15 eV. For lithiumdoped silicon clusters, the adiabatic (AIEs) and vertical (VIEs) ionizationenergies of the SinLim clusters were evaluated. CalculatedAIE and VIE values at the B 3 LYP/ 6 / 311 +G(d) and CCSD(T) /aug-cc-pVDZ levels forSi 6 Li 2, Si 7 Li, Si 10 Li, Si 11 Licompare quite well with the corresponding experimental results obtained usingthe photo-ionization efficiency measurements. For borondoped silicon clusters, heats of formation calculated by both G 4 andCCSD(T) /CBS methods showed good agreement with available experimental data. Overall, it appears that an accurateevaluation of the TAEs and thereby the standard heats of formation of silicon-basedclusters remains a great challenge for quantum chemical computations in order to attain thechemical accuracy of ± 1. 0 kcal/mol. Due to the non-classical bonding of clusters,the use of other thermochemical approaches (such as bond separation reactions) and more economic computational methods could not be applied. The only optionleft is to increase the quality of the wavefunctions in going beyond theCCSD(T) level. However, our preliminary computations using the full CCSDT treatmentpointed out that it is much more computer-demanding than the CCSD(T) method,which goes beyond our actual computing resources. Based on the geometricalcharacteristics of the ground states, a growth mechanism for each series ofbinary silicon clusters SinXm can now beestablished. Generally, alkali (Li) orearth-alkali (Mg) dopants prefers add on an edge or a face of Sin frameworks, whereas theboron group 13 element (B, Al) favors substitution into one of the Si positionsin Sin+ 1 counterparts. Due to the shorter B-Si bond lengths, as compared with the Al-Si counterparts,the B impurity can intrude inside the corresponding Si n cage (for up to n&# 8805; 8). In particular, the neutral structures of doubly impurities doped siliconclusters SinX 2,(X = Li, Mg, Al) have similar way of growing up: one dopant atom substitutesinto a position of Sin+ 1,whereas the other is usually added on an edge, or a face, of the existingcluster. Our theoretical results also predicted that some closed-shellsystems such as Si 9 B-, Si 10 B+, Si 9 Al-,and Si 4 C 2 + are characterized by enhanced stabilities. Theirhigher thermodynamic stabilities can be understood by the Jellium shell model(JSM). According to JSM, the valence electrons are supposed to befreely itinerant in a simple mean-field potential formed by the nuclei of atomsand core electrons, the valence electrons fill the hydrogen-like orbitals &# 8204;&# 8204;followingthe pattern of orbitals as [1 S 21 P 61 D 102 S 21 F 142 P 61 G 182 D 10 ]etc Within this model, the numbers of valence electrons of 8, 20, 34, 40, 56 and 68  emerge as the magic numbersthat actually correspond to a complete filling of the successive shellelectrons. Concerning the bonding phenomena, electron localization techniques (ELF and ELI-D) were used to locate the whereabouts of electrons, and thereby toidentify the chemical bonds of some specific clusters such as Si­ 3,Si 4, Si 42 +, Si 4 C 2 +, andSi 9 C. Calculations of the ring current, which is the magneticresponse of a molecule, were also carried out in order to probe their aromaticity. This study provided a further supportfor the point of view that the existence of delocalized occupied molecularorbitals in a planar molecule is a necessary but not sufficient condition toassign a certain aromatic character (aromatic, non-aromatic or anti-aromatic) to that specific type of electrons. Different criteria (such as the magneticring current) need to be considered for a more consistent evaluation of thispopular but intriguing molecular property. In addition, both the Si 4 C 2 +dication and the SiC 9 neutral exhibit a planar tetracoordinatecarbon atom (ptC) in their lowest-lying isomer. This is caused by a drivingforce for C-planarization which includes not only the electron delocalizationon the square frame but also the bonding between C-dopant and the Si frame of thesmall dication. In the larger neutral cluster cage, the Si 5 grouptends to stabilize electronically the cage by electron transfer but alsomechanically by geometrical constraints in maintaining a ptC configuration. We also attempted to search for potential linkers in makingsilicon nanowires. We found that the Mg dopant, due to its large electrontransfer capacity, behaves as a cation Mgdelta+ and thereby induces anionic entity with the Sindelta-anionic partner. The resulting Mg cation can be served as a linker between Sin blocks leading tostabilized linear [(Sik) Mg]lstructures in part due to electrostatic attraction forces. This allowed us to identify some suitable membersthat can further be used as superatoms for assemblies. We thus probed thefive-, seven-, eight- and ten-atom Si building blocks, {{and the role of the}} Mgelement as the linkers connecting them. Calculated results ofthe average assembling energy which gave us an idea about the tendency ofassembling the cluster of (SikMg) l with k = 5, 7, 8, 10, show that silicon clusters Si k tend to assemble in ring forms (Rl) over the linear forms(Ll) as the assembling energy of the Rl are larger than those of the Ll. However, a more important fact is that the average assembling energy of thelinear form tends to increase with the increasing size (l), implying that <b>a(longer)</b> nanowire can be considered as a plausible possibility.
