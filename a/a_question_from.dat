5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>from</b> Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E

25|$|In 1298 Ibn Taymiyyah {{wrote an}} {{explanation}} of the ayat al-mutashabihat (the unclear verses of the Qur'an) called Al-`Aqidat al-Hamawiyat al-Kubra (The creed of the great people of Hama). The book is about divine attributes and it served as an answer to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>from</b> the city of Hama, Syria. At that particular time Ash'arites held prominent positions within the Islamic scholarly community in both Syria and Egypt, and they held a certain position on the divine attributes of God. Ibn Taymiyyah in his book strongly disagreed with their views and this heavy opposition to the common Ash'ari position, caused considerable controversy.|$|E

These responsa of the later geonim were often essays on Talmudic themes, and since a single letter often answered many questions, it frequently became book-length in size. Two important examples of such books are the Siddur of Amram Gaon, addressed to the Jews of Spain {{in response to a}} question about the laws of prayer, and the Epistle of Sherira Gaon, which sets out the history of the Mishnah and the Talmud in response to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>from</b> Tunisia.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the product}} {{development}} (i.e., architectural artifact) in each cell or the problem solution embodied by the cell {{is the answer}} to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>from</b> a perspective, typically, the models or descriptions are higher-level depictions or the surface answers of the cell. The refined models or designs supporting that answer are the detailed descriptions within the cell. Decomposition (i.e., drill down to greater levels of detail) takes place within each cell. If a cell is not made explicit (defined), it is implicit (undefined). If it is implicit, the risk of making assumptions about these cells exists. If the assumptions are valid, then time and money are saved. If, however, the assumptions are invalid, it is likely to increase costs and exceed the schedule for implementation.|$|E
25|$|When {{the elderly}} Zapparoni finally makes his entrance, Richard senses his latent power, {{remarking}} {{that there is}} more to him than his intelligence. In a narrative aside prompted by <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>from</b> Zapparoni, Richard contrasts his former comrades Fillmor, Lorenz, and Twinnings. Unlike either Lorenz and Twinnings, Fillmor, now a successful high officer, is driven entirely by ambition, yet totally lacks imagination. So when Zapparoni asks Richard for his opinion on Fillmor’s memoir, Richard is unsure how to respond. Over the course of a tactical conversation, Zapparoni begins with familiar territory for Richard, namely war, yet is quickly able to master the discussion, forcing Richard into contortions and self-contradictions. Zapparoni then announces that he has other matters to attend to, and asks Richard to wait for him in the garden, warning him to beware of the bees.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, {{the ship}} was refloated and {{allocated}} as a war prize to China and placed under the ownership of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Shanghai. In 1947 she {{was sent to the}} Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock for repairs. New electrical systems and radar were fitted and her accommodation was rebuilt. During that time {{the ship was}} transferred to the China Tanker Co Ltd, Hong Kong and re-entered service in 1950 as Yung Hao with China still claiming ownership. Her crew defected to the Communist Chinese side in March 1951. On 12 March 1951, an emergency Cabinet meeting was held by the Hong Kong Government to discuss the ship. Four days later, the Chinese Government reiterated its claim to the ship, stating that it held the British Government liable for any interference in the free movement of the vessel, leading to the lodging of a claim for compensation. Yung Hao was requistioned by the British Admiralty on 7 April to prevent her falling into Chinese hands on orders from Governor Sir Alexander Grantham. The next day, the issue was raised in the British Parliament. Answering <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>from</b> Ernest Kinghorn, Secretary of State for the Colonies James Griffiths stated that the requisitioning had been done in consultation with the British Government and was to prevent North Korean and Chinese forces using the ship.|$|E

500|$|The final overdub was McCartney's bass guitar part, {{which he}} added on 3 June. The process of {{recording}} the bass separately from a rhythm track provided greater flexibility when mixing a song, and allowed McCartney {{to control the}} harmonic structure of the music by defining chords. As confirmed by the band's recording historian, Mark Lewisohn, [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] was the first Beatles song to have the bass superimposed onto a dedicated track on the recording. This technique became commonplace in the Beatles' subsequent work. During the 3 June session, the song was temporarily renamed [...] "I Don't Know", which had been Harrison's reply to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>from</b> producer George Martin as to {{what he wanted to}} call the track. The eventual title was decided on by 6 June, during a remixing and tape-copying session for the album.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{later said}} that the lyrics take duality as their theme.

The completed song includes a musical coda, which was improvised by the Beatles when they were recording the track in October 1967. Unimpressed with the composition, Lennon pushed for [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] to be the single's A-side, but McCartney and the band's producer, George Martin, opted for the more commercial-sounding [...] "Hello, Goodbye". The Beatles produced three promotional films for the song, {{one of which was}} shown on The Ed Sullivan Show in America. Due to recently imposed regulations against lip-syncing in Britain, none of the clips were aired there.|$|E

I didn't want to tour, I was too tired, then you guys kept buying the record, and I had to come out and see you guys" [...] on stage at Winnipeg on November 16.
