40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed laboratory characterization of a thermal dissociation chemical ionization mass spectrometer (TD-CIMS) for the atmospheric measurement of Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and its homologues (PANs). PANs are efficiently dissociated {{in a heated}} inlet and the resulting peroxy <b>acyl</b> <b>radicals</b> are reacted with I&minus; ions in a flow tube. The mass spectrometer detects the corresponding carboxylate ions. PAN, peroxypropionyl nitrate (PPN), peroxyisobutyryl nitrate (PiBN), peroxy-n-butyryl nitrate (PnBN), peroxyacryloyl nitrate (APAN), peroxycrotonyl nitrates (CPAN) and peroxymethacryloyl nitrate (MPAN) were cross-calibrated with both a dual channel GC/ECD and a total odd-nitrogen (NOy) instrument for the NCAR TD-CIMS' typical aircraft operation conditions. In addition, the instrument sensitivity {{to a number of}} more exotic PANs (peroxyhydroxyacetyl nitrate, methoxyformyl peroxynitrate, and peroxybenzoyl nitrate) was evaluated qualitatively by comparisons with a long-path FTIR instrument. The sensitivity for PPN is slightly higher than that of PAN. Larger aliphatic and olefinic PAN compounds generally showed lower sensitivities. We postulate that these differences are owing to secondary reactions in the thermal decomposition region, which either reduce the yield of peroxy <b>acyl</b> <b>radicals</b> or cause losses of these radicals through intramolecular decomposition. The relative importance of these secondary reactions varies considerably between different PAN species. Results also indicate that the reaction of the larger peroxy <b>acyl</b> <b>radicals</b> with the ion-water cluster, I&minus;(H 2 O) n proceeds about an order of magnitude faster than with I&minus; alone, as has been observed for peroxy acetyl radicals. Sensitivity variations among the individual PAN species at very low water vapor were observed.

The development of conditions for a general method of the reduction is reported, with various examples being shown. Chapter three begins with a review of the synthesis of a range of twisted amides. The formation of a twisted amide precursor, containing a dithiocarbamate groups is reported. The attempts to form the bicyclic twisted amide, by used of carabamoyl radicals generated from dithiocarbamates are described.

50|$|In 1989 and 1993, Yamada and {{co-workers}} reported the first enantioselective total synthesis {{of both the}} enantiomers of ptaquilosin, the aglycone of ptaquiloside. In the first step, the menthyl ester of cyclopentane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid 1 was partially hydrolyzed to afford the monomenthyl ester, which was later alkylated with methallyl bromide {{in the presence of}} HMPA to selectively produce 2. The product 2 was then converted to the acid chloride and treated with stannic chloride to effect Friedel-Crafts acylation to give enone 3. Hydride reduction, selective oxidation of the allylic alcohol, and silylation were then performed to provide compound 4. On treatment with base and a chloroethyl sulfonium salt, a mixture of spirocyclopropanes was obtained. The minor product 5a can be isomerized with p-toluenesulfonic acid to 5b with 81% yield. Desaturation by selenylation/dehydroselenation and basic peroxide oxidation afforded epoxide 6. Mild reduction, methyl Grignard addition, and oxidation gave compound 7. Methylation of the cyclopentanone under Noyori’s condition using the TASF enolate produced a mixture of isomers. The undesired isomer 8a can be equilibriumed with potassium tert-butoxide in 81% yield to exclusively generate 8b. Reduction, deprotection, and oxidation afforded 9. On treatment with oxygen in warm ethyl acetate, the aldehyde on 9 was oxidized to the <b>acyl</b> <b>radical</b> for decarbonylation. Stereoselective trapping of the tertiary radical by oxygen gave the hydroperoxide 10. Under mild reduction, the naturally occurred (-)-ptaquilosin 11 was obtained. The Yamada’s synthesis proceeded in 20 steps with an overall yield of 2.9%. Similarly, the unnatural (+)-enantiomer of ptaquilosin was synthesized from the diastereomer of 2.Multiple synthetic studies directed towards ptaquilosin 11 have been reported since 1989. In 1994, Padwa {{and co-workers}} described the synthesis of the core skeleton of ptaquilosin by a highly convergent approach. In 1995, Cossy and co-workers reported novel routes to the racemic and optically active ptaquilosin skeleton.

40|$|Photolysis, at low {{temperatures}} in cyclopropane and/or CFCl 3, of bis[(E) - 4, 4 -dimethylpent- 2 -enoyl]-peroxide 1, bis(4, 4 -dimethylpent- 2 -ynoyl) peroxide 2 and dipropyl peroxydicarbonate 3 yielded the corresponding carbonyloxyl radicals, viz. Me 3 CCH=CHC(O) O., Me 3 CC 2 ̆ 261 CC(O) O. and PrOC(O) O., which {{were identified by}} EPR spectroscopy. Carbonyloxyl radicals were not detected on photolysis of bis(3 -methylbut- 2 -enoyl) peroxide 4, di[(E) -cinnamoyl] peroxide 7, and bis(1 -methylpropyl) peroxydicarbonate 9. All the peroxides also give other radicals {{many of which were}} identified from their EPR spectral parameters. Thus, the two bis(alkenoyl) peroxides give the 'corresponding' alkenylacyl radicals, viz. s-cis- and s-trans-Me 3 CCH=CH 1 ̆ 0 a=O from 1 and s-trans-Me 2 C=CH 1 ̆ 0 a=O from compound 2. Evidence is presented which indicates that these <b>acyl</b> <b>radicals</b> may be formed directly during the photolysis of substrates 1 and 4 via a Norrish type- 1 process. This would represent a new route for the photodecomposition of acyl peroxides with C-O bond scission occurring in competition with the usual O-O bond scission.
