Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in the dark, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning.

500|$|Later {{alternative}} bands such as Nirvana, Pavement, Radiohead, Coldplay, Pearl Jam, Live, and Local H {{have drawn}} inspiration from R.E.M.'s music. [...] "When I was 15 {{years old in}} Richmond, Virginia, they were {{a very important part}} of my life," [...] Pavement's Bob Nastanovich said, [...] "as they were for all the members of our band." [...] Pavement devoted the song [...] "Unseen Power of the Picket Fence" [...] from the No Alternative compilation (1993) to discussing Chronic Town and Reckoning. Local H, according to the band's Twitter account, created their name by combining two R.E.M. songs: [...] "Oddfellows Local 151" [...] and [...] "Swan Swan H". Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was a vocal fan of R.E.M., and had plans to collaborate on a musical project with Stipe before his death in April 1994. Cobain told Rolling Stone in an interview earlier that year, [...] "I don’t know how that band does what they do. God, they’re the greatest.

2500|$|In later {{collections}} Lagerfeld {{chose to}} break away from the ladylike look of Chanel and began to experiment with fabrics and styles. During the 1980s, more than 40 Chanel boutiques opened worldwide. By the end of the 1980s, the boutiques sold goods ranging from US$200-per-ounce perfume, US$225 ballerina slippers to US$11,000 dresses and US$2,000 leather handbags. Chanel cosmetics and fragrances were distributed only by Chanel outlets. Chanel marketer Jean Hoehn explained the firm's approach, saying, [...] "We introduce a new fragrance every 10 years, not every three minutes like many competitors. We don't confuse the consumer. With Chanel, people know what to expect. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> coming back to us, at all ages, as they enter and leave the market." [...] The 1984 launch of a new fragrance, in honor of the founder, Coco, continued the label's success. In 1986, the House of Chanel struck a deal with watchmakers and in 1987, the first Chanel watch debuted. By the end of the decade, Alain moved the offices to New York City.|$|E

2500|$|Behavioral Checklists and Scales: {{behaviors}} are more definite than traits. [...] The critical incidents method (or critical incident technique) concerns [...] "specific behaviors indicative of {{good or bad}} job performance". [...] Supervisors record behaviors of what they judge to be job performance relevant, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> a running tally of good and bad behaviors. [...] A discussion on performance may then follow. [...] The behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) combine the critical incidents method with rating scale methods by rating performance on a scale but with the scale points being anchored by behavioral incidents. [...] Note that BARS are job specific. In the behavioral observation scale (BOS) approach to performance appraisal, employees are also evaluated {{in the terms of}} critical incidents. In that respect, it is similar to BARS. However, the BOS appraisal rate subordinates on the frequency of the critical incidents as they are observed to occur over a given period. The ratings are assigned on a five-point scale. The behavioral incidents for the rating scale are developed {{in the same way as}} for BARS through identification by supervisors or other subject matter experts. Similarly, BOS techniques meet equal employment opportunity because they are related to actual behavior required for successful job performance.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Lowenthal {{was cast}} as Jinnosuke, aka [...] "Kuma", a teddy-bear-headed warrior, in the anime feature Afro Samurai which starred Samuel L. Jackson {{as the title}} character. In an {{interview}} with Eastern Kicks, Lowenthal said that what he liked about Jinno was that he [...] "starts off as one guy and ends {{up in a very}} different, very very dark place. Plus I got to kick Sam Jackson's ass. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> bringing him back from the dead for me to play again. And he's a twin-sword-wielding insane cyborg death machine with a giant teddy bear head. What's not to like?" [...] He also said that they recorded the voicing for Afro Samurai separately so he did not get to meet Jackson personally until a release party for the related video game years later. Luke Carroll of Anime News Network described Lowenthal's voicing as a [...] "good performance" [...] but [...] "not enough to make it more than an average dub at best". Dennis Amith of J-ENT! thought the voice acting was well done. Lowenthal would reprise the role in the 2009 feature [...] Steve Fritz of Newsarama wrote [...] "The action sequencing is still top notch, and the vocal performances from Jackson, [...] Liu, Lowenthal and company is on the money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Short sellers must {{be aware}} of the {{potential}} for a short squeeze. [...] When the price of a stock rises significantly, some people who are shorting the stock cover their positions to limit their losses (this may occur in an automated way if the short sellers had stop-loss orders in place with their brokers); others may be forced to close their position to meet a margin call; others may be forced to cover, subject to the terms under which they borrowed the stock, if the person who lent the stock wishes to sell and take a profit. [...] Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional covering. [...] Because of this, most short sellers restrict their activities to heavily traded stocks, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> an eye on the [...] "short interest" [...] levels of their short investments. [...] Short interest is defined as the total number of shares that have been legally sold short, but not covered. A short squeeze can be deliberately induced. [...] This can happen when large investors (such as companies or wealthy individuals) notice significant short positions, and buy many shares, with the intent of selling the position at a profit to the short sellers, who may be panicked by the initial uptick or who are forced to cover their short positions to avoid margin calls.|$|E

Every autumn in the month of September, when the great heat is abated, people send to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the small-pox.

She immediately rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common scratch) and puts into the vein as much venom as can lye upon the head of her needle, and after binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins[...] [...] [...] The children or young patients play together {{all the rest of the}} day and are in perfect health till the eighth.
