Research into combating Harpy swarm <b>attacks</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducted</b> but the simulation software used to date, Naval Simulation System, is inadequate for future research. A new and mission-focused simulation tool is necessary in order to advance research in defensive tactics against Harpy and other unmanned aerial vehicle threats (UAV). This research develops a simulation model for a Harpy swarm attack using Simkit to meet the need for a mission specific analytical tool. The base model consists of a user-defined Harpy patrol area and a ship traversing the area on a course and speed also defined by the user. A total of 16 parameters are defined and implemented. The model records the time any Harpy impacts the ship to provide data for the response variable, the number of Harpy hits on the ship. Main effect and full factorial regressions were performed as well as a partition tree to determine which parameters had the most significance on the number of Harpies which hit the ship. These model characteristics and future enhancements will provide researchers the ability to assess alternative anti-UAV swarm tactics...|$|R

The flutter boundaries for the fuel tanks were nearly Mach number independent (occurring at constant dynamic pressure). To study the aerodynamic effect of the fuel tank stores, pencil stores (slender cylindrical rods) which had the same mass and pitch and yaw inertia as the fuel tanks were tested on the model. These pencil store configurations exhibited a transonic dip in the flutter dynamic pressure, indicating that the aerodynamic effect of the actual fuel tanks on flutter was significant. Several flutter analyses methods were used in an attempt to predict the flutter phenomenon exhibited during the wind-tunnel test.

40|$|To protect themselves, plant may {{response}} to insect’s damage through {{two kinds of}} defensive mechanisms (constitutive and inducible). Inducible defense appear just after plants were attacked by herbivores through the methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) systematic action. Previous studies indicated that application of MeJA on plant leaves or the direct insect damage may cause plant’s production of some defense-related substances, such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and trypsin inhibitor (TI) which may against insect’s <b>attack.</b> Many research <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducted</b> to evaluate the effects of sparying MeJA on plant leaf on plants and subsequently on insect herbivores; but only limited studies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducted</b> to investigate the effects of MeJA on seeds’ germination and the prime effects against insect herbivores. In this study, tomato seeds were soaked in MeJA of different concentrations and different soaking time. Then, the plant’s defensive proteins, tomato’s performance and short- term growth performance of Spodoptera litura were measured. Results showed that PPO increased by treated with MeJA for 1 hour, while treated with MeJA for 1 day could decerase PPO and TI content. High MeJA concentration could decrease tomato seed germination ration and caused bad larval performance, especially in long time treatment. In summary, we found MeJA could decrease larval performance and tomato’s growth performance. Since this experiment was only tested for seedlings in greenhouse, more studies are needed for the practical use of this idea in the field. 植物對於昆蟲之防禦反應，依照其產生方式不同可將其分為兩大類：組成型及誘導型。誘導型防禦僅於植物受到傷害時才誘發產生，例如使用甲基茉莉花酸(Methyl jasmonic acid, MeJA) 在植物葉片上所誘發出的抗蟲反應即是一種誘導型防禦。前人研究指出，對植物葉片施用MeJA及給予直接傷害會促使植物產生抗蟲物質，如多酚氧化酵素 (Polyphenol oxidase, PPO) 及胰蛋白&# 37238;抑制劑 (Trypsin inhibitor, TI) 等以達到抗蟲效果。有關MeJA處理植物葉片後，探討其抗蟲效果之研究相當多，但測試其對於種子處理後之發芽及其後之幼苗抗蟲能力的研究卻非常少。本實驗採用番茄種子浸泡於不同濃度之MeJA，處理兩種不同浸泡時間後，測量番茄幼苗之PPO及TI含量、植株之生長表現及斜紋夜蛾幼蟲取食各處理組後之短期生長表現。實驗結果顯示，短期浸泡MeJA後番茄PPO上升，但長期浸泡MeJA則使PPO及TI下降；在兩個浸泡時間皆觀察到施用高濃度MeJA會造成番茄種子發芽率及番茄乾重下降，且長期浸泡MeJA造成的影響比短期更為顯著，浸泡MeJA亦使斜紋夜蛾幼蟲生長在較初期的時間受到負面影響。總結實驗結果，番茄種子施用MeJA後，能使斜紋夜蛾幼蟲之短期生長表現下降，同時會使植株生長表現下降。由於本實驗只針對溫室幼苗進行測試，在田間之實用部分，仍需更多探討。中文摘要 [...] -i 英文摘要 [...] ii 目錄 [...] -iii 表目錄 [...] iv 圖目錄 [...] -v 前言 [...] - 1 前人研究 [...] - 3 材料與方法 [...] 5 結果 [...] - 9 討論 [...] - 12 參考文獻 [...] - 14 附錄一 [...] - 41 附錄二 [...] - 42 表一、浸泡濃度 0 、 1500 、 2000 、 2500 、 3000 、 3500 、 4000 及 4500 μM MeJA對番茄發芽率的影響 [...] 19 表二、浸泡濃度 0 、 100 、 500 及 3000 μM MeJA對番茄發芽率的影響 [...] - 20 圖一、短期處理番茄在播種後第 8 天之PPO含量 [...] - 21 圖二、短期處理番茄在播種後第 14 天之PPO含量 [...] 22 圖三、短期處理番茄在播種後第 14 天之TI含量 [...] 23 圖四、短期處理番茄在播種後第 22 天之TI含量 [...] 24 圖五、短期處理番茄在播種後第 8 天斜紋夜蛾之RGR [...] 25 圖六、短期處理番茄在播種後第 14 天斜紋夜蛾之RGR [...] - 26 圖七、短期處理番茄在播種後第 22 天斜紋夜蛾之RGR [...] - 27 圖八、短期處理番茄在播種後第 8 天之乾重 [...] 28 圖九、短期處理番茄在播種後第 14 天之乾重 [...] - 29 圖十、短期處理番茄在播種後第 22 天之乾重 [...] - 30 圖十一、長期處理番茄在播種後第 21 天之PPO含量 [...] 31 圖十二、長期處理番茄在播種後第 29 天之PPO含量 [...] 32 圖十三、長期處理番茄在播種後第 21 天之TI含量 [...] 33 圖十四、長期處理番茄在播種後第 29 天之TI含量 [...] 34 圖十五、長期處理番茄在播種後第 21 天斜紋夜蛾之RGR [...] - 35 圖十六、長期處理番茄在播種後第 29 天斜紋夜蛾之RGR [...] - 36 圖十七、長期處理番茄在播種後第 21 天之乾重 [...] - 37 圖十八、長期處理番茄在播種後第 29 天之乾重 [...] - 38 圖十九、長期處理番茄在播種後 43 天之地上部乾重 [...] - 39 圖二十、長期處理番茄在播種後 43 天之地下部乾重 [...] - 4...|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} factors for the {{improvement}} of finishing phase of tactical actions of the qualified women's handballers in an <b>attack</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> examined. Complex experimental researches and analysis of their results on the special tests basis, which were directed on verification of effectiveness of the specialized training program {{for the improvement}} of accuracy of throws of the qualified women's handballers, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducted</b> for this purpose. Researches were divided into two groups: indexes of handballers of playing season 2009 - 2010 (group I) and indexes of handballers of playing season 2010 - 2011 (group II) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the nature of}} the flow field behind a rectangular wing of circular arc cross section <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducted</b> in the Langley 9 -inch supersonic tunnel. Pitot- and static-pressure surveys covering a region of flow behind the wing <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made together with detailed pitot surveys throughout the region of the wake. In addition, the flow direction <b>has</b> <b>been</b> measured by means of a weathercocking vane. Theoretical calculations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to obtain the variation of both downwash and sidewash with angle of attack by using the superposition method of Lagerstrom, Graham, and Grosslight. In addition, the effect of wing thickness on the sidewash with the wing at 0 degree angle of <b>attack</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> evaluated...|$|R
50|$|Initial Moroccan <b>attacks</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{generally}} successful. In {{the space}} of a fortnight, the Moroccans and their tribal allies had asserted control over most of Ifni, isolating inland Spanish units from the capital. Simultaneous <b>attacks</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> launched throughout Spanish Sahara, overrunning garrisons and ambushing convoys and patrols.|$|R
40|$|Exploratory tests <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducted</b> in the NASA-Langley Research Center's 12 -Foot Low-Speed wind Tunnel to {{evaluate}} the application of wing-leading-edge devices on the stall-departure and spin resistance characteristics of a 1 / 6 -scale model of a T-tail general-aviation aircraft. The model was force tested with an internal strain-gauge balance to obtain aerodynamic data on the complete configuration and with a separate wing balance to obtain aerodynamic data on the outer portion of the wing. The addition of the outboard leading-edge droop eliminated the abrupt stall of the windtip and maintained or increased the resultant-force coefficient up to about alpha = 32 degrees. This change in slope of the resultant-force coefficient curve with angle of <b>attack</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> shown to be important for eliminating autorotation and for providing spin resistance...|$|R
