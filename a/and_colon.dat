5|$|By {{the end of}} 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had {{designated}} a highway numbered M-7 between Three Rivers and Centreville. This highway was extended east {{by the middle of}} 1936. The route connected US131 in downtown Three Rivers to US112 outside Coldwater. At the time of the extension, all of M-7 was a gravel road. Later that year, the original segment between Three Rivers <b>and</b> <b>Colon</b> was paved, and the state extended the hard-surface route as far as Nottawa in 1937.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 the 7th Infantry Division {{participated in}} Operation Just Cause in Panama, briefly occupying {{the country in}} {{conjunction}} with the 82nd Airborne Division. Elements of the 7th Infantry Division landed in the northern areas of Colón Province, Panama, securing the Coco Solo Naval Station, Fort Espinar, France Field, <b>and</b> <b>Colón</b> while the 82nd Airborne and U.S. Marines fought in the more heavily populated southern region. Once Panama City was under U.S. control, the 82nd quickly re-deployed and left the city {{under the control of the}} 7th Division's 9th Infantry Regiment until after the capture of Manuel Noriega. It suffered four killed and three wounded in the operation.|$|E

25|$|Estrogen and the ERs {{have also}} been implicated in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, {{prostate}} cancer, and endometrial cancer.

25|$|The {{two most}} {{prevalent}} phyla {{of the colon}} are firmicutes and bacteroides. The ratio between the two seems to vary widely {{as reported by the}} Human Microbiome Project. Bacteroides are implicated in the initiation of colitis <b>and</b> <b>colon</b> cancer. Bifidobacteria are also abundant, and are often described as 'friendly bacteria'.|$|E

25|$|If {{radiation}} therapy is done first, and fails, then radical prostatectomy becomes a very technically challenging surgery {{and may not}} be feasible.

25|$|A {{majority}} of histologically normal fields surrounding neoplastic growths (adenomas <b>and</b> <b>colon</b> cancers) in the colon also show reduced MBD4 mRNA expression (a field defect) compared to histologically normal tissue from individuals {{who never had}} a colonic neoplasm. This finding suggests that epigenetic silencing of MBD4 is an early step in colorectal carcinogenesis.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of SEMS are used to alleviate symptoms caused by cancers of the gastrointestinal tract that obstruct {{the interior of the}} tube-like (or luminal) structures of the bowel — namely the esophagus, duodenum, common bile duct <b>and</b> <b>colon.</b> SEMS are designed to be permanent and, as a result, are often used when the cancer is at an advanced stage and cannot be removed by surgery.|$|E
25|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC), {{also known}} as bowel cancer <b>and</b> <b>colon</b> cancer, is the {{development}} of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine).
