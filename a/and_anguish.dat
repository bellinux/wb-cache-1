25|$|Severus Snape is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. An exceptionally skilful wizard, his coldly sarcastic and controlled exterior conceals deep emotions <b>and</b> <b>anguish.</b> A Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Snape is {{hostile to the}} series' protagonist, Harry, the moment he sets foot in Snape's classroom; this hostility is rooted in Harry's resemblance to Harry's father James, who bullied and harassed Snape during their time at Hogwarts. Though philosophically attracted to the Dark Arts and Lord Voldemort's ideology of wizard supremacy, Snape's love for Muggle-born Lily Evans, Harry's mother, eventually compels him to defect from the Death Eaters. Snape becomes a double-agent on behalf of Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix, and protects Harry throughout the series.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{his career}} Wolf {{modelled}} his lieder after those of Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann, particularly in the period around his relationship with Vally Franck; in fact, they were good enough imitations to pass off as the real thing, which he once attempted, though his cover was blown too soon. It is speculated that his choice of lieder texts in the earlier years, largely dealing with sin <b>and</b> <b>anguish,</b> were partly influenced by his contraction of syphilis. His love for Vally, not fully requited, inspired highly chromatic and philosophical lieder that could be regarded as successors to Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder cycle. Others were as distant from those in mood as possible; lighthearted and humorous. The rarely heard symphonic poem Penthesilea is tempestuous and highly colored as well. Although Wolf admired Liszt, who had encouraged him to complete the work, he felt Liszt's own music too dry and academic and strove for color and passion.|$|E

Much of U2's songwriting and music is also motivated by contemplations of loss <b>and</b> <b>anguish,</b> coupled with hopefulness and resilience, themes that are central to The Joshua Tree. Some of these lyrical ideas have been amplified by Bono and the band's personal experiences during their youth in Ireland, as well as Bono's campaigning and activism later in his life. U2 have used tours such as Zoo TV and PopMart to caricature social trends, such as media overload and consumerism, respectively.|$|E

[...] Rediff called his performance [...] "excellent", and [...] "...one of the top performances of 2007".

500|$|Although Balzac did {{not draw}} {{specifically}} {{from the women}} in his life to create Valérie, parallels have been observed in some areas. The tumultuous end of his affair with Louise Breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to Mme. Hanska is {{similar in some ways}} to Valérie's manipulation of Steinbock. Critics also connect the pride <b>and</b> <b>anguish</b> felt by Balzac during Mme. Hanska's pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by Baron Hulot when Valérie conceives and loses her child. Although he never ascribed to Mme. Hanska any of the traits in Valérie's treacherous character, he felt a devotion similar to that of Hulot. He once wrote to her: [...] "je fais pour mon Eve toute les folies qu'un Hulot fait pour une Marneffe, je te donnerai mon sang, mon honneur, ma vie" [...] ("I commit for [...] all the follies that a Hulot commits for Madame Marneffe; I give you my blood, my honor, my life").|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of her {{decision}} to become Mahomet's queen, Irene becomes ensnared in a complex power struggle between his various advisors: the First Visier Cali Bassa, the Aga Mustapha, and the officer Abdalla, who is suffering from unrequited love for Aspasia. Mahomet becomes convinced that Bassa, with Irene's complicity, is plotting against him. Two of Abdalla's captains kill Irene, but with her dying words she reveals that Bassa's true accomplice was the Greek soldier Demetrius, Aspasia's lover, who has safely escaped with his loved one. On learning that Irene had not been conspiring against him, Mahomet is distraught:MAHOMET:Robb'd of the maid, with whom I wish'd to triumph,No more I burn for fame or for dominion;Success and conquest now are empty sounds,Remorse <b>and</b> <b>anguish</b> seize on all my breast;Those groves, whose shades embower'd the dear Irene,Heard her last cries, and fann'd her dying beauties,Shall hide me from the tasteless world for ever.(Irene V. xii. ll. 42–48) ...|$|E
500|$|Marsh praises his 1968 {{reading of}} [...] "U.S. Male", [...] "bearing {{down on the}} hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle {{assurance}} that he brought to his Sun records."

500|$|By {{comparison}} with his output in other genres, Vaughan Williams's music for chamber ensembles and solo instruments forms {{a small part}} of his oeuvre. Grove lists twenty-four pieces under the heading [...] "Chamber and instrumental"; three are early, unpublished works. Vaughan Williams, like most leading British 20th-century composers, was not drawn to the solo piano and wrote little for it. From his mature years, there survive for standard chamber groupings two string quartets (1908–09, revised 1921; and 1943–44), a [...] "phantasy" [...] string quintet (1912), and a sonata for violin and piano (1954). The first quartet was written soon after Vaughan Williams's studies in Paris with Ravel, whose influence is strongly evident. In 2002 the magazine Gramophone described the second quartet as a masterpiece that should be, but is not, part of the international chamber repertory. It is from the same period as the Sixth Symphony, and has something of that work's severity <b>and</b> <b>anguish.</b> The quintet (1912) was written two years after the success of the Tallis Fantasia, with which it has elements in common, both in terms of instrumental layout and the mood of rapt contemplation. The violin sonata has made little impact.|$|E
