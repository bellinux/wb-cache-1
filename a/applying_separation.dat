In CEC, the electroosmotic flow (EOF) is the driving force of the mobile phase and the flow velocity of the mobile is mainly depended on the EOF and the <b>applied</b> <b>separation</b> voltage. The stronger EOF and higher <b>applied</b> <b>separation</b> voltage will lead to the higher flow velocity, which is required for fast separations.

Then, it was used as starting material reacted with 1, 1, 4, 7, 10, 10 -hexamethyltriethyl-enetetramine (HMTETA). The formation of the quaternary ammonium groups from this reaction would generate an anodic EOF from cathode to anode in CEC.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that certain {{integral}} transforms and Fourier-type series can be used to solve many classical boundary and initial value problems in separable coordinate systems. More recently, {{it has been shown that}} these classical transforms and series are spectral representations associated with an ordinary differential system which results on <b>applying</b> <b>separation</b> of variables to the given boundary value problem. This has been the basis for recent work concerned with systematically generating the proper spectral representation needed to solve a given problem. See [1]-[4] for a list of references. We shall consider the problem of finding the associated spectral representation when the resulting ordinary differential system has the eigenvalue parameter occurring in both the equation and one boundary condition. Moreover, the differential equation is to be satisfied on a semi-infinite interval, thus leading to a singular problem which does not seem to have been studied before. In § 2 by using a transformation due to B. Friedman (which we modify appropriately for our singular case), we first give a formal derivation of the spectral representation, and then we rigorously prove the result. In § 3 our representation is applied to solve an initial-boundary value problem arising in the theory of diffusion and heat flow in one dimension. We should bear in mind that even in cases where solutions are already known, our method systematically yields alternative representations which are often more rapidly convergent and from which asymptotic expansions of solutions with respect to parameters can often be found. In the problem to be considered a representation of the solution can also be found easily by a straight-forward application of the Laplace transform in time t, while the new transform derived in § 2 yields the solution when applied in space x. The new transform, however, can be applied when the coefficients in the boundary value problem are time dependent, a situation which, in general, precludes the use of the Laplace transform [...] As a general rule [1] there should be a spectral representation associated with each ordinary differential system resulting from <b>applying</b> <b>separation</b> of variables to the original boundary value problem, and each spectral representation should lead to a different representation of the solution of the original problem...|$|E

Of this, 12. 7 million tonnes (21 %) came from {{indigenous}} sources; {{the majority of}} which was from surface mining (8. 6 million tonnes). Many planning applications for surface mining of coal and the coal extraction that follows, are often a source of conflict with the communities who live within shallow coalfield areas. Policies which enforce a gap, or ‘separation zone’, between communities and surface coal mining operations exist in Wales and Scotland, but do not exist in England. This paper examines the effect of <b>applying</b> <b>separation</b> zones {{on the availability of}} shallow coal resources within two study areas; one within the South Wales Coalfield, the other within the Midlands Coalfield (comprising the Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and North Derbyshire Coalfield areas).

The implications on the availability of shallow coal resources of applying different separation zone distances around settlements within these two areas are explored. Results reveal that although the settlement morphology is important in determining the area of the separation zone, and has greatest influence in the South Wales Coalfield, the area of coal resource sterilised by the application of separation zones is greatest in the Midlands Coalfield due to it having a higher proportion of urban development situated on the surface extent of the shallow coal resource...|$|E

A general steady spiral solution of incompressible inviscid axisymmetric flow was obtained analytically by <b>applying</b> <b>separation</b> of variables to the 3 D Euler equations. The solution, depending on 3 parameters, describes the spiral path of the fluid material element on the Bernoulli surface, whereas some new exact solutions were obtained to be bounded within the whole region. The first one is a continued typhoon-like vortex solution, where there are two intrinsic length scales. One is the radius of maximum circular velocity r_m, the other is the radius of the vortex kernel r_k=√(2) r_m. The second one is a multi-planar solution, periodically in z-coordinate. Within each layer, the solution is a umbrella vortex similar to the first one. The third one is also a multi-planar solution in z-coordinate. In each layer, it is a combination of two independent solutions like the Rankine vortex, which is also finite but discontinued for either vertical or horizontal velocity. The fourth one is a multi-paraboloid vortex solution finite for z-coordinate but infinite for r-coordinate. Besides, some classical simple solutions (Rankine vortex, Batchelor vortex, Hill spherical vortex, etc.) were also obtained. The above explicit solutions can be applied to study the radial structure of the typhoon, tornados and mesoscale eddies. Both the solutions and approaches used here could also be applied to other complex flows by the Navier-Stokes equations.

40|$|Formaldehyde is {{commonly}} used in detergents and cosmetic products as antibacterial agent and preservative. This substance is unfavorable for human health because it {{is known to be}} toxic for humans and causes irritation of eyes and skins. The toxicology studies of this compound indicate risk of detergents and cosmetic formulations with a minimum content of 0. 05 % free formaldehyde. Therefore, determination of formaldehyde as quality control parameter is very important. In this study, a photoluminescence method was achieved by using 2 -methyl acetoacetanilide. Also, the Box-Behnken design was applied for optimization of Hantzsch reaction for formaldehyde derivatization. The investigated factors (variables) were temperature, % v/v ethanol, reaction time, ammonium acetate, and 2 -methyl acetoacetanilide concentration. The linear range was obtained from 0. 33 – 20 × 10 − 7 [*]M (1 – 60 [*]μg·kg− 1) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0. 12 [*]μg·kg− 1. The proposed method was applied for the analysis of Iranian brands of liquid detergents and cosmetic products. The formaldehyde content of these products was found to be in the range of 0. 03 – 3. 88 %. Some brands of these products had higher concentration than the maximum allowed concentration of 0. 2 %. High recoveries (96. 15 %– 104. 82 %) for the spiked dishwashing liquid and hair shampoo indicate the proposed method is proper for the assessment of formaldehyde in detergents and cosmetic products.

40|$|Rationale]: When {{applying}} biosynthetic engineering approaches at {{the early}} stages of drug discovery, e. g. aiming to develop novel tetracycline analogues, target compounds are generally produced by engineered microorganisms in low yields. Rapid and reliable identification of metabolites with desired structural modification directly from bacterial cultures is therefore of great importance. [Methods]: Structural elucidation of atypical tetracyclines was carried out by fragmentation applying electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) (triple quadrupole - linear ion trap; Applied Biosystems 4000 QTRAP) and a high-resolution mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies 6224 TOF). Fragmentation patterns were obtained either with direct injection or by <b>applying</b> <b>separation</b> of target compounds with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) prior to mass spectrometry. In-source and CID fragmentation were compared. Theoretical calculations of target structures using the Gaussian programme suite were carried out with the aim of strengthening experimental structural elucidation. [Results]: Recombinant strains of Amycolatopsis sulphurea producing atypical tetracyclines chelocardin, modified chelocardin analogues (9 -demethylchelocardin and 2 -carboxyamido- 2 -deacetyl-chelocardin (CDCHD), and anhydrotetracycline (ATC) were analysed by collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation with higher collision energies to yield structurally important fragments which were identified. We have demonstrated that ATC is more prone to fragmentation compared to its epimer, which was further supported by comparison of both structures calculated with ab initio calculations. [Conclusions]: We have demonstrated that fragmentation patterns of atypical tetracyclines in CID-MS spectra enable rapid structural elucidation of target metabolites produced by cultures of genetically engineered bacteria. This method is of significant importance for early stages of drug development considering that isolation of target metabolites produced at low concentration is challenging.

In 11 patients, an interdental wooden wedge (Hawe-Neos) was placed (group W), and in 16 patients, a separation ring (Composi-Tight Gold) was placed at the contact between teeth 4 / 5 and 5 / 6. Simultaneously, in both groups, a wooden wedge, combined with a separation ring (Composi-Tight Gold), was placed on the contact between teeth 4 / 5 and 5 / 6 (reference group W+S). To measure proximal contact tightness, frictional forces were recorded at the removal of a 0. 05 mm thick metal matrix band inserted between adjacent teeth. Contact tightness was measured at contacts 4 and 5 and at 5 and 6 in the third and fourth quadrant using the Tooth Pressure Meter prior to <b>applying</b> <b>separation</b> devices (TO) five minutes after application (T 1) and five minutes after removal of the devices (T 2). The effect of separation was determined by calculating the differences between contact tightness before application and contact tightness with the devices in situ (T 1 -T 0). Interdental recovery was calculated by the difference in contact tightness before application and after removal of the devices (T 2 -T 0). To assess the presence of statistically significant differences between these measurement times, paired t-tests were applied. With each patient, either a comparison between W and W+S or S and W+S was made. For both W versus W+S and S versus W+S, paired t-tests were applied to compare differences (T 1 -T 0 and T 2 -T 0) between the separation devices. Within a patient, groups W and S could not be compared, therefore, to compare separation achieved between these two devices, unpaired t-tests were used. The increase in contact tightness measured at contact 4 and 5 for group W (0. 98 +/- 0. 26 N) was statistically significantly less compared to the increase in group S (5. 48 +/- 0. 88 N) (p < 0. 001) or group W+S (4. 62 +/- 0. 68 N) (p = 0. 02). No significant differences were found between groups S and W+S (p = 0. 77).
