40|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>length</b> <b>parameterization</b> can {{be thought}} of as the most natural among all {{possible}} parameterizations of a given curve. Beyond having several nice mathematical properties, this parameterization is useful for computer graphics applications: drawing a curve given in this form and computing its length, are particularly easy. Unfortunately, for the curves used mostly in computer graphics, namely cubic splines, the <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> <b>parameterization</b> cannot, in general, be expressed as any elementary function. As a result, practitioners are forced into employing approximate numerical methods which are in many cases complex, computationally intensive, and susceptible to error accumulation due to their iterative nature. This paper explores the following new direction to this problem. Instead of the traditional classes of curves, such as polynomials and rational functions, we promote the usage of a new class of curves which are all given in an explicit <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> <b>parameterization</b> form.

40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{piecewise}} rational interpolating polynomial monotonicity preserving interpolation, {{adopting the}} numerical quadrature {{to calculate the}} arc length si at everyone of the ordered vector point on the parametric curve, an approximating scheme for the inverse one of arc length function of the parametric curve is constructed, which passes through the n+ 1 points. A C 2 nearly arc-length parameterization is presented by substituting the approximating scheme for the parameter t. The nearly Arc-length Parameterization passes through the n+ 1 vector-valued points, and has its accurate arc length parameters at {{every one of the}} ordered vector points. Moreover, our further study shows that the nearly Arc-length Parameteriz ation carries the exactly same geometric shape because it comes form a kind of parametric transformation of the original curve. Therefore, this process provides a key to the difficult problem of the <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> <b>parameterization</b> of parametric curve. Index Terms — CAD, Monotonicity preservin...|$|E

Multisubject {{statistical}} analyses of diffusion tensor images in regions of specific white matter tracts have commonly measured only the mean {{value of a}} scalar invariant such as the fractional anisotropy (FA), ignoring the spatial variation of FA {{along the length of}} fiber tracts. We propose to instead perform tract-based morphometry (TBM), or the statistical analysis of diffusion MRI data in an anatomical tract-based coordinate system. We present a method for automatic generation of white matter tract <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> <b>parameterizations,</b> based on learning a fiber bundle model from tractography from multiple subjects. Our tractbased coordinate system enables TBM for the detection of white matter differences in groups of subjects. We present example TBM results from a study of interhemispheric differences in FA. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study in}} detail the notion of global {{curvature}} defined on rectifiable closed curves, a concept which has been successfully applied in existence and regularity investigation regarding elastic self-contact problems in nonlinear elasticity. A bound on this purely geometric quantity serves as an excluded volume constraint to prevent self-intersections of slender elastic bodies modeled as elastic rods. Moreover, a finite global curvature characterizes simple closed curves, whose <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> <b>parameterizations</b> possess a Lipschitz continuous tangent field. The investigation of local and non-local properties of global curvature motivates, in particular, an extended definition of local curvature at any point of a rectifiable loop. Finally we show how a bound on global curvature {{can be used to}} define topological constraints such as a given knot type for closed loops or a prescribed linking number for closed framed curves, suitable to describe, e. g., supercoiling phenomena of biomolecules...|$|R

The "optimal" re [...] parameterization in this family (that comes closest under the L 2 norm to <b>arc</b> [...] <b>length</b> <b>parameterization)</b> can be identified by solving a quadratic equation, but may exhibit too much residual parametric speed variation for motion control and other applications.

40|$|A {{new method}} to obtain {{explicit}} re-parameterization that preserves the curve degree and parametric domain {{is presented in}} this paper. The re-parameterization brings a curve {{very close to the}} <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> <b>parameterization</b> under L 2 norm but with less segmentation. The re-parameterization functions we used are C 1 continuous piecewise rational linear functions, which provide more flexibility and can be easily identified by solving a quadratic equation. Based on the outstanding performance of Mobius transformation on modifying pieces with monotonic parametric speed, we first create a partition of the original curve, in which the parametric speed of each segment is of monotonic variation. The values of new parameters corresponding to the subdivision points are specified a priori as the ratio of its cumulative arc length and its total arc length. C 1 continuity conditions are imposed to each segment, thus, with respect to the new parameters, the objective function is linear and admits a closed-form optimization. Illustrative examples are also given to assess the performance of our new method...|$|E
40|$|In many {{exciting}} modern video games, {{one of the}} player's {{main tasks}} is to move and control the "hero" or alter-ego on a curved path. This is also a key issue in more serious applications like an automobile driver training simulator. In order to determine where the vehicle is at any time, while the speed is controlled with the trainee's accelerator pedal, we need a computationally efficient way to establish this position by, say, defining an arc length parameterized curve to represent the "road" or other trajectory constraint. To compute the are length of a parametric curve or define the arc length parameterized curve using the analytical methods compromises many real-time simulations where designers compete to continuously add realism enhancing visual and audio effects. In this thesis, an efficient and novel way to parameterize a cubic curve with respect to arc length is adapted and implemented. Its use in real-time application is demonstrated and its performance is {{compared to that of}} another recently proposed method. The main advantage of our approach is the simplicity. That is, Bezier segments are subdivided as required and <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> <b>parameterization</b> is obtained offline for fast look-up, thus requiring less computation in real-time...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{analysis}} of human actions by comparing different performances of the same action executed by different actors. Specifically, we present a comparison procedure applied to the walking action, but the scheme {{can be applied to}} other different actions, such as bending, running, etc. To achieve fair comparison results, we define a novel human body model based on joint angles, which maximizes the differences between human postures and, moreover, reflects the anatomical structure of human beings. Subsequently, a human action space, called aSpace, is built in order to represent each performance (i. e., each predefined sequence of postures) as a parametric manifold. The final human action representation is called p–action, which is based on the most characteristic human body postures found during several walking performances. These postures are found automatically by means of a predefined distance function, and they are called key-frames. By using key-frames, we synchronize any performance with respect to the p– action. Furthermore, by considering an <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> <b>parameterization,</b> independence from the speed at which performances are played is attained. As a result, the style of human walking can be successfully analysed by establishing the differences of the joints between a male and a female walkers...|$|E

40|$|The current {{operational}} {{practice in}} scheduling air traffic arriving {{at an airport}} is to adjust flight schedules by delay, i. e. a postponement of an aircraft’s arrival at a scheduled location, to manage safely the FAA-mandated separation constraints between aircraft. To meet the observed and forecast growth in traffic demand, however, the practice of time advance (speeding up an aircraft toward a scheduled location) is envisioned for future operations as a practice additional to delay. Time advance has two potential advantageous capabilities: to increase the throughput of the arriving traffic, and to reduce the total traffic delay when the traffic sample is below saturation density. A cost associated with time advance is the fuel expenditure required by an aircraft to speed up. The contribution {{of this paper is}} an optimal control model of air traffic arriving in a terminal area that gives qualitative insight into the interdependence between two competing objectives: saving fuel (total, for the entire air traffic operation) and reducing the duration (makespan) of the operation. The numerical solution provided here was obtained using, for convenience, a software packaged based on the Pseudospectral Method with Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation.

In Euclidean geometry, all metric notions (<b>arc</b> <b>length</b> for curves, {{the first}} fun-damental form for surfaces, etc.) {{are derived from}} the Euclidean inner product on tangent vectors, and this inner product is {{preserved}} by the full symmetry group of Euclidean space (translations, rotations, and reflections).

Nevertheless, {{it is possible to}} define an invariant notion of <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> for nondegenerate curves, and an invariant first fundamental form for nondegenerate surfaces in equiaffine space.
