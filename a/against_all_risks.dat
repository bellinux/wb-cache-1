The gallant ship [...] Dreadnought, thoroughly repaired and classed A1 at Lloyd's, had [...] been insured for £3,000 <b>against</b> <b>all</b> <b>risks</b> of the sea. She sailed on [...] March 10, 1864, from Columbo for London. Three days later the crew, [...] while fishing, hooked a swordfish. Xiphias, however, broke the [...] line, and a few moments after leaped half out of the water, with [...] the object, it should seem, of taking a look at his persecutor, the [...] Dreadnaught. Probably he satisfied himself that the enemy was [...] some abnormally large cetacean, which it was his natural duty to [...] attack forthwith. Be this as it may, the attack was made, and the [...] next morning the captain was awakened with the unwelcome [...] intelligence that the ship had sprung a leak. She was taken back to [...] Columbo, and thence to Cochin, where she hove down. Near the keel [...] was found a round hole, an inch in diameter, running completely [...] through the copper sheathing and planking.|$|E

[...] "You'll find out nothing here - this man is {{obviously}} a fake of some kind." [...] But she wants a treatment...Joe shows the lady {{a photo of a}} young smiling couple. The young woman in the photo reminds Mrs A of herself when she was a carefree girl. Mrs. A realizes she wants to break the shell around her and has a dream of the same young couple with the man reading a declaration from a book titled “Ruth, Roses and Revolvers.” The young man is apparently trying to woo the woman “those who have insured themselves <b>against</b> <b>all</b> <b>risks</b> are bound to lose all.” The couple joins others at a film screening were the group watches a man on the screen who goes through various poses and gestures. The audience imitates the man in the film by repeating his gestures. After the screening the couple sees the book leaning against a tree. One woman jokes “all we need now is a revolver.” The man turns the book around. On the back cover is a photo of Man Ray, the author, and we see superimposed a procession of wounded soldiers.|$|E

50|$|Global risk {{potentials}} {{and their}} interplay with economic, social and ecological processes of change {{have emerged as}} a challenge to the international community. Never before has human intervention in nature assumed global dimensions. This has been driven on the one hand by a growing global population, particularly in developing countries, {{and on the other hand}} by rising human demands in conjunction with specific patterns of production and consumption, above all in industrialised countries. By presenting this report, the WBGU hopes to contribute constructively to an effective, efficient and objective management of the risks of global change. The approach taken by the WBGU is first to classify globally relevant risks and then to assign to these classes of risk both established and innovative risk assessment strategies and risk management tools. On this basis, management priorities can be set. However, the WBGU notes that it is impossible to safeguard <b>against</b> <b>all</b> global <b>risks,</b> particularly as exploiting opportunities will always entail taking risks.|$|R

Of course, the Euro currency is not a solution <b>against</b> <b>all</b> <b>risks</b> (it remains the risk of overheating and the risk of the loss of competitiveness), but amid the beginning and manifestation of global financial and economic crisis, the Euro currency proved to be a good enough protection for the euro area countries, increasing the attractiveness of this monetary area for the NMS.

40|$|Several {{papers have}} {{documented}} that US consumers {{can not fully}} insure themselves <b>against</b> <b>all</b> their idiosyncratic <b>risks,</b> but little is understood about which mechanisms provide insurance. We investigate whether, as some suggest, progressive taxes provide additional insurance. The methodology distinguishes insurance from redistribution, and can by applied to testing any potential insurance mechanism. Using repeated cross-sections from the US consumer expenditure survey (CEX), we relate changes in consumption inequality to several measures of tax progressivity. Identification exploits the variation in taxes both across states and over time. Our results suggest, under weak assumptions, that progressive taxes do not induce insurance, while stronger assumptions quantify this effect. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion that}} {{individuals}} face idiosyncratic labor-market uncertainty {{is a common}} one. Government programs such as unemployment insurance and social security are motivated by such an idea. Economic theory, ranging from labor supply to savings behavior to asset pric-ing, often presupposes that such risks are im-portant. A number of papers, however, have questioned this orthodoxy. Sumru Altug and Robert A. Miller (1990), for instance, are un-able to reject a set of factor-structure restrictions implied by complete markets. John H. Cochrane (1991) and Barbara J. Mace (1991) find evi-dence of consumption insurance, although not <b>against</b> <b>all</b> types of <b>risks.</b> Robert M. Townsend (1994) documents evidence of risk-sharing in Indian villages.

40|$|This article {{extends the}} {{standard}} adverse-selection model for competitive insurance markets, which assumes a single source of risk, {{to the case}} where individuals are subject to multiple risks. We compare the following market situations—the case where insurers can offer comprehensive policies <b>against</b> <b>all</b> sources or <b>risks</b> (complete contracts) and the case where different risks are covered by separate policies (incomplete contracts). In the latter case, we consider whether the insurer of a particular risk has perfect information regarding an individual's coverage against other sources of risks. The analysis emphasizes the informational role of bundling in multidimensional screening. When the market situation allows bundling, it is shown that in equilibrium the low-risk type {{with respect to a}} particular source of risk does not necessarily obtain partial coverage against that particular risk.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} for Airbus preparing a new freighter development process was {{the design of a}} solid freighter barrier, which separates the courier area from the cargo compartment. The major task of such a barrier is to protect the passengers <b>against</b> <b>all</b> <b>risks</b> caused due to cargo impact by a justifiable design. These risks may result from all kind of survivable incident and accident scenarios. Real aircraft crashes were analyzed to get away from a static book-case and come to a more realistic dynamic crash scenario. A reduced-order simulation model was built up to investigate and simulate the dynamic effects during crash. The simulation model considers the highly nonlinear stiffness and damping characteristics of all critical cargo types and also includes their energy absorption potentials. A series of full scale container crash tests have been performed at accredited car crash facilities. The test campaigns were complemented by numerous component tests to study also general crash principles. The critical simulation parameters were identified and implemented into the simulation model. The subsequent validation process showed a close agreement between simulation and test. The simulation environment {{has turned out to be}} a reliable basis to simulate all critical barrier loads with respect to the specific aircraft loading distributions. The essence of this investigation is an adequate understanding of the real crash effects. The proposed dynamic crash approach is more realistic than the static condition and results in an optimized safety barrier wall concept. This dynamic approach provides equivalent safety compared to the existing devices and is accepted by FAA and EASA...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to clarify benefits and risks in regards with data protection, cost; business can have {{by the use of}} this new technologies for the implementation and management of organization’s information systems. Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative case study of the results obtained via interviews. Three research questions were raised: Q 1 : How can company benefit from using Cloud Computing compared to other solutions?; Q 2 : What are possible issues that occur with Cloud Computing?; Q 3 : How would Cloud Computing change an organizations’ IT infrastructure? Findings – The calculations provided in the interview section prove the financial advantages, even though the precise degree of flexibility and performance has not been assessed. Cloud Computing offers great scalability. Another benefit that Cloud Computing offers, in addition to better performance and flexibility, is reliable and simple backup data storage, physically distributed and so almost invulnerable to damage. Although the advantages of Cloud Computing more than compensate for the difficulties associated with it, the latter must be carefully considered. Since the cloud architecture is relatively new, so far the best guarantee <b>against</b> <b>all</b> <b>risks</b> it entails, from a single company's perspective, is a well-formulated service-level agreement, where the terms of service and the shared responsibility and security roles between the client and the provider are defined.

40|$|Land {{development}} in the so-called "Ninety-Mile Desert" area of South Australia can now be regarded as having passed the experimental stage. This, of course, is not to infer that the land brought into production by the A. M. P.

Like other components of the rural sector this area {{can be expected to}} experience from time to time climatic variations, stock and plant diseases, and product price fluctuations which may materially affect its well-being. But, subject to this reservation, it can fairly be claimed that the A. M. P.

In this transition from experiment to accomplishment the main barriers which had long inhibited the development of much of this area have been demolished and this successful example is now being emulated independently by many private individuals.

60|$|This gentleman, Sir, acts as {{attorney}} for Mr. Paul Benfield. Every one who hears me is {{well acquainted with}} the sacred friendship and the steady mutual attachment that subsists {{between him and the}} present minister. As many members as chose to attend in the first session of this Parliament can best tell their own feelings at the scenes which were then acted. How much that honorable gentleman was consulted in the original frame and fabric of the bill, commonly called Mr. Pitt's India Bill, is matter only of conjecture, though by no means difficult to divine. But the public was an indignant witness of the ostentation with which the measure was made his own, and the authority with which he brought up clause after clause, to stuff and fatten the rankness of that corrupt act. As fast as the clauses were brought up to the table, they were accepted. No hesitation, no discussion. They were received by the new minister, not with approbation, but with implicit submission. The reformation may be estimated by seeing who was the reformer. Paul Benfield's associate and agent was held up to the world as legislator of Hindostan. But it was necessary to authenticate the coalition between the men of intrigue in India and the minister of intrigue in England by a studied display of the power of this their connecting link. Every trust, every honor, every distinction, was to be heaped upon him. He was at once made a Director of the India Company, made an alderman of London, and to be made, if ministry could prevail, (and I am sorry to say how near, how very near, they were prevailing,) representative of the capital of this kingdom. But to secure his services <b>against</b> <b>all</b> <b>risk,</b> he was brought in for a ministerial borough. On his part, he was not wanting in zeal for the common cause. His advertisements show his motives, and the merits upon which he stood. For your minister, this worn-out veteran submitted to enter into the dusty field of the London contest; and you all remember that in the same virtuous cause he submitted to keep a sort of public office or counting-house, where the whole business of the last general election was managed. It was openly managed by the direct agent and attorney of Benfield. It was managed upon Indian principles and for an Indian interest. This was the golden cup of abominations,--this the chalice of the fornications of rapine, usury, and oppression, which was held out by the gorgeous Eastern harlot,--which so many of the people, so many of the nobles of this land had drained to the very dregs. Do you think that no reckoning was to follow this lewd debauch? that no payment was to be demanded for this riot of public drunkenness and national prostitution? Here, you have it here before you! The principal of the grand election-manager must be indemnified; accordingly, the claims of Benfield and his crew must be put above all inquiry.|$|R

Without the key, the data cannot be decompressed. We focus on threat prevention by cryptography that, if properly implemented, is virtually impossible to break directly. Our security by design is based on two principles: first, defence in depth, where our proposed design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to get both the data and their key. Second, the principle of least privilege, where the attacker may gain access to only part of a system. The paper highlights the benefits of the solution that include high compression ratios, less bandwidth requirements, faster data transmission and response times, less storage space, and less energy consumption among others...|$|R
