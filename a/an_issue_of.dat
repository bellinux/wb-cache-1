5|$|The military's anti-venereal disease {{campaign}} {{marked a}} major {{turning point for}} the movement: {{it was the first}} time a government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters.

5|$|A major {{turning point}} for the {{movement}} came during World War I, when many U.S. servicemen were diagnosed with venereal diseases. The government's response included an anti-venereal disease campaign that framed sexual intercourse and contraception as issues {{of public health and}} legitimate topics of scientific research. This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters; as a consequence, contraception transformed from <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> morals to <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> public health.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E

When Vallas left the post to run for governor, Daley chose the relatively obscure Arne Duncan, who later became the U.S. Secretary of Education under Barack Obama, to lead the district. On March 19, 1997, the Chicago City Council adopted the Domestic Partners Ordinance, which made employee benefits available to same-sex partners of City employees.

5|$|A new Fire Emblem {{title was}} first {{announced}} in April 2004, {{with the full}} reveal coming in <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Weekly Shōnen Jump.

5|$|After reading <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the Tank Girl comic she had {{received}} as a gift, Talalay obtained permission from Deadlines publisher Tom Astor to direct a film adaptation. She selected Catherine Hardwicke to be the production designer, and worked closely with Martin and Hewlett during {{the making of the}} film. Tank Girl was filmed primarily in White Sands, New Mexico, and Tucson, Arizona. The film's critically praised soundtrack was assembled by Courtney Love, and the Rippers' makeup and prosthetics team was headed by Stan Winston. Winston's studio wanted to work on the project so much that they cut their usual prices in half {{in order to meet the}} film's budget.|$|E
5|$|Confusion arose when <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the French daily {{newspaper}} Le Petit Journal, published on 24 July 1904 {{on the occasion}} of the bey of Tunis's visit to France, reproduced an illustration showing the flag used while was visiting the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Ivan Sache of Flags of the World claimed that this flag design, which hadn't been seen earlier, may have been inaccurate, suggesting that the journalist might not have been at the affair or he had reproduced a drawing of the wrong flag.|$|E
5|$|During the {{communist}} era, {{the legacy of}} Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from {{the notion that he}} satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austria-Hungarian Empire, to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was Marx's theory of alienation. While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> debate.|$|E

Harrison had not applied to Scott for permission to recruit in the state, and many Kentuckians– from Scott's political enemy, Humphrey Marshall, to his trusted advisor, Jesse Bledsoe– perceived this as a slight to the governor. Ignoring Bledsoe's indignation, Scott refused to make <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the faux pas and instead {{became one of the}} staunchest supporters of Harrison's rising career.|$|E
5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
