5|$|An {{occupation}} of the pier was started by ten activists on the designated closure date. The campaign was boosted {{by the appearance of}} Chow Yun-fat early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, {{have been involved in the}} Star Ferry pier protest, and took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working a full-time job, vowing to block the demolition non-violently in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} murder of a {{motorcycle}} dispatch-rider and the theft of his top-secret documents by a motorcycle-riding assassin. The rider was en route from SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, then located in Versailles, to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain in France. Since Bond is already in Paris, his superior, M, sends him to assist in the investigation in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> can. Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey to Station F as the previous rider: as expected, the assassin attempts to kill Bond. Bond, however, is ready and kills the assassin. He then uncovers the assassin's hidden base of operations.|$|E

Robertson zealously supported the Democratic nomination of William Jennings Bryan for the presidency.|$|E

Burke was impressed enough by Crabbe's poems to promise to help him in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could. The two became close friends and Burke helped Crabbe greatly both in his literary career and in building a role within the church.|$|E

500|$|Tesla {{exhibited}} a pre-atomic understanding of physics in his writings; he {{disagreed with the}} theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating {{there was no such}} thing as an electron creating an electric charge. He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or [...] "sub-atom" [...] that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity. Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in <b>any</b> <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> was a believer in the 19th century concept of an all-pervasive [...] "ether" [...] that transmitted electrical energy.|$|E
500|$|Homer {{endeavors to}} make Bart more {{masculine}} by {{forcing him to}} look at a cigarette billboard featuring scantily clad women in hopes Bart will be attracted to girls. Homer then escorts him to see a steel mill to show Bart a manly environment; however, the entire workforce is gay, and during their breaks, they turn the steel mill into a gay disco. A desperate Homer insists on taking Bart deer hunting with Moe and Barney. When they cannot find any deer, they decide instead to go to [...] "Santa's Village" [...] and shoot the reindeer, despite a tearful Bart being reluctant to do so. This backfires when the reindeer attack them. John, with the help of Lisa and Marge, uses a Japanese Santa Claus robot to scare off the reindeer and save the hunting party. Homer accepts John, more or less, and tells Bart, who is still unaware of his father's concerns, that <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> lives his life is fine with him. After Lisa informs Bart that Homer thinks he is gay, Bart is stunned. The episode ends with everyone driving off in John's car.|$|E

500|$|With the {{financial}} and critical success of Jaws, Spielberg earned {{a vast amount of}} creative control from Columbia, including the right to make the film <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> wanted. Schrader turned in his script, which Spielberg called, [...] "one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned in to a major film studio or director. It was a terribly guilt-ridden story not about UFOs at all." [...] Titled Kingdom Come, the script's protagonist was a 45-year-old Air Force Officer named Paul Van Owen who worked with Project Blue Book. [...] " [...] job for the government is to ridicule and debunk flying saucers." [...] Schrader continued. [...] "One day he has an encounter. He goes to the government, threatening to blow the lid off to the public. Instead, he and the government spend 15 years trying to make contact." [...] Spielberg and Schrader experienced creative differences, hiring John Hill to rewrite. At one point the main character was a police officer. Spielberg [...] " [...] it hard to identify with men in uniform. I wanted to have Mr. Everyday Regular Fella." [...] Spielberg rejected the Schrader/Hill script during post-production on Jaws. He reflected, [...] "they wanted to make it like a James Bond adventure." ...|$|E
500|$|Hall's {{approach}} {{was to create}} peaceful compositions that evoked classicism, to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events and allow audiences {{to take in the}} action. Hall and Mendes first discussed the intended mood of a scene, but he was allowed to light the shot in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> felt necessary. In most cases, Hall first lit the scene's subject by [...] "painting in" [...] the blacks and whites, before adding fill light, which he reflected from beadboard or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill. Hall shot American Beauty in a [...] in the Super 35 format, using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 35mm film stock. He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within. He shot the whole film at the same T-stop (T1.9); given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects. He used Panavision Platinum cameras with the company's Primo series of prime and zoom lenses. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and EXR 5248 stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak's newly introduced Vision release print stock, which, combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5% lower in contrast. Hall used a 1/8inch Tiffen Black ProMist filter for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect {{may not have been the}} best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its anamorphic release print led to a slight amount of degradation; therefore, the diffusion from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35–anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended.|$|E
