40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a fully contactless high precision magnetically suspended position stage with large planar stroke. This stage is the first which is suitable for practical application in vacuum. The underlying electromechanical working principles, modelling and analysis, the mechanical and electrical design, real-time control, and the experimental results of a test set-up are presented. The possibility to combine magnetic suspension and propulsion in a single actuator was proven experimentally by a PhD investigation performed by Frank Auer in the years 19901995 at the Laboratory for Micro Engineering at Delft University of Technology. Prototypes showed low cross-coupling of suspension and propulsion, and sensor-limited accuracy. In 1995, this research started as a follow-up, with the goal: improvement of the practical applicability of linear Active Magnetic Bearings (ambs) {{in the field of}} Precision Engineering. Therefore, an investigation into the state-of-the-art in ambs was performed, which revealed that, due to the high development costs, ambs can be applied best for either high end applications (e. g. linear motion stages with high precision and throughput) or for high volume consumer products (e. g. bearings for hard disk drives). These applications then profit of the general advantages of ambs, like contactless operation (no wear, no maintenance, possibly application in vacuum, absence of stick-slip), and <b>adjustable</b> <b>bearing</b> characteristics (servo position, variable stiffness and damping, active vibration isolation). Disadvantages that may limit the applicability are the limited dynamic stiffness and bearing force, with its accompanying break-through risk, and the heat development by the coils. While rotational amb actuators are mature, and have become commercially available for several years, major development effort is focused on advanced control, reliability, modularity, and cost reduction there. In contrast, linear amb actuators are still evolving. Compared to their rotational counterparts, linear systems offer only one additional degree-of-freedom, but this leads to much more freedom of the electromechanical actuator design. Since no specific application was predefined for this research, a market investigation was performed. The results were combined into the definition of a target application. When the requirements for such an application were compared to the performance delivered by the stage that was developed by Auer, {{it turned out that the}} range of the planar stroke, the positioning accuracy, the propulsion force, and the acceleration all needed to be improved, before practical application could be considered. Moreover, for application in vacuum, the development of heat should be minimized, and the power dissipation on the suspended object needs to be negligible. This can only be accomplished by a thorough re-design or a completely new principle. Based on an investigation of the principles of electromechanics, and the status and applications of electromechanical actuators in general, a number of desirable capabilities was defined at the beginning of the work described. Six possibilities are identified that appear promising for improvement. 1. Developing an integrated Lorentz drive with reluctance bearing 2. Exploiting the ongoing improvement of rare earth permanent magnets for applying them for biasing 3. Applying crossing flux-guidance bars introducing a lateral freedom of motion 4. Applying a wireless propulsion (moving iron) removing both the heat of the coils of the rotor as well as avoiding the flying umbilical wires 5. Applying high permeability coil winding material, improving the number of ampere-turns in the air gap Some of these possibilities are new, while others are known from the state-of-the-art but are new in the combined or integrated application presented. For all of them, experimental demonstrators were built to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness. The first four possibilities are combined into a novel integrated planar active magnetic motor-bearing concept, the pamb, for which a patent application was granted. The basic pamb configuration can control two to four degrees-of-freedom. Numerous, differently shaped actuators can be derived from it, that all allow for a long, principally unlimited, planar or angular stroke. The novelty lies therein that the advantages of a list of magnetic bearing and motor aspects are combined into an indivisible, integrated solution. The novel configuration integrates: * energy efficient variable reluctance type suspension, * permanent magnet biasing for fast acceleration and hence high position stability, of both bearing and motor, * extended, crossing flux guidance bars that enable motion over a long stroke, while freedom of motion is allowed for long orthogonal linear or angular strokes, * saturation of parts of the yoke, which simplifies dimensioning and fine-tuning of the permanent magnets, and ensures an optimal bias flux level, all over the long stroke, * direct Lorentz propulsion without any wires on the flat iron rotor bars, but instead with wire on the fixed stator yoke, where conduction can cool the windings, which makes the stage applicable in vacuum, * simple shaped yoke parts that are easy to produce, and * a high evolvability, meaning that the system can be scaled up to even larger strokes without changing the maximum obtainable acceleration. Based on this configuration concept, a 6 dof experimental set-up was built that demonstrated the practical feasibility. The set-up, called the pamb, shows a robust behavior of the suspension, over a full planar stroke that covers 130 mm 130 mm. The novel moving iron propulsion, with magnets and coils on the stator only, proved to work equally well as the common engineering solution with coils on the moving part. Thus, all advantages of the system by Auer are maintained, while the planar stroke has been enlarged 16 times, the dissipation during suspension is decreased from 84 W to 0. 8 mW, and the heat generation and flying wires associated with the propulsion force are taken away from the rotor. Currently, a propulsion of 0. 2 g can be reached at a total of 200 W dissipation in four propulsion coils on the stator. It should be noted that the experimental system was not optimized for a high acceleration. When, as a follow up towards practical application, a prototype is to be built, acceleration can be improved by a factor five at least through the addition of windings. In addition, by switching of coil segments, the dissipation can be decreased a factor five. Since the acceleration that can be obtained with the homopolar Lorentz force within the pamb set-up is limited, it is recommended that, to further improve the acceleration in propulsion direction, salient poles are applied instead of the flat wound propulsion coils. Although, compared to the current pamb, both motor types are stronger, they have the following drawbacks. Firstly, cogging forces are introduced, secondly costs increase, and thirdly start-up of the bearings is complicated. The advantage remains that the maximum bias flux which can be controlled by the magnetic bearings is utilized still; even employed for both functions. Based on the outcome of the experiments, it is concluded that merging two basic pamb elements leads to non-linear couplingboth mechanic as well as magnetic that complicates improvement of the sub-micron position stability as achieved with the experimental set-up realized. Therefore, an alternative actuator layout is suggested that can control four degrees-of-freedom at max, which may serve as a building block for contactless positioning systems. The work presented demonstrates the large potential in electromechanical actuator design, to achieve compact and low cost solutions for integrated motor-bearings. Since the pamb actuator concept meets the requirements set by a number of practical applications, it is recommended to start a technological research project with the aim to develop an application dedicated prototype. For this, a list of suggestions for improvement is given, of which many are combined into the alternative planar motor-bearing design mentioned above. Finally, several suggestions are given to continue this research project by a dedicated research of either the force-current relation under the influence of yoke saturation and stray flux, or of a zero intrinsic stiffness motor-bearing actuator suitable for long linear or planar stroke.

50|$|When {{the wind}} turbine nacelle is {{positioned}} on {{the tower and}} the yaw bearing assembly is completed {{it is necessary to}} adjust the pressure on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the <b>adjustable</b> gliding <b>bearing</b> systems. These <b>adjustable</b> gliding <b>bearings</b> comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure distribution plate. In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (pre-tension) elements are located. The vertical position of the pressure plates is usually controlled by an adjustment screw. This adjustment screw presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure support plate, fixed on the bearing assembly with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw bearing arrangement is performing as anticipated.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundPulsatile flow in deep, {{perforating}} {{veins and}} varicose veins (VVs) {{has been described}} previously to support a hypothesis of arteriovenous (AV) fistulae in the pathogenesis of VVs. Its presence has also been suggested {{as a cause of}} failure of VV treatments. However, AV communications have never been adequately visualized and direct pressure tracings within leg veins have been inconclusive. The present study was observational aiming to investigate the prevalence and rate of spontaneous pulsation within the great saphenous vein (GSV) in volunteers and patients using color duplex and compare this to reflux and markers of disease severity. MethodsTwenty-seven consecutive patients (32 legs, median Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) = 5 [0 - 11]) attending the VV clinic and 23 consecutive ambulatory normal volunteers (46 legs) had their GSV assessed at midthigh using color duplex. Subjects were examined standing with the hips resting against an <b>adjustable</b> couch, <b>bearing</b> weight on the contralateral leg, with the test leg touching the ground. The presence of flow and reflux were initially determined using manual calf compression. Saphenous pulsation (SP) was defined as a cyclical change in velocity. The GSV diameter and SP rate were then recorded after 2 minutes of dependency. The number of pulsations was counted from video recordings. ResultsThe resting SP, if present, was discrete, monophasic, of variable amplitude, antegrade, and irregular, irrespective of respiration. Pulsation was detected in 2 / 44 (4. 5 %) legs with C 0 - 1 (C part of CEAP), 9 / 17 (52. 9 %) legs with C 2 - 3, and 16 / 17 (94. 1 %) legs with C 4 - 6 (P <. 05, z test of column proportions). Reflux occurred in 8 / 32 (25 %) legs without SP (C 0 = 2, C 1 = 1, C 2 = 3, C 3 = 2). The median GSV diameter was significantly elevated in the presence of SP (no pulse: 3. 5 [range, 1. 5 - 8. 1] mm; pulse: 7 [range, 4 - 9. 4] mm; P <. 0005). The median refluxing GSV diameter in GSV pulsators compared with nonpulsators was 7 (range, 4 - 9. 4) mm; vs 5. 1 (range, 2. 7 - 8. 1) mm, respectively (P =. 003). The median SP rate in refluxing GSVs was 52 (range, 22 - 95) beats per minute. ConclusionsThe high prevalence of pulsatile antegrade saphenous flow is a novel observation in patients with severe superficial chronic venous insufficiency. It is detectable in 75 % of patients with GSV reflux and significantly increases with clinical severity and saphenous diameter. It may be a marker of advanced venous disease and, as it is easy to record, it could supplement duplex evaluations of reflux. Further work is needed to establish the clinical relevance of the SP in terms of disease progression, recurrence after treatment, and as a hemodynamic marker of severity...|$|R
