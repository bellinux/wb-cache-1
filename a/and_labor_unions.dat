5|$|As of 2012, {{progress}} on the project has been stalled by disagreements between the Wolkoffs {{and the town of}} Islip over the amount the Wolkoffs will spend for the transportation piece of the project, and between the family <b>and</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> over wages and health care. The town of Islip has stated that the Wolkoffs agreed to spend $75million (2011USD) for the infrastructure improvements; however, the family stated in a September 2011 letter that they would only commit to $27million (2011USD) and that they never agreed to the original figure. Gerald Wolkoff thought that the discrepancy stemmed from his belief that transportation should be funded by the government, not from private sources, as his project would generate tax revenue for the government. Despite the issues surrounding the project, the Heartland project received $2.5million from the State of New York for roadway improvements in December 2011. The funding was part of a $101million (2011USD) package given to Long Island for various economic improvements.|$|E
