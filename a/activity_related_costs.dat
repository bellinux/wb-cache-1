40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} level of user {{innovation}} activity related to different brands of {{the same type of}} product- automated clinical chemistry analyzers. Strong interbrand differences are found in user involve-ment in such innovation tasks as the development of new chemical test methods for use on the different analyzers studied. We test the speculation of inter-viewees that the cause of the differences observed lies in details of the design of the analyzers studied which makes some easier for users to modify than others, and find it supported by our data. As product design is a variable under the control of product manufacturing firms, this finding suggests that manufacturers can, it at least some product categories, influence the level of user innovation related to their products via product designs which encourage or discourage such <b>activity.</b> <b>Related</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits are discussed.

40|$|Generating {{companies}} use {{the maintenance}} cost {{function as the}} sole or main objective for creating the maintenance schedule of power generators. Usually only maintenance <b>activities</b> <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> are considered to derive the cost function. However, in deregulated markets, maintenance <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> alone do not represent the full costs of generators. This paper models various cost components that affect the maintenance activities in deregulated power markets. The costs that we model include direct and indirect maintenance, failures, interruptions, contractual compensation, rescheduling, and market opportunity. The loss of firm’s reputation and selection of loyalty model are also considered using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) within an opportunity cost model. A case study is used to illustrate the modelling activities. The enhanced model is utilised in generator maintenance scheduling cases. The experimental results demonstrate the importance and impact of market <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> in maintenance schedules...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is an {{analysis}} of the use of management techniques and resultant recommendations for better application of selected techniques. Management techniques consist {{of a wide range of}} managerial activities, this thesis is focused on ten of them. These techniques are general and universal. The theoretical part of this thesis focuses on characterisation of selected techniques. In practical part selected managers and their application of these techniques at their work are analysed. The analysis is based on individual interviews. The purpose of presented analysis was to find shortcomings of techniques and to calculate these mistakes financially. If a manager does not use correct technique during his own <b>activity,</b> <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> to the task are often bigger and results are more expensive than they have to be.

40|$|Objectives: This {{study of}} {{outpatient}} costs aims to test two classification systems, a disaggregated occasion of service system (OOS), and a 'bundled' system which attributes related ancillary services to an index clinic visit; {{and to provide}} advice to H&CS Victoria on transitional payment policy. Context: Health services delivered by hospital outpatient departments {{are the subject of}} increasing research and policy attention, both in Australia and overseas. Payers are particularly concerned with the large share of health services funding, and with the effects of multiple funding sources on provider cost shifting. Victoria's introduction of casemix-based funding for inpatient services in 1993 highlighted the lack of information on outpatient activities, which represent 17. 5 % of total expenditures in the State. Design: A purposive sample of five hospitals was recruited; two months of <b>activity</b> and <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> data was extracted form each hospital's information system. Results: Costs of 148, 234 OOS and 108, 486 episodes were analysed. Non-admitted patient services had a mean OOS of $ 75 and a mean 'bundled' case of $ 102. Weights for the OOS classification ranged from 0. 4 to 2. 0; the 'bundled' system ranged from 0. 2 and 2. 8. High within-category variability (CV> 1) was found for over half of both the OOS and 'bundled' categories. Conclusions: Financial data and cost allocations were consistent across hospitals sampled; activity data were less reliable. Differences relating to: outpatient counting rules; definitions for clinical episode and OOS; and patient booking methods varied across hospitals. Intrinsic limitations of the two systems for payment purposes are discussed. Coding rules and audit procedures would support introduction of payment system changes in 1996 / 97...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores a new competitive arena which shifts {{focus from}} competition for customers, where advantages are becoming {{harder to find}} and sustain, towards competitive advantage through control of inbound logistics. Supply chain management, industrial/organizational economics, transaction cost economics, and the resource-based view support how inbound logistics <b>activities</b> may <b>relate</b> to <b>cost</b> advantages, access to demanded quantifies of limited inputs, quicker delivery of inputs, and customized presentations of inputs. These advantages can support the competitive strategies and supplement downstream competitive actions employed by firms.

Regarding this work, {{we will find}} a set of controls that minimizes the number of exposed human, symptomatically infected human, and {{the total number of}} mosquitoes as well as the costs associated with implementing the control strategy. The constants A_ 1, A_ 2, and A_ 3, are the weighted constants associated with exposed human, symptomatically infected human, and the total number of mosquito, respectively. The constants B_ 1, B_ 2, and B_ 3 are the weighted constants of the control variables u_ 1, u_ 2 and u_ 3, respectively. The terms 1 / 2 B_ 1 u_ 1 ^ 2, 1 / 2 B_ 2 u_ 2 ^ 2, and 1 / 2 B_ 3 u_ 3 ^ 2 are the costs associated with implementing each of the three controls. The <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> to the first control might be the expenses of using insect repellent, mosquito net, and herbal spray for instance. The <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> to second control might be the expenses of providing protections or warning leaflets about the safe sexual <b>activity.</b> The <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> to the last control could come from the expenses of using mosquito pesticides and the process implementation.|$|R
40|$|In a {{world with}} no {{transaction}} costs, vertical integration is intrinsically inefficient because it reduces specialization and thus the exercise of comparative advantage among firm units. However, in reality transactions between separate firms carrying out vertically <b>related</b> <b>activities</b> have <b>costs</b> stemming from weak property rights protection, information asymmetry, or agency behavior, all of which lead to anticipated opportunistic behavior and ex ante distortions in investment. If these transaction difficulties cannot be overcome by contracting, because of weak institutions or insufficient market disciplinary forces, vertical integration can be a solution. Politically connected corporate insiders can use vertical integration to enhance their rent-seeking returns, though these are likely not shared with outside shareholders if this can be avoided. Empirical validation of these hypotheses is most likely in emerging economies, where legal and market institutions are often weak despite substantial variation across sub-regions. Using Chinese data, we find that vertical integration is indeed importantl...|$|R
40|$|The {{activation}} of an immune response is beneficial for organisms {{but may also}} have costs that affect fitness. Documented immune costs include those associated with acquisition of special nutrients, as well as immunopathology or autoimmunity. Here, we test whether an experimental induction {{of the immune system}} with a non-pathological stimulant can elevate energy turnover in passerine birds. We injected phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), a commonly used mitogen that activates the cell-mediated immune response, into the wing web of house sparrows, Passer domesticus. We then examined energetic costs resulting from this immune <b>activity</b> and <b>related</b> those <b>costs</b> to other physiological activities. We found that PHA injection significantly elevated resting metabolic rate (RMR) of challenged sparrows relative to saline controls. We calculated the total cost of this immune activity to be ca. 4. 20 kJ per day (29 % RMR), which is equivalent to the cost of production of half of an egg (8. 23 kJ egg(- 1)) in this species. We suggest that immune activity in wild passerines increases energy expenditure, which in turn may influence important life-history characteristics such as clutch size, timing of breeding or the scheduling of moult...|$|R

40|$|Background: Choosing an {{appropriate}} accounting system for hospital {{has always been}} a challenge for hospital managers. Traditional cost system (TCS) causes cost distortions in hospital. Activity-based costing (ABC) method is a new and more effective cost system. Objective: This study aimed to compare ABC with TCS method in calculating the unit cost of medical services and to assess its applicability in Kashani Hospital, Shahrekord City, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on accounting data of Kashani Hospital in 2013. Data on accounting reports of 2012 and other relevant sources at the end of 2012 were included. To apply ABC method, the hospital was divided into several cost centers and five cost categories were defined: wage, equipment, space, material, and overhead costs. Then activity centers were defined. ABC method was performed into two phases. First, the total costs of cost centers were assigned to <b>activities</b> by using <b>related</b> <b>cost</b> factors. Then the costs of activities were divided to cost objects by using cost drivers. After determining the cost of objects, the cost price of medical services was calculated and compared with those obtained from TCS. Results: The Kashani Hospital had 81 physicians, 306 nurses, and 328 beds with the mean occupancy rate of 67. 4 % during 2012.

50|$|The ratios may {{be applied}} to any unit {{comprising}} economic activities because such <b>activities</b> always <b>relate</b> to <b>cost</b> and value, “and having some physical substrate, always influence the environment.” Furthermore, {{there are two different}} levels upon which to orchestrate the ratios: ‘’micro’’ and ‘’macro’’. There are three different methods to determine eco-efficiency at the micro-level. First, ‘’incremental eco-efficiency’’, which “specifies the effects of the total value of a product system or sector and its total concomitant environmental effects.” Second, an analysis method nicknamed ‘’win-win’’, which “gives a comparison between a historical reference situation and potentially new situations based on the use of new technologies.” It {{should be noted that the}} win-win micro-method is limited because it cannot give a concrete answer on the question of whether it improves overall environmental performance. And the third is ‘’difference eco-efficiency’’, which is similar to the win-win variant, but removes all irrelevant alternatives to heighten potential for optimal technologies while comparing two alternatives.Now the macro-level is much less defined and has shown less accurate results. However, “the ultimate aim of eco-efficiency analysis is to help move micro-level decision making into macro-level optimality.” The main goal in years to come is to create headline indicators to carry out macro-level analysis at a country/world scale.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Construction {{materials}} take up {{a significant}} proportion of the total construction cost. Without careful planning and controlling on the flow of construction materials, {{it is possible that the}} cost of materials may increase unnecessarily. In view of that, this paper aims to examine whether the development of logistics cost analysis can help determine suitable logistics strategies for a project which involves the use of bulky components like precast concrete units. Design/methodology/approach - The cost elements incurred during the logistics process of precast components from the supplier's yard to the construction site are first identified through the activity-based costing (ABC) approach. Under each element, the resources necessary to fulfil the specific element are analysed. By representing those cost components through the cost functions, simulations can be carried out to determine the logistics cost under different logistic scenarios. Findings - Through the ABC approach, the resources consumed can be traced back to the consuming activity and subsequently to a particular cost element. More importantly, the results indicate that the simulation model can identify a logistics option which would result in the lowest logistics cost without affecting the construction schedule. Originality/value - This paper should help increase understanding of managers and planners on construction logistics <b>activities</b> and their <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> so as to increase their bid competitiveness and/or improve the chance of success at the construction stage by minimising the construction logistics cost.
