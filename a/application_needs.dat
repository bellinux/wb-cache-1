25|$|In general, energy can {{be stored}} in a capacitor, super capacitor, or battery. Capacitors are used when the <b>application</b> <b>needs</b> to provide huge energy spikes. Batteries leak less energy and are {{therefore}} used when the device needs to provide a steady flow of energy.|$|E
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{providing}} process-specific transmission channels for applications, the layer establishes {{the concept of the}} port. This is a numbered logical construct allocated specifically for each of the communication channels an <b>application</b> <b>needs.</b> For many types of services, these port numbers have been standardized so that client computers may address specific services of a server computer without the involvement of service announcements or directory services.|$|E

25|$|Plings {{are also}} used in Acorn RISC OS to denote an {{application}} directory: a folder that when double clicked executes a program file inside called !Run. Other files in the appfolder generally contain resources the <b>application</b> <b>needs</b> to run. The appfolder {{can be viewed as}} a normal folder by double-clicking with the shift key held down. In addition, other special resource files such as !Boot (executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the filer), !Sprites (an icon file containing icon definitions loaded if !Boot cannot be found) and !Help (a text, HTML or other executable file listed in the filer menu for the application) also start with a pling.|$|E

2500|$|This feature {{makes it}} easy to develop {{efficient}} languages within languages. [...] For example, the Common Lisp Object System can be implemented cleanly as a language extension using macros. [...] This means that if an <b>application</b> <b>needs</b> a different inheritance mechanism, it can use a different object system. [...] This is in stark contrast to most other languages; for example, Java does not support multiple inheritance and there is no reasonable way to add it.|$|E

2500|$|Visa {{exemption}} {{also applies}} to residents of countries that are visa exempt as well as holders of a valid visa issued by Canada, the United States or a Schengen member state.

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is to}} simulate capabilities using commonly supported hierarchical domains; in this approach, each protected object must reside in an address space that the application does not have access to; the kernel also maintains a list of capabilities in such memory. [...] When an <b>application</b> <b>needs</b> to access an object protected by a capability, it performs a system call and the kernel then checks whether the application's capability grants it permission to perform the requested action, {{and if it is}} permitted performs the access for it (either directly, or by delegating the request to another user-level process). [...] The performance cost of address space switching limits the practicality of this approach in systems with complex interactions between objects, but it is used in current operating systems for objects that are not accessed frequently or which are not expected to perform quickly.|$|E

50|$|OLE DB {{separates}} the data store from the <b>application</b> that <b>needs</b> {{access to it}} {{through a set of}} abstractions that include the datasource, session, command, and rowsets. This was done because different <b>applications</b> <b>need</b> access to different types and sources of data, and do not necessarily want to know how to access functionality with technology-specific methods. OLE DB is conceptually divided into consumers and providers. The consumers are the <b>applications</b> that <b>need</b> access to the data, and the providers are the software components that implement the interface and thereby provides the data to the consumer. OLE DB is part of the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) stack.|$|R
