5|$|The anteroconid—the cusp <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> m1—is usually {{divided in}} two by a central {{indentation}} (the anteromedian fossettid) in A.donovani, but this fossettid is absent in A.praeuniversitatis. Behind the anteroconid is the protoconid—metaconid pair of cusps. There is an anterolabial cingulum—a crest {{at the front}} labial margin, {{in front of the}} protoconid. There is a long crest behind the metaconid, a mesolophid. There is usually no corresponding crest (an ectolophid) behind the protoconid. Another pair of cusps—the hypoconid and the entoconid—is located {{at the back of the}} tooth. The entoconid, the lingual cusp of the two, is oriented forwards. There is always a large root <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the tooth and another at the back. A.donovani usually has a small labial root between the two large roots and often also another small root at the lingual side, but only one of four A.praeuniversitatis m1s even has the labial rootlet.|$|E

5|$|A christening ewer and basin {{made by the}} Garrard&Co. founder George Wickes in 1735 {{were used}} at the christening of the future GeorgeIII in 1738.

An inscription <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the ewer records its use at the christening of GeorgeIII's son, Prince Alfred, in 1780. The handle of the ewer is topped by a figure of Hercules slaying the Hydra, symbolising the triumph of virtue over vice.|$|E

5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E

5|$|In Dermotherium chimaera, the p4 and m1 through m3 {{are similar}} to each other (and unlike the i3, canine, and p3) and appear to form a series of {{decreasing}} size from front to back. In D.major, only m2 and m3 are known, but they are similar in morphology and m3 is smaller than m2. In the Sunda colugo, however, the teeth get larger from p4 to m3. The p4 and molars have a distinct trigonid (a triangular group of cusps <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a tribosphenic tooth) and talonid. The trigonid contains strong protoconid and metaconid cusps. The metaconid is stronger than the protoconid in the molars, {{but it is not}} clear whether this is the case in the p4. In the living colugos, the protoconid is higher than the metaconid in both p4 and m1. The trigonid is longer in the p4 than in the molars. In D.chimaera, the trigonid is broader than in D.major. A low crest, the paracristid, descends from the protoconid lingually and towards the front, forming the front margin of the trigonid; there is no distinct cusp (a paraconid) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the trigonid on the p4, but this cusp is present in the molars.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, the Gold Coast City Council {{released}} {{plans for}} a Mack Rides Water Coaster at Sea World. The ride would have been located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the park, with the ride's station situated where the Penguin Encounter exhibit exists and the main track extending out and over the car park. These plans were shelved. In December 2008, Sea World opened Jet Rescue, an Intamin JetSki Coaster.|$|E
5|$|In the legion, the velites were {{attached}} to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii. They usually formed up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the legion before battle to harass the enemy with javelin throws and to prevent the enemy doing the same before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier infantry to attack. After they had fallen back, they would move up behind the attacking troops and throw darts at the enemy. They also sometimes carried wounded back to the rear, however usually a corps of deportates did this. In a pitched battle, the velites would form up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the legion and cover the advance of the hastati, who were armed with swords. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back and let the principes, similarly equipped though more experienced infantry, take over. If the principes failed, they would retire behind the triarii, well trained, heavily armoured, spear armed legionaries and let them attack.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
5|$|In {{this type}} of legion, the 900 principes formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each. The principes stood in the second battle line, behind hastati of the first line {{and in front of}} the triarii in the third. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin armed light infantry would form up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati, light spearmen.|$|E

Representing the hosts, Zhu Xiaolin was the only non-African {{to reach the top}} eight at the championships. The joint effort of the Japanese women aided them to a sixth consecutive team bronze medal – making them the only medalling country outside the typically strong African triumvirate of Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea.|$|E
