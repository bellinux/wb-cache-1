She was certainly a leader, and a pioneer.|$|R

30|$|In addition, there <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> {{academics}} claiming any difficulty when sharing, {{and this}} {{could be explained by}} the fact that there <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> algorithms in their possession and thus a lower number of people who see problems in sharing is natural.|$|R
5|$|Breeding densities {{vary from}} 0.9–6pairs/km (1.4–9.7pairs/mi) of coast {{depending}} {{on the quality of}} the habitat. There <b>are</b> <b>few</b> threats, although oil spills can temporarily reduce the invertebrate population of affected rocky coasts.|$|E
5|$|Conscientious objectors (COs) {{refuse to}} {{participate}} in military service because of belief or religious training. During wartime, this stance conflicts with conscription efforts. Those willing to accept non-combatant roles, such as medical personnel, are accommodated. There <b>are</b> <b>few</b> legal options for draftees who cannot cooperate with the military in any way.|$|E
5|$|Interordinal hybrids (between {{different}} orders) <b>are</b> <b>few,</b> {{but have}} been made with the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (female) and the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus (male).|$|E

5|$|New Guinea, writes Wallace, {{is mostly}} unknown, {{with only the}} {{wildlife}} of the northwestern peninsula partially explored, but already 250 land birds are known, making the island of great interest. There <b>are</b> <b>few</b> mammals, mostly marsupials, including a kangaroo (first seen by Le Brun in 1714).|$|E
5|$|Production {{ended in}} 1967 {{soon after the}} Rootes Group {{was taken over by}} Chrysler, which did not have a {{suitable}} engine to replace the Ford V8. Owing to the ease and affordability of modifying the Tiger, there <b>are</b> <b>few</b> surviving cars in standard form.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately the {{smallest}} Lanchester became far {{too expensive for}} the size of car it <b>was,</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> sold and production ended in 1951.|$|R

5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>few</b> {{compound}} words, {{but lots}} of derivations. The grammar employs a mixture of head and dependent marking: both agent and patient are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative.|$|E
5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>few</b> draft-type Finnhorse family lines left, {{and only}} an {{estimated}} {{two or three}} hundred animals {{are known to be}} used as actual workhorses in the 21st century.

Snakes species include bullsnakes {{and rubber}} boas, {{as well as}} western rattlesnakes, which {{are most likely to}} be found at lower elevations and in the Minidoka District. Amphibians including the Columbia spotted frog, long-toed salamander, and the Rocky Mountain tailed frog are relatively common.|$|E
