25|$|Father Sandoz, {{a talented}} Puerto Rican linguist, is {{described}} as of mixed Taíno and Conquistador heritage and character.

Several of his close friends and co-workers, people {{with a variety of}} unique skills <b>and</b> <b>talents,</b> had seemingly coincidental connections to Arecibo; one of them, a gifted young technician, was the first to hear the transmissions. In Sandoz's mind, only God's will could bring this group of people with the perfect combination of knowledge and experience together at the moment when the alien signal was detected. These were the people who, with three other Jesuit priests, were chosen by the Society of Jesus to travel to the planet, using an interstellar vessel made with a small asteroid.|$|E
25|$|According to the JCT, an {{organization}} that provides workers with sufficient levels of skill variety (using different skills <b>and</b> <b>talents</b> in performing work), task identity (contributing to a clearly identifiable larger project), and task significance (impacting the lives or work of other people) {{is likely to have}} workers who feel their work has meaning and value. Sufficiently high levels of autonomy (independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job) will inspire the worker to feel responsibility for the work; and sufficiently high levels of Task Feedback (receiving timely, clear, specific, detailed, actionable information about the effectiveness of his or her job performance) will inspire the worker to feel the organization is authentically interested in helping to foster his/her professional development and growth. The combined effect of these psychological states results in desired personal and work outcomes: intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, performance quality, low absenteeism, and low turnover rate.|$|E

25|$|By 1579, Caccini {{was singing}} at the Medici court. He was a tenor, {{and he was}} able to {{accompany}} himself on the viol or the archlute; he sang at various entertainments, including weddings and affairs of state, and took part in the sumptuous intermedi of the time, the elaborate musical, dramatic, visual spectacles which were one of the precursors of opera. Also during this time he took part in the movement of humanists, writers, musicians and scholars of the ancient world who formed the Florentine Camerata, the group which gathered at the home of Count Giovanni de' Bardi, and which was dedicated to recovering the supposed lost glory of ancient Greek dramatic music. With Caccini's abilities as a singer, instrumentalist, and composer added to the mix of intellects <b>and</b> <b>talents,</b> the Camerata developed the concept of monodyan emotionally affective solo vocal line, accompanied by relatively simple chordal harmony on one or more instrumentswhich was a revolutionary departure from the polyphonic practice of the late Renaissance.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{individual}} differences in aptitude, defined as a domain-specific skill within the normal ability range, <b>and</b> <b>talent,</b> defined as a domain specific skill of exceptional quality, is under debate. The nature {{of the variation in}} aptitudes <b>and</b> exceptional <b>talents</b> across different domains was investigated in a population based twin sample. Self-report data from 1, 685 twin pairs (12 – 24  years) were analyzed for Music, Arts, Writing, Language, Chess, Mathematics, Sports, Memory, and Knowledge. The influence of shared environment was small for both aptitude <b>and</b> <b>talent.</b> Additive <b>and</b> non-additive genetic effects explained the major part of the substantial familial clustering in the aptitude measures with heritability estimates ranging between. 32 and. 71. Heritability estimates for <b>talents</b> were higher <b>and</b> ranged between. 50 and. 92. In general, the genetic architecture for aptitude <b>and</b> <b>talent</b> was similar in men and women.
