5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>willing</b> to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E

2500|$|After {{discussing}} {{the matter with}} a few congregants, Kahane put out {{an ad in the}} Jewish Press on May 24, 1968, which read: [...] "We are talking of JEWISH SURVIVAL! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>willing</b> to stand up for democracy and Jewish survival? Join and support the Jewish Defense Corps." [...] Shortly after, Kahane renamed the group the [...] "Jewish Defense League," [...] fearing that [...] "Corps" [...] would be construed as too militant. The group's declared purpose was: [...] "to combat anti-Semitism in {{the public and private sectors}} of life in the United States of America." [...] Kahane stated that the League was formed to [...] "do the job that the Anti-Defamation League should do but doesn't." ...|$|E

However, Lu Su saw that Yuan Shu's {{administration}} was ill-disciplined and believed that Yuan would not be successful. He told his followers, [...] "The central government has failed. Robbers and bandits are rampant. The areas around the Huai and Si rivers are no longer safe. I heard the lands in Jiangdong are fertile, its population is prosperous, and its army is powerful. We can take shelter there. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>willing</b> to accompany me to that paradise and wait until the situation here stabilises?" [...] They unanimously agreed to follow him.|$|E

2500|$|Said former Tigers manager Jim Leyland of Miller's early struggles, [...] "He {{was like}} a lot of guys {{breaking}} into the profession and wasn’t sure what it was all about. [...] He had a huge arm – big, big stuff — but he found it tough to repeat his delivery. ... He didn't have the command. [...] But I think he's got it right. [...] This game is hard. [...] Success is definitely not a straight line, but <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>willing</b> to work?" [...] Former Boston batterymate David Ross, who observed Miller while he was transitioning from starting to relieving full-time, said [...] ""A guy like Andrew Miller has perspective on success and failure, so he understands not to take anything for granted and to stay in the moment and continue to do what he does best.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} Everest took shape in Gowariker's mind around {{two years before}} the telenovela was made. At that time he was {{confused}} between the themes of female empowerment and the fairly obscure sport of mountaineering. As he could not proceed with either of them individually, Gowariker combined the two themes into one, creating the theme of Everest. Gowariker stated that: [...] "The whole idea of the show actually began with an insight that what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>willing</b> to do for your dreams?" [...] Before starting the shooting of Everest, Gowariker had to do a great deal of research. The makers referred to books such as To Everest and Beyond (by Edmund Hillary) and accounts by various other mountaineers, a few of whom they met personally. Mitali Mahajan, who co-wrote the story and the screenplay of the show, said: [...] "There are 14 peaks that have an elevation of over 8,000 meters and some enthusiastic people have climbed them all. A lot of them have live blogs about their journey through these peak. We have been following a lot of them." ...|$|E
