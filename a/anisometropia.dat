Any visual deprivation, that is, anything interfering with such input over a prolonged period of time, such as a cataract, severe eye turn or strabismus, [...] <b>anisometropia</b> (unequal refractive error between the two eyes), or covering or patching the eye during medical treatment, will usually result in a severe and permanent decrease in visual acuity and pattern recognition in the affected eye if not treated early in life, a condition known as amblyopia. The decreased acuity is reflected in various abnormalities in cell properties in the visual cortex. These changes include a marked {{decrease in the number}} of cells connected to the affected eye as well as cells connected to both eyes in cortical area V1, resulting in a loss of stereopsis, i.e. depth perception by binocular vision (colloquially: [...] "3D vision"). The period of time over which an animal is highly sensitive to such visual deprivation is referred to as the critical period.|$|E
50|$|A {{determination}} of the prevalence of <b>anisometropia</b> has several difficulties. First of all, the measurement of refractive error may vary from one measurement to the next. Secondly, different criteria have been employed to define <b>anisometropia,</b> and the boundary between <b>anisometropia</b> and isometropia depend on their definition.|$|E
50|$|Anisometropic {{persons who}} have {{strabismus}} are mostly far-sighted, {{and almost all of}} these have (or have had) esotropia. However, there are indications that <b>anisometropia</b> influences the long-term outcome of a surgical correction of an inward squint, and vice versa. More specifically, for patients with esotropia who undergo strabismus surgery, <b>anisometropia</b> {{may be one of the}} risk factors for developing consecutive exotropia and poor binocular function may be a risk factor for <b>anisometropia</b> to develop or increase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anisometropia</b> is the {{condition}} {{in which the two}} eyes have unequal refractive power. Each eye can be nearsighted (myopia), farsighted (hyperopia) or a combination of both, which is called antimetropia. Generally a difference in power of two diopters or more is the accepted threshold to label {{the condition}} <b>anisometropia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Refractive surgery causes {{only minimal}} size differences, similar to contact lenses. In a study {{performed}} on 53 {{children who had}} amblyopia due to <b>anisometropia,</b> surgical correction of the <b>anisometropia</b> followed by strabismus surgery if required led to improved visual acuity and even to stereopsis {{in many of the}} children (see: Refractive surgery#Children).|$|E

50|$|One study {{estimated}} that 6% of those {{between the ages}} of 6 and 18 have <b>anisometropia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several {{studies have}} found that <b>anisometropia</b> occurs more {{frequently}} and tends to be more severe for persons with high ametropia, and that this is particularly true for myopes. <b>Anisometropia</b> follows a U-shape distribution according to age: it is frequent in infants aged only a few weeks, is more rare in young children, comparatively more frequent in teenagers and young adults, and more prevalent after presbyopia sets in, progressively increasing into old age.|$|E
50|$|Notwithstanding {{research}} {{performed on}} the biomechanical, structural and optical characteristics of anisometropic eyes, the underlying reasons for <b>anisometropia</b> are still poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|One {{cause of}} {{significant}} <b>anisometropia</b> and subsequent aniseikonia has been aphakia. Aphakic patients {{do not have}} a crystalline lens. The crystalline lens is often removed because of opacities called cataracts. The absence of this lens left the patient highly hyperopic (farsighted) in that eye. For some patients the removal was only performed on one eye, resulting in the <b>anisometropia</b> / aniseikonia. Today, this is rarely a problem because when the lens is removed in cataract surgery, an intraocular lens, or IOL is left in its place.|$|E

50|$|Refractive {{amblyopia}} {{may result}} from <b>anisometropia</b> (unequal refractive error between the two eyes). <b>Anisometropia</b> exists {{when there is a}} difference in the power between the two eyes. The eye which provides the brain with a clearer image typically becomes the dominant eye. The image in the other eye is blurred, which results in abnormal development of one half of the visual system. Refractive amblyopia is usually less severe than strabismic amblyopia and is commonly missed by primary care physicians because of its less dramatic appearance and lack of obvious physical manifestation, such as with strabismus. Given that the refractive correction of <b>anisometropia</b> by means of spectacles typically leads to different image magnification for the two eyes, which may in turn prevent binocular vision, a refractive correction using contact lenses is to be considered. Also pediatric refractive surgery is a treatment option, in particular if conventional approaches have failed due to aniseikonia or lack of compliance or both.|$|E
50|$|Suppression is {{frequent}} {{in children}} with <b>anisometropia</b> or strabismus or both. For instance, children with infantile esotropia may alternate with which eye they look, each time suppressing vision in the other eye.|$|E
50|$|Frequently, {{amblyopia}} {{is associated}} with a combination of <b>anisometropia</b> and strabismus. In some cases, the vision between the eyes can differ to the point where one eye has twice average vision while the other eye is completely blind.|$|E
50|$|Eccentric {{fixation}} is {{less common}} but nonetheless a possible reason {{as to why}} a patient may fail the 4 PRT. <b>Anisometropia</b> in a patient {{can lead to a}} microtropia. If left untreated at a young age foveal suppression occurs and the eccentric area of the deviated eye replaces foveal fixation for both binocular and monocular vision. This occurs with the interest of finding better visual acuity, however all patients found with eccentric fixation have amblyopia, suppression, <b>anisometropia</b> and poorer stereopsis. Eccentric fixation utilises an abnormal retinal correspondence point and not the fovea, no movement under the prism is seen when placed over the deviated eye as the image falls onto the suppression scotoma.|$|E
50|$|Pediatric {{refractive}} surgery involves other risks than {{refractive surgery}} on adults, yet {{it may be}} indicated especially for children whose cognitive or visual development is failing due to refractive error, in particular in cases of bilateral high refractive error, <b>anisometropia,</b> anisometric amblyopia or accommodative esotropia.|$|E
50|$|For {{those with}} large degrees of <b>anisometropia,</b> {{spectacle}} correction may cause {{the person to}} experience a difference in image magnification between the two eyes (aniseikonia) which could also prevent the development of good binocular vision. This can {{make it very difficult}} to wear glasses without symptoms such as headaches and eyestrain. However, the earlier the condition is treated, the easier it is to adjust to glasses.|$|E
50|$|Aniseikonia {{can occur}} {{naturally}} or be {{induced by the}} correction of a refractive error, usually <b>anisometropia</b> (having significantly different refractive errors between each eye) or antimetropia (being myopic (nearsighted) in one eye and hyperopic (farsighted) in the other.) Meridional aniseikonia occurs when these refractive differences only occur in one meridian (see astigmatism). Refractive surgery can cause aniseikonia {{in much the same}} way that it is caused by glasses and contacts.|$|E
50|$|In case {{of strong}} <b>anisometropia,</b> contact lenses may be {{preferable}} to spectacles because they avoid {{the problem of}} visual disparities due to size differences (aniseikonia) which is otherwise caused by spectacles in which the refractive power is very different for the two eyes. In a few cases of strabismic children with anisometropic amblyopia, a balancing of the refractive error eyes via refractive surgery has been performed before strabismus surgery was undertaken.|$|E
50|$|Most {{affected}} {{people also}} experience eye problems, including colobomata (notches) {{in the lower}} eyelids, partial or complete absence of eyelashes on the lower lid, downward angled eyelids, drooping of upper and lower eyelids, and narrowing of the tear ducts. Vision loss can occur and is associated with strabismus, refractive errors, and <b>anisometropia.</b> It can also be caused by severely dry eyes, a consequence of lower eyelid abnormalities and frequent eye infections.|$|E
50|$|In {{certain types}} of <b>anisometropia,</b> the visual cortex of the brain will not use both eyes {{together}} (binocular vision), and will instead suppress the central vision {{of one of the}} eyes. If this occurs often enough during the first 10 years of life while the visual cortex is developing, it can result in amblyopia, a condition where even when correcting the refractive error properly, the person is still not correctable to 20/20.|$|E
5000|$|Aspheric lenses {{are also}} {{sometimes}} used for eyeglasses. Aspheric eyeglass lenses allow for crisper vision than standard [...] "best form" [...] lenses, mostly when looking in other directions than the lens optical center. Moreover, {{the reduction of}} the magnification effect of a lens may help with prescriptions that have different powers in the 2 eyes (<b>anisometropia).</b> Not related to the optical quality, they may give a thinner lens, and also distort the viewer's eyes less as seen by other people, producing better aesthetic appearance.|$|E
50|$|An {{eye that}} {{has too much}} or too little {{refractive}} power to focus light onto the retina has a refractive error. A myopic eye has too much power so light is focused in front of the retina. Conversely, a hyperopic eye has too little power so when the eye is relaxed, light is focused behind the retina. An eye with a refractive power in one meridian that is different from the refractive power of the other meridians has astigmatism. <b>Anisometropia</b> is the condition in which one eye has a different refractive power than the other eye.|$|E
50|$|Amblyopia (aka lazy eye) {{occurs when}} the vision of one eye is {{significantly}} {{better than the other}} eye, and the brain begins to rely on the better eye and ignore the weaker one. Amblyopia affects 4% of the population and is clinically diagnosed when the refractive error of one eye is more than 1.5 diopters different from the other eye (<b>anisometropia)</b> or one of the eye is misaligned {{for a long period of}} time (Strabismus). The management of amblyopia involves correcting of significant refractive errors and using techniques that encourage the brain to pay attention to the weaker eye such as patching the stronger eye(occlusion therapy).|$|E

50|$|The cover-uncover {{test can}} also be used for more {{problematic}} disorders of binocular vision, the tropias. In the cover part of the test, the examiner looks at the first eye as he or she covers the second. If the eye moves from out to in, the person has exotropia. If it moved from in to out, the person has esotropia. People with exotropia or esotropia are wall-eyed or cross-eyed respectively. These are forms of strabismus that can be accompanied by amblyopia. There are numerous definitions of amblyopia. A definition that incorporates all of these defines amblyopia as a unilateral condition in which vision in worse than 20/20 {{in the absence of any}} obvious structural or pathologic anomalies, but with one or more of the following conditions occurring before the age of six: amblyogenic <b>anisometropia,</b> constant unilateral esotropia or exotropia, amblyogenic bilateral isometropia, amblyogenic unilateral or bilateral astigmatism, image degradation. When the covered eye is the non-amblyopic eye, the amblyopic eye suddenly becomes the person's only means of seeing. The strabismus is revealed by the movement of that eye to fixate on the examiner's finger. There are also vertical tropias (hypertropia and hypotropia) and cyclotropias.|$|E
