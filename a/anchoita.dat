50|$|The Argentine <b>anchoita</b> or Argentine anchovy, Engraulis <b>anchoita,</b> is an anchovy of {{the genus}} Engraulis, found in and around waters of Argentina, Uruguay, and {{southern}} Brazil.|$|E
50|$|Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> {{is a key}} {{species in}} the pelagic {{ecosystem}} of the Argentine waters. They are zooplanktivores, and prey especially upon copepods, but also their own eggs. Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> themselves are prey to other species, and constitute a main diet component of important commercial species such as hake, squid and mackerel.|$|E
50|$|Annual {{catches of}} Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> in 2000-2009 varied between 12 and 44 {{thousand}} tonnes, mainly taken by Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The diet of {{this species}} {{consists}} of small benthic fish, crustaceans, polychaetes, gastropods and octopuses. They primarily feed on fish, especially Argentine <b>anchoita,.</b> Mean diving depth is almost 25 m,. Most feeding takes place in inshore regions, but at least some populations will travel {{some distance from the}} shore to fish.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} assessment between {{the use of}} the Argentine <b>anchoita</b> (Engraulis <b>anchoita)</b> for reduction fisheries and human food and/or value-added products is the focus of this case study. General biological aspects, spatial and seasonal distribution and available biomass estimates of the target species are examined. Currently applied and promising potential methods of processing <b>anchoita</b> in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay are described and compared in terms of economic and nutritional impact. Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> is a small pelagic fish that occurs in the South West Atlantic Ocean (SWAO) with Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina sharing the so-called <b>anchoita</b> "Bonaerense" stock. Annual abundance estimates vary between 600 000 tonnes and 4. 5 million tonnes, with significant regional and yearly variations in biomass estimates along the shelves of the three countries. Fishing takes place predominantly between July and November. Catches in 2006 were reported to be around 30 000 tonnes in Argentina and 17 000 tonnes in Uruguay. It is estimated that up to 135 000 tonnes of <b>anchoita</b> could be sustainably exploited along the southern Brazilian coast. However, despite its abundance, this species is not fished there. The three countries exhibit different approaches to the utilization of E. <b>anchoita.</b> Argentina is the pioneer in the exploitation and manufacture of <b>anchoita</b> and the main manufacturer of different kinds of products for human consumption directed to both the domestic and export markets. More than 80 percent of this production is salted fish and the remainder is prepared as value-added food. In 2005, Argentine exported anchoitabased products at a value of US$ 26 million. At present, Uruguay processes its <b>anchoita</b> catch exclusively as fishmeal for export, although the preparation of products for human consumption is planned for the near future. Due to its unexploited fishery resources as well as considerable demand, Brazil has great potential for manufacturing new products that could contribute to both the domestic and export markets. Trial products have been developed that could address food security and poverty alleviation in the region and elsewhere. Alternative potential uses for new products from <b>anchoita</b> were assessed on the basis of prototypes developed in Brazil. It is concluded that novel products such as dehydrated risotto, soup and sausage have considerable strategic marketing value. An assessment of {{the costs and benefits of}} the production of fishmeal and new products for human consumption in Brazil revealed that the transformation of <b>anchoita</b> for human consumption results in significantly higher direct positive impacts on poverty and food security. Governmental social programmes supporting school meals and hospital diets are a promising entry point for the introduction of novel products to nutritionally challenged parts of society. The search for common solutions for improved utilization of <b>anchoita</b> should evolve from a strong technical-scientific interaction and mutual collaboration among the governments of the three countries.

40|$|Abstract The {{increasing}} {{world population}} presses the productive sector for {{a supply of}} food increasingly more expressive. For this reason, the search for innovative nutritional alternatives becomes crucial to ensure food security for mankind. This way, <b>anchoita</b> (Engraulis <b>anchoita),</b> a pelagic with nutritional technological characteristics similar to sardine (Sardinella brasiliensis) appears, with a potential to be an alternative food to consumer market, relieving the relentless search for sardine. Therefore, this work performed a comparative study between the two species as a raw material, considering physical and chemical evaluations and microbiological and freshness of the fish, {{in addition to a}} control in the process of seaming. As a result, it was observed that the fish in natura was transformed into a food with all its own characteristics, through the employment of quality control for the canning process, ensuring a product with good acceptability to consumers by means of sensory analysis, which revealed an acceptance of 86. 44 % for canned <b>anchoita</b> with no significant difference (p < 0. 05) between this product and one o...|$|E
40|$|The diet of the South American Tern (Sterna hirundinacea) and its {{seasonal}} variation during the 2005 and 2006 non-reproductive {{seasons in the}} Uruguayan Atlantic coast was analyzed. Diet was assessed by the analysis of pellets collected in the Rocha lagoon sandbar, a major tern roosting area in Uruguay, aiming to analyze the hypothesis that terns feed mainly on the Argentine Anchovy (Engraulis <b>anchoita)</b> during the wintering period. A total of 844 pellets were collected, 442 in 2005 and 402 in 2006. Diet was composed of fish (88 %), insects (9 %) and crustaceans (3 %). The main fish species consumed was the Argentine Anchovy (77. 7 %), followed by Marini's Anchovy (Anchoa marinii) (7. 9 %) and the Striped Weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa) (3. 6 %). Insects and crustaceans were the main items {{in two of the}} groups of pellets collected during the study period. Despite this temporal variation in the diet, the Argentine Anchovy was the main prey item consumed during both seasons. These results support the hypothesis that South American Terns strongly depend on anchovies as trophic resource. En este trabajo se analizó la dieta del Gaviotín Sudamericano (Sterna hirundinacea) y su variación estacional durante las temporadas no reproductivas de 2005 y 2006 en la costa atlántica uruguaya. La dieta fue estudiada por medio del análisis de bolos colectados en la barra de la laguna de Rocha, una importante zona de descanso para la especie en Uruguay, con el propósito de analizar la hipótesis de que el gaviotín se alimenta principalmente de <b>Anchoíta</b> Argentina (Engraulis <b>anchoita)</b> durante el período de invernada. Un total de 844 bolos fueron colectados, 442 en 2005 y 402 en 2006. La dieta estuvo compuesta por peces (88 %), insectos (9 %) y crustáceos (3 %). La principal presa consumida fue la <b>Anchoíta</b> Argentina (77. 7 %), seguida de la Anchoa (Anchoa marinii) (7. 9 %) y la Pescadilla de Red (Cynoscion guatucupa) (3. 6 %). Los insectos y los crustáceos fueron el ítem principal en dos de las muestras (grupos de bolos) colectadas durante el período de estudio.

The summer 2011 distribution (vertical and spatial) of Oikopleura dioica was studied in terms of abundance, biomass, estimation of egg production and population structure in the different sectors of the El Rincón coastal front, {{in the light of}} thermal and salinity gradients. Peaks of abundance of Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> larvae were compared to O. dioica patterns. Samples were collected with plankton nets of 67 µm and 200 µm at two layers, below and above the thermocline depth. CTD data profiles were also recorded. During this campaign high salinity waters were predominant in the estuarine area. Conversely, a thermal stratification was found, being more marked at the external stations of the front where the highest densities and biomass of O. dioica coincided with the highest E. <b>anchoita</b> larvae densities. The size structure of O. dioica was also associated with the thermal gradient. The smaller sizes were found in the homogeneous area at the coast where the temperature was higher around 22 ºC.

40|$|The first {{studies on}} the {{problems}} related to the reproduction of marine fish in Argentina (SW Atlantic ocean) {{have been carried out}} with a species of great economic importance, the anchovy (Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> Hubbs and Marini). The spawning period of this species during the period 1963 - 64 has been determined. By the application of the quantitative collection method, it has been established that spawning commenced in the areas close to the coast during {{the first few days of}} September and at a water temperature of 10, 3 ° C and reached its greatest intensity in October (up 1569 eggs/ 1 square metre surface water) at a temperature varying between 11, 5 - 13, 8 ° C. From the middle of November the anchovy continues to reproduce in a less intensive form and further out to Sea, up to at least the month of May. The intensity of reproduction reaches a peek in February, and at a water temperature of 20 ° C. It is believed that two physiologically distinct populations of Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> may exist, the first reproducing in Spring and the second in Autumn. It has been established that a daily spawning rhythm occurs, between the hours of 8 and 12 p. m. During this period it was possible to obtain mature females with which artificial fertilization was performed. The rate of development was determined, which at a temperature of 14 - 15 ° C is from 69 - 72 hours, and at a temperature of 19 - 20 ° C from 50 - 53 hours. A temperature of 49 ° C was found be lethal. The different embryonic and larval stages of development are illustrated diagramatically and individually described. The preliminary {{studies on the}} larvae and juveniles caught in the Sea during the period of reproduction led to the formulation of certain conclusions whith reference that the juveniles, as yet larvae, begin to group together at an early age, and the younger individuals the more uniform are the schoals whith regards to the total size of the specimens. It has shown that the anchovy during its first year of life tends to display littoral behaviour. RESUMEN EN ESPAÑOL: Los primeros estudios de los problemas referentes a la reproducción de los peces marinos en la Argentina (océano Atlántico sudoccidental) se han efectuado sobre una especie de gran importancia económica, Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> Hubbs y Marini. Se ha determinado la época de desove de la <b>anchoíta</b> en un período anual 1963 - 64. Aplicando el método de recolección cuantitativo se ha establecido que el desove de esta especie ha empezado en las zonas muy cercanas a la costa, en los primeros días de setiembre a la temperatura 10, 3 ° C y ha alcanzado mayor intensidad en octubre (hasta 1569 huevos en 1 m 2 de la superficie del agua) a la temperatura 11, 5 °- 13, 8 ° C. Desde mediados de noviembre la <b>anchoíta</b> sigue reproduciéndose en forma poco intensiva y más mar afuera, hasta por lo menos el mes de mayo. La intensidad de reproducción para este segundo período alcanza un pico, aunque muy pequeño en febrero a la temperatura 20 ° C. Se hace la suposición de que pueden existir dos de distintas características fisiológicas poblaciones de Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> una de reproducción primaveral y otra de reproducción otoñal. Además se ha establecido que existe un ritmo diario de desove que comprende las horas 20 - 24. En las horas de postura se pudo conseguir hembras maduras y con sus productos sexuales se efectuó la fecundación artificial. Se determinó la velocidad de desarrollo que a la temperatura 14 °- 15 ° C es de 69 - 72 horas y en la temperatura 19 °- 20 ° C es de 50 - 53 horas. La temperatura 4 ° resultó ser letal. Se realizaron dibujos y descripciones correspondientes a los distintos estadios embrionarios y larvales. Los estudios preliminares de las larvas y juveniles de la <b>anchoíta,</b> capturados en el mar en la época de reproducción, permitieron sacar ciertas conclusiones sobre el crecimiento en sus primeros meses de vida. Se observó que los juveniles, larvas todavía, empiezan a agruparse muy temprano y cuanto más jóvenes son los individuos, tanto más uniformes son los cardúmenes en las dimensiones de los ejemplares. Se demostró que la <b>anchoíta</b> en su primer año de vida tiene costumbres muy costeras...|$|E
40|$|Distribution of {{anchovies}} (Clupeiformes, Engraulidae) {{was described in}} the Sepetiba Bay, a coastal area of Southeastern Brazil, to assess eventual mechanisms of habitat selection. Two fish sampling programmes were accomplished; one using beach seine (1998 / 2000) to catch juveniles in sandy beaches, and the other, using seines (1999 / 2000) to catch adults in deeper bay areas. Six species representing 4 genera were recorded: Anchoa tricolor, Anchoa januaria, Anchoa lyolepis, Cetengraulis edentulus, Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> and Lycengraulis grossidens. Anchoa tricolor and A. januaria were the most abundant species, with the former peaking in the outer bay, while the latter peaking in the inner bay. Adults A. tricolor are target of heavy commercial fisheries in the bay during Spring-Summer, while E. <b>anchoita,</b> an abundant species in the continental shelf, was occasionally caught in large numbers during the Autumn.

40|$|The Argentine anchovy (Engraulis <b>anchoita)</b> is an {{essential}} species in the pelagic ecosystem of the southwest Atlantic Ocean, and a potentially important fishery resource.

The results indicate the existence of different populations in the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil: the bonaerense stock in southern Brazil is shared with Argentina and Uruguay and exhibits migratory behavior, while in the southeast there is a population confined to this region and shows different population characteristics.

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} ocean {{model and}} hydrographic observations {{are used to}} characterize the shelf circulation of the northern Argentinean shelf {{during the study period}} (1993 – 2008) and ultimately to explore possible linkages among atmospheric, oceanic, and biological climatic variability. Abundance of larvae and eggs of the local anchovy species, Engraulis <b>anchoita,</b> exhibit a spatial and temporal variability similar to those stocks found {{in other parts of the}} world and that we interpret in the context of the particularities of the local circulation and hydrography. Two (statistically) coupled modes of wind stress-surface velocity are described and interpreted in terms of historical and new information. A complex picture emerges in which the intensity of both a thermal shelf front, the alongshore flow, and larvae abundance would be connected and forced by local wind stresses. For all areas examined on the shelf, the larvae/egg abundance would not be very sensitive to short-lived climatic fluctuations (e. g., year-to-year) but they would be indeed to regime shifts. The shallow shelf area bounded by the 39 °S and 41 °S parallels would expose a clearer linkage between physical and biological variables than that north of 39 °S. We attribute this fact to the particular physical conditions found in the southernmost area, which would favor an increased habitat quality for Engraulis <b>anchoita...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Studies of ichthyoplankton {{retention}} by nets {{of different}} mesh sizes {{are important because}} they help in choosing a sampler when planning collection {{and the establishment of}} correction factors. These factors make it possible to compare studies performed with nets of different mesh sizes. In most studies of mesh retention of fish eggs, the taxonomic identification is done at the family level, resulting in the loss of detailed information. We separated Engraulidae eggs, obtained with 0. 333 mm and 0. 505 mm mesh bongo nets at 172 oceanographic stations in the southeastern Brazilian Bight, into four groups based on their morphometric characteristics. The difference in the abundance of eggs caught by the two nets was not significant for those groups with highest volume, types A and B, but in type C (Engraulis <b>anchoita),</b> the most eccentric, and in type D, of the smallest volume, the difference was significant. However, no significant difference was observed in the egg size sampled with each net for E. <b>anchoita</b> and type D, which exhibited higher abundance in the 0. 333 mm mesh net and minor axis varying from 0. 45 - 0. 71 mm, smaller than the 0. 505 mm mesh aperture and the mesh diagonal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Recruitment of {{pelagic fish}} {{is the result}} of a group of {{processes}} that affect their entire life cycle. Most of the variability in pelagic fish natural mortality is thought to occur during the early life stages of development, and to be related to environmental factors. The central Southwestern Atlantic Continental Shelf is one of the most productive fishing sites in the western South Atlantic, but the processes involving the circulation in this area and its influence on eggs and larvae transport and retention are still poorly understood. The use of coupled physical-biological models to investigate fish early life history is relatively common. This work presents results of such a model applied to <b>anchoita</b> (Engraulis <b>anchoita).</b> The model is alternatively coupled to two surface velocity fields: the Ekman surface velocities computed from wind stress data, and the output of a three dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model. It is used to compute larval retention over the shelf. The results show that taking into account only Ekman velocities does not explain the seasonal and spatial spawning patterns observed in the region. Retention values with the experiments forced with output of the hydrodynamical model better match the observations. Our results suggest that the density driven circulation, induced by freshwater discharges of the Patos Lagoon and the la Plata River, and intrusions produced by the variability of the boundary currents (Brazil and Malvinas Currents) are efficient mechanisms of larval retention, especiall...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the acceptance of breaded fish (Engraulis <b>anchoita)</b> by public school students aged 5 – 18 (n= 830) from two cities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. First, by using multivariate analyses, the authors sought to assess the effect of the variables sex, city, and age on the acceptance of breaded fish. The second objective was to develop a predictive model that was applicable to different levels of acceptance. The results showed that the significant variable for the acceptance of breaded fish was age. According to the linear model and the descriptive statistics, an inverse relationship exists between the acceptance of breaded fish in school meals and the age of the children, possibly a consequence of the children being more critical in their food preference with the rising age, making the insertion of a new food that is not part of their eating behaviour more difficult...|$|E
30|$|In this study, the {{identification}} and characterization of Lactobacillus previously isolated from fresh anchovies (Engraulis <b>anchoita)</b> are investigated. 16 S rDNA partial sequencing assigned all the isolates {{to belong to the}} Lactobacillus sakei/curvatus group. Fourteen out of 15 isolates were identified as L. sakei by phenotypic traits: they exhibited catalase activity and fermented melibiose, although only 10 of them hydrolyzed arginine. These results were confirmed by multiplex PCR-based restriction enzyme analysis with Hin dIII and by restriction fragment length polymorphic (RFLP) analysis of the 16 S- 23 S rDNA intergenic spacer region with Taq I. Among identified isolates, four L. sakei strains and the sole L. curvatus strain showing sensitivity to chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline and exhibiting high tolerance to NaCl (10 - 18 %) were unable to produce neither dextran nor biogenic amines. Based on technological and safety features, L. sakei SACB 704 and L. curvatus SACB 03 a naturally present in fresh anchovies may be promising strains {{for the development of a}} starter culture to accelerate and control the fermentation of salt fermented anchovy-based products.|$|E
30|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{described}} the natural and variable occurrence of LAB in fish (Ringø and Gatesoupe 1998;Ringø et al. 2002;Bucio et al. 2006;Michel et al. 2007), {{there are only a}} few studies reporting the presence of LAB in anchovies (Engraulis <b>anchoita).</b> Pediococcus halophilus (now classified as Tetragenococcus halophilus) has been described as the main species in salted anchovy by Villar et al. (1985) while more recently Najjari et al. (2008) reported the isolation of L. sakei from raw, salted and conserved in oils anchovies. In a previous study Leuc. mesenteroides and Leuc. carnosum were identified as part of LAB microbiota from fresh anchovies (Belfiore et al. 2010). Here, most of the identified lactobacilli were assigned to L. sakei species in coincidence with Najjari et al. (2008). Among Lactobacillus identified strains, a high ability to survive in saline environment must be highlighted for L. sakei SACB 704 and L. curvatus SACB 03 a. Since salt is often used as a hurdle to preserve fish and fish products, the high salt tolerance and the lack of negative safety traits exhibited by these strains may represent an advantage to be used as functional culture in salted anchovy-based products.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the acceptance of fermented anchovy (Engraulis <b>anchoita)</b> by consumers aged 18 – 67 (n= 100) from two experiments, first using preference test and then by acceptance of formulation preference. Anchovy fillets were fermented with added NaCl and glucose with 4 different treatments: A (NaCl 1 % and glucose 4 %), B (NaCl 1 % and glucose 6 %), C (NaCl 1. 5 % and glucose 4 %), and D (NaCl 1. 5 % and glucose 6 % glucose). At first, the preference of fermented anchovy fillets with samples prepared in the form of pizza was assessed by applying a preference ranking test to 75 consumers. The results indicated the sample with 1 % NaCl and 6 % glucose as the preferred (P> 0. 05). Later in the second stage, the preferred fermented fillet was subjected to acceptance by 100 consumers who have the consumption habit of such product by using a hedonic scale of 9 points. The results indicated an acceptance rate of 79. 8 %. This work aimed to call attention to the importance of the acceptance of this food...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the {{spatial distribution of}} the abundance, biomass and size of zooplankton (nauplii, calanoids, cyclopoids and appendicularians) {{in relation to the}} distribution of first-feeding larvae and eggs of Engraulis <b>anchoita</b> across the frontal system of Peninsula Valdés. Twelve samples of zooplankton and ichthyoplankton were taken with small Bongo (67 μm) and Pairovet (200 μm) nets during the spring of 2004 along two transects. The total abundance of zooplankton and the chlorophyll a concentration were higher in homogeneous waters, while total biomasses were higher in stratified waters. Temperature was negatively correlated with biological variables and was the main factor affecting the zooplankton distribution. In both transects, abundance peaks of first-feeding larvae were detected at coastal stations along with the smallest fraction of zooplankton (< 500 μm), while the largest fraction was dominant at the external stations, coinciding with the highest egg abundance. The physical structure of this front generates different levels of food availability for first-feeding larvae. Calanoids (southern transect) and cyclopoids (northern transect) are predominant followed by nauplii and appendicularians. The biomass of zooplankton preys contributes to the carbon transfer to the upper trophic levels and is probably important for the survival and growth of anchovy larvae in this frontal system...|$|E
40|$|Anchovy larvae (Engraulis <b>anchoita)</b> were sampled {{from an area}} of {{upwelling}} in the subtropical waters {{over the}} Brazilian shelf and from an area over the Argentinian shelf characterized by a tidal mixing front. They were analysed for their nutritional condition by measuring RNA/DNA ratios. The degree of starvation occurring in the two geographic areas was correlated to length distribution, developmental stage and position in the water column. It was shown that starving larvae (5 to 80 %) were mainly found in the smaller length classes (4 to 10 mm SL), but some larvae between 16 to 20 mm SL were also determined as starving (4 to 6 %). Larvae found in the stratified water column had higher RNA/DNA ratios reflecting a better nutritional condition than in the mixed water body. The degree of starvation at the same developmental stage was higher in Brazil than in the Argentinian area. RNA/DNA ratios of larvae from the Argentinian area showed a significant shift to higher values (indicating a better condition) than in Brazil. Results on the nutritional condition of the larvae based on RNA/DNA ratios were compared with zooplankton data and larval gut analyses determined on the same cruise. Speculations on the survival strategies of these two anchovy populations are give...|$|E
