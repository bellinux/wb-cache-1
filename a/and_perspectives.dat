5|$|The novel—Grossman's first—was written {{during his}} tenure as a video game designer. The book uses characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} associated with comic books and superhero fiction, but is written entirely in prose. The story explores how superheroes cope with their powers and interact with one another. The potential motivations <b>and</b> <b>perspectives</b> of supervillains are also examined. Grossman's book has been variously described as clever, engaging, and fun—but overstuffed with comic book tropes. An audiobook was released along with the hardcover edition, while a movie has been in development since 2008.|$|E
5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles <b>and</b> <b>perspectives</b> the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe role of disparity–perspective cue {{conflict}} in depth contrast was examined. A central square and a surrounding frame {{were observed in}} a stereoscope. Five conditions were compared: (1) only disparity was introduced into either the centre or surround stimulus, (2) only perspective was introduced into the centre or surround, (3) concordant <b>perspective</b> <b>and</b> disparity were introduced into the centre or surround, (4) disparity was introduced into one stimulus <b>and</b> <b>perspective</b> into the other, and (5) only the centre stimulus was presented with horizontal shear disparity <b>and</b> <b>perspective</b> manipulated independently. The results show that individual differences in depth contrast were related to individual differences in the weighting of disparity <b>and</b> <b>perspective</b> in the single-stimulus conditions. We conclude that conflict between disparity <b>and</b> <b>perspective</b> contributes to depth contrast. However, significant depth contrast occurred {{when there was no}} disparity–perspective cue conflict, indicating that this cue conflict is not the sole mechanism producing depth contrast...|$|R
