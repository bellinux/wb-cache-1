5|$|As the {{hurricane}} neared the Florida Keys on September25, its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery. The reorganization {{led to an}} increase in intensity, and at about 1530UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast. The slow motion of the storm led to an erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated <b>at</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 35mph (55km/h), restricting outflow within {{the hurricane}} and confining the most intense convection to {{the eastern side of the}} circulation.|$|E

It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would {{not be required to}} support YCBCR output.|$|E
5|$|Half {{the area}} of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been {{reclaimed}} in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The Environment Agency's management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness {{in the face of a}} potential sea level rise of 1.1m (3ft) by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards <b>at</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 3.5m (10ft) per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Vakhmistrov devised Zveno-SPB (SPB: Sostavnoi Pikiruyuschiy Bombardirovschik, Combined Dive Bomber) which {{consisted}} of a Tupolev TB-3-4AM-34FRN mothership and two Polikarpov I-16 Type 5 fighters. Each of the fighters was armed {{with a pair of}} 250kg (550lb) FAB-250 high-explosive bombs. Although an I-16 Type 5 could get airborne on its own with no more than 100kg (220lb) of bombs, once hoisted in the air by the TB-3 it could reach 410km/h (220 knots, 255mph) at 2500 m (8,200ft), had a service ceiling of 6800 m (22,310ft), and could dive <b>at</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 650km/h (350 knots, 405mph). Once the bombs were dropped, the SPB-launched I-16s performed like conventional Type 5s. The three-aircraft Zveno-SPB had a total takeoff weight of 22000kg (48,500lb), a top speed of 268km/h (145 knots, 165mph), and a range of 2500km (1,350 NM, 1,550mi). The use of a mothership increased the range of the I-16s by 80%.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1536 {{there was a great}} muster, {{reckoned}} <b>at</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40,000 in number, at Horncastle in Lincolnshire. The nervous gentry managed, with difficulty, to disperse these masses—who had tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with the king by petition. The Pilgrimage of Grace was a more serious matter. Revolt spread through Yorkshire, and the rebels gathered at York. Robert Aske, their leader, negotiated the restoration of sixteen of the twenty-six northern monasteries, which had actually been dissolved. However, the promises made to them by the Duke of Suffolk were ignored on the king's orders. Suffolk was instructed to put the rebellion down. Forty-seven of the Lincolnshire rebels were executed, and 132 from the northern pilgrimage. Further rebellions took place in Cornwall in early 1537, and in Walsingham (in Norfolk). These received similar treatment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar {{became the first}} {{generation}} of wide-body passenger airliners to enter service. In 1978, Boeing unveiled three new models: the twin-engine Boeing 757 to replace its 727, the twin-engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300, and a trijet 777 concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011. The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s' extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations. These regulations allowed twin-engine airliners to make ocean crossings <b>at</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> three hours' distance from emergency diversionary airports. Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners. The trijet 777 was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants. Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the 767-300ER and the 747-400.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, the 767 {{spearheaded the}} growth of twinjet flights across the {{northern}} Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines. Before the 767, overwater flight paths of twinjets could {{be no more than}} 90 minutes away from diversion airports. In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes <b>at</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> two hours' distance from land. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines. The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.|$|E
