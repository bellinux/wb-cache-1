5|$|After a {{prolonged}} power struggle, Khrushchev was finally ousted {{from his post}} as First Secretary in October 1964, charged with the failure of his reforms, his obsessive re-organizations of the Party <b>and</b> <b>Government</b> apparatus, his disregard for Party <b>and</b> <b>Government</b> institutions, and his one-man domineering leadership style. The Presidium (Politburo), the Central Committee and other important Party–Government bodies had grown tired of Khrushchev's repeated violations of established Party principles. The Soviet leadership also believed that his individualistic leadership style ran contrary to the ideal collective leadership. Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his posts as First Secretary and Premier respectively, and Mikhail Suslov, Andrei Kirilenko, and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny), were also given prominence in the new leadership. Together they formed a functional collective leadership.|$|E
