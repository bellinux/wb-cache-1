Alumina debris were few and appeared as yellow dots of 0. 5 µm in diameter. Usually pure fibrocytic reactions were described when the prosthesis has been loosened for many months or years resulting in massive foreign body reaction related to the amount of debris generated from metal, cement or ceramic. Cementless plain alumina socket was documented after natural death of the patient who had this prosthesis implanted for 12 years.

One of the perspective options to solve the above issue is the use of custom triflange acetabular components (CTAC) designed based on preoperative computer tomography given the specifics of bone defects of the patient. Purpose of the study — to evaluate the outcomes of CTAC use in revision hip replacement. Materials and methods. The authors analyzed treatment outcomes of 12 patients after revision hip replacement using additive techniques of computer simulation and 3 D printing CTAC. Follow up period after the surgery averaged 7 ± 3 months (from one to ten months). 7 out of 12 patients had acetabular defects of Paprosky 3 B type, 4 patients had defects of Paprosky 3 A and in one patient — of Paprosky 2 C.

25|$|Integrated tug barge {{systems are}} {{generally}} {{divided into three}} generations {{by the type of}} coupling. In the first generation systems the tug is connected to the barge by wires or chains. However, because the two vessels are subject to different motion responses due to their shape, displacement and position on a wave, such operation is only possible in calm sea conditions — in rough weather the tug has to disconnect from the barge and continue the journey by towing it in a traditional way. The second generation systems are designed with a deeper stern notch and improved coupling devices to allow operation in heavier seas while still permitting relative motion between the two vessels. The third generation systems such as the Finnpusku system, equipped with rigid or <b>articulated</b> mechanical <b>coupling,</b> allow operation in all sea states and even in ice conditions as the pusher-barge combination behaves hydrodynamically like a conventional ship. However, in some cases the specialized hull form of the pusher, designed to form a streamlined hull when coupled to the barge, might lead to problems with stability and seakeeping when the pusher is operated independently.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: The {{research}} aims {{to explore}} dyadic constructed illness experiences and identities in couples living with severe uncontrolled asthma (SUA) Methods: Following NHS ethical approval, three couples, where one partner {{was being treated}} for SUA, were recruited from an asthma clinic. Each couple {{took part in a}} dyadic semi-structured, face-to-face interview. Mean duration since disease onset was 34 years (range 24 - 49). Patients' mean age was 66 years (range 59 - 73). Data were analysed using discourse analysis. Expected results: Preliminary results show that couples' dyadically constructed identities are fluid identities that adapt to variable illness severity over the disease course. Couples' dyadically constructed 'coping scripts' emerged from the non-asthmatic partner's expectations for coping strategies. <b>Couples</b> <b>articulated</b> unresolved emotional burden from old illness-related memories around acceptance of condition or traumatic encounters with health services. They highlighted lack of professional psychological support in coping with the illness. Participants perceived unique relationship and rapport with specific physicians. Despite physical suffering and life constrains, couples reported a good quality of life that they actively constructed. Current stage of work: A further 7 - 10 couples are being recruited to explore the preliminary findings further. Discussion: Exploring co-constructed illness experiences of SUA with dyadic approach provides valuable data on the significant other's influences and the impact of illness on the couple as a unit. Joint dyadic interviewing is useful in exploring the co-construction of illness experience in discourse, potentially applicable to areas of chronic disease management and health behaviour change.
