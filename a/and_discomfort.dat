5|$|During {{his days}} as the Agong, Sultan Iskandar was often seen in public {{carrying}} a pistol in his waistband, which drew considerable concern <b>and</b> <b>discomfort</b> from the Malaysian public due to his past record of criminal offences. He was also reputed to have led a flamboyant lifestyle, which also drew similar scepticism. He was also {{known to be a}} motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies. These documentaries drew criticisms from the Malaysian public, who felt that the television clips of Sultan Iskandar were inappropriate for its theme and national image.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the Artillery uniforms were a variety of {{handmade}} and personally customized uniforms. By 1862, the Confederate uniforms became organized. They became cadet gray and were to be lined {{with a layer of}} red around the sleeve. The pant legs were light blue. Even after the uniforms were organized many of the artillerymen wore regular clothes due to the heat <b>and</b> <b>discomfort</b> caused by the regular uniforms.|$|E

5|$|During World War I {{the track}} and rolling stock {{received}} little maintenance, {{and by the end}} of the war they were in a piteous state, while expenses had increased dramatically. The problem became a crisis after the serious fire at the Trianon depot on 30 November 1921, which destroyed 70 of the 155 trams of the CTR. Successive fare rises provided a stopgap, but with the new convention of 29 December 1923 the company announced a reorganisation of the network. A competitor had also arrived: the bus. Trams had always attracted criticism over their limited capacity, slowness <b>and</b> <b>discomfort,</b> and their encumbrance to motor cars in the city centre. Another accident on the Monumental line on 5 October 1925 hastened the inevitable: the trams lost their first route.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2014–15 season, Durant was {{diagnosed}} with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks. He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors, returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points. He then sprained his left big toe in late January. On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain <b>and</b> <b>discomfort</b> in his surgically repaired right foot, and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery. In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.|$|E

She helps with the other Trill to transplant Odan into the new host, and both Riker and Odan fully recover. When Odan attempts to continue their relationship, Dr. Crusher is uncomfortable, knowing both that the Trill appear to have no preferences on gender orientation, and that Odan will continue to live on {{in any number of}} hosts' bodies. Odan admits he still loves Dr. Crusher, but understands her confusion <b>and</b> <b>discomfort,</b> and promises to never forget her or their short time together. And Dr. Crusher replies that she loves Odan too; in Odan's new, female host body, Odan then kisses the inner wrist of her hand.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert {{the people in the}} vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes <b>and</b> <b>discomfort</b> in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas. He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{personality}} traits <b>and</b> psychological <b>discomfort,</b> eighteen months after bariatric sur-gery (vertical banded gastroplasty) in morbidly obese patients. Method: We used the Millon Clinical Multiax-ial Inventory-II (MCMI-II) for assessing personality traits in 100 morbidly obese patients. Results: Six basic factor dimensions {{in the mental}} state were obtained: (1) Personality traits <b>and</b> Psychological <b>Discomfort,</b> (2) Histrionic-Narcissistic-Antisocial, (3) Neurotic, (4) Paranoid, (5) Alcohol dependence, and (6) Dependent. Conclusions: Our results suggest that people with morbid obesity after bariatric surgery share characteristics of personality disturbances <b>and</b> psychological <b>discomfort,</b> <b>and</b> that subtypes of different personality dimensions are associated with wide groups of psychopathological symptoms (German J Psychiatry 2002; 5 (4) : 90 - 94) ...|$|R
