50|$|A Phase <b>Alternating</b> Line (PAL)-based <b>television</b> set display, for example, scans 50 fields {{every second}} (25 odd and 25 even). The {{two sets of}} 25 fields work {{together}} to create a full frame every 1/25 of a second (or 25 frames per second), but with interlacing create a new half frame every 1/50 of a second (or 50 fields per second). To display interlaced video on progressive scan displays, playback applies deinterlacing to the video signal (which adds input lag).|$|R
40|$|By using a {{deterministic}} approach, {{an exact}} {{form for the}} synchronous detected video signal under a ghosted condition is presented. Information regarding the phase quadrature-induced ghost component derived from the quadrature forming nature of the vestigial sideband (VSB) filter is obtained by crosscorrelating the detected video with the ghost cancel reference (GCR) signal. As a result, the minimum number of taps required to correctly remove all the ghost components is subsequently presented.

50|$|With the {{widespread}} adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts {{have been in}} decline; in 2013 {{it was estimated that}} about 7% of US households used an antenna. A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to digital terrestrial television broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an <b>alternate</b> to cable <b>television</b> (CATV) for cord cutters. All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.|$|R

50|$|The Screen Actors Guild, a union {{representing}} {{actors and}} actresses throughout Hollywood reports that the average television and film actor earns less than US$5000 annually; the median hourly wage for actors was $18.80 in May 2015. Actors sometimes <b>alternate</b> between theater, <b>television,</b> and film or even branch into other occupations within the entertainment industry such as becoming a singer, comedian, producer, or a television host {{in order to be}} monetarily diversified, as doing one gig pays comparatively very little. For instance, David Letterman is well known for branching into late night television as a talk show host while honing his skills as a stand-up comedian, Barbra Streisand ventured into acting while operating as a singer, or Clint Eastwood, who achieved even greater fame in Hollywood for being a film director and a producer than for his acting credentials.|$|R
40|$|IDENTIFIERS FCC, *Federal Communication Commission Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) is {{comprised}} of 31 television channels in the 2500 - 2690 MHz frequency range reserved by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) for use by educational institutions and organizations. This study delineates the history of instructional television with special reference to ITFS and provides {{a consideration of the}} relationships among various <b>alternate</b> methods of <b>television</b> distribution. Conclusions regarding {{the state of the art}} of ITFS are based on the author's survey of the present ITFS licensees and applicants, interviews with persons involved in various aspects of ITFS utilization, and personal visits to individual ITFS systems. Survey results are geographically depicted to indicate comparisons among systems in terms of size, staff, equipment, budget, and utilization. The study provides statistical profiles of the 65 ITFS systems on the air in April 1970 and a directory of persons responsible for individual systems. Appendixes include tables of frequency assignments, information on private users of the ITFS band, and FCC application procedures. The author concludes that the problems of ITFS stem more from the administrative and educational structure than from any deficiency in the bases engineering capabilities of ITFS. A series of suggestions to remedy these problems is listed. (Author/JY...|$|R

This study sought to determine if a relationship existed between the absence or presence of captioning during televised instruction and student performance. Approximately 140 suburban public school fifth graders (6 classrooms) were studied. Intact classrooms were assigned by lottery to one of three treatment conditions. The treatment groups watched a 24 -minute video on insects under three experimental conditions. Group 1 watched the video with audio, but without captions. Group 2 watched the video with audio and captions. Group 3 watched the video with captions, but without audio. After viewing, each subject was given a multiple-choice test covering 12 content vocabulary words and 12 factual recall questions from the video. Subjects were also surveyed on the number of hours they spent watching television daily. Posttests were administered both immediately after the treatment and after a 4 -week delay. Repeated two-way ANOVAs were conducted using the subjects' raw scores from the posttest and delayed posttest analyzed by the independent variables. Examined specifically was the interaction between the primary independent variable, method, and student characteristics (standardized achievement test scores, television viewing habits, and gender) on the dependent variables (content vocabulary and factual recall). If interaction was not present, then the main effect for method was examined. The level of significance was set at the alpha level of. 05 for rejecting any null hypothesis. The results of the study indicated that interaction was present between method and student achievement test scores on the dependent variable "factual recall. " Sound-off captioning was the best learning condition for students with the highest achievement test scores and the worst learning condition for students with the lowest achievement test scores. The strength of the relationship diminished slightly after the 4 -week delay and was only significant in the interaction of method and student composite scores. However, patterns similar to the immediate posttest were still present. No significant differences between any of the groups were found when sound-on captioning was employed, suggesting that sound-on captioning is a viable <b>alternate</b> to conventional <b>television</b> presentations. Television viewing habits and gender were not found to affect student success with captioning...|$|R
