In a 1985 interview with Spin magazine, Ike admitted, [...] "Yeah, I hit her, but I didn't hit her more than the <b>average</b> <b>guy</b> beats his wife.... If she says I abused her, maybe I did." [...] He worded this slightly differently in his memoirs, Taking Back My Name (1999), writing: [...] "Sure, I've slapped Tina.... There have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I have never beat her." ...|$|E

Like someone in a John Frankenheimer movie". Actor Luke Goss was cast in the role after episode writer Akiva Goldsman personally called his house and asked him to join the show. On June 24, 2009, TV Guide announced the casting of Meghan Markle as [...] "an attractive, brash and quick-witted junior agent".|$|E
500|$|Daft Punk {{have said}} that they donned their robot outfits to easily merge the {{characteristics}} of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later stated that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. [...] "But then it became exciting from the audience's point of view. It's the idea of being an <b>average</b> <b>guy</b> with some kind of superpower." [...] When asked whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated [...] "No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you." [...] With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of black leather jacket and pants and simplified versions of the Discovery headgear. The attire was designed by Hedi Slimane. Bangalter stated that, [...] "We never like {{to do the same thing}} twice. It's more fun and entertaining for us to do something different, whether it's wearing masks or developing a persona that merges fiction and reality. We're happy to give back to the masses".|$|E

From November 4, 2010 to November 28, 2010, the band was included on a US tour entitled <b>Average</b> <b>Guys</b> with Exceptional Hair Tour in support of A Skylit Drive, along with For All Those Sleeping, Scarlett O'Hara, and Motionless in White.

500|$|After {{scouting}} {{more than}} twelve possible locations to film scenes {{that would take}} place in Volterra, Italy, the scouting team selected the town of Montepulciano, which they believe was the best representation of Meyer's description in the book. Principal photography concluded with the scenes that were filmed in this area from May 25 through the 29. For the face-off between the Volturi and Edward, {{the idea was to}} have a bigger [...] "bang", rather than just the paralysis of Edward. Initially what was a huge battle with vampires being thrown everywhere turned into a one-on-one fight between Felix and Edward, after receiving a stamp of approval from Meyer. The idea quickly changed from the typical outlandish battle, to portraying Edward as an <b>average</b> <b>guy</b> {{caught in the middle of}} a bad situation; for Bella, conveying the feeling of being caught in the middle of a group of vampires fighting was important as well. This scene also required special effects, stunt work, and figuring out how to portray vampires fighting at very fast speeds.|$|E
500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an <b>average</b> <b>guy.</b> Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Stern spotted an {{advertisement}} in Radio & Records for a [...] "wild, fun morning guy" [...] at rock station WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut. He used some morning air time to assemble an aircheck with more outrageous bits, including Robert Klein and Cheech and Chong records with added flatulence routines and one-liners. Stern was hired {{for the same}} salary, but worked a more intense schedule. After four hours on the air, he voiced and produced commercials for another four.

He also completed duties as the station's public affairs director, and hosted a Sunday morning talk show which he favored above playing records as it [...] "represented what I wanted to do on radio more than anything.

In the summer of the 1979 energy crisis, Stern urged listeners to a two-day boycott of Shell Oil Company, a stunt which attracted media attention. It was at WCCC where Stern first met Fred Norris, the overnight disc jockey, {{who went on to}} become Stern's writer and producer since 1981. Stern left WCCC in early 1980 after he was denied a [...] "lousy, stinking twenty-five-dollar-a-week raise". At the same time, local rival station WHCN had assembled tapes and press clippings of Stern and forwarded them to Burkhart/Abrams, a radio consulting firm, {{in an effort to get}} Stern out of the Hartford market as a rise in his ratings increased his threat to the station's numbers.
