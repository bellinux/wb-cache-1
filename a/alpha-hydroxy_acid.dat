While enantiomers, i. e., mirror-image-like stereoisomers, contain the same atoms and functional groups, differences in the three-dimensional arrangement of those atoms or groups may result in different biological activities. Regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration require quantitative detection and characterization of individual enantiomers of chiral drugs and their metabolites because the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological properties of enantiomers may differ. Therefore, separation and detection of enantiomers are crucial to the understanding of their biological roles. Antibodies raised against chiral haptens have the potential of discriminating between enantiomers, which makes them one of only a few tailor-made types of chiral selectors. In this dissertation, antibodies were raised against D- and L-alpha-hydroxy acids, respectively. Both polyclonal antibodies from rabbits and monoclonal antibodies from murine hybridomas were produced that stereoselectively bind {{to a wide range of}} <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acids,</b> including both aromatic and aliphatic <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acids.</b> No detectable interaction was seen with the "opposite" enantiomer. Further studies confirmed that the hydroxyl/carboxyl/hydrogen triad about the stereogenic center is essential for antibody binding as no interaction was observed with structurally closely related compounds such as alpha-amino acids. Conversely, previously produced stereoselective anti-alpha-amino acid antibodies bound only to alpha-amino acids of the correct configuration and not to <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acids.</b> The remarkable stereoselectivity and class specificity of these antibodies enabled the development of fluorescence-based immunoassays for the simultaneous detection of D-phenylalanine, L-phenylalanine, D-phenyllactic acid, and L-phenyllactic acid using four antibodies, each of which was labeled with a unique fluorophore. Furthermore, the utility of an anti-alpha-hydroxy acid antibody for enantiomer separation in chiral immunoaffinity chromatography was demonstrated...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} the relationship between these hydroxy fatty acids in plaque and gingival tissues or the significance of these complex lipids in promoting inflammatory periodontal disease. The present study determined the percentages of ester-linked and amide-linked hydroxy fatty acids in complex lipids recovered from plaque and gingival tissue samples and the relationship between bacterial hydroxy fatty <b>acids</b> and <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> fatty <b>acids</b> in the lipid extracts. To evaluate a potential role for these hydroxy fatty acids in inflammatory periodontal disease, gingival tissue samples were examined for a relationship between prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and hydroxy fatty acids recovered in gingival lipid. This investigation demonstrated that <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> fatty <b>acids</b> are only ester linked in plaque lipids but are largely amide linked in gingival tissue lipids. Furthermore, the level of <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> fatty <b>acid</b> in gingival lipid is directly related to the level of the bacterial hydroxy fatty acid 3 -OH iso-branched C 17 : 0 (3 -OH iC 17 : 0) in the same lipid extract.

Finally, <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> fatty <b>acid</b> levels in gingival tissue lipids correlate directly with the recovery of PGE 2 in the same tissue samples.

40|$|The alpha-amino and <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acids</b> {{found in}} the Murchison {{carbonaceous}} chondrite are deuterium enriched.

However, the hydroxy acids found on Murchison are less deuterium enriched than the amino acids. With the objective of determining if the discrepancy in deuterium enrichment between the amino acids and the hydroxy acids found on Murchison is consistent with their formation in a Strecker synthesis, we have measured the deuterium content of alpha-amino and <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acids</b> produced in solutions of deuterated carbonyl compounds, KCN and NH 4 Cl, and also in mixtures of such solutions and Allende dust at 263 K and 295 K.

Five days of incubation with lovastatin had no measurable effect on the growth of the five gut anaerobes but significantly reduced CH 4 production and methanogen growth as measured by quantitative PCR (P < 0. 01). Quantitative PCR analyses indicated that compared with controls, <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acid</b> lovastatin significantly increased the expression of the genes mta and mcrA implicated in methanogenesis and significantly decreased the expression of the fno gene implicated in methanogenesis.

Insertion of benzyl and ethyl 2 -triorganylsilyl 2 -diazoacetates into activated C-H bonds adjacent to oxygen, such as in tetrahydrofuran, was possible using dirhodium(II) acetate, albeit in moderate yields (up to 50 % yield). When the chiral Davies catalyst was used, benzyl 2 -tetrahydro- 2 -furanyl- 2 -trimethylsilylacetate was obtained in 58 % ee. Ring expanded products were isolated from the reaction of benzyl Alpha-triorganylsilyl Alpha-diazoacetate with oxetane, attributed to a Stevens rearrangement. The dirhodium(II) -catalyzed reaction of Alpha-triorganylsilyl Alpha-diazoacetates proceeded well with various acyclic and cyclic ketones, affording dioxolanones in up to 98 % yield. The effect {{of the structure of}} the diazo compound on the formation of the dioxolanones was investigated, and various novel silyl-substituted diazo precursors were synthesized for this purpose. A silylated enol ether competes with the formation of a dioxolanone, depending on the electronic and steric properties of the ester functionality. Two routes for the synthesis of Alpha-silyl-substituted <b>Alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acids</b> were envisioned, comprising dirhodium(II) -catalyzed oxygen transfer and dirhodium(II) -catalyzed O-H insertions. Reactions of Alpha-triorganylsilyl Alpha-diazo esters with propylene oxide afforded 2 -silyl- 2 -oxoacetates in up to 95 % yield. These were converted into their corresponding enantiomerically-pure hydroxy acids via reduction using NaBH 4, enantiomer separation by preparative HPLC, and palladium-catalyzed hydrogenolytic debenzylation. Alternatively, asymmetric reduction using (R) -Alpine Borane was effective in achieving 2 -silyl- 2 -oxyacetates in up to 91 % ee. Various alcohols were effectively inserted into Alpha-triorganylsilyl Alpha-diazo esters, generating 2 -silyl- 2 -oxyacetates in up to 97 % yield.

Biological systems are sensitive to the subtlest differences in the structure of chemicals they encounter, and discriminate between their isomeric forms at virtually all levels of interaction. As a consequence, structural isomers of exogenous compounds including stereoisomers can have extremely different effects on human health. The development of refined analytical techniques and selectors for the precise determination and purification of bioactive chiral and other structurally similar molecules is therefore of great interest. The research group of Drs. Oliver and Heike Hofstetter at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois has previously raised antibodies that stereoselectively bind to a-amino acids and a-hydroxy acids, respectively. These antibodies have been used for enantiomer detection and separation in immunoassays, sensors, and chromatographic techniques. In this work, several random and site-specific protein immobilization strategies were employed to immobilize a monoclonal anti-L-amino acid antibody onto a silica support material. The resulting chiral stationary phases (CSPs) were comparatively evaluated using frontal affinity chromatography. Furthermore, enantiomer separation of free <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acids</b> was achieved using a monoclonal anti-D-hydroxy acid antibody immobilized onto a synthetic high flow-through chromatographic support.

In MSUD, elevation of the branched-chain amino acids, such as alpha-keto acid and <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acid,</b> occurs due to the BCKDC gene deficiency, appearing in the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, which leads to neurological damage and mental retardation. MSUD phenotypically penetrates due to the mutations in the coding genes of four subunits of the BCKD complex, including the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, DBT, and DLD genes. Case report: We aimed to report the cases of three families whose children were affected by MSUD and presented with symptomatic features {{during the first week}} of birth, which were identified by mass spectrometry.

40|$|Alpha-hydroxylic acids {{are widely}} used in the {{treatment}} and control of skin disorders. Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acid</b> that can be formed endogenously from long-chain dicardoxylic acids, metabolism of oleic acid or omega oxidation of mono carboxylic acids. It shows bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms present on acne-bearing skins. The beneficial effects of Azelaic acid have been lead to different pharmaceutical formulations such as creams, gels, etc. HPLC and GC techniques are mostly used for the determination of Azelaic acid in plasma. These techniques are very accurate but, they are expensive and time consuming {{due to the lack}} of chromophore and consequently the necessity of pre-column sample preparation. For the determination of Azelaic acid in pharmaceutical dosage forms, a simple method with suitable accuracy and precision is needed. In this research, non-aqueous titration was used for the determination of Azelaic acid. For this purpose, Azelaic acid was titrated by sodium methoxide in the presence of thymol blue. The results of method validation by considering various parameters showed the accuracy of the suggested method in the determination of Azelaic acid in pharmaceutical formulations.

40|$|Ten new cyclic hexadepsipeptides, six isariins {{and four}} isaridins, from the fungus Isaria have been {{identified}} and characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled to tandem electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESIMS/MS). The isariins possess a beta-hydroxy acid residue and five alpha-amino acids, while isaridins contain a beta-amino acid, an <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acid,</b> and four alpha-amino acids. One- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy confirmed the chemical identity {{of some of the}} isariin fractions. Mass spectral fragmentation patterns of [M + H](+) ions reveal clear diagnostic fragment ions for the isariins and isaridins. Previously described cyclic depsipeptides, isarfelins from Isaria felina (Guo, Y. X.; Liu, Q. H.; Ng, T. B.; Wang H. X. Peptides 2005, 26, 2384), are now reassigned as members of the isaridin family. Examination of isaridin sequences revealed significant similarities with cyclic hexadepsipeptides such as destruxins and roseotoxins. The structure of an isariin (isariin A) investigated by NMR spectroscopy indicated the presence of a hybrid alpha beta C- 11 turn, formed by the beta-hydroxy acid and glycine residues and a (D) Leu-(L) Ala type II' beta-turn. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of isariins and an isaridin on the intra-erythrocytic growth of Plasmodium falciparum is presented...|$|E
40|$|Carbon, hydrogen, and {{nitrogen}} isotopic analyses of various classes of organic compounds done {{in collaboration with}} Epstein and Krishnamurthy (Caltech) have shown these compounds to be enriched to varying degrees in the heavier isotopes. These results, in particular the large deuterium enrichments, have been interpreted as indicating an interstellar origin for the meteorite compounds or their precursors. Such isotopic fractionations, of hydrogen especially, are characteristic of low temperature ion-molecule reactions in cold interstellar clouds. There is also evidence from the large corresponding suites of alpha-amino and <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acids</b> found in meteorites suggesting that aqueous phase chemistry on the meteorite parent body {{played an important role}} in the formation of these compounds. These data support the hypothesis that interstellar compounds survived in the solar nebula at a radial distance corresponding to the asteroid belt, were incorporated into the parent body in icy, volatile-rich, planetesinals, and underwent further reactions during a period of aqueous activity within the early parent body to give the present suite of meteorite compounds. This formation hypothesis will be discussed and the results of recent isotopic and molecular analyses bearing on it will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Esters of alpha-oxo-carbonic acids such as ethyl {{pyruvate}} (EP) {{have been}} demonstrated to exert inhibitory effects on the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. So far, there is no information about effects, if any, of ethyl lactate (EL), an obviously inactive analogue of EP, on inflammatory immune responses. In the present study, we provide evidence that the anti-inflammatory action of alpha-oxo-carbonic acid esters is mediated by inhibition of glyoxalases (Glo), cytosolic enzymes that catalyse the conversion of alpha-oxo-aldehydes such as methylglyoxal (MGO) into the corresponding <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acids</b> using glutathione as a cofactor. In Vitro enzyme activity measurements revealed the inhibition of human Glo 1 by alpha-oxocarbonic acid esters, whilst alpha-hydroxy-carbonic acid esters such as EL were not inhibitory. in contrast, both EP and EL were shown to suppress the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha a, interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, IL- 6 and IL- 8 from human immunocompetent cells, and modulated {{the expression of the}} immune receptors HLA-DR, CD 14 and CD 91 on human monocytes. Here, we show a crossing link between glyoxalases and the immune system. The results described herein introduce glyoxalases as a possible target for therapeutic approaches of immune suppression...|$|R
40|$|The {{insertion}} of <b>alpha-hydroxy</b> <b>acids</b> into peptide chains provides a convenient means for investigating {{the effects of}} hydrogen bond deletion on polypeptide secondary structures. The crystal structures of three oligopeptides containing L-lactic acid (Lac) residue have been determined. Peptide 1, Boc-Val-Ala-Leu-Aib - Val-Lac-Leu-Aib-Val-Ala-Leu-OMe (Boc: tert-butyloxycarbonyl; Aib: alpha- aminoisobutyric acid; OMe: methyl ester), and peptide 2, Boc-Val-Ala-Leu-Aib - Val-Lac-Leu-Aib-Val-Leu-OMe, adopt completely helical conformations in the crystalline state with the Lac(6) residue comfortably accommodated {{in the center of}} a helix. The distance between the O atoms of Leu(3) CO group and the Lac(6) O (ester) in both the structures is 3. 1 - 3. 3 Å. The NMR and CD studies of peptide 1 and its all-amide analogue 4, Boc-Val-Ala-Leu-Aib - Val-Ala-Leu-Aib-Val-Ala-Leu-OMe, provide firm evidence for a continuous helical conformation in solution in both the cases. In a 14 -residue peptide 3, Boc-Val-Ala-Leu-Aib-Val-Ala-Leu-Val-Ala-Leu-Aib-Val-Lac-Leu-OMe, residues Val(1) -Leu(10) adopt a helical conformation. Aib(11) is the site of chiral reversal resulting in helix termination by formation of a Schellman motif. Residues 12 - 14 adopt nonhelical conformations. The loss of the hydrogen bond near the C-terminus appears to facilitate the chiral reversal at Aib(11) ...|$|R
