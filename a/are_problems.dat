5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E

25|$|With a {{definition}} of effective calculation came the first proofs that there <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> in mathematics that cannot be effectively decided. Church (1936a, 1936b) and Turing (1936), inspired by techniques used by Gödel (1931) to prove his incompleteness theorems, independently demonstrated that the Entscheidungsproblem is not effectively decidable. This result showed {{that there is no}} algorithmic procedure that can correctly decide whether arbitrary mathematical propositions are true or false.|$|E
25|$|If {{the impact}} of {{symptoms}} of osteoarthritis on {{quality of life is}} significant and more conservative management is ineffective, joint replacement surgery or resurfacing may be recommended.

Iran, as well, presents problems with nuclear proliferation. There is active conflict in Afghanistan. The Middle East in general continues to fester, although relations with India are improving. Policy towards Russia remains uncertain. China also presents a challenge. There are difficulties in other regions too.

25|$|Such {{magnetic}} fields may be advected inward from {{the interstellar medium}} or generated by a magnetic dynamo within the disk. Magnetic fields strengths at least of order 100 Gauss seem necessary for the magneto-centrifugal mechanism to launch powerful jets. There <b>are</b> <b>problems,</b> however, in carrying external magnetic flux inward towards the central star of the disk. High electric conductivity dictates that the magnetic field is frozen into the matter which is being accreted onto the central object with a slow velocity. However, the plasma is not a perfect electric conductor, so there is always some degree of dissipation. The magnetic field diffuses away faster than {{the rate at which}} it is being carried inward by accretion of matter.|$|E
25|$|Scientists have drilled {{only about}} 1.5km into the 6- to 7-kilometer-thick oceanic crust, so their {{understanding}} of oceanic crust comes largely from comparing ophiolite structure to seismic soundings of in situ oceanic crust. Oceanic crust has a layered velocity structure that implies a layered rock series similar to that listed above. In detail there <b>are</b> <b>problems,</b> with many ophiolites exhibiting thinner accumulations of igneous rock than are inferred for oceanic crust. Another problem relating oceanic crust and ophiolites is that the thick gabbro layer of ophiolites calls for large magma chambers beneath mid-ocean ridges. Seismic sounding of mid-ocean ridges has revealed only a few magma chambers beneath ridges, and these are quite thin. A few deep drill holes into oceanic crust have intercepted gabbro, {{but it is not}} layered like ophiolite gabbro.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{negative}} {{answer to the}} halting problem shows that there <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> that cannot be solved by a Turing machine, the Church–Turing thesis limits what {{can be accomplished by}} any machine that implements effective methods. However, not all machines conceivable to human imagination are subject to the Church–Turing thesis (e.g. oracle machines). It is an open question whether there can be actual deterministic physical processes that, in the long run, elude simulation by a Turing machine, and in particular whether any such hypothetical process could usefully be harnessed {{in the form of a}} calculating machine (a hypercomputer) that could solve the halting problem for a Turing machine amongst other things. It is also an open question whether any such unknown physical processes are involved in the working of the human brain, and whether humans can solve the halting problem (Copeland 2004, p.15).|$|E

25|$|Many {{dictionaries}} {{suggest that}} the word chocolate comes from the Nahuatl chocolatl, based on an evolution from -tl to -te, however, there <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> with this hypothesis. Firstly Coe argued that the word chocolatl {{does not appear in}} the Aztec cultural writings of the time. Similarly the word is not found in the work of Alonso de Molina, a lexicographer of the time, who wrote a book about the grammar of the Aztec language in 1555. It is also absent from Bernardino de Sahagún's encyclopedia and from the Huehuetlatolli ("The words of the ancients") a guide to moral conduct. In all these works the word cacahuatl (cocoa water) is used. In his periodic letters, Hernán Cortés refers to 'cocoa.' At an indeterminate time in the 16th century, the Spanish of New Spain began to use the word chocolatl.|$|E
25|$|The average water tariff {{reported}} in 2014 was KSh 60 or US$0.60 per m3. This figure {{is not very}} indicative because of significant regional variations and because in Kenya a progressive block tariff system is in place for household connections. This means {{that for the first}} 10 m3 a minimum charge is paid that corresponds to a low, highly subsidised tariff, while for the following blocks (up to 20, 50, 100 and 300 as well as above 300 m3) an increasingly higher tariff is being charged, with the tariff in the highest block being five times higher than in the lowest block. Where no meter is installed, a fixed monthly charge is applied. The rationale for this system is to promote water saving practices and to ensure that low-income households can afford to use an adequate amount of water. However, there <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> with this system, because households in low-income areas resell water or share a connection with other households and thus risk ending up paying a higher tariff.|$|E
25|$|Also, there <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> in basing the {{analysis}} {{on a single}} type of character, such as a single gene or protein or only on morphological analysis, because such trees constructed from another unrelated data source often differ from the first, and therefore great care is needed in inferring phylogenetic relationships among species. This is most true of genetic material that is subject to lateral gene transfer and recombination, where different haplotype blocks can have different histories. In general, the output tree of a phylogenetic analysis is {{an estimate of the}} characters phylogeny (i.e. a gene tree) and not the phylogeny of the taxa (i.e. species tree) from which these characters were sampled, though ideally, both should be very close. For this reason, serious phylogenetic studies generally use a combination of genes that come from different genomic sources (e.g., from mitochondrial or plastid vs. nuclear genomes), or genes that would be expected to evolve under different selective regimes, so that homoplasy (false homology) would be unlikely to result from natural selection.|$|E
