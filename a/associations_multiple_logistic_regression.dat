40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} whether {{a high level}} of commonly experienced physical and mental symptoms could predict long spells of sickness absence in Swedish women and, further, to investigate the causal pattern of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors in relation to long spells of sickness absence. Methods: A questionnaire containing items on socioeconomic and psychosocial variables was sent to a random population of women, 40 to 50 years of age, living in a rural Swedish community. The response rate was 81. 7 % (397 women). Data on long spells of sickness absence (> 14 days) for the year following the baseline survey were obtained from the social insurance office. Odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate bivariate <b>associations.</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis was used to test for confounding and effect modification. Results: Women suffering from {{a high level of}} common symptoms were at risk of subsequent long spells of sickness absence, OR= 3. 39 (1. 86 - 6. 17). High demands at work and an active job position (i. e. the combination of high demands and a high degree of job control) were both associated with long spells of sickness absence, OR= 2. 16 (1. 12 - 4. 17) and OR= 1. 92 (1. 01 - 3. 67). The combined exposure (high level of common symptoms and an active job position) increased the odds for long spells of sickness absence (OR= 9. 13; 3. 39 - 24. 58) with synergy noted. Conclusions: The finding that women with common symptoms are at risk of future sickness absence is of particular importance in a primary health care setting. The finding that women in active job positions had a higher risk of sickness absence might be an effect of modern working conditions for women...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between diet diversity and hypertension was examined in a cross-sectional exploratory study of 82 randomly selected adult residents of Saba Island, Netherlands Antilles, {{in the eastern}} Caribbean Basin. Blood pressure measurements, taken over 4 years, and the appropriate use of antihypertensive medications, were used to identify chronic hypertensives. A 24 -hour dietary recall, semi-quantitative food frequency interviews, and ethnographic confirmation techniques were used to calculate diet diversity, {{a measure of the}} overall dietary pattern. Results suggest hypertension is associated with lack of an overall balance of food groups in the daily diet beyond any imbalance of a particular dietary cation such as sodium, potassium, or calcium. Bivariate analyses found a significant association between a poorly diversified diet and hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 4. 25, 95 percent confidence intervals [CI] = 1. 47, 12. 30). Dietary intake of sodium, potassium, and calcium was also examined and found not {{to be associated with the}} presence of hypertension in bivariate analyses.

40|$|Background: In India, common morbidities among {{children}} under 3 {{years of age}} are fever, acute respiratory infections, diarrhea. Effective early management at the home level and health care-seeking behavior in case of appearance of danger signs are key strategies {{to prevent the occurrence}} of severe and life-threatening complications. Objectives: To find out the prevalence of acute child morbidities, their determinants and health-seeking behavior of the mothers of these children. Setting and Design: The cross-sectional study was carried out in Wardha district of central India. 0 Material and Methods: We interviewed 990 mothers of children below 3 years of age using 30 -cluster sampling method. Nutritional status was defined by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference. Composite index of anthropometric failure (CIAF) was constructed. Hemoglobin concentration in each child was estimated using the &#x 2032;filter paper cyanm ethemoglobin method. &#x 2032; Using World Health Organization guidelines, anemia was defined as hemoglobin concentration less than 110 g/L. Post-survey focus group discussions (FGDs) were undertaken to bridge gaps in information obtained from the survey. Statistical Analysis: The data was analyzed by using SPSS 12. 0. 1 software package. Chi-square was used to test the association, while odds ratios were calculated to measure the strength of <b>association.</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis was applied to derive the final model. Results: Anemia was detected in 80. 3 &#x 0025; of children, and 59. 6 &#x 0025; of children were undernourished as indicated by CIAF. The overall prevalence of acute morbidity was 59. 9 &#x 0025;. Children with mild anemia, moderate anemia and severe anemia had 1. 52, 1. 61 and 9. 21 times higher risk of being morbid, respectively. Similarly, children with single, 2 and 3 anthropometric failures had 1. 16, 1. 29 and 2. 27 times higher risk of being morbid, respectively. Out of 594 (60 &#x 0025;) children with {{at least one of the}} acute morbidities, 520 (87. 5 &#x 0025;) sought health care, where majority (66. 1 &#x 0025;) received treatment from private clinics.

Women with recurrent pre-eclampsia or pre-eclampsia early in pregnancy reportedly have an increased long-term risk of CVD. Short stature is {{a risk factor for}} CVD but has rarely been examined in relation to pre-eclampsia. Methods We used data from 59 968 singleton live births in the Danish National Birth Cohort born between 1998 and 2001 to assess risk of severe pre-eclampsia/ eclampsia (296 cases) in relation to self-reported height. We examined the <b>association</b> in <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regressions</b> stratified by parity. Results Among primiparas there was a weak association (compared with women 165 cm, women 172 cm had on OR of 0. 79, 95 % CI: 0. 55, 1. 14). Among multiparas, the tallest women had an adjusted OR of 0. 42 (95 % CI: 0. 20, 0. 87) of developing severe pre-eclampsia compared with women 165 cm. The OR per centimetre was 0. 94 (95 % CI: 0. 91, 0. 97). Self-reported pre-existing hypertension did not explain this association, which also persisted when the analysis was restricted to non-overweight women.

This paper describes prevalence and covariates of psychiatric conditions in Georgia populations in three defined geographic areas. Methods: Data came from the Georgia population-based random-digit-dialing study investigating unwellness and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in Georgia populations of three defined geographic areas (metropolitan, urban, and rural). Respondents were screened for symptoms of fatigue, sleep, cognition, and pain at household screening interviews, and a randomly selected sample completed detailed individual phone interviews. Based on the detailed phone interviews, we conducted one-day clinical evaluations of 292 detailed interview participants classified as unwell with a probable CFS (i. e.

In contrast to short-term sickness absence, rates for LTSA have been on the increase. This paper, part 1 of a two-part paper, identifies individual domain barriers to returning to work (RTW) from LTSA across the work disability timeline in the UK labor market. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of 6, 246 workers from an occupationally diverse Police Force within the UK using a large administrative database. A series of chi-squared analyses were conducted to analyze the between and within group <b>associations.</b> Next, <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analyses using the Enter method were performed to develop a predictive model for RTW and Absence Phase. Results Findings substantiated the presence of individual domain barriers to RTW and predictors of RTW outcome and established the absence phase specificity of a number of risk factors of prolonged work disability. In particular, injury/illness especially mental ill health (MIH), physical job demands, sex, and number of episodes of LTSA are significant individual domain barriers to RTW and represent important risk factors for prolonged work disability. Conclusions Duration of work disability is associated with medical diagnosis, especially MIH, physical job demands, sex, and number of LTSA episodes. Findings also support the importance of using the outcome measure of absence phase of risk factors in addition to RTW outcome. Am. J. Ind. Med. Â© 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the impact of functional, communicative, and critical health literacy dimensions on positive and negative attitudes toward health decision making. The transtheoretical model of health behavior change (TTM) provided the theoretical framework to explain this association. A culturally-adapted survey was used in this cross-sectional study to measure health literacy dimensions, positive and negatives attitudes toward health decision making, and other factors in 100 Puerto Ricans living with HIV/AIDS. Demographic factors and clinical and immunological variables were obtained from the HIV/AIDS Registry database. Bivariate analyses were conducted to determine <b>associations</b> and <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analyses were used to determine the extent to which health literacy and other factors, while controlling for demographic characteristics, disease duration, and stage of readiness, predicted positive and negative attitudes toward health decision making.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionPreeclampsia is {{a complex}} and {{heterogeneous}} disease with increased risk of maternal mortality, especially for earlier gestational onset. There is a great inconsistency regarding the genetics of preeclampsia across the literature. The gene Activin A receptor, type IIA (ACVR 2 A), was reported as associated to preeclampsia in Australian/New Zealand and Norwegian populations. The goal {{of this study was}} to validate this genetic association in a Brazilian population. MethodsWe performed a case-control study using 693 controls and 613 cases (443 preeclampsia, 64 eclampsia and 106 HELLP syndrome), from a Northeastern Brazilian population. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACVR 2 A were tested for <b>association</b> through <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> models. ResultsThere was no statistical association with preeclampsia (per se), eclampsia or HELLP. However, by grouping preeclampsia in accordance to the gestational age at delivery, SNPs rs 1424954 (ORÂ =Â  1. 86; 95 % CI, 1. 25 â€“ 2. 78; pÂ =Â  0. 002) and rs 1014064 (ORÂ =Â  1. 77; 95 % CI, 1. 21 â€“ 2. 60; pÂ =Â  0. 004) were significantly associated with early onset preeclampsia (gestational ageÂ â‰¤Â  34 weeks). The risk haplotype had a frequency of 0. 468 in early preeclampsia compared to 0. 316 in controls (pÂ =Â  0. 0008 and permuted pÂ =Â  0. 002). DiscussionActivin A receptors are important in decidualization, trophoblast invasion and placentation processes during pregnancy. The gene ACVR 2 A was associated with the more severe early onset preeclampsia. This finding supports the hypothesis of different pathogenic mechanisms contributing to the early- and late-onset preeclampsia...|$|R

In an attempt to identify the biologically relevant variants, we analyzed 909 genetic variants across 5 q 11. 2 in 103, 991 breast cancer individuals and control individuals from 52 studies in the Breast Cancer <b>Association</b> Consortium. <b>Multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analyses identified three independent risk signals: the strongest associations were with 15 correlated variants (iCHAV 1), where the minor allele of the best candidate, rs 62355902, associated with significantly increased risks of both estrogen-receptor-positive (ER(+) : odds ratio [OR] = 1. 24, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 21 - 1. 27, ptrend = 5. 7 Â Ã— 10 (- 44)) and estrogen-receptor-negative (ER(-) : OR = 1. 10, 95 % CI = 1. 05 - 1. 15, ptrend = 3. 0 Â Ã— 10 (- 4)) tumors. After adjustment for rs 62355902, we found evidence of association of a further 173 variants (iCHAV 2) containing three subsets with a range of effects (the strongest was rs 113317823 [pcond = 1. 61 Â Ã— 10 (- 5) ]) and five variants composing iCHAV 3 (lead rs 11949391; ER(+) : OR = 0. 90, 95 % CI = 0. 87 - 0. 93, pcond = 1. 4 Â Ã— 10 (- 4)). Twenty-six percent of the prioritized candidate variants coincided with four putative regulatory elements that interact with the MAP 3 K 1 promoter through chromatin looping and affect MAP 3 K 1 promoter activity. Functional analysis indicated that the cancer risk alleles of four candidates (rs 74345699 and rs 62355900 [iCHAV 1], rs 16886397 [iCHAV 2 a], and rs 17432750 [iCHAV 3]) increased MAP 3 K 1 transcriptional activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed diminished GATA 3 binding to the minor (cancer-protective) allele of rs 17432750, indicating a mechanism for its action. We propose that the cancer risk alleles act to increase MAP 3 K 1 expression inÂ vivo and might promote breast cancer cell survival. status: publishe...|$|R

Methods: The cross-sectional baseline study was conducted at Bogor District. The aim {{of the study was}} to collect information about the vitamin A status of the breastfed infant, and to look for a relationship between many factors related to it. The samples were 183 breastfed infants aged 2 - 0 months without chronic disease, congenital disease, severe PEM nor twins. The chi-square and the prevalence odds ratio (POR) at the 95 % confidence interval were used to measure the <b>association</b> between variables. <b>Multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis was used to measure the closest factors to infant's vitamin A status. Results: The study showed that 54. 1 % of breastfed infants were at risk of vitamin A deficiency. Based on bivariate analysis, there are two significant independent variables related to infants vitamin A status, which are maternal vitamin A status and infant infection status. <b>Multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis showed that infection status is the closest factor to vitamin A deficiency in infants, followed by maternal vitamin A status and breast feeding frequency.

For DM it was 12. 1 % (10. 7 - 13. 5); 12. 9 % (10. 7 - 13. 5) in men and 11. 4 % (9. 5 - 13. 3) in women. The prevalence based on World Population as standard was 18. 3 % for DM and 11. 9 % for prediabetes. The prevalence of DM and prediabetes increased with age. Of people aged â‰¥ 50 years 46 % of men and 44 % of women had DM. Prediabetes and DM were associated with various measures of adiposity. DM was also associated with and family history of dyslipidemia in women, cardiovascular disease in men, and with hypertension, dyslipidemia and family history of diabetes in both sexes. Age was the strongest predictor of DM and prediabetes followed by obesity. Of people aged 50 years or over almost half had DM and another 10 - 15 % had prediabetes leaving only a small proportion of people in this age group with normoglycemia. Since we did not use an oral glucose tolerance test the true prevalence of DM and prediabetes is thus likely to be even higher than reported here.

40|$|Introduction: Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STI) pose a huge {{burden on}} the health of our society with more than 110 million infections currently in the United States. STIs are much more detrimental for women due to the risk of infertility and potential pregnancy complications. STIs can have many damaging impacts during pregnancy including stillbirth, premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery and direct infections of the infant, or subsequent infant mortality. In Kalamazoo County the rates of STI infections are nearly double that of the state and nation. In addition, the rates of infant mortality in Kalamazoo County are also higher than state and national averages. To combat this public health epidemic, we conducted a case controlled retrospective study to examine the impact of STIs on the birth outcomes of women in Kalamazoo County. Materials and Methods: The birth and death records from women who gave birth in Kalamazoo were examined using bivariate tests for <b>associations,</b> and <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> {{to assess the impact of}} health and demographic variables on the birth outcomes of infants born between 2008 - 2014. Poor birth outcomes were defined as prematurity less than 37 weeks, low birth weight less than 2500 g, and infant mortality. Results: Uninfected mothers had greater odds of having a good birth outcome than women with STIs, specifically Chlamydia infection (OR 1. 82, 95 % CI 1. 55, 2. 11), Gonorrhea infection (OR 2. 14, 95 % CI 1. 62, 2. 82) or Herpes infection (OR 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 13, 1. 49). There is an increased rate of Chlamydia infections per 1000 women who were; between the ages of 13 and 24 (93 versus 27), of color (105 versus 31), not college educated (69 versus 7), not married (99 versus 12), or on Medicaid (89 versus 12). These patterns were also consistent for Gonorrhea infections, but not Herpes. Conclusions: Data from this study indicates that STI infections in our community are increasing the risk of having a poor birth outcome. The factors that correlate with each STI to predict poor birth outcomes vary however. This research was undertaken in collaboration with community agencies, including Kalamazoo Community and Health Services, and our findings will help inform educational strategies to combat these problems within our community...|$|R

DESIGN [...] Analysis of smokers in a large prospective study. Self completed questionnaires provided information on psychosocial factors. SETTING [...] Coronary care units at six English hospitals participating in a multicentre clinical trial. SUBJECTS [...] These comprised consenting myocardial infarction survivors who had been identified as smokers and who completed questionnaires within seven days of infarct at six hospitals participating in the Anglo-Scandinavian study of early thrombolysis. The 532 patients identified have been followed for over {{five and a half}} years. The main outcome measure was five year all cause mortality. MAIN RESULTS [...] Smokers who stopped within one month showed significantly reduced mortality compared with those who persisted, adjusting for other prognostic indicators (odds ratio 0. 56, 95 % confidence interval 0. 33, 0. 98). Overall, 74 % stopped smoking. Being married, low life stress levels before infarct, and higher social class were associated with stopping smoking but the differentials were small. Of the clinical variables, a final diagnosis of definite myocardial infarction was associated with stopping smoking. All <b>associations</b> remained after <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression.</b> CONCLUSION [...] Smoking cessation can halve the smokers' odds of dying after myocardial infarction and psychosocial factors play a small but important role in the important decision to stop smoking.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) vs. controls, and to verify possible associations of MetS with specific disease-related factors. Methods: the subjects were 283 RA patients and 226 healthy controls, frequency matched by age and sex. MetS was defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria. Disease activity was evaluated with the Disease Activity Score using 28 joints (DAS 28). A standardized clinical evaluation was performed and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed. Results: the criteria for MetS were met by 39. 2 % RA patients vs. 19. 5 % {{in the control group}} (p < 0. 001). Increased waist circumference, elevated blood pressure (BP), and fasting glucose were more frequent in RA patients than controls (p < 0. 001 for all <b>associations).</b> By <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis (adjusted for age, sex, and years at school), the risk of having MetS was significantly higher for RA patients than for controls [odds ratio (OR) 1. 87, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 17 - 3. 00, p = 0. 009]. the DAS 28 was significantly higher in RA patients with MetS than in those without MetS (3. 59 +/- 1. 27 vs. 3. 14 +/- 1. 53; p = 0. 01). Disease duration, the presence of rheumatoid factor, and extra-articular manifestations were similar for patients with and without MetS. Conclusions: MetS frequency was higher in RA patients than in controls. Among RA patients, MetS was associated with disease activity. the higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in RA suggests that inflammatory processes play a notable {{role in the development of}} cardiovascular disease (CVD), and indicates that tight control of systemic inflammatory activity and CVD modifiable risk factors should be recommended.

Twenty-six percent of the prioritized candidate variants coincided with four putative regulatory elements that interact with the MAP 3 K 1 promoter through chromatin looping and affect MAP 3 K 1 promoter activity. Functional analysis indicated that the cancer risk alleles of four candidates (rs 74345699 and rs 62355900 [iCHAV 1], rs 16886397 [iCHAV 2 a], and rs 17432750 [iCHAV 3]) increased MAP 3 K 1 transcriptional activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed diminished GATA 3 binding to the minor (cancer-protective) allele of rs 17432750, indicating a mechanism for its action. We propose that the cancer risk alleles act to increase MAP 3 K 1 expression in vivo and might promote breast cancer cell survival...|$|R
40|$|Background: The National Breast Cancer Audit Database of the Society of Breast Surgeons of Australia and New Zealand {{is used by}} {{surgeons}} {{to monitor}} treatment quality and for research. About 60 % of early invasive female breast cancers in Australia are recorded. The objectives of this study are: (1) to investigate associations of socio-demographic, health-system and clinical characteristics with treatment of invasive female breast cancer by mastectomy compared with breast conserving surgery; and (2) to consider service delivery implications. Materials and Methods: Bi-variable and multivariable analyses of associations of characteristics with surgery type for cancers diagnosed in 1998 - 2010. Results: Of 30, 299 invasive cases analysed, 11, 729 (39 %) were treated by mastectomy as opposed to breast conserving surgery. This proportion did not vary by diagnostic year (p> 0. 200). With major city residence as the reference category, the relative rate (95 % confidencelimits) of mastectomy was 1. 03 (0. 99, 1. 07) for women from inner regional areas and 1. 05 (1. 01, 1. 10) for those from more remote areas. Low annual surgeon case load (â‰¤ 10) was predictive of mastectomy, with a relative rate of 1. 08 (1. 03, 1. 14) when compared with higher case loads. Tumour size was also predictive, with a relative rate of 1. 05 (1. 01, 1. 10) for large cancers (40 + mm) compared with smaller cancers (< 30 mm). These <b>associations</b> were confirmedin <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis. Conclusions: Results confirmprevious studies showing higher mastectomy rates for residents of more remote areas, those treated by surgeons with low case loads, and those with large cancers. Reasons require further study, including possible effects of surgeon and womanâ€™s choice and access to radiotherapy services.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 41) A Monte Carlo {{comparison between}} a multiple linear and a <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> model was made utilizing a simple cross-validation procedure. The measure {{used to assess}} the two models was R 2, which was defined for this study as the squared correlation coefficient between the predicted outcome measure and the actual binary outcome measure. Each sample contained 50 "subjects" with one binary outcome measure and four continuous predictor variables. The predictor variables were transformed into variables with normal and u-shape distribution properties. There were 129 data sets with normal distributions and 121 data sets with u-shape distributions which were analyzed. A known population correlation matrix was used to correlate each data set. Regression coefficients and R 2 values were calculated for the original 129 normal and 121 u-shape data sets using a multiple linear and a <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> model. The obtained regression coefficients were then applied to cross-validation samples yielding another set of R 2 values. The <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> model had significantly larger R 2 values for both normal and u-shape distributions when the original data sets were evaluated. The shrinkage estimate was calculated by subtracting the R 2 cross-validation value from the corresponding R 2 original value. The shrinkage estimate was significantly greater for the <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> model for both types of data distributions. The two models essentially had equivalent R 2 values for the cross-validation samples. The <b>multiple</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> model used for this investigation experienced convergence problems on several of the data sets. Parameter estimates that were extremely large in magnitude were also obtained on several other data sets. Originally 160 sample sets with normal and u-shape properties were generated.
