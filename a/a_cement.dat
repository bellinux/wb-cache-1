5|$|For {{the shot}} of the levitating truck, which {{was used in the}} film to {{demonstrate}} the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached <b>a</b> <b>cement</b> truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement. In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E
5|$|Freight {{trains to}} the various {{industrial}} companies along the line remained until the 1980s, when traffic sank drastically. From 1988, the line was closed from Foss-Eigeland, although the line from there to Ganddal was kept for use for <b>a</b> <b>cement</b> factory. Until 2001 only the three first kilometers (two first miles) of the line were used, for transport of concrete structures, but then the Norwegian National Rail Administration stopped all traffic on the line.|$|E
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Total hip arthroplasties in young {{patients}} have lower long-term survival rates than in older patients. We evaluated {{the use of}} a unique treatment protocol in patients aged between 40 and 50 years. In all cases we used <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> THA, and for acetabular deficiencies we also used impacted bone grafts together with <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> cup...|$|R
30|$|The major {{weakness}} {{of our study}} {{is that it is}} not randomized. Also, difference in age between the two groups is a clear confounding variable. Younger age was significantly associated with wear, and older age in our patients with <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> cup is in contradiction to previous reports that <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> all-polyethylene cup has better behavior than an uncemented in terms of wear.|$|R
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Revision surgery for periprosthetic femoral {{fractures}} around <b>an</b> unstable <b>cemented</b> femoral stem traditionally requires {{removal of existing}} <b>cement.</b> We propose <b>a</b> new technique whereby <b>a</b> well-fixed <b>cement</b> mantle can be retained in cases with simple fractures that can be reduced anatomically when <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> revision is planned. This technique is well established in femoral stem revision, but not in association with a fracture...|$|R
5|$|The extension's {{completion}} {{was delayed}} by weather and <b>a</b> <b>cement</b> workers' strike; {{it was to}} have been finished by October 1, 1950the tenth anniversary of the opening of the first section. On October 23, 1950, the Philadelphia extension was previewed in a ceremony led by Governor Duff. The extension opened to traffic on November 20, 1950; the governor and chairman Evans cut the ribbon at the Valley Forge mainline toll plaza to the west of King of Prussia.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipalities}} of Voss and Granvin {{wanted to use}} the right-of-way for a hiking and bicycle path, and NSB canceled their plans. Demolish started on 10 December 1991, although the section from Voss to Palmafoss was kept to serve <b>a</b> <b>cement</b> factory. Two of the Class 64 trains have been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Association and are based at the Old Voss Line in Bergen.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the main}} façade's first- and second-story windows and the {{entrance}} are adorned with white wooden label moldings. The main entrance is composed of a tall double wooden entrance door, with its original handle and locks. Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels. A rectangular transom light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double wooden doors. Outside the entryway is a spacious brick stoop that is accessed by <b>a</b> <b>cement</b> walkway from West Main Street. Its brick steps {{leading up to the}} stoop were last restored in the late 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Prosthetic cost {{contributes}} {{greatly to}} the overall expense of THA. A key question, therefore, {{in the selection of}} implant technique is whether any price difference exists between a cementless and <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> femoral prosthesis. We evaluated the price difference between the most commonly used cemented and cementless femoral stems at three high-volume academic medical centers. Each hospital’s costs for prostheses from the manufacturers were recorded. The average cost of implanting a cementless femoral prosthesis was $ 296 more than the average cost of implanting <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> femoral stem, even with the additional expense of two batches of bone cement and the accessories commonly used to achieve <b>a</b> third-generation <b>cementing</b> technique. The price difference was less variable if the cost of the prostheses from only the primary implant supplier for each institution was considered. As the number of THAs performed per year continues to escalate, implantation of <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> femoral component remains an attractive method of fixation from an economic standpoint...|$|R

5|$|After high school, Shoup {{attended}} DePauw University {{where he}} was one of 100 awarded the Edward Rector Scholarship, giving him full tuition. Majoring in mathematics, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity and maintained high marks, narrowly failing the selection criteria for Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was on the track and field and rifle teams, and also competed in the wrestling and football teams. He won the Indiana and Kentucky Amateur Athletic Union marathon in 1925. He waited tables, washed dishes and worked in <b>a</b> <b>cement</b> factory to help pay his expenses. Lack of funds compelled him to take a year off after his junior year to teach school, and his expenses were further strained when he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and incurred hospital bills. He opted to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) to offset his living expenses, and later recalled that this was the only reason he joined the military. He graduated from DePauw in 1926.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Jovovich {{starred in}} the horror/action film Resident Evil, {{released}} in the United States on March 15, 2002 {{and based on the}} CAPCOM video game series of the same name. She portrayed Alice, the film's heroine, who fights a legion of zombies created by the Umbrella Corporation. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise. Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to <b>a</b> <b>cement</b> platform, which her management deemed too dangerous, and had trained in karate, kickboxing, and combat-training. The film was commercially successful, grossing $17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining $40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide. Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in No Good Deed (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy You Stupid Man (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in Dummy (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series King of the Hill. The role of Fangora in Dummy allowed Jovovich to act in film with Oscar-winning Adrien Brody, who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it easy to identify with this role because she felt Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress' own life.|$|E
5|$|Sitakunda has <b>a</b> <b>cement</b> factory, 12 jute mills, 6 textile mills, 10 {{re-rolling}} mills, and 79 {{functional and}} defunct shipyards. Two of the operational jute mills {{are run by}} the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation, and one has been sold to a private sector company. To protest against privatization, workers of Hafiz Jute Mill, Gul Ahmed Jute Mill, MM Jute Mill and RR Jute Mill blocked the Dhaka–Chittagong Highway for seven hours in September 2007. As early as 1953, Sitakunda was described as the location for one of only five poultry farms in East Pakistan, along with Tejgaon (Dhaka), Narayanganj (Dhaka), Jamalpur (Bogra), and Sylhet. Some mining for sand from agricultural lands is carried out along {{the eastern side of}} the Dhaka–Chittagong road. Operators of local brick kilns are engaged in illegal hill cutting, a practice that was responsible along with heavy rainfall for the 2007 Chittagong mudslide. The rural poor are supported by Grameen Bank and NGOs such as CARE, BRAC and ASA.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Schindler {{had spent}} his entire fortune on bribes and black-market {{purchases}} of supplies for his workers. Virtually destitute, he moved briefly to Regensburg and later Munich, but did not prosper in postwar Germany. In fact, he was reduced to receiving assistance from Jewish organisations. In 1948 he presented a claim for reimbursement of his wartime expenses to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and received $15,000. He estimated his expenditures at over $1,056,000, including the costs of camp construction, bribes, and expenditures for black market goods, including food. Schindler emigrated to Argentina in 1949, where he tried raising chickens and then nutria, a small animal raised for its fur. When the business went bankrupt in 1958, he left his wife and returned to Germany, where he had a series of unsuccessful business ventures, including <b>a</b> <b>cement</b> factory. He declared bankruptcy in 1963 and suffered a heart attack the next year, which led to a month-long stay in hospital. Remaining in contact with many of the Jews he had met during the war, including Stern and Pfefferberg, Schindler survived on donations sent by Schindlerjuden from all over the world. He died on 9 October 1974 and is buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, {{the only member of the}} Nazi Party to be honoured in this way. For his work during the war, in 1963 Schindler was named Righteous Among the Nations, an award bestowed by the State of Israel on non-Jews who took an active role to rescue Jews during the Holocaust. Other awards include the German Order of Merit (1966).|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To review {{hospital}} mortality after hemiarthroplasty or {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) using <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> stem for displaced femoral neck fractures. Methods. Medical records of 284 hips in 70 men and 209 women aged 45 to 106 (mean, 81. 3) years who underwent hemiarthroplasty (n= 232) or THA (n= 52) with <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> stem using third-generation cementing techniques (including use of a plug, lavage, and cement pressurisation) for displaced femoral neck fractures were retrospectively reviewed. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grading, 6 patients were classified preoperatively as grade 1, 77 as grade 2, 148 as grade 3, 47 as grade 4, and one as grade 5. Patients were operated on within 48 hours. Patients were rehabilitated in the hospital until discharge. The primary outcome measure was {{hospital mortality}}, including the cause of death.

30|$|A clear {{impact of}} cutting {{speed on the}} length of tool life is {{manifested}} as a decrease in the tool life with increasing cutting speed. The assumed value of tool wear VBmax for <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> carbide bit is smaller than for a high-speed steel tool so the cutting distances required to reach tool wear VBmax =  0.2  mm are lower. Considering the machining at the highest rotational speed, the required cutting distance of <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> carbide bit to reach the assumed VBmax value is about twice as small as that of a high-speed steel bit.|$|R
5000|$|Despite common belief, the Tessar was not {{developed}} from the 1893 Cooke triplet design by replacing the rear element with <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> achromatic doublet. In fact, Paul Rudolph designed the Anastigmat with two cemented doublets in 1890. In 1899, he separated the doublets in the Anastigmat to produce the four-element, four-group Unar lens. In 1902, he realized that reversing the two rear elements of the Unar and returning to <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> doublet would improve performance; he named the result [...] "Tessar", from the Greek word τέσσερα (téssera, four) to indicate a four-element design.|$|R
30|$|In total hip arthroplasty, {{polyethylene}} debris {{is mainly}} {{responsible for the}} development of osteolysis with subsequent loss of bone stock and implant fixation [1 – 3]. In the early 1980 s several reports showed that, in the long term, the rate of wear and the degree of osteolysis observed with uncemented cups were greater than those associated with cemented components [4 – 11], but in one study this could not be proved [12]. As no studies have reported direct comparison of long-term results of cemented versus uncemented acetabular components, the question of whether <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> all-polyethylene cup has better behavior than an uncemented one has not been fully clarified. This study was undertaken to compare wear of <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> and <b>an</b> uncemented cup with similar design, polyethylene, and sterilization method. Our hypothesis was that there is no difference in the rate of wear of polyethylene between <b>a</b> <b>cemented</b> and <b>an</b> uncemented cup with similar design, polyethylene, and sterilization method.|$|R
