Cousins Idris and Timur return to Afghanistan over two decades later in 2003 to reclaim their family's property. While there, Timur makes <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show</b> of publicly distributing money to street beggars while Idris privately bonds with Roshi, an Afghan girl who suffers from a horrific injury and whose family was murdered by her uncle. Idris at first promises to arrange for Roshi to undergo the operations needed for her recovery but distances himself from her and Afghanistan on returning to the States. Several years later, Idris comes across Roshi signing copies of her bestselling memoir, which she has dedicated to her adoptive mother and Timur, who paid for her surgery.|$|E
5|$|Although Gebhard had {{gathered}} some troops around him, {{he hoped to}} recruit support from the Lutheran princes. Unfortunately for him, he had converted to another branch of the Reformed faith; such cautious Lutheran princes as Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, balked at extending their military support to Calvinists and the Elector Palatine was unable to persuade them to join the cause. Gebhard had three primary supporters. His brother, Karl, had married Eleonore, Countess of Hohenzollern (1551–after 1598), and Gebhard could hope that this family alliance with the power-hungry Hohenzollerns would help his cause. Another long-time ally and supporter Adolf, Count von Neuenahr, was a successful and cunning military commander whose army secured {{the northern part of}} the territory. Finally, John Casimir (1543–1592), the brother of the Elector Palatine, had expressed his support, and made <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show</b> of force in the southern part of the Electorate.|$|E

500|$|Director Kim Manners {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Not <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show,</b> but a good one. It's {{a lighter}} show. There {{is a lot of}} humor in it, but I think it's a hit with fans because there is some {{wonderful}} Mulder and Scully's relationship stuff. The entire third act is {{just the two of them}} talking, which is actually kind of interesting. The scene where Mulder and Scully talk while stranded on a rock included approximately 10 pages of dialogue. Gillian Anderson said of the scene: [...] "I loved that. That was so much fun, and I think it was written really well... It was just neat to have us separated from everything and stuck on this island where we could wax philosophical and kind of tell the truth to each other in strange ways."

[...] Bain also observed {{that the vast majority}} of the shots of Carey are either long shots, showing the singer from a distance, or close up shots, showing Carey from the shoulders and above, so that the viewer was not able to easily recognise that she was pregnant. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy also praised the content of the video, writing [...] "Of course it wouldn't be a Mariah Carey video without some glitz and glam so the stage and backdrop are covered in (what else?) glitter. Mariah puts on <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show</b> and sings her heart out with that famous eight-octave range... scrooges need not apply, 'Oh Santa!' is fun and festive and has you longing for a sip of eggnog." ...|$|E

[...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as [...] "A very bizarre episode in which everyone just has a good time." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "A certified classic, 'Child' mocks the self-help field and makes a good point along the way. Of course, it does all this with scads of clever moments and becomes <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show.</b> As one who works in psychology, it's hard to resist this program's spoofery." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B+ and described Homer's escapades with the trampoline as [...] "the episode's brightest spot." [...] Turner described the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner homage as [...] "one of the show's most overt and inspired tributes to the Warner cartoons." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4.5 out of 5.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, I think that was the first time that he was really impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show</b> and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April 2010. He {{said that the}} aliens in the episode were [...] "one note", and overall [...] "Code of Honor" [...] didn't generate any emotional investment. He gave the episode a score of C−, summing it up as [...] "I'm not sure I'd believe <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show</b> {{could come out of}} TNG after watching 'Code', but I could at least say it had promise without sounding like a complete tool." [...] Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Code of Honor" [...] for Tor.com in May 2011. He thought the episode was riddled with clichés, and says that the episode only seems racist because of the casting even though the script didn't call for it. [...] "If the Ligonians had been played by white people, none of the dialogue would change, and nobody would call it racist", he said and gave it a score of two out of ten. Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation thought the episode was very slowly paced, and that the fight scene at the end was [...] "clunky and awkward", suggesting that this {{had something to do with}} the opposition of the cast and crew to the episode overall. She thought there were several plot holes, including why sickbay couldn't replicate the vaccine, and that the only redeeming quality of the episode was the beginning of the friendship between Data and La Forge.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{also came}} up with the idea to have a {{crossover}} with the show , which also takes place in Baltimore. He later recalled, [...] "I realized that the whole episode was framed around Byers telling his story to a Baltimore homicide detective. So I figured 'what the heck? Homicides <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show,</b> so why not try to get Richard Belzer to play his Detective [...] character?'" [...] Despite some hesitancy from Fox's lawyers, the show got in contact with NBC executive producer Tom Fontana, who was more than willing to allow the use of Belzer: Gilligan later described Fontana as a [...] "great guy" [...] for assistance in the matter. The episode also features the first reappearance of X, who had been murdered in the season four opener [...] "Herrenvolk". The idea to bring back X was thought up by executive producer John Shiban, who helped Gilligan storyboard the episode. He noted, [...] "we had the board set up and [...] and there was a piece missing and we just couldn't come up with a how to get out of this situation, why doesn't this assassin just kill The Lone Gunmen? It was a flashback story and it was in 1989 and we were pacing around in my backyard, and [...] I just turned to him and said, 'X! [...] X has another agenda! X is the assassin, it's not some other character, it's our X. [...] He wouldn't kill the Gunmen, 'cause he's trying to help Mulder.'" ...|$|E

Its appearance does not answer to our ideal of the conqueror. His statues, though not representing him as a type of manly beauty, yet give him refined, intelligent features, but a comparison with the mummy shows that the artists have idealised their model.

According to BoxRec, Gans had asked the fight to be stopped in the ninth round after being injured by an accidental headbutt from Erne. Other sources wrote that Erne had held a decisive edge in the bout, and continuously battered Gans in the face, before Gans finally ended the fight fearing permanent damage to his eye.

500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show</b> and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{first year}} of Q-ship service was {{frustrating}} for Stuart and the [...] crew. Although, prior to his attachment to the ship, Farnborough had succeeded in sinking an enemy submarine (the U-68 in March 1916), {{there had been no}} successes since. In February 1917, Campbell decided that in order to properly invite an attack, the Farnborough would have to actually be torpedoed before combat and then engage the submarine as she closed to finish the job with shellfire. [...] On 17 February this theory was proven correct off Southern Ireland when the lone Farnborough was struck by a torpedo fired at extreme range. Campbell intentionally failed to evade the missile and the ship took the blow in the hold, causing some minor injuries to the crew but serious damage to the ship. The crew were well rehearsed and the [...] "panic party" [...] took to their boats with <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show</b> of alarm and disorder while the gun crews manned positions on their hidden weapons. When four lifeboats had been released and the ship had settled in the water and was clearly sinking, the submarine U-83 pulled up just ten yards (9m) from the wreck. A hail of shot was then unleashed by the Farnborough's remaining crew from their six-pounder gun and several machine guns into the stationary submarine. The very first shot decapitated the German captain Bruno Hoppe and the U-boat was rapidly reduced to a battered wreck. Eight German sailors escaped the submarine before it sank but only two could be pulled from the water, one of whom subsequently died from his wounds.|$|E

Actor Stephen Barker Turner and actress Keira Naughton guest starred in the episode as Tom and Jennifer Parker. Stink Fisher appeared as Jason Peterson and Slaine starred as Kevin Roban, a drug dealer. Slaine said of his role in the episode, [...] "As a lot of people know I have branched out from hip-hop to acting and this will be my first venture into network television. I’m really looking forward to working on this, as it’s <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>show</b> with a fantastic cast". This episode marked the first appearance of Cliff Curtis, who plays Special Agent Derek Ames, a love interest for Megan Hunt (Delany). Curtis was reported to have a role in Body of Proof in November 2010. Curtis was originally meant to be appearing {{towards the end of the}} season. Delany said, [...] "We do have a very dashing FBI agent coming on for the end of the season, played by Cliff Curtis. [...] an old friend, so I wanted him for the role". Afterwards, Curtis appears in one more episode; [...] "Hard Knocks". [...] "Missing" [...] marked the first appearance of Joanna Cassidy since the first season. Cassidy, who plays Joan Hunt has appeared in season one episodes, [...] "Society Hill" [...] and [...] "Buried Secrets". Delany said that Megan's relationship with Joan in the second season would be [...] "tough" [...] because it has been [...] "going on for a long time and most people don’t change after a certain age".
