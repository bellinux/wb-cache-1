30|$|Recently, high-dimensional {{dynamical}} {{systems have}} been an attractive research field for many scientific areas particularly in computer sciences and have received considerable <b>attention</b> <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> communication field. This kind of chaotic map has better mixing nature and higher complexity. Moreover, {{it is more difficult}} or even impossible to predict the time series generated by the system. These properties granted them to be a good candidate for secure communications. To the best of our knowledge, only a few chaos-based hash functions with high-dimensional dynamical {{systems have been}} reported [30, 32, 38]. For instance, an algorithm for image encryption based on a high-dimensional chaotic map with high efficiency is proposed in [4]. The high-dimensional chaotic maps [4] possess remarkable dynamical properties such as invariant measure, ergodicity, the possibility of KS-entropy calculation, and bifurcation without any period doubling [4, 39, 40].|$|R
40|$|Privacy and {{security}} {{should be paid}} much more <b>attention</b> <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, {{as far as we}} know, few researches on secure VANET protocols have addressed both the privacy issues and authenticated key establishment. Therefore, in this work, a lightweight authenticated key establishment scheme with privacy preservation to secure the communications between mobile vehicles and roadside infrastructure in a VANET is proposed, which is called SECSPP. Our proposed scheme not only accomplishes vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-road side infrastructure authentication and key establishment for communication between members, but also integrates blind signature techniques into the scheme in allowing mobile vehicles to anonymously interact with the services of roadside infrastructure. We also show that our scheme is efficient in its implementation on mobile vehicles in comparison with other related proposals. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

It is a dynamic wireless network that can be formulated {{without the need for}} any pre-existing infrastructure in which each node can act as a router. Routing protocols {{play a vital role in}} transmission of data across the network. The two major classifications of routing protocols are unipath and multipath. One of the main challenges of MANET is the design of robust routing protocol that adapt to the frequent and randomly changing network topology. Passive Attacks such as snooping and Active Attacks such as wormhole attack, black hole attack, byzantine attack, Transport Layer Attacks, Multipath Layer Attacks etc. are possible in the available routing protocols. Wireless ad-hoc networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes due to security vulnerabilities of the AODV routing protocol. Anonymous routing protocols attract much more <b>attention</b> <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> MANETs for the purposes of security and privacy concerns. The use of AOMDV (Ad-hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector) and improved the security of MANET against the several Vulnerabilities is analyzed in this study. Performance of On-demand routing protocols such as Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol and Adhoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) routing protocol are analyzed. AOMDV has better packet delivery ratio and comparatively low average end-to-end delay when compared to the existing AODV protocol. The number of packets dropped in the AOMDV against the vulnerabilities is very low. Thus the proposed technique which uses AOMDV is proved to be better against the attacks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Model-driven {{approach}} has recently received much <b>attention</b> <b>in</b> developing <b>secure</b> software and systems. In addition, software developers {{have attempted to}} employ such an emerging approach in the early stage of software development life cycle. However, security concerns are rarely considered and practiced {{due to the lack}} of appropriate systematic mechanisms and tools. In this paper, we introduce a multilayered software development life cycle (SDLC), which is based on an assurance management framework (AMF), focusing on the development of authorization systems. AMF facilitates comprehensive realization of formal se-curity model, security policy specification and verification, gen-eration of security enforcement codes, and rigorous conformance testing. We also articulate our experience in analyzing role-based authorization requirements and realizing those requirements in constructing a role-based authorization system.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} seminal work of Volpano and Smith, there has been growing {{evidence}} that type systems {{may be used to}} enforce condentiality of programs through non-interference. However, most type systems operate on high-level languages and calculi, and -level lan-guages have not received much <b>attention</b> <b>in</b> studies of <b>secure</b> information ow " (Sabelfeld and Myers, [1]). Therefore, we introduce an information ow type system for a low-level language featuring jumps and calls, and show that the type system enforces termination-insensitive non-interference. Furthermore, information ow type systems for low-level languages should appropriately relate to their counterparts for high-level languages. Therefore, we introduce a compiler from a high-level imperative programming language to our low-level language, and show that the compiler preserves information ow types...|$|R

More specifically, it provides a valuable form of metacognition, one that contributes to social stability by helping individuals negotiate the challenges that come from having to act in the face of unclear norm...|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} of {{equilibrium}} <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> strategies (EinSS) <b>in</b> non-cooperative games is presented. The EinSS {{coincides with the}} Nash-Cournot Equilibrium when Nash-Cournot Equilibrium exists and postulates the incentive of players to maximize their profit under the condition of security against actions of other players. The new concept is illustrated {{by a number of}} matrix game examples and compared with other closely related theoretical models. We prove the existence of equilibrium <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> strategies <b>in</b> four classic games that fail to have Nash-Cournot equilibria. On an infinite line we obtain the solution <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> strategies of the classic Hotelling’s price game (1929) with a restricted reservation price and linear transportation costs. New type of monopolistic solution <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> strategies is discovered in the Tullock Contest (1967, 1980) of two players. For the model of insurance market we prove that the contract pair found by Rothschild, Stiglitz and Wilson (1976) is always an equilibrium <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> strategies.

40|$|Abstract: With the {{widespread}} use of electronic health record (EHR), building a secure EHR sharing environment has attracted a lot of <b>attention</b> <b>in</b> both healthcare industry and academic community. Cloud computing paradigm is one of the popular healthIT infrastructure for facilitating EHR sharing and EHR integration. In this paper we discuss important concepts related to EHR sharing and integration in healthcare clouds and analyze the arising security and privacy issues in access and management of EHRs. We describe an EHR security reference model for managing security issues in healthcare clouds, which highlights three important core components <b>in</b> <b>securing</b> an EHR cloud. We illustrate the development of the EHR security reference model through a use-case scenario and describe the corresponding security countermeasures and state of art security techniques that can be applied as basic security guards...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With {{increased}} {{focus on}} wireless communications, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are attracting much <b>attention</b> <b>in</b> recent years. MANET is an infrastructure less mobile network formed {{by a number}} of self organized mobile nodes which is different from traditional networks that has a fixed infrastructure. Certificate revocation is a major security component in mobile ad hoc networks. Because of their wireless and dynamic nature, MANETs are vulnerable to security attacks from malicious nodes. Certificate revocation mechanism plays an important role <b>in</b> <b>securing</b> a network. When the certificate of a malicious node is revoked, it is denied from all activities and isolated from the network. The main challenge for certificate revocation is to revoke the certificates of malicious nodes promptly and accurately. In this project we will simulate the certificate revocation and recovery technique using Clustering method...|$|R
