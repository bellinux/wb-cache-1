5|$|On November 27, 1998, King County Metro driver Mark McLaughlin, {{the driver}} of a {{southbound}} route 359 Express <b>articulated</b> <b>bus,</b> {{was shot and killed}} by a passenger, Silas Cool, while driving across the bridge. Cool then shot himself as the bus veered across two lanes of traffic and plunged off the bridge's eastern side onto the roof of an apartment building below. Herman Liebelt, a passenger on the bus, later died of injuries he sustained in the crash.|$|E
25|$|In late 2004, NABI {{unveiled}} a new 60-foot low-floor <b>articulated</b> <b>bus</b> with rail-like styling, {{which had been}} in development since early 2003. This new product was designated the Model 60-BRT. Delivery of production versions began the following year, and a shorter, 42-foot derivative was eventually produced.|$|E
25|$|The other {{criticism}} {{is that there}} is very low ridership the trains compared to some very crowded bus lines such as the 90-99 series routes. One fully loaded Trillium Line train carries 285 passengers compared to 131 passengers for an <b>articulated</b> <b>bus.</b> The O-Train schedule is limited by track capacity.|$|E

25|$|First Greater Manchester also {{operates}} {{a number of}} 'overground' services, high frequency colour-coded services connecting Manchester with many large towns around the conurbation including Bolton, Bury, Oldham and Rochdale. A high frequency <b>articulated</b> <b>bus</b> route on the Bury-Manchester 135 service, which operates every six to ten minutes is the competing bus route with Metrolink's Bury Line.|$|E
25|$|Such was the {{popularity}} of the Routemaster that many calls continued to be made for {{a new version of the}} vehicle to be produced. On 3 September 2007, Conservative mayoral candidate Boris Johnson announced that he was contemplating introducing a modern-day version of the Routemaster (and scrapping <b>articulated</b> <b>bus</b> operation). In December 2007, UK magazine Autocar commissioned leading bus designer Capoco, designer of the innovative Optare Solo, to come up with detailed proposals for a new-generation Routemaster.|$|E
25|$|MCW Metrobuses and AEC Routemasters {{were the}} staple diet of the depot {{for many years}} until the new Alexander ALX400 bodied DAF DB250LFs arrived. The final Routemasters left Tottenham in September 2004 when route 73 was {{converted}} to Mercedes-Benz Citaro <b>articulated</b> <b>bus</b> operation and moved to Lea Valley. However Tottenham has retained a single Routemaster for the Arriva London Heritage fleet for use at shows and special events. It {{is probably the most}} famous too, being the (numerically) first production Routemaster, RM5.|$|E

25|$|The new Nova Bus LFS {{articulated}} buses came factory-equipped with bike racks, {{as do the}} non-articulated LFS buses entering service in 2015. These racks were sealed in October 2014 by order of the Ministry of Labour, due to concerns about bikes on the racks obscuring the drivers' view. In May 2015, the slot closer to the bus was authorised for use. The other is sealed off with metal panels, and the retention hooks have been removed. Once the first slot is full, cyclists may bring their bikes inside the <b>articulated</b> <b>bus</b> during off-peak hours, at the driver's discretion.|$|E
25|$|General accumulations in Quebec and northeastern Ontario {{were between}} 8 to 16inches (20–40cm) from the Timmins region to east of Quebec City. Numerous schools were closed across western Quebec {{including}} all {{schools in the}} Gatineau area while all school transportation was cancelled across Ottawa and Eastern Ontario. OC Transpo's <b>articulated</b> <b>bus</b> fleet experienced similar problems as during the Winter Storm of December 2005 when some buses jackknifed or were stuck in the snow in many areas across the city, although the problem was less severe than in 2005. That incident however involved similar accumulations of about one foot. Numerous flights from Macdonald-Cartier International Airport and Pierre-Elliott Trudeau International Airport (133 flights) were canceled.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Dennis {{also built}} one 12-metre Enviro500 {{demonstrator}} for long-term loan. It was first loaned to Community Transit between 2007 and 2009 which {{put it into}} service on 1 August 2007, the bus was used on commuter routes between Seattle and various points in Snohomish County during its first year in operation. From September 2010, it was loaned to Strathcona County Transit on a one-year lease for the operator's one-year-long double-decker pilot project. The pilot {{is part of an}} exploration of different high-capacity bus types to carry more passengers on the high-demand commuter routes, which are between Strathcona County and Edmonton; an <b>articulated</b> <b>bus</b> is also being evaluated as an alternative and there is no commitment to put any Alexander Dennis model or any double-decker design into permanent service. This bus becomes the first double-decker to be used for regular transit service in Alberta.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2005, the new Orange Line (Los Angeles Metro) began service. The busway was {{constructed}} {{instead of a}} further Red Line rail extension in the Valley. The Orange Line uses train-like two-cabin <b>articulated</b> <b>bus</b> bodies to provide high-capacity transit service across an east-west corridor in the southern San Fernando Valley. The Red Line connects to the Orange Line at [...] station. The Orange Line feeds about 15,000 new boardings into the Red Line at the North Hollywood terminus. Currently, little chance exists for further underground Red Line extension west from its northern terminus.|$|E
2500|$|One 1996 NABI <b>articulated</b> <b>bus,</b> 9619 {{was saved}} and {{converted}} into MTA's official [...] "Comfort Bus," [...] a bus specially {{designed to be}} dispatched to special events in Baltimore City during the summer to provide air conditioning to the attendees of special events and to be dispatched around the city for displaced city residents whose homes were made uninhabitable by fire or other causes to provide them heat {{in the winter and}} air conditioning in the summer. The interior for 9619 was heavily modified from its revenue service design with three interior roof mounted AC units, modified seating arrangement, tables, a water cooler, microwave, mini-fridge, wall electrical outlets, and a door facing the public-area of the bus prohibiting access from {{going in and out of}} the front door, entrance and exit for the public is only through the rear door. Artscape 2015 was the very first event with very high temperatures that 9619 was deployed to as the official MTA Maryland Comfort Bus and the bus had major problems keeping the interior comfortably air conditioned from the three interior roof mounted AC units that were installed. MTA on July 20, 2015 posted to their Facebook page in a comment to an Artscape 2015 attendee who boarded 9619 and experienced the lack of air conditioning: [...] "We spoke with the HVAC specialists who work on the Comfort Zone Bus and they are aware of and working on the issue. Sorry for the discomfort you experienced. Because the Comfort Zone Bus is a new innovation, sometimes it takes a trial or two to get the bugs worked out. Thanks for letting us know!" ...|$|E

50|$|Double-decker buses may be {{more popular}} with {{passengers}} due to the better view, and to cyclists who {{may be at risk}} due to the unpredictable swing of an <b>articulated</b> <b>bus's</b> tail. <b>Articulated</b> buses normally offer more standing room while double-decker buses may sometimes (not always) offer more seats. Articulated buses have less dwell time because of the extra doors, while double-decker buses offer less chances for fare dodgers since there are fewer or no unmanned doors.|$|R
