40|$|As bio-integrated {{systems that}} link both plants and fish culture, inside <b>aquaponic</b> systems, the {{processes}} of ammonia-oxidizing and nitrification in nitrite and nitrate are essential for growth and development of both fish and plants culture biomass. Plants with nearly the same nutritional requirements during their life cycle, like spinach in our case, are recommended to be grown under <b>aquaponic</b> conditions. Although nitrates concentrations up to 200 – 250 mg/l are reported to be acceptable for fish growth, {{in the last years}} the toxic effect of long term exposure to high nitrate levels on fish and plants cultured biomass were highlighted. The main goal of the present study is to compare the nitrate level of spinach, grown in an <b>aquaponic</b> system, under three plant densities (V 1 - 59 plants/m 2, V 2 - 48 plants/m 2 and V 3 – 39 plants/m 2).

40|$|<b>Aquaponic</b> is a {{combination}} of fish and plant cultivated in recirculating systems. Fish culture in closed recirculating systems causes organic waste accumulation in the system. If these metabolites are used for plant nutrition, they are not mere waste, but have economical value and however benefit the fish production systems. Most <b>aquaponic</b> systems are designed as perlite-filled media, thin layer of nutrient solution, or Raft system. Photosynthesis parameters and water relations are good indexes for recognition of healthy plants and are used as tools for studying physiological conditions of plants. In this experiment, mint plants were cultivated in Raft <b>aquaponic</b> system and perlite medium. In Raft system, plant roots were suspending in water and absorbed water from pot bottom. Whereas in perlite system, roots were in the perlite medium and irrigation water was applied from top of the pots. The plants grown in Raft system showed mineral elements’ deficiency as leaf chlorosis. Photosynthesis and water parameters analysis showed that photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, mezophyll efficiency, water use efficiency and photosynthesis active radiation were higher in the plants grown in perlite than in raft <b>aquaponic</b> system. On the other hand, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature and sub-stomatal CO 2 were higher in the raft <b>aquaponic</b> system than perlite medium. Thus, due to better physiological conditions of mint plants, perlite medium might yield better results compared to raft <b>aquaponic</b> system...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to exploit the {{euryhaline}} nature of commercially attractive species for their cultivation in freshwater <b>aquaponic</b> systems. This approach may increase the profitability of <b>aquaponic</b> production in coastal countries where the consumption of marine fish is traditional and of commercial relevance. For this purpose, juvenile European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were reared in an <b>aquaponic</b> freshwater (AFW) system and an <b>aquaponic</b> saltwater (ASW) system (salinity 20 ppt), in combination with chard (Beta vulgaris var. cicla) seedlings, a salt tolerant plant. At the end of the trial, nitrate and phosphate concentration in water significantly increased in the ASW system, suggesting that the ability of B. vulgaris to absorb these substances was limited by salinity. Total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry revealed that the concentration of some oligoelements such as Fe remained lower with respect to the concentration in the freshwater hydroponic solution, in both AFW and ASW. FTIR-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on plants showed that growth at high salinity affected their lipid content. In the case of fish, freshwater had no effects on mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acid profiles, although saturated fatty acids were significantly decreased in D. labrax reared in AFW.
