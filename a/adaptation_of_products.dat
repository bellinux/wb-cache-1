40|$|Environmental {{concern has}} greatly {{increased}} in magnitude within the companies of Swedish industry. Product development {{has become a}} strategic area: the environmental <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> is fundamental for a decrease in environmental impact from human activities, and product development {{is an area of}} the greatest importance to the competitiveness of companies. Integrating environmental aspects into product development at operations level is needed to achieve product improvements. The theme of this thesis is how to integrate environmental aspects into product development. An overarching purpose has been to identify adequate activities and changes required for integration. Great importance has been attached to conducting changes, especially by investigating how successfully to implement support tools in product development. Qualitative research interviews have been used to collect empirical data. Conclusions on measures industrially applicable to enabling the integration of environmental aspects have been drawn, as empirical data and experiences have been accumulated. Environmental aspects give rise to new considerations in product development: causal relationships between products and environmental impact; the life-cycle approach; and, new priorities and trade-offs between function, cost and quality of products. A need for activities supporting these considerations is identified; and, preferably, several activities, concerning knowledge development, work procedures and support tools, should be applied. It is also important to identify environmental actors for providing expertise and enthusiasm in the organisation. The implementation of support tools has to be carefully considered. To guide such implementation a framework with key factors has been developed. The framework suggests a cyclical implementation process, identification of the organisational change field, and consistent management behaviour. Keys to successful implementation are goal setting, knowledge development, adequate resources, anchoring at all levels, and a focus on individuals. To stay competitive, companies need to be proactive and respond to the driving forces underlying environmental adaptation. To make possible the environmental <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products,</b> several measures are needed. The following proactive measures have been identified: Management ought to set direction with a comprehensive view on business development and physical flows in the business. Commitment to desired change must be created to make sure changes are accepted and durable. Knowledge and skills need to be developed with an action learning approach. Work procedures need to be adjusted to include environmental criteria and secure interaction between product developers and environmental experts. Support tools can support a structured approach and enable rapid progress to be attained.  QC 2010062...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{presents}} {{the model of}} the e-manufacturing environment as the multi-agent system. The e-manufacturing system is a joint, multi-dimensional base gathering all required information and providing fast access to data and various analyses needed for a manufacturing control system in a real time. All operations executed at the level of a manufacturing system are related to the appropriate level of a management system, thus it allows synchronizing actions at these areas. Fluent combination of operations realized at various levels of a company system allows to manufacture products of highest quality/reliability with maximum utilization of production resources and maximum <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> basing on actions and decisions made pursuant to actual information from production plant. Applying the multi-agent systems for enterprise manufacturing control system enables automation of many processes which previously required human intervention, such as the inspection and control processes.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{international}} research activities of multinational corporations {{that are related}} to Germany. It analyzes what role German companies and Germany as a host of foreign companies play in the growing specialization of global exploitation and generation of knowledge. The paper covers application oriented as well as strategic research for two company samples-German and non-German-on the basis of a complex indicator-based analysis (patents and publications) and microdata from business reports. The paper shows that internationalization of research and development (R&D) has increased and broadened in scope. It highlights the strong and growing differences existing between technological and scientific areas as well as between different sectors. Apparently, while the market <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> is still the major driver for German companies, international knowledge seeking has become more and more important, especially in technological areas that are linked very closely to basic research. While Germany as a host of international industrial R&D is much more attractive for applied research (mechanical engineering) than for basic research, the country has still established attractiveness in selected knowledge-intensive technological areas and shows a high intensity of international cooperation. There is a high level of reciprocity in knowledge-intensive areas pointing towards a global specialization and division of labor...|$|E

The relative importance of market-oriented R&D, i. e.

By dissaggregating foreign R&D by types, it was possible to ascertain the effects of a number of organizational variables. Thus the presence of global product divisions was shown to affect negatively the establishment of ‘production support’ units. The existence of product divisions headquartered abroad — taken as an indication of a ‘geocentric’ type of organization — was strongly related to the occurrence of ‘multi-motive’ R&D units, i. e. overseas laboratories that — similar to home country based R&D — perform a wide range of qualified R&D tasks. For the rather large proportion of foreign R&D undertaken in ‘politically motivated’ units, no statistically significant relationships could be established. Here, further research is needed.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{evidence from}} a limited survey undertaken among Norwegian ICT firms in 2001, supplemented with other statistical evidence. Corresponding {{to the limited}} production of ICT hardware in Norway, the hardware firms covered by the survey were dominated by sales outlets of foreign firms. While these firms are on average small and with a modest skill requirement, {{some of them are}} larger and more skill-intensive due to the provision of related software and services. Within-firm learning, higher education as well as sector- and industry-wide knowledge externalities generally matter to IT firms. Education is ranked third, and is more important for software and services than for hardware. Knowledge externalities are less important for foreign-owned firms. 2 / 3 of the firms surveyed produce various combinations of hardware, software and services, with software+services as the most frequent combination, composed by firms that are on average clearly larger than the sample average. Such firms rely more on learning within the firms and less on sectorwide knowledge externalities than other IT firms. <b>Adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> to individual customers is important for many IT goods, and implies that e. g. imported software frequently generates substantial domestic employment in related services.

30|$|With {{the growing}} pace of globalization, MNEs {{innovation}} strategy is also expanding as never before. Generally, firms expand globally {{as a consequence}} of home based ‘ownership advantages’ to be exploited in foreign markets (Kuemmerle, 1999; Patel & Vega, 1999). MNEs usually restrict their R&D activity close to headquarter (Mansfield et al. 1979). However, in the early 1980 ’s they started R&D in offshore locations to augment home base R&D capabilities. Major reason for dispersion of R&D activities was to secure new technological competencies distributed globally. Many R&D units are now working beyond the <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> developed in home to local market. Many firms are acquiring new knowledge from the local environment for the parent unit at home (Zander, 1999; Pearce & Papanastassiou, 1999; Niosi, 1999; Zedtwitz & Gassmann, 2002). However, offshoring R&D by MNEs were restricted mainly in triad region (US, Western Europe, and Japan). In recent years new mode of organizing MNEs innovative activities are gradually emerging. MNEs around the globe are now eager to exploit developing countries’ markets particularly the two emerging Asian major; China and India (Mrinalini & Wakdikar, 2008; Bruche, 2009; Krishna et al. 2012; Patra, 2014). Simultaneously, government of both these countries are creating conducive environment for MNEs with attractive policies like tax breaks, knowledge parks, and multiple knowledge hubs in major cities in the form of world class educational institutes. Policy and decision makers in these countries realized that communication among government, university and industry is the key to innovation and sustainable growth.|$|E
40|$|Innovation is best {{understood}} broadly, to include anything {{new in the}} way a firm operates, in the goods or services it produces, in the processes it uses to do so or in the way it organises to provide its services or produce or distribute its goods. This breadth makes the precise measurement of innovation elusive. While the measurement of the narrower concept of research and development (R&D) is subject to some international standardisation, there are differences in interpretation. Also, the level of R&D outputs such as patents from a firm {{may not be the best}} indicator of the significance of R&D’s addition to knowledge or the dynamic capability of a firm. This paper attempts to examine innovation by including the introduction, adoption and <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products,</b> processes and ways of organising and marketing that are new to the firm. While some of this may result from expenditure on R&D, innovation is not necessarily related to R&D. Though it is difficult to measure, a great deal of effort has been expended in recent years in attempting to estimate the extent to which innovation takes place, and in comparing innovation in different countries and different sectors. The main aim of this paper is to use existing sources to begin the study of Ireland’s system of innovation, from an evolutionary perspective. The argument of the paper is that, if we distinguish between R&D-based innovation and non-R&D-based innovation, there is some evidence that Ireland is more effective at the latter than the former.

It is observed that one of the fundamental challenges facing the multinational enterprise in the contemporary world is the decision to standardize marketing programs and practices or to tailor them according to the local conditions of the host country. A vigorous comparative methodology of matched samples at the level of statistical analysis was utilized for the study. Japanese, South Korean and Indian MNEs in Nigeria affiliates were matched on the basis of product mix, industry age, size, market served and other environmental variables to obtain certain conditions. The sample size consisted of 121 firms of Asian MNEs in Nigeria vis-a-vis 41 Japanese, 44 Indian and 36 South Korean affiliates in Nigeria. The sample was {{selected on the basis of}} products, market served and other environmental variables. The study therefore examines the marketing integration strategies in low risk environment of western Europe and USA, moderate risk environment such as south Korea, Japan and other emerging industrialized countries in Asia and high risk environment such as Nigeria and other developing countries in Africa and Latin America. The result of the study shows that the integration of product decision is uniform in the three market environments while that of price is less uniform and less high.
