50|$|Economic {{development}} in Mumbai brought a growth in population caused mainly by {{the migration of}} laborers from {{other regions of the}} country. The number of residents in the city increased more than twelve times in the last century. Greater Mumbai, formed by City Island and Salsette Island, is the largest city in India with a population of 16.4 million, according to data collected by the census of 2001. Mumbai is one of the densest cities in the world, 48,215 persons per km² and 16,082 per km² in suburban areas. In this scenario, urban agriculture seems unlikely to be put into practice since it must compete with real estate developers for the access and use of vacant lots. <b>Alternative</b> <b>farming</b> methods have emerged as a response to scarcity of land, water, and economic resources employed in UPA.|$|E
50|$|A different, {{possibly}} viable, solution {{has also}} been proposed: sustainable agriculture. The concept of sustainable agriculture {{is one that is}} not fully understood throughout the world and has many definitions. These can range from the idea of producing strictly organic crops to instituting fertilizing practices which better the environment rather than deplete it. However, the overarching concept of this new farming method implies shifting modern conventional agriculture away from focusing so much on generating capital. The desire for economic success is important, yet the heavy use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in raising crops and livestock is not eco-friendly. However, there are several concerns raised with this approach. First, some farmers argue that as the world population continues to increase, sustainable agriculture {{will not be able to}} support the necessary amount of food production. Conventional farming’s heavy reliance on chemicals is believed to produce a much higher overall output than <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> methods. On the opposing side, supporters of agricultural sustainability argue that sustainable yields have the potential to exceed those of conventional agriculture. The crops produced would be less exposed to chemical toxins and better able to feed the human population.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} provide {{valuable}} {{information about the}} realities of the Queen pineapple (QP) farmers in Camarines Norte, highlighting their farming practices and worldview about sustainable development. Most of the respondents are owner-operator having a mean farm size of 1. 33 hectares devoted to queen pineapple farming and crop diversification with two to seven crops combined to augment income. Cropping pattern employed by most of the respondents is multiple cropping, specifically intercropping, rotational cropping, and fallowing. Soil nutrient and weed management of most respondents is conventional: inorganic fertilizers and chemical based, respectively. However, pest control management by most of the respondents is of the alternative method. Overall, QP farmer respondents were found to be practicing <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> methods. The problems cited by the respondents were mainly production, marketing and communication-related. The respondents showed that they have moved towards <b>alternative</b> <b>farming.</b> However, more attention should be given to soil nutrient and weed management practices.

40|$|Reconfiguration {{of farming}} systems to reach various {{productive}} and environmental objectives while meeting farm and policy constraints {{is complicated by}} the large array of farm components involved, and the multitude of interrelations among these components. This hampers the evaluation of relations between various farm performance indicators and of consequences of adjustments in farm management. Here we present the FarmDESIGN model, which has been developed to overcome these limitations by coupling a bio-economical farm model that evaluates the productive, economic and environmental farm performance, to a multi-objective optimization algorithm that generates a large set of Pareto-optimal <b>alternative</b> <b>farm</b> configurations. The model was implemented for a 96 ha mixed organic farm in the Netherlands that represents an example with relevant complexity, comprising various crop rotations, permanent grasslands and dairy cattle. Inputs were derived from a number of talks with the farmers and from literature. After design-, output- and end-user validation the optimization module of the model was used to explore consequences of reconfiguration. The optimization aimed to maximize the operating profit and organic matter balance, and to minimize the labor requirement and soil nitrogen losses. The model outcomes showed that trade-offs existed among various objectives, {{and at the same time}} identified a collection of <b>alternative</b> <b>farm</b> configurations that performed better for all four objectives when compared to the original farm. Relatively small modifications in the farm configuration resulted in considerable improvement of farm performance.
