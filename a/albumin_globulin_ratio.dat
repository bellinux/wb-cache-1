40|$|Determination of serum {{total protein}} {{concentration}} and main fractions (albumin and globulin) {{can be used as}} an important diagnostic tool in clinical biochemistry. Several factors can affect the concentration of total protein, albumin, globulin and <b>albumin</b> <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> (A/G). The aim {{of this study is to}} obtain serum protein profiles, albumin, globulin and A/G ratio based on breed, age and BCS (body condition score). Blood samples from 160 bulls were collected.

They were classified into the four groups, N (<b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> was normal), L (hemoglobin was within normal limits, but <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> was subnormal), Z (both hemoglobin and <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> were in subnormal range, whereas serum protein was maintained normal) and F (hemoglobin, serum protein and slbumin to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> were all below the lower limit of normal range) to be compared with the impairment in general condition which was graded as slight, moderate and severe, and the following conclusions were arrived at:-(1) Groups N, L, Z and F approximetely correspond to the healthy or slightly ill, the slightly or moderately ill, the moderately or severely ill, and the severetly ill conditions, respectively. (2) Each of the four groups contained various patterns (a type and its subtypes) which nearly equivalent in clinical implication, but thtere were a few exception: patterns subtype N. and subtype L. equaled the groups L and group N, respectively, as an indicstor of general condition. (3) In interperting the grade od impaurment in the general condition from the pattern of connecting line, a careful consideration must be paid to the degree of deviation of each constituent (hemoglobin, serum protein or <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio)</b> from its normal rage, construing larger deviation as being related to a more seriously impaired conditiono and vice versa: Contingency coefficient of 0. 45 and the rate of hit of 70 per cent were obtained in this way between the connecting line and The clinically assessed general conditions. (4) The rate of hit varied to a certain extent with the difference in the kind of diseases: it was satisfactorily high in the diseases of the liver and biliary tract, the lungs and, the blood and hematopoietic organs, especially in hepatitis, hepatic cancer, cancer of the biliary tract, and pulmonary tuberculosis, although it was relatively low in the diseases of the pancreas and the thyroid gland {{as well as in the}} paitients belonging to psychiatry, neurology and otolaryngokogy. Gastroduodenal ulcer, hypertension, entercolitis (including dysentery), cancer of the breast and diabetes mellitus were generally diagnosed by the blood spectrum as the more favorable than by the purely clinical examination; but liver cirrhosis, gastroduodenitis, thoracic empyema, peritonitis, uterine cancer, nephrosis, uremia, and pancreatic cancer were, on the contrary, showed a tendency to be judged as the severer than clinically.

However, it is not beyond criticism, particularly regarding the slight ailment. The assured fact that the group N, instead of L, connecting line was associated with a considerable number of moderately ill paitients, is an example.

40|$|Liver {{function}} and protein metabolism {{are among the}} important factors that have bearing on the selection of cases and the prospects of their recovery in the postoperative period in. the surgical treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. In the pre- and post-operative periods of 67 cases which underwent pneumonorrhaphy with extrapleural pneumonolysis, the author examined not only various functions of the liver {{as well as the}} blood protein levels (total protein level, <b>albumin</b> <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> and fibrinogen level in blood), but also the erythrocyte sedimentation rates and tuberculin reactions {{in order to determine the}} relationship between these values and the post-operative conditions, especially the type of hemothorax that occurs as a postoperative complication. The findings of the investigations are summarized as follows: 1) How the liver will function, what type of hemothorax will ensue and how soon an improvement in these conditions will occur in the postoperative period depended to a considerable extent on the degree of functional disorder of the liver observed in the pre-operative period. 2) The total protein level and <b>albumin</b> <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> more or less paralleled the worsening and improvement in the functions of the liver. 3) In the change in fibrinogen level in blood occurring in the post-operative period, the cases under investigation have been divided into three types. And the type that manifested lowering was found among those that had shown high degree of functional disorder of the liver. The erythrocyte sedimentation rates, furthermore, paralleled these symptoms. 4) The amount of blood lost in operation and the degree of pleural adhesions influenced to a considerable extent the functions of the liver in the postoperative period. 5) A change in the tuberculin reactions can be used as index of the functional disorder of the liver. As the method used by the author for examining the functions of the liver is not 1 only simple but is supposed to have close relations with the protein metabolism, having, in addition, significant relations withsuch routine methods of examination as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and tuberculin reaction, its adoption would no doubt contribute toward developing better selection of the cases for surgery and forecasting their improvement and recovery in the post-opeative period...|$|E
40|$|Present {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find out the relationship between serum biochemical profile and postpartum metritis. Mainly serum glucose, total protein, albumin, <b>albumin</b> <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio,</b> blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and calcium were studied. Colorimetric method was used for quantitative estimation of biochemical profile. Twenty seven animals with recent history of calving and subsequent metritis were included in the study.

Although hypercortisolemia may affect protein metabolism directly or indirectly, data regarding alterations of levels of serum protein in a large series of patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) have been lacking. We have now evaluated, retrospectively, the levels of circulating serum <b>albumin,</b> <b>globulins,</b> total proteins, and the <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> in 99 patients with endogenous CS before, immediately after, and 3, 6, and 12 months following successful treatment. Subjects with concomitant infections or other chronic diseases {{were excluded from the}} analysis. Although mean serum albumin and total protein levels were within the normal reference ranges, in general, they gradually increased after treatment with maximal values being reached at 12 months after normalization of hypercortisolemia (P < 0. 0001 for both); there were no significant changes in serum globulin levels or in the <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio.</b> Patients with CS as a whole showed a weak but significant negative correlation between serum albumin and 0900 h cortisol level (r = - 0. 303; P = 0. 0035). In conclusion, our data suggest that CS is associated with a small but significant reduction in circulating serum protein levels, which are restored following treatment of hypercortisolemia, although these changes occur within the reference range. Thus, extreme alterations in serum total protein or albumin levels in patients with CS should alert physicians to the presence of concomitant pathology, and additional specific investigation should be undertaken to elucidate the cause...|$|R

As part of a reintroduction program, captive-bred brush-tailed rock-wallabies (BTRWs) (Petrogale penicillata) were hardened-off {{for at least three}} months before release into the Grampians National Park, western Victoria. A total of 41 animals were involved in the project, with the 24 selected for hardening-off aged between 1. 1 and 4. 3 years. In all, 21 animals have been released, with data from 11 collected from all sites (captive, hardening-off and reintroduced). At each site animals were periodically trapped, anaesthetised, physically examined, weighed, and blood sampled for haematological and biochemical data over three calendar years. All reintroduced animals were radio-collared. This study presents data across sites (167 samples), two seasons (winter/spring, 95 samples; summer/autumn, 72 samples), two different age groups (juveniles 1. 25 years) and both sexes. Seventy percent of released BTRWs and 90 % of sympatric macropodids were positive for macropod herpes virus; none of three BTRWs tested for toxoplasmosis was positive. Faeces were collected opportunistically for flotation and ectoparasites were collected and identified. While physical examinations with anaesthesia were safe and eliminated some animals from being released, they failed to detect all cases of oral cavity disease. A reference range of haematological and biochemical parameters have been established for this evolutionarily significant unit of BTRW. Lymphocyte/neutrophil ratios of released animals suggested that the main acute stressor is a handling phenomenon but the oxidative stress index suggested that animals were coping with their environment. Significant site differences were noted for several variables including red cell mass (red cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit), white cell count, lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio, <b>albumin</b> <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio,</b> creatinine, urate, ascorbic acid, a-tocopherol, retinol, cholinesterase, total carotenoids and oxidative stress index. Significant seasonal differences were noted for some variables, including red cell mass, ascorbic acid, <b>albumin</b> <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio,</b> cholinesterase, total carotenoids and retinol. Significant age differences were noted for red cell mass, albumin and dietary antioxidants. The only sex-related difference related to higher retinol levels in females. Those parameters related to diet, e. g. albumin, retinol, a-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, and total carotenoids were consistent with those found in other rock-wallabies. David J. Schultz, Brian G.

Limited supply and seasonal availability of groundnut cake (GNC) result in high price, {{on the other}} hand sunflower cake (SFC) and karanj seed cake (KSC) are cheaper protein sources and could be used as ruminants feed supplements. A study was undertaken in lambs to study the effect of haematobiochemical and pathological changes by incorporating two alternate protein supplements viz., karanj seed cake and sunflower cake as sole protein source in complete diets. Twenty one Nellore Brown lambs (9 - 10 months) of uniform body weight (27. 62 kg + 1. 026) were randomly divided into 3 groups with 7 lambs in each treatment and fed the respective diets for an experimental period of 150 days.

40|$|Objective Purpose was to {{determine}} the effects of grazing system and floor type on concentrations of blood metabolites, activity of creatine kinase, body weight and carcass characteristics of castrated Nguni goats. Methods Forty eight, 7 month old goats were randomly allocated to herding and tethering treatments from 0800 to 1300 hours and accommodated on slatted and earth floors daily. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture every fifteenth day for metabolite analysis. Slaughter was done at a commercial abattoir following 5 months of monitoring. Results Tethered goats had significantly higher concentrations of urea (5. 19 mmol/L) (p< 0. 001), creatinine (55. 87 μmol/L) (p< 0. 05), total protein (64. 60 g/L) (p< 0. 01), and globulin (49. 79 g/L) (p< 0. 001), whereas herded goats had higher glucose (3. 38 mmol/L) (p< 0. 001), albumin (15. 33 g/L) (p< 0. 05), albumin/globulin ratio (0. 34) (p< 0. 01), and body weight (24. 87 kg) (p< 0. 001). Slatted floors caused higher (p< 0. 01) albumin at 15. 37 g/L. The interaction of grazing system and floor type affected creatinine, total protein, globulin at (p< 0. 01) and albumen/globulin ratio at (p< 0. 01). The least creatinine concentration and albumin/globulin ratio was in herded and tethered goats that were accommodated on earth floors, respectively. The highest total protein and globulin concentrations were in serum of tethered goats that were accommodated on earth floors. The highest (p< 0. 05) dressing percentage (45. 26 %) was in herded goats accommodated on slatted floors.

MTX can cause unpredictable serious hepato-renal side effects. Sylimarin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, membrane stabilizing effect,stimulate tissue regeneration and inhibit deposition of collagen fibers. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of Sylimarin on MTX induced hepato-nephrotoxicity in children with ALL. Patients and Methods:  80 children with newly diagnosed ALL were included in the study. They were divided randomly into: Group I that included 40 children with ALL with their ages ranging from 4 - 13 years and mean age of 6. 85 ± 2. 89 years who received Sylimarin 420 mg/day in 3 divided doses for one week after each MTX dose and Group II that included 40 children with ALL with their ages ranging from 4 - 12 years and mean age value of 7. 30 ± 2. 6 years who received placebo for one week after MTX therapy.

40|$|In nephrosclerosis (Volhard and Fahr {{classification}} of nephritis) {{there was no}} decrease in the plasma proteins. With heart failure the <b>ratio</b> of <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> fell from the normal 1. 7 ± 0. 3 to about 1. There is a sharp {{difference between the two}} types of glomerulonephritis in the effect on plasma proteins. In the vascular-interstitial type the effect was the same as in nephrosclerosis. There was no decrease in the plasma proteins until shortly before death. In the glomerulotubular or nephrotic type, active or recently active, the total plasma proteins were less than 5 gm. per 100 cc. This decrease from the normal 5. 5 to 7. 5 occurred whether edema was present or absent. The decrease affected chiefly the <b>albumin,</b> the <b>globulin</b> being usually diminished but little, and sometimes slightly increased. Consequently the <b>ratio</b> of <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> was reduced to less than 1, and occasionally to 0. 6. In nephrosis similar changes were found in the total protein concentration but in severe cases the decrease in albumin was greater than in nephrotic glomerulonephritis while the globulin was either very slightly reduced or was increased. The <b>albumin</b> : <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> was therefore lower than in nephrotic glomerulonephritis, ranging down to 0. 26. With the disappearance of edema there was usually an increase in the plasma protein concentration, but this was not invariable, and concentrations of 4. 5 per cent or less were compatible with the persistent absence of edema. The <b>ratio</b> of <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> showed an irregular tendency to rise. Whenever the total concentration was less than 4 per cent there was some edema present, but it was sometimes slight in amount. With recovery in acute cases, and remission with decrease of proteinuria in chronic cases, normal concentrations were regained. The <b>albumin</b> : <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> remained low in some instances for a longer period on account of an absolute increase in globulin concentration. In "functional proteinuria" no change in plasma proteins was found. Low plasma protein concentrations were always associated with considerable losses of protein in the urine, but these losses did not provide an explanation for all our observations.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{excellence}} of modern broiler production {{is based on}} the genetic improvement of broiler strains for high growth rate and high egg production, associated with technological developments in nutrition, management, and health. Over the last decades, the clinical biochemistry of broilers has been studied to determine serum biochemical component values; however, there are still many knowledge gaps on factors that determine changes in these values. In this study, the serum lipid and protein profiles of 4 -week-old male and female Cobb broiler breeders were evaluated. Blood samples were collected on a commercial farm located in the city of Uberlândia, MG, Brazil. The following parameters were evaluated: total protein, <b>albumin,</b> <b>globulin,</b> <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> (A/V), uric acid, urea, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels using an automatic analyzer. The results showed sex-specific biochemical patterns for most blood parameters evaluated.

40|$|With the {{planimeter}} {{the author}} measured {{the area of}} splenic dullness in normal persons, patients with infectious hepatitis. liver cirrhosis, cholcystopathia, mechanical jaundice, endocarditis lenta and several patients with other diseases, and obtained the following results. 1. The expansion of area in the spleen can be recognized in 93 per cent of acute hepatitis and in 62. 2 per cent of chronic hepatitis. Moreover, splenomegaly is marked at the initial stage of the acute case, {{and in most cases}} it disappears within about 50 days. In the chronic hepatitis generally splenomegaly disappears in about 60 days, but in some it persists for a relatively long period of time with poor prognosis. 2. Since in infectious hepatitis the low palpability and highly expanded area of dullness are the evidences of splenomegaly, an emphasis need be placed on the importance of measuring area of splenic dullness in diagnosing this disease. 3. In infectious hepatitis the swelling of the liver has a considerable correlation with the swelling of the spleen, and moreover, the greater the swelling of the liver, the correlation can be said to be that much closer. However, even in the case where the liver is unpalpable, the swelling of the spleen can be quite great, and therefore, it seems difficult to decide at once the mutual realtionship between the two. 4. As for the relationship between the area of the spleen and the liver functions examined in infectious hepatitis correlation in not necessarily clear from the relationship between the spleen and the findings of Takata reaction as the serum colloid reaction, serum proteins, especially the albumin content, <b>albumin</b> <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio,</b> serum bilirubin titer and the degree of bilirubinuria and urobilinogenuria, but in the results of synthetic judgment and observations carried out in the course of disease a relatively parallel relationship can be recognized. 5. That in diseases other than infectious hepatitis such as in liver cirrhosis and hemolytic jaundice, a marked splenomegaly can be recognized, and in hepatoma, cholecystopathia, and mechanical jaundice with exception of a few cases no splenomegaly can be observed offers an important clue for the differential diagnosis of these diseases. Moreover, in endocarditis lenta and Basedow's disease likewise splenomegaly can be recognized though it seems natural from the cause of disease, this is important for diagnosis in the consideration of other symptoms. Splenomegaly can not be observed in gastric ulcer, lung tuberculosis, nephritis, polyneutritis and diabetes mellitus...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Tarragon (Artemisia {{dracunculus}} L.) is a plant, {{which has}} nutritional and therapeutic uses for years. In traditional medicine, this plant {{has been used}} for relief of indigestion, detoxification of the body, treatment of insomnia, improvement of liver function, and antibacterial properties. As blood plasma proteins have important role in maintaining the body homeostasis, this study was performed to determine the effect of hydroalcoholic extract of tarragon on the levels of serum proteins in mice. Methods: In this experimental research, 40 mature male mice (weight, 30 ± 5 g) were used. The animals were divided into five groups od 8 each: Group 1, control; group 2, placebo; and groups 3, 4, and 5 intraperitoneally received the plant extract at doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg bw for 20 days. At the end, blood samples were collected, and serum protein levels, such as <b>albumin,</b> alpha- 1 <b>globulin,</b> alpha- 2 globulin, beta globulin, gamma globulin, total protein, and <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio,</b> were measured. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Duncan statistical tests at the significance level of p≤ 0. 05. Results: The albumin concentration at dose of 200 mg/kg, beta globulin at doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg doses, gamma globulin at dose of 50 mg/kg, total protein at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg, had significant decrease compared to the control group (p≤ 0. 05). The <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> showed a significant increase at the dose of 50 and 100 mg/kg and a significant decrease at the dose of 200 mg/kg compared to the control group (p≤ 0. 05).

40|$|Neuropathic {{urinary bladder}} is often colonised by multidrug-resistant bacteria. We report a 64 -year-old male {{spinal cord injury}} patient with paraplegia, who {{received}} gentamicin on empirical basis before undergoing suprapubic cystostomy, as antibiotic sensitivity report of urine was not available. This patient developed fulminate septicaemia. Although appropriate antibiotic therapy (meropenem) was started when this patient manifested features of sepsis, acute renal failure occurred and he expired. Inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy was the major contributory factor for this patient's mortality. Learning points from this case are (1) never do a cystostomy without prior urine culture and appropriate antibiogram; (2) in a chronic spinal cord injury patient, full blood count, liver function tests, albumin level, and <b>albumin</b> to <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio</b> should be performed before any surgical procedure...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To study, {{the effect}} of a homoeopathic {{medicine}} Crotalus horridus 200 C on ehrlichiosis in dogs in an endemic area of Aizawl district of Mizoram state of India. Materials and Methods: To evaluate the efficacy of Crotalus horridus 200 C against ehrlichiosis dogs. 12 positive cases confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were divided into two groups comprising six dogs in each group. One group was treated with standard therapy (doxycycline) and other group was treated with Crotalus horridus 200 C at 4 pills orally for 20 days. Clinical improvement of affected dogs was recorded after therapy. Important haemato-biochemical parameters before and after therapy such as haemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC), total leukocyte count (TLC), differential leukocyte count (DLC), platelet count, total protein, <b>albumin,</b> <b>globulin,</b> A:G <b>ratio,</b> total bilirubin, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and liver-specific enzymes namely alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed following standard protocol. All the parameters were compared with a control healthy group (T 3). All experiment dogs were from different age with different breeds and bloods were collected at forenoon only. Results: PCR test yielded 13 dogs positive out of 67 suspected samples screened (19. 40 %) with an amplification of 387 bp fragment from 16 S rRNA gene of E. Canis. Off total positive, only 8 (61. 53 %) could be detected in peripheral blood smear. Crotalus horridus-treated group of dogs showed clinical recovery from fever and temperature to normalcy by the 14 th day posttreatment. Haemato-biochemical profiles of affected dogs such as Hb, PCV, TEC, TLC, DLC, platelet count, total protein, <b>albumin,</b> <b>globulin,</b> A:G <b>ratio,</b> total bilirubin, serum creatinine, BUN, and liver-specific enzymes namely ALT and ALP were turned to normalcy within 21 days of post-treatment. Conclusion: Nested PCR assay had been shown to be sensitive and specific for detection of Ehrlichia canis.

40|$|Pre- and {{post-prandial}} serum conjugates of {{cholic acid}} (SCCA) were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in 83 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), 14 of whom {{did not have}} steatorrhoea, and in 25 controls. Of the CF patients with steatorrhoea, 38 % had fasting SCCA levels greater than 3 standard deviations above mean fasting control values, whereas no CF patient without steatorrhoea had elevated fasting SCCA levels. Steatorrhoeic patients with palpable livers had higher pre- and post-prandial SCCA levels. Post-prandial SCCA levels failed to discriminate between control and CF groups however. Other serum tests of liver function, including the aspartate amino transferase, alkaline phosphatase, <b>albumin,</b> gamma <b>globulin,</b> and <b>albumin</b> : <b>globulin</b> <b>ratio,</b> failed to correlate with the SCCA. Changes in serum protein constituents correlated strongly with pulmonary dysfunction. The results suggest that elevation of fasting SCCA levels in CF patients is a more sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction than other tests and is a better discriminator than post-prandial SCCA levels between normal and abnormal liver function. The test is recommended for early detection of liver dysfunction in CF patients...|$|R
