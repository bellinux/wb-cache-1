40|$|The lung is {{a highly}} {{branched}} tree-like tubular system that results from more than 20 generations of the conducting airways and consists of 300 million alveoli for gas exchange. Airway branches form via branching morphogenesis and then mature into conducting airways, in which the number and distribution of different cell types need to be precisely controlled. The conducting airways contain four lung cell types: club cells, ciliated cells, basal cells, and neuroendocrine cells. SOX 2 is a well-known conducting <b>airway</b> <b>marker.</b> SOX 2 is a transcription factor that {{is known to be}} important in embryonic development and induction of pluripotent stem cells. We hypothesized that SOX 2 controls cell differentiation in the conducting airways. To determine the role of SOX 2 in the conducting airways, we used various mouse models to determine if SOX 2 controls cell differentiation. SOX 2 was deleted in the lung epithelium by using Sox 2 EGFP/CKO and ShhCre/+. We observed a decrease in club cell, basal cell, and neuroendocrine cell differentiation when Sox 2 is absent in the conducting airways. SOX 2 overexpression was done by using Rosa 26 R-lox-stop-loxSox 2 (Gt(Rosa) 26 Sortm 1 /Sox 2 /blh) in the lung epithelium, Sox 9 distal progenitor cells, alveolar type 1 cells, and alveolar type 2 cells. We found that SOX 2 expression in the alveoli region reprograms alveoli cells into conducting airway cells. Mutant alveolar type 1 and type 2 cells expressing SOX 2 are able to generate basal –like cells. Further, through microarray analysis we found SOX 21, a transcription factor, significantly down regulated in the absence of Sox 2. Sox 21 has a unique expression pattern in the conducting airways. The expression of SOX 21 is uniform in the proximal airways and sporadic in the distal airways. Together, these data suggest SOX 2 controls cell differentiation in the conducting airways. Our data regarding how Sox 2 controls airway cell differentiation in the mouse lung gives insight regarding direct differentiation from an immature cell to a specialize cell...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Background: The {{relationship}} between lower <b>airway</b> <b>markers</b> of inflammation and infection with physiologic findings is poorly understood {{in young children}} with cystic fibrosis (CF). The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the association of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) markers of infection and inflammation, including mediators linked to airway remodeling, to infant lung function values in young children with CF undergoing clinically indicated bronchoscopy. Methods: Plethysmography and the raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RVRTC) technique were performed in 16 sedated infants and young children with CF prior to bronchoscopy. BALF was collected and analyzed for pathogen density, cell count, % neutrophils, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-b 1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8). Results: There was a significant direct correlation between functional residual capacity (FRC), the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC) and FRC/TLC with % neutrophils (P< 0. 05). Forced expiratory flows were inversely correlated to % neutrophils (P< 0. 01). Lung function parameters did not differentiate those with and without lower airway infection; however, pathogen density directly correlated with FRC and inversely correlated with flows (P< 0. 05). In a subset of the population, MMP- 2 directly correlated with RV/TLC and inversely correlated with flows (P< 0. 05) and TGF-b 1 directly correlated with FRC (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that lower airway inflammation as well as mediators linked to airway remodeling play an active role in pulmonary deterioration in CF infants and young children undergoing clinically indicated bronchoscopy.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Airway {{inflammation}} is a {{key feature}} of asthma. Currently, airway inflammation can be detected through both invasive and non- invasive methods. Non invasive methods are safe, feasible and a potentially useful way to assess <b>airway</b> inflammatory <b>markers</b> in both healthy children and children with asthma. In this thesis, a variety of non-invasive markers (induced sputum, exhaled nitric oxide, and exhaled breath condensate) was used to investigate childhood asthma. The aim of the first study was to compare and contrast the different <b>airway</b> <b>markers</b> between healthy children and children with asthma. The second study described the different airway inflammatory phenotypes in children with asthma, and examined clinical predictors of these phenotypes; whereas the third study investigated the effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure on airway inflammation in childhood asthma. The final study assessed the knowledge and attitudes of {{parents of children with}} asthma towards passive smoking. The studies used both cross- sectional and longitudinal designs. Children with stable asthma aged between 7 - 17 years underwent clinical assessment, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), exhaled breath condensate and sputum induction. Urinary cotinine was assayed to assess tobacco smoke exposure. These studies have found that children with asthma show differences in both clinical pattern and pathological pattern compared to healthy children. These differences were apparent with elevated FeNO and sputum eosinophils. In children with asthma, there was heterogeneity of airway inflammation. There were 2 stable inflammatory patterns: eosinophilic asthma and paucigranulocytic asthma. Unlike adult asthma, these phenotypes have different clinical features, which may facilitate detection of the phenotypes in clinical practice. ETS exposure in children with asthma was common and associated with a non- eosinophilic pattern of airway inflammation. In children who had a change in ETS exposure, sputum eosinophils were decreased whereas sputum neutrophils were increased during ETS exposure compared to a non- ETS exposure period. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels were decreased after exposure to ETS compared to those at the time of non- ETS exposure. The severity of asthma was increased in children living with parents who smoked. As a result, parents of children with asthma, especially smoking parents should be more aware about the harmful effects of smoking on their children’s health and themselves. Health risk awareness about tobacco smoke helps parental smokers alter their smoking behavior as well as protecting children from ETS exposure. In conclusion, the important findings of this thesis are the description of the inflammatory phenotypes in childhood asthma, the identification of clinical predictors of these phenotypes and the determination of the effects of ETS exposure on airway inflammatory patterns in childhood asthma. These results should facilitate understanding and management of childhood asthma and prompt treatment studies based on <b>markers</b> of <b>airway</b> inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Between-visit {{variability}} of small <b>airway</b> obstruction <b>markers</b> {{in patients with}} asthma To the Editor: Clinical trials in patients with airway diseases often use forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) as the sole physiological outcome measure. However, FEV 1 {{is thought to be}} insensitive to obstruction of the smaller airways, which may be particularly relevant in asthma [1]. Putative <b>markers</b> of small <b>airway</b> obstruction include measures of airway resistance using impulse oscillometry (IOS) [2] and indices of ventilation heterogeneity derived from multiple-breath inert gas washout (MBW) [3]. We recently showed that increased airway resistance at 5 Hz (R 5) and 20 Hz (R 20) is associated with worse asthma control and more frequent exacerbations [4], and FARAH et al. [5] demonstrated that MBW parameters may be responsive to asthma therapy. In order to conduct clinical trials using these alternative outcome measures, it is necessary to be assured of their repeatability and stability over time. Moreover, an estimate of between-visit variability in the stable state is required so that sample size calculations can be performed. We therefore aimed to determine th...|$|R

An understanding of the relationship between airway bacterial presence and dominance in severe asthma may help direct alternative treatment approaches. Objective:We aimed to use a culture independent analysis strategy to describe the presence, dominance and abundance of bacterial taxa in induced sputum from treatment resistant severe asthmatics and correlate findings with clinical characteristics and <b>airway</b> inflammatory <b>markers.</b> Methods: Induced sputum was obtained from 28 stable treatment-resistant severe asthmatics.

We found that expressing high levels of ELF 5 during early lung development disrupted branching morphogenesis and produced a dilated epithelium. The effects of ELF 5 on morphogenesis were stage-dependent, since inducing the transgene on E 16. 5 had no effect on branching. ELF 5 reduced expression of the distal lung epithelial differentiation markers Erm, Napsa and Sftpc, and type II cell ultrastructural differentiation was immature.

We have studied the relationship between baseline dyspnoea perception and inflammatory markers in sputum in eight patients with mild asthma and in 13 patients with moderate to severe asthma. The perception of dyspnoea was scored on the Borg scale. Eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) was measured by fluoroimmunoassay and by an interleukin (IL) - 5 sandwich ELlSA. The baseline Borg score was significantly higher in patients with severe asthma than in patients with mild to moderate asthma (4 · 1 ± 0 · 29 vs. 2 · 28 ± 0 · 28, P< 0 · 05). The proportion of eosinophil and ECP levels in the sputum were significantly higher in patients with moderate to severe asthma.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{previously}} {{identified a}} MUC 5 B gene promoter-variant {{that is a}} risk allele for sporadic and familial Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (IPF/UIP). This allele was strongly associated with increased MUC 5 B gene expression in lung tissue from unaffected subjects. Despite the strong association of this <b>airway</b> epithelial <b>marker</b> with disease, little is known of mucin expressing structures or of airway involvement in IPF/UIP. METHODS: Immunofluorescence was used to subtype mucus cells according to MUC 5 B and MUC 5 AC expression and to identify ciliated, basal, and alveolar type II (ATII) cells in tissue sections from control and IPF/UIP subjects. Staining patterns were quantified for distal airways (Control and IPF/UIP) and in honeycomb cysts (HC). RESULTS: MUC 5 B-expressing cells (EC) were detected {{in the majority of}} control distal airways. MUC 5 AC-EC were identified in half of these airways and only in airways that contained MUC 5 B-EC. The frequency of MUC 5 B+ and MUC 5 AC+ distal airways was increased in IPF/UIP subjects. MUC 5 B-EC were the dominant mucus cell type in the HC epithelium. The distal airway epithelium from control and IPF/UIP subjects and HC was populated by basal and ciliated cells. Most honeycombing regions were distinct from ATII hyperplasic regions. ATII cells were undetectable in the overwhelming majority of HC. CONCLUSIONS: The distal airway contains a pseudostratified mucocilary epithelium that is defined by basal epithelial cells and mucus cells that express MUC 5 B predominantly.

Serum elastase was positively correlated with serum a- 1 AT (group 1, r = 0. 81, P < 0. 002 and group 2, r = 0. 83, P < 0. 17) and negatively correlated with FEV 1 (r = - 0. 85, P < 0. 03 and - 0. 14, P < 0. 85, respectively). The results indicate the presence of chronic and persistent pulmonary inflammation in stable patients with COPD. Induced sputum permitted the demonstration of the existence of a subpopulation of cells in which neutrophils predominated.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundHypoxia and snoring-related {{mechanical}} trauma contribute to airway inflammation in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Increased exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), an <b>airway</b> inflammation <b>marker,</b> {{has been reported}} in OSA patients. We propose the measure of NO in the oral cavity (oNO) as marker of oropharyngeal inflammation in OSA. MethodsWe compared oNO and FENO of 39 OSA patients with those of 26 mild asthmatics (ASTHMA), 15 patients with chronic rhinitis or rhinosinusitis (CRS) and 24 healthy subjects. A special device was used for oNO measurement. Apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index, mean and nadir SaO 2 were calculated from the polysomnography. ResultsoNO was significantly increased in OSA (104. 2 95 %CI 80. 2 – 135. 5 ppb) as compared to ASTHMA (71. 9 95 %CI 56. 3 – 91. 9 ppb; p= 0. 015), CRS (54. 4 95 %CI 40. 2 – 73. 7 ppb; p= 0. 009) and healthy subjects (63. 6 95 %CI 59 – 73 ppb; p< 0. 001). oNO was directly related to AHI (r= 0. 466, p= 0. 003) and to minutes slept with SaO 2 < 90 % (r= 0. 471, p= 0. 011) and it was inversely related to nadirSaO 2 (r=− 0. 393, p= 0. 018). FENO was highest in asthmatics (40. 3 95 %CI 32. 5 – 50. 1 ppb) and only slightly elevated in OSA (23. 1 95 %CI 19, 8 – 28. 3 ppb) and CRS (22. 8 95 %CI 16. 8 – 32. 5 ppb). ConclusionsThe finding that oral NO is increased in OSA and is related to upper airway obstructive episodes and to hypoxemia severity, strengthens the clinical and pathogenic role of oral inflammation in OSA...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{trials of}} a {{combination}} therapy of an inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate (FP), with a long-acting β 2 -agonist, salmeterol (Sal), have demonstrated a greater improvement in lung function and in quality of life measures after the combination compared with either component of alone. In a subanalysis of the data of the TRISTAN study, Sal/FP reduced exacerbation rates in COPD patients with a baseline FEV 1 < 50 % of predicted. A combination therapy of budesonide and formoterol improved {{quality of life and}} FEV 1, and reduced exacerbations better than either component alone. In studies of FP or of Sal/FP in COPD, there was a reduction in all-cause mortality by 25 % relative to placebo.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{majority}} of the global population cannot afford existing asthma pharmacotherapy. Physical training as an airway anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma could potentially be a non-invasive, easily available, affordable, and healthy treatment modality. However, effects of physical training on airway inflammation in asthma are currently inconclusive. The main objective of this review is to summarize the effects of physical training on airway inflammation in asthmatics. Methods A peer reviewed search was applied to Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and DARE databases. We included all observational epidemiological research studies and RCTs. Studies evaluating at least one <b>marker</b> of <b>airway</b> inflammation in asthmatics {{after a period of}} physical training were selected. Data extraction was performed in a blinded fashion. We decided a priori to avoid pooling of the data in anticipation of heterogeneity of the studies, specifically heterogeneity of <b>airway</b> inflammatory <b>markers</b> studied as outcome measures. Results From the initial 2635 studies; 23 studies (16 RCTs and 7 prospective cohort studies) were included. Study sizes were generally small (median sample size[*]=[*] 30). There was a reduction in C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, sputum cell counts and IgE in asthmatics with physical training. Mixed results were observed after training for fractional excretion of nitric oxide and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The data was not pooled owing to significant heterogeneity between studies, and a funnel plot tests for publication bias were not performed because there were less than 10 studies for almost all outcome measures. Physical training intervention type, duration, intensity, frequency, primary outcome measures, methods of assessing outcome measures, and study designs were heterogeneous. Conclusion Due to reporting issues, lack of information and heterogeneity there was no definite conclusion; however, some findings suggest physical training may reduce airway inflammation in asthmatics...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{microbiological}} analysis of airway samples in asthma has demonstrated an altered microbiome {{in comparison to}} healthy controls. Such changes may have relevance to treatment-resistant severe asthma, particularly those with neutrophilic airway inflammation, as bacteria might be anticipated to activate the innate immune response, {{a process that is}} poorly steroid responsive. An understanding of the relationship between airway bacterial presence and dominance in severe asthma may help direct alternative treatment approaches. We aimed to use a culture independent analysis strategy to describe the presence, dominance and abundance of bacterial taxa in induced sputum from treatment resistant severe asthmatics and correlate findings with clinical characteristics and <b>airway</b> inflammatory <b>markers.</b> Induced sputum was obtained from 28 stable treatment-resistant severe asthmatics. The samples were divided for supernatant IL- 8 measurement, cytospin preparation for differential cell count and Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling for bacterial community analysis. In 17 / 28 patients, the dominant species within the airway bacterial community was Moraxella catarrhalis or a member of the Haemophilus or Streptococcus genera. Colonisation with these species was associated with longer asthma disease duration (mean (SD) 31. 8 years (16. 7) vs 15. 6 years (8. 0), p =  0. 008), worse post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV 1 (68. 0 % (24. 0) vs 85. 5 % (19. 7), p =  0. 025) and higher sputum neutrophil differential cell counts (median (IQR) 80 % (67 - 83) vs 43 % (29 - 67), p =  0. 001). Total abundance of these organisms significantly and positively correlated with sputum IL- 8 concentration and neutrophil count. Airway colonisation with potentially pathogenic micro-organisms in asthma is associated with more severe airways obstruction and neutrophilic airway inflammation. This altered colonisation may have a {{role in the development of}} an asthma phenotype that responds less well to current asthma therapies...|$|R
40|$|Children {{with severe}} neurodisability (ND) {{commonly}} suffer from chronic respiratory symptoms that impact greatly on quality of life, {{and lead to}} recurrent hospital admissions. This morbidity (and its causes) is poorly described, despite being well recognised by paediatricians. In this study, we characterised respiratory symptoms in children with ND at times of stability and deterioration. We also assessed the relationship between respiratory symptoms, lower <b>airway</b> inflammatory <b>markers</b> and levels of infection/colonisation. ND children were recruited upon admission for elective surgery (Elective-ND [n = 16]), or acutely upon admission to Intensive Care (PICU-ND [n = 19]), and compared to healthy control children [n = 12]. Parents completed a validated respiratory symptom questionnaire in which symptoms associated with activity were removed (total maximal score of 108). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was collected, and BAL neutrophil counts, IL- 8 and TGFβ- 1 levels measured. BAL microbial analysis was performed using a 16 S/ 18 S rRNA gene based assay and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PCR. All ND children had high levels of respiratory symptoms (median [IQR] symptom score PICU-ND, 55 [38 - 64]; Elective-ND, 26 [7 - 45]; Control, 4 [0 - 7]: p 20 invariably had BAL neutrophilia. Elective patients with 16 S/ 18 S microbial rDNA positive BAL had higher neutrophil counts (positive, 33 [18 - 70]%; negative, 8 [4 - 38]%: p< 0. 05) and generally higher symptom scores (positive, 17 [5 - 32]; negative, 5 [0 - 9]: p = 0. 097). Streptococcus mitis was commonly identified in BAL from ND children; Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not identified in any sample. Children with severe ND often {{have high levels of}} chronic respiratory symptoms, which may relate to lower airway inflammation.

Underlying etiologies include severe pulmonary infection and cystic fibrosis (CF); however, in {{a substantial number of}} patients with non-CF-related bronchiectasis (NCFB), no cause is found. The increasing armamentarium of therapies now available to combat disease in CF is {{in stark contrast to the}} limited tools employed in NCFB. Our study aimed to evaluate similarities and differences in <b>airway</b> inflammatory <b>markers</b> in patients with NCFB and CF, and to suggest potential common treatment options. The results of this study show that NCFB bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples possessed significantly increased NE activity and elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP- 2) and MMP- 9 compared to healthy controls (P &lt; 0. 01); however, the levels detected were lower than in CF (P &lt; 0. 01). Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) concentrations were significantly elevated in NCFB and CF compared to controls (P &lt; 0. 05), but in contrast, negligible levels of IL- 18 were detected in both NCFB and CF. Analogous concentrations of IL- 10 and IL- 4 measured in NCFB and CF were statistically elevated above the healthy control values (P &lt; 0. 05 and P &lt; 0. 01, respectively). These results indicate high levels of important proinflammatory markers in both NCFB and CF and support the use of appropriate anti-inflammatory therapies already employed in the treatment of CF bronchiectasis in NCFB.

40|$|Abstract Background Patients with {{bronchitis}} type {{of chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have raised vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in induced sputum. This {{has been associated}} with the pathogenesis of COPD through apoptotic and oxidative stress mechanisms. Since, chronic airway inflammation is an important pathological feature of COPD mainly initiated by cigarette smoking, aim {{of this study was to}} assess smoking as a potential cause of raised airway VEGF levels in bronchitis type COPD and to test the association between VEGF levels in induced sputum and airway inflammation in these patients. Methods 14 current smokers with bronchitis type COPD, 17 asymptomatic current smokers with normal spirometry and 16 non-smokers were included in the study. VEGF, IL- 8, and TNF-α levels in induced sputum were measured and the correlations between these markers, as well as between VEGF levels and pulmonary function were assessed. Results The median concentrations of VEGF, IL- 8, and TNF-α were significantly higher in induced sputum of COPD patients (1, 070 pg/ml, 5. 6 ng/ml and 50 pg/ml, respectively) compared to nonsmokers (260 pg/ml, 0. 73 ng/ml, and 15. 4 pg/ml, respectively, p 0. 05, respectively). Significant correlations were found between VEGF levels and pack years (r = 0. 56, p = 0. 046), IL- 8 (r = 0. 64, p = 0. 026) and TNF-α (r = 0. 62, p = 0. 031) levels both in asymptomatic and COPD smokers (r = 0. 66, p = 0. 027, r = 0. 67, p = 0. 023, and r = 0. 82, p = 0. 002, respectively). No correlation was found between VEGF levels in sputum and pulmonary function parameters. Conclusion VEGF levels are raised in the airways of both asymptomatic and COPD smokers. The close correlation observed between VEGF levels in the <b>airways</b> and <b>markers</b> of <b>airway</b> inflammation in healthy smokers and in smokers with bronchitis type of COPD is suggestive of VEGF as a marker reflecting the inflammatory process that occurs in smoking subjects without alveolar destruction. </p...|$|R
40|$|Chronic airway diseases, like asthma or COPD, are {{characterized}} by hyperresponsiveness resulting in inflammation and bronchoconstriction. During these diseases, also remodeling of the airway tissue occurs. Smooth muscle hypertrophy, epithelial goblet-cell hyperplasia and collagen deposition are examples of airway remodeling. Recent findings suggest a role for muscarinic receptor stimulation regulating remodeling in chronic airway diseases. Besides, other recently published data suggest that mechanical stress caused by bronchoconstriction may cause remodeling independent of inflammation. In this study, methacholine was used to induce bronchoconstriction, but methacholine is also a muscarinic agonist. Mainly due to this last article, the question arose which mechanisms {{are involved in the}} induction of airway remodeling by bronchoconstriction. That is why we designed a model to examine if the effect of methacholine is attributable to cell signaling or to the mechanical forces caused by bronchocon striction. We used isometric and isotonic contraction experiments to induce mechanical strain in bovine airway smooth muscle strips and added methacholine to induce both bronchoconstriction and cell signaling via muscarinic receptors. The strips were tested on several protein levels with western blot. Contractile protein levels in chronic stimulated strips did not show strain-dependent increases. The acute stimulated strips with isometric settings did show a significant increased phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2 and GSK- 3 level at 10 grams of tension. In case of phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2, this increase is probably strain-dependent. Methacholine was able to further increase the levels, but not on a strain-dependent manner. Besides, we tested if the phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 was attributable to Rho kinase-induced contraction, but this was not demonstrated. However, we did see an inhibitory effect on the contractility of methacholine induced strips. With regard to this last point, more experiments are recommended to investigate this properly. The main aim of this study to design a model to investigate whether the increasing effect of methacholine on <b>airway</b> remodeling <b>markers</b> was due to cell signaling or to the mechanical forces caused by constriction of the trachea has not yet been achieved. ...|$|R

Aortic stiffness, an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk, and systemic and airway inflammation are increased {{in patients with}} the disease. Statins modulate aortic stiffness and have anti-inflammatory properties. A proof-of-principle, double-blind, randomized trial determined if 6 weeks of simvastatin 20 mg once daily reduced aortic stiffness and systemic and airway inflammation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods: Stable patients (n= 70) were randomized to simvastatin (active) or placebo. Pre-treatment and post-treatment aortic stiffness, blood pressure, spirometry, and circulating and airway inflammatory mediators and lipids were measured. A predefined subgroup analysis was performed where baseline aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) was > 10 m/sec. Results: Total cholesterol dropped in the active group. There was no significant change in aortic PWV between the active group and the placebo group (- 0. 7 m/sec, P= 0. 24).

Methods Sixty-six subjects were randomised to SFC or FP/M for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in neutrophil, eosinophil, macrophage, lymphocyte, and epithelial cell levels in induced sputum. Additional outcomes included the change in other sputum <b>markers</b> of <b>airway</b> inflammation, airway responsiveness, symptom control, and lung function. Results Both treatments had no significant effect on induced sputum inflammatory cells, although there was a trend for a reduction in sputum eosinophils. Both treatments significantly improved airway responsiveness, whereas SFC generally led to greater improvements in symptom control and lung function than FP/M. FP/M led to significantly greater reductions in sputum cysteinyl leukotrienes than SFC (treatment ratio 1. 80; 95 % CI 1. 09, 2. 94).
