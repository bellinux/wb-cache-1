Most of the traffic had transferred to the railway by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s, and was bound for Llanstephan.|$|E

Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, {{which is owned by}} individuals and family groups.

Hibs failed to secure the ground lease and a builder started constructing houses on the site in 1890.

50|$|ATMs {{typically}} connect {{directly to}} their host or ATM Controller on either ADSL or dial-up modem over a telephone line or directly on <b>a</b> <b>leased</b> line.

Less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem on a POTS line rather than using <b>a</b> <b>leased</b> line, since <b>a</b> <b>leased</b> line may be comparatively more expensive to operate compared to a POTS line.
