5|$|Human {{activity}} in the lands of modern Bulgaria {{can be traced back}} to the Paleolithic. Animal bones incised with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture, Vinča culture and the eneolithic Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing gold working and exploitation. Some of these first gold smelters produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure, the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. This site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.|$|E

Private letters commending Tacitus are quoted from the senators 'Autronius Tiberianus' and 'Claudius Sapilianus', both of whom <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fictitious.

5|$|Most seabirds are colonial, and {{the reasons}} for colonial {{behaviour}} <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Ewiniar {{killed at}} least 34people in China, with areas as far {{northwest}} as Gansu and Shanxi affected by landslides.

Therefore, the deaths that can be attributed to Ewiniar from the landslides <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> indirectly caused, and not directly. Average rainfall reported in Shandong was 3.4mm (0.133inches) per hour from 6a.m. July 9 through midnight July 10 (totalling about 61.2mm or 2.4inches). At least 300 flights out of Beijing's Capital International Airport had to be delayed due to thunderstorms and effects of Ewiniar, while Air China and China Eastern Airlines cancelled flights to South Korea heading out of China. As Ewiniar did not affect the mainland directly, there are little to no reports of major damage.|$|E
5|$|Zeta Coronae Borealis is {{a double}} star with two blue-white {{components}} 6.3arcseconds apart that can be readily separated at 100xmagnification. The primary is of magnitude5.1 and the secondary is of magnitude6.0. Nu Coronae Borealis is an optical double, whose components are a similar distance from Earth but have different radial velocities, hence <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unrelated. The primary, Nu1 Coronae Borealis, is a red giant of spectral type M2III and magnitude 5.2, lying 640±30 light-years distant, and the secondary, Nu2 Coronae Borealis, is an orange-hued giant star of spectral type K5III and magnitude 5.4, estimated to be 590±30light-years away. Sigma Coronae Borealis, on the other hand, is a true multiple star system divisible by small amateur telescopes. It is actually a complex system composed of two stars around as massive as the Sun that orbit each other every 1.14days, orbited by a third Sun-like star every 726years. The fourth and fifth components are a binary red dwarf system that is 14,000AU distant from the other three stars.
