40|$|Virtualized {{data centers}} enable sharing of {{resources}} among hosted applications. However, {{it is difficult}} to satisfy servicelevel objectives (SLOs) of applications on shared infrastructure, as application workloads and resource consumption patterns change over time. In this paper, we present <b>AutoControl,</b> a resource control system that automatically adapts to dynamic workload changes to achieve application SLOs. <b>AutoControl</b> is a combination of an online model estimator and a novel multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) resource controller. The model estimator captures the complex relationship between application performance and resource allocations, while the MIMO controller allocates the right amount of multiple virtualized resources to achieve application SLOs. Our experimental evaluation with RUBiS and TPC-W benchmarks along with production-trace-driven workloads indicates that <b>AutoControl</b> can detect and mitigate CPU and disk I/O bottlenecks that occur over time and across multiple nodes by allocating each resource accordingly. We also show that <b>AutoControl</b> can be used to provide service differentiation according to the application priorities during resource contention...|$|E

40|$|Cortical neurons in vivo {{had been}} {{regarded}} as Poisson spike generators that convey no information other than the rate of random firing. Recently, using a metric for analyzing local variation of interspike intervals, {{researchers have found that}} individual neurons express specific patterns in generating spikes, which may symbolically be termed regular, random, or bursty, rather invariantly in time. In order to study the dynamics of firing patterns in greater detail, we propose here a Bayesian method for estimating firing irregularity and the firing rate simultaneously for a given spike sequence, and we implement an algorithm that may render the empirical Bayesian estimation practicable for data comprising a large number of spikes. Application of this method to electrophysiological data revealed a subtle correlation between the degree of firing irregularity and the firing rate for individual neurons. Irregularity of firing did not deviate greatly around the low degree of dependence on the firing rate and remained practically unchanged for individual neurons in the cortical areas V 1 and MT, whereas it fluctuated greatly in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. This indicates the presence and absence of <b>autocontrolling</b> mechanisms for maintaining patterns of firing in the cortex and thalamus, respectively...|$|R

Materials and methods: This was an <b>autocontrolled</b> comparison study. A total of 159 patients undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment were recruited in this study. The pH values, osmolarity pressures, and ROS levels of 15 batches of two culture media were measured. Sibling oocytes or embryos from individual patients were randomly assigned to two culture groups with Quinn's Advantage Cleavage and Blastocyst media (QAC/QAB) or GIII series cleavage and blastocyst media (G 1. 3 /G 2. 3). The difference between the two culture groups was analyzed using one-sample t test. Results: The QAC/QAB and G 1. 3 /G 2. 3 media exhibited similar pH values and osmolarity pressures. However, the prepared QAC/QAB media were characterized to contain lower amounts of ROS than the G 1. 3 /G 2. 3 media. Furthermore, the blastocysts that developed under the QAC/QAB media were morphologically superior to those that developed under the G 1. 3 /G 2. 3 media. Conclusion: The elevated ROS levels in culture media were associated with poor development of blastocyst-stage embryos.

Main Outcome Measure(s) Percentage of viable, apoptotic, and necrotic sperm and recovery rate of total motile, progressive motile, and viable sperm before and after the two sperm preparation methods. Result(s) Compared with the original semen, the mean percentages of apoptotic and necrotic sperm were significantly lower after both sperm preparation methods. The mean percentage of viable sperm was significantly higher after swim-up compared with gradient centrifugation. The recovery rates of total motile, progressive motile, and viable sperm were significantly higher using gradient centrifugation compared with swim-up. The viable sperm percentage and the progressive sperm motility were significant predictors for negative difference between the two methods in terms of viable sperm percentage after preparation. Conclusion(s) Both sperm preparation methods allow obtaining a sperm population with a low percentage of apoptotic sperm. Therefore, the risk of using apoptotic sperm for clinical treatment seems to be rather low. The choice of method will depend on whether IVF/ICSI or intrauterine insemination is to be performed...|$|R

The reactivity could be mistaken as autoantibody (if <b>autocontrol</b> is positive) or alloantibody (if <b>autocontrol</b> is negative). We present a case that demonstrates daratumumab could mimic a high titer low avidity (HTLA) alloantibody.

40|$|Virtualized {{data centers}} enable sharing of {{resources}} among hosted applications. However, {{it is difficult}} to manage these data centers because of ever-changing application requirements. This thesis presents a collection of tools called <b>AutoControl</b> and LiteGreen, that automatically adapt to dynamic changes to achieve various SLOs (service level objectives) while maintaining high resource utilization, high application performance and low power consumption. <b>AutoControl</b> resource manager is based on novel control theory and optimization techniques. The central idea of this work is to apply control theory to solve resource allocation in virtualized data centers while achieving applicaiton goals. Applying control theory to computer systems, where first-principle models are not available, is a challenging task, and is made difficult by the dynamics seen in real systems including changing workloads, multi-tier dependencies, and resource bottleneck shifts. To overcome the lack of first principle models, we build black-box models that not only capture the relationship between application performance and resource allocations, but also incorporate the dynamics of the system using an online adaptive model. The next challenge is to design a controller that uses the online model to compute optimal allocations to achieve applicaiton goals. We are faced with two conflicting goals: quick response and stability. Our solution is an adaptive multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) controller that uses a simplified Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) formulation. The LQR formulation treats the control as an optimization problem and balances the tradeoff between quick response and stability to find the right set of resource allocations to meet application goals. We also look at the idea of leveraging server consolidation to save desktop energy. We design and implement a novel power manager called LiteGreen to save desktop energy by virtualizing the user’s desktop computing environment as a VM and then migrating it between the user's physical desktop machine and a VM server, depending on whether the desktop computing environment is being actively used or is idle. A savings algorithm based on statistical inferences made from a collection of traces is used to consolidate desktops on a remote server to save energy...|$|E

In the absence of PNPase, there was no increase in pnp-lacZ expression, indicating that the increase in pnp expression occurs at a posttranscriptional level. Other experiments clearly show that increased pnp expression at low temperature is only observed under conditions in which the <b>autocontrol</b> mechanism of PNPase is functional.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown that the pnp messenger RNAs are cleaved by RNase III at the 5 ' end and that these cleavages induce a rapid decay of these messengers. A translational fusion between pnp and lacZ was introduced into the chromosome of a delta lac strain to study the expression of pnp. In the presence of increased cellular concentrations of polynucleotide phosphorylase, {{the level of the}} hybrid beta-galactosidase is repressed, whereas the synthesis rate of the corresponding message is not significantly affected. In the absence of pnp, the level of the hybrid protein increases strongly. Thus, polynucleotide phosphorylase is post-transcriptionally autocontrolled. However, <b>autocontrol</b> is totally abolished in strains where the RNase III site on the pnp message has been deleted or in strains devoid of RNase III. These results suggest that polynucleotide phosphorylase requires RNase III cleavages to autoregulate the translation of its message.

There is a paucity of data on the incidence of RBC alloimmunization and autoimmunization in thalassemic patients from eastern part of India, as pretransfusion antibody screening is not routinely performed. Aims. To assess the incidence of RBC alloimmunization and autoimmunization in transfusion dependent thalassemic patients in eastern India. Materials and Methods. Total 500 thalassemia cases were evaluated. The antibody screening and identification were performed with commercially available panel cells (Diapanel, Bio-rad, Switzerland) by column agglutination method. To detect autoantibodies, <b>autocontrol</b> and direct antiglobulin tests were carried out using polyspecific coombs (IgG + C 3 d) gel cards in all patients. Results.

Cellular basis of ethylene effects on growth 904 Acknowledgements 906 References 906 Summary The vegetative development of plants {{is strongly dependent on}} the action of phytohormones. For over a century, the effects of ethylene on plants have been studied, illustrating the profound impact of this gaseous hormone on plant growth, development and stress responses. Ethylene signaling is under tight self-control at various levels. Feedback regulation occurs on both biosynthesis and signaling. For its role in developmental processes, ethylene has a close and reciprocal relation with auxin, another major determinant of plant architecture. Here, we discuss, in view of novel findings mainly in the reference plant Arabidopsis, how ethylene is distributed and perceived throughout the plant at the organ, tissue and cellular levels, and reflect on how plants benefit from the complex interaction of ethylene and auxin, determining their shape. Furthermore, we elaborate on the implications of recent discoveries on the control of ethylene signaling...|$|E

40|$|The {{aggressivity}} or bullying {{between school}} students {{is a very}} important subject nowadays, and it is a significant social issue as school is an institution, where alongside the family, children and youth develop themselves. To approach this subject it is necessary to know what are the characteristics of children and youth who display bullying behaviour. In this research, we study the relationship between emotional intelligence variables, like empathy, self control and impulsivity, and their influence on aggressive behaviour at school. The results show us that aggressive behaviour is related to age, sex and empathy. Key words: Bullying, aggressive behaviour, emotional intelligence. La violencia o agresividad entre escolares es un tema de actualidad de gran relevancia social debido, principalmente, a que la escuela es una de las instituciones, junto a la familia, en la que se forman los niños y adolescentes. Para abordar este tema es imprescindible conocer, entre otras cosas, qué rasgos caracterizan a los alumnos violentos o agresivos. En este trabajo, se estudia la relación entre variables tales como empatía, <b>autocontrol</b> e impulsividad, que forman parte del constructo denominado inteligencia emocional, con influencia en las conductas agresivas en el ambiente escolar. Los resultados son alentadores ya que permiten diseñar programas concretos de intervención en relación con las variables edad, el sexo y empatía en relación con la agresividad. Palabras clave: Bullying, agresividad, inteligencia emocional. ...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Autoimmune {{hemolytic}} anemia (AIHA) {{is characterized by}} the production of autoantibodies directed against red cell antigens. Most patients of AIHA arrive in the emergency or out-patient department (OPD) with severe anemia requiring urgent blood transfusion. Here we share our experience of managing these patients with incompatible blood transfusions and suggest the minimal test required to assure patient safety. Materials and Methods: A total of 14 patients admitted with severe anemia, diagnosed with AIHA and requiring blood transfusion urgently were included in the study. A series of immunohematological investigations were performed to confirm the diagnosis and issue "best match" packed red blood cells (PRBC) to these patients. Results: A total of 167 PRBC units were crossmatched for 14 patients of which 46 units (28 %) were found to be best match ones and 26 (56. 5 %) of these units were transfused. A mean turn around time of 222 min was observed in issuing the ′best match′ blood. Severe hemolysis was observed in all patients with a median hemoglobin increment of 0. 88 g/dl after each unit PRBC transfusion. Conclusion: Decision to transfuse in AIHA should be based on the clinical condition of the patient. No critical patient should be denied blood transfusion due to serological incompatibility. Minimum investigations such as direct antiglobulin test (DAT), antibody screening and <b>autocontrol</b> should be performed to ensure transfusion safety in patients. All transfusion services should be capable of issuing "best match" PRBCs in AIHA...|$|E
40|$|From the {{perspective}} of the sociology of professions, every professional activity should have its own clearly circumscribed and regulated sphere of action. Such an articulation facilitates the regulation of the production of a given profession as well as {{the way in which it}} is practiced. The purpose of the research reported here was to provide a comprehensive review and evaluation of the regulatory framework governing the advertising sector in Spain. To this end, the authors analysed external regulatory legislation and self-regulatory codes extracted from the data base of the Asociación para la Autoregulación de la Comunicación Comercial (<b>Autocontrol)</b> that had been enacted or adopted between 1988, the year that Law 11 / 1998 on General Telecommunications entered into force, and 2003 as well as other relevant documents retrieved from the Boletin Oficial del Estado (BOE) pertaining to the same period. Findings indicate that although there has been a groundswell of legislation governing advertising practices in Spain since 1988, especially at the regional level, lawmakers have focused on the content of advertising messages and shown very little interest in regulating the professions of advertising and public relations. Furthermore, Spanish legislation enacted in 2003 and EU policies appear to have encouraged the adoption of voluntary codes of ethics. Sectors traditionally subject to mandatory advertising regulation, either due to the vulnerability of their target audiences or the potential impact of their commercial messages on public health or the environment, are more likely to develop self-regulatory codes of conduct than other...|$|E

Fueron un apoyo fundamental en la difusión de los valores morales, estéticos y patrióticos, aunque no fueron militaristas y tendieron a moderar la inclusión de preceptos higienistas, a medida que la población los fue asimilando. La consolidación de las pedagogías espiritualistas, con elementos de la Escuela Nueva, se advierte también en los contenidos de estos libros, que pusieron el énfasis en el <b>autocontrol</b> del escolar, apelando a la persuasión y a los sentimientos de emulación y de culpa. Escritos para niños urbanos, no fueron funcionales para el medio rural, aunque contribuyeron a una temprana urbanización de la mentalidad agraria.

They were a fundamental support in the diffusion of the moral, aesthetic and patriotic values, though they were not militaristic and tended to moderate the incorporation of hygienists rules, as the population was assimilating them. The consolidation of the spiritualist pedagogy, with elements of the New School, are found also in the contents of these books, which put the emphasis in the self-control of the student, appealing to the persuasion and the feelings of emulation and fault.
