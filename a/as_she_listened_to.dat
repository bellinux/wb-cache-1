25|$|Songs {{and music}} were a natural {{extension}} of this interest in words and {{her love of}} music began early in life <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> her father, Walter Pendleton Stringfellow, sing. She had access to a scrapbook of folk songs collected by her grandmother, Rosalie Cope Stringfellow. She began her music career collecting folksongs and performing them, first with her husband Jim in the late 1950s, then later on her own. It was during this time that the Smithsonian Institution's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage recorded Rosalie and Jim performing her collection of traditional songs. Many of these have been released by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings in various compilation albums throughout the last fifty years.|$|E
500|$|In September 2004, Jarre {{released}} AERO, both a DVD and a CD in one package. Purportedly the world's {{first album}} released for 5.1 systems, with it being fully [...] "constructed" [...] in 5.1 surround sound, it contains re-recorded versions {{of some of}} his most famous tracks, including tracks from Oxygène and Équinoxe. Accompanying the audio, the DVD features a visual image of Anne Parillaud's eyes, recorded in real time <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the album. Jarre used the minimalist imagery to reinforce the audio content of the DVD. The CD was mixed in super-stereo.|$|E
500|$|The tour {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times gave the concert a rave review affirming that Mars' energy never runs {{out as well}} as the [...] "seemingly effortless precision", which made the performance about itself. Wood finalized, [...] "The harder he played, the easier it appeared to get." [...] Holly Perry from AXS wrote that Mars was not only a [...] "true artist", but also [...] "an icon in the making". She concluded that the finale had the best production of the entire concert. Mike Wass of Idolator gave a positive review, as he witnessed Mars' [...] "powerful" [...] vocals and the band's [...] "incredibly musicianship." [...] He enlighted the singers [...] "swoonworthy rendition" [...] of [...] "When I Was Your Man", the [...] "rock interpretation" [...] of [...] "Grenade" [...] and the Pharrell duet. Jason Lipshutz, Billboard magazine writer, felt {{that one of the most}} stunning things on the concert was the catalog of number one records he left off the live show and still make it impressive. He continued, saying that Mars is a pop artist with the [...] "whole package", comparing him to [...] "an ace Pixar movie". Lipshutz ended his review stating that Mars is one of the best live performers at the given moment. The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman commented that the singer kept a high level of energy during the entire concert. She added, [...] "much work, planning, and rehearsal went in to the show, but Mars made it look easy." [...] Lillian Altman writing for The AU Review felt that [...] "the chemistry between the nine performers was phenomenal", since the band enjoys performing together by dancing and interacting with the public. After the show's finale Altman confessed that it was the first time she was walking home [...] "singing and dancing in the streets" [...] after attending a concert or festival <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> Mars' tracks on her iPod.|$|E

He convinces the {{neighbors in the}} pool {{to take care of}} Mahler, but {{on the way to the}} airport, he changes his mind. Instead, he goes to pick up Florence at the hospital, and they return to her apartment. The film closes <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> Roger's voice mail.|$|R
5000|$|Melissa Silverstein - (indieWire) {{described}} [...] "Michael's {{campaign to}} get Suu the Nobel Peace Prize to raise her visibility and protect her safety" [...] {{as one of the}} film's highlights. She emphasised hereby the scene [...] "of one of her sons accepting the award on her behalf <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> ceremony on a radio thousands of miles away". She found that scene [...] "moving".|$|R
50|$|In each episode Melody {{undertakes}} {{an everyday}} activity with her mother. The fun she has, or the frustrations or difficulties she experiences, prompts her <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> {{a piece of}} music.

2500|$|Armstrong met {{his first}} serious girlfriend, Erica Paleno (also known as Arica Pelino), inside the Gilman music club on his sixteenth birthday. Erica {{became known as}} the [...] "first {{official}} Green Day fan" [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the first four-track recordings by Billie and Sean, encouraging the band, touring with them and acting as occasional photographer for the band. Erica inspired many of Green Day's well known songs including [...] "Christie Road", which was written for her by Armstrong about the local tracks where the couple would sneak out to meet. When Armstrong began living in punk houses and warehouses at the age of seventeen, including the warehouse above a West Oakland brothel which ultimately inspired the song [...] "Welcome to Paradise" [...] Erica would often stay with him despite the dangers, [...] "I would stay with him sometimes in these warehouses full of crusty punks". The couple split in late 1991. Erica is the sister of former Green Day touring member (2004–2005) Mike Pelino and sister-in-law of Janna White, wife of Green Day guitarist Jason White.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson was {{passionate about}} music {{from a young}} age and even asked her mother how anyone could live without it. She sang at a church and started playing the piano {{at the age of}} five, {{learning}} from her pastor's wife, Evangeline Thiessen. [...] Her parents played country music records by Jim Reeves and Don Williams at home and as she got older, her musical interests diversified <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> artists like ABBA, Charley Pride, Fleetwood Mac and Marty Stuart among others. The family later moved to Westlock, Alberta and Johnson attended RF Staples High School there. During her high school years, she learned to play the clarinet, flute and saxophone. She kept up her piano lessons largely in part due to Thiessan sending books and encouraging letters to her. [...] Her high school teachers were not as encouraging and caused her to turn away from music for a while and turn to science, a period in her life which she called [...] "a stain in her heart".|$|E

6000|$|Mother Nature has but one care, the children. We talk of Love as the Lord of Life: it is but the Minister. Our novels end where Nature's tale begins. The {{drama that}} our curtain falls upon, is but the prologue to her play. How the ancient Dame must laugh <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> the prattle of her children. [...] "Is Marriage a Failure?" [...] "Is Life worth Living?" [...] "The New Woman versus the Old." [...] So, perhaps, {{the waves of}} the Atlantic discuss vehemently whether they shall flow east or west.|$|R
50|$|What {{starts off}} with a mildly {{disturbing}} game of charades escalates into Trudy and Keith castrating and beheading, respectively, Mr. Vanislaw, whose penis is now being stored in the freezer, and Buck who is incited by The Three Figures from the laugh track into attempted rape on Keith. Climactically, the laugh track voices {{burst out of the}} ceiling, demanding a Court TV-style trial of Trudy and Keith, which Mrs. Siezmagraff quite happily and manically provides. Ultimately, Trudy and Keith, {{under the influence of the}} voices, blow up the house, leaving Betty alone on the beach to find peace and tranquility <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> the sound of the waves.|$|R

6000|$|... "Delightful!" [...] murmured Bella, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> {{the sweet}} {{strains of the}} Commander-in-chief's band, and gazed dreamily at the sun-flashes that danced on the glassy water.|$|E
60|$|She {{thought of}} all this, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the witty {{discourse}} of the Cabinet Minister, who, no doubt, {{felt that he had}} found in Lady Blakeney a most perfect listener. Suddenly she saw the keen, fox-like face of Chauvelin peeping through the curtained doorway.|$|R

A terribly wounded Buffy sits alone at home <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> Giles and Willow talk in another room. They worry about Buffy's condition {{and their ability to}} fight this thing that seems so much bigger than them all. Buffy finally comes downstairs and gives an inspirational speech about this huge challenge before them that is bigger than any evil they've ever faced. She tells the group that she's more scared than ever, but she's not about to back down now. There's a new plan: they're declaring war on this evil instead of waiting for it to make a move which Buffy says,"If they want an apocalypse, we'll give em one." ...|$|R
60|$|He went {{to sleep}} with the {{readiness}} of a child, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lay <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> his quiet breath she remembered how easy it had once been for her to sleep.

60|$|There was {{pain and}} there was {{pleasure}} in the girl's face <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> these implied reproaches. It was sweet, it was bitter to defend herself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But if {{you don't}} marry, what then?' asked Mrs Jo, {{feeling like a}} girl again <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the answers, and watched the thoughtful, gay, or eager faces.|$|E

6000|$|Although the Lady Capilla {{was unwilling}} to {{reciprocate}} the passion of Champou the man, she was not averse to quiet interviews with Champou the Prince.

60|$|With this in her mind, the governess {{could not}} be {{expected}} to accept as satisfactory what was not entire confutation or contradiction, and Miss Mohun saw that, politely <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was <b>listened</b> <b>to,</b> it was all only treated as excuse; since there could be no denial of Gillian's folly, and it was only a question of degree.|$|R
6000|$|... "How you do run on!" [...] said Mother, mechanically, placid dreaminess in {{her face}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the violin that like a river bore the flotsam of Hungarian and Jewish voices.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me what happened," [...] said Helen. She had to {{keep her}} lips from {{twitching}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> Rachel's story. It was poured out abruptly with great seriousness and no sense of humour.|$|E

50|$|She {{has been}} with Pondus since they were teenagers, but {{is a far more}} {{conventionally}} normal person than he is. She does not share his love for football, but much prefers to watch soap operas on TV. The only thing she will never forgive about their wedding day, {{is the fact that he}} got married in his soccer shoes (and tuxedo). Her taste in music is offensive to Pondus, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> likes <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Michael Bolton, Modern Talking, Ricky Martin etc.|$|R
50|$|Peggy Grahame: An {{independent}} {{young woman}} who, when orphaned, {{is sent to}} live with her uncle Enos in an old, colonial house, and she views this change apprehensively.

Her uncle most often ignores her, treating her like a child when she does interfere, and she begins to be very lonely. Then the spirits of her Colonial ancestors visit her, filling some of her rather dull and uneventful days. She eagerly awaits their visits, as well as the secret communications she keeps up with Pat. She learns more of her history <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> her predeceasors and roams around the old house, unravelling the mysteries of the past. In many ways she is like her ancestor Barbara Grahame, who visits her most often.|$|R

60|$|Leger did so concisely, and Hetty clenched the chair-arm hard <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> him. Still, {{young as}} she was, she held herself in hand, and sat very still, with the colour ebbing from her face.|$|E
