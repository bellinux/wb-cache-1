5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E

The game follows the story of four heroes who attempt to scale a tower {{at the center of the}} world that supposedly leads to paradise. The four heroes may belong to one of three character classes, each housing a unique customization path.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately cognatic (derived {{through both}} males and females), in Scotland kinship was agnatic, with {{members of a group}} sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor. Women {{retained}} their original surname at marriage, symbolising that they did not join their husband's kin, and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship. Women could marry from the age of 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties, by which they accrued resources, status <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> would allow them to establish a household. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Highland women, based on the higher birth rate of the Highlands, might have married earlier than their Lowland counterparts.|$|E

The other branch that came down from Cao Jiwu was through his other student, Dai Longbang.

25|$|From the beginning, Didsbury {{encouraged}} {{connections to}} educational institutions in other countries, {{with at least}} 1000 people reported to have visited during the first nine months, from Greece, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and America. Staff and students made visits to foreign countries, including Germany and Russia, with students from these countries visiting Didsbury. In the 1970s, visits to Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United States became {{a major part of}} Didsbury's courses, and these relationships were strengthened when the UK joined the European Economic Community. The Erasmus Programme, a European Union programme set up in 1987, established partner institutions across Europe, allowing staff and students to spend significant amounts of time abroad, most while studying the BEd degree from 1991 onwards. The purpose of Erasmus was to allow students to gain experience in a foreign setting, and return to the UK with knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> would impact the children they would teach. As a result of a policy change for accommodation, visits to Finland by students with their children were made possible in 2000. In 2008, it was extended to include Bridgewater State College in the United States, and Hong Kong Institute of Education, despite not being in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Endel Tulving {{originally}} described {{episodic memory}} as {{a record of}} a person's experience that held temporally dated information and spatio-temporal relations. A feature of episodic memory that Tulving later elaborates on {{is that it allows}} an agent to imagine traveling back in time. A current situation may cue retrieval of a previous episode, so that context that colours the previous episode is experienced at the immediate moment. The agent is provided with a means of associating previous feelings with current situations. Semantic memory, on the other hand, is a structured record of facts, concepts, <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> we have acquired. Semantic information is derived from accumulated episodic memory. Episodic memory {{can be thought of as}} a [...] "map" [...] that ties together items in semantic memory. For example, all encounters with how a [...] "dog" [...] looks and sounds will make up the semantic representation of that word. All episodic memories concerning a dog will then reference this single semantic representation of [...] "dog" [...] and, likewise, all new experiences with the dog will modify the single semantic representation of that dog.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1980s, {{informal}} logic {{has been}} partnered and even equated, {{in the minds}} of many, with critical thinking. The precise definition of [...] "critical thinking" [...] is a subject of much dispute. Critical thinking, as defined by Johnson, is the evaluation of an intellectual product (an argument, an explanation, a theory) in terms of its strengths and weaknesses. While critical thinking will include evaluation of arguments and hence require skills of argumentation including informal logic, critical thinking requires additional abilities not supplied by informal logic, such as the ability to obtain and assess information and to clarify meaning. Also, many believe that critical thinking requires certain dispositions. Understood in this way, [...] "critical thinking" [...] is a broad term for the attitudes <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> are involved in analyzing and evaluating arguments. The critical thinking movement promotes critical thinking as an educational ideal. The movement emerged with great force in the '80s in North America as part of an ongoing critique of education as regards the thinking skills not being taught.|$|E
