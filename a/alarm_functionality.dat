Partial weight-bearing is a common measure that accelerates the healing process following lower-body surgeries or fractures. In order to improve the compliance with this method, a smartphone application was developed. It provides the user with an audible and haptic biofeedback alarm when a predefined threshold is reached by the pressure sensors’ data {{of a pair of}} instrumented insoles. The preliminary results show that the <b>alarm</b> <b>functionality</b> works in accordance with the stipulations. The biofeedback also appears to {{have a positive effect on}} the amount of steps under the target weight...|$|E
40|$|As the {{technology}} is going on rapidly the major parameters affecting the chip design is area, density and clock speeds. Every digital circuitry [1]. {{is based on the}} clock and design of clock for each and every individual module is a bit complex process and so this paper deals with the real time clock in which this clock module can be integrated to various circuits as per their requirement and <b>alarm</b> <b>functionality</b> is also implemented such that this can be helpful in waking up the devices at particular time from the sleep mode to save the power consumption this paper is completely based on the FSM plot[3] also consisting of the counters and the registers this is implemented on the Spartan 3 FPGA board and the complete code coverage report have been generated design have been done using verilog HDL in Xilinx and the verification part have been done in mentor graphics too...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLine type heat {{detectors}} (LTHD) {{are important for}} temperature based fire detection in applications {{with a large number}} of detection points. Preferably they are used in aggressive environments showing extreme temperatures, high humidity, dust exposure, aggressive gases, or others. Typical applications are in traffic tunnels, cable channels, or conveyor belts. Europe is actually preparing the new EN 54 - 22 standard for resettable line type {{heat detectors}} (LTHD). This new standard includes a classification of the various types of detectors, reaction classes, and test procedures. It will allow more adequate testing compared to the actual procedure based on EN 54 - 5 for point detectors. It will cover all types of resettable LTHD as semiconductor cables, fiber optic cables, pneumatic systems, and analog cables. The paper presents an overview on the actual draft of the standard. During the last years, Metaphysics has developed a new semiconductor sensor based LTHD. In contrary to other types of LTHD it is using discrete semiconductor temperature sensors such allowing an exact localization of the fire and highly flexible programming of the <b>alarm</b> <b>functionality.</b> Due to a special, patented high-speed bus system it has been shown in several public tests that this system is significantly faster than other LTHD systems. After first experience in the field, more features like loop setups with increased availability and network solutions have been added recently. The paper shows the physical principle of this approach and its system design completed by test reports and application examples...|$|E

40|$|According to the International Diabetes Atlas (2013), {{approximately}} 225, 840 {{people in}} Ireland {{are living with}} diabetes. It is estimated that by 2030 there would be 278, 850 people living with the disease it is quite {{clear that this is}} a major problem. From a technical standpoint this project sets out to help those people living with the disease to manage it best they can with the aid of an android application and glucometer device. The application has been developed in Android Studio, the application works alongside a Bluetooth glucometer device for recording users blood sugar readings. The main aim is {{to move away from the}} traditional pen to paper method that most diabetics use when recording their blood levels and to utilize all of the great advancements in technologies which have been available to us in recent years. The user has the be ability to record their blood sugar readings as they normally would however utilizing Bluetooth the glucometer device that wirelessly transmits the data and stores it in the android application which utilises a real-time database for online backup. I believe that by combining the device that is used by all diabetics in conjunction with the application adds great value to the project and makes it differ widely from other similar applications available from the play store. In addition to this the application the user with a reminder <b>alarm</b> <b>functionality</b> for reminders for medication or anything they desire. A pedometer which is also within application will ensure that the diabetic user will be getting enough exercise per day to ensure good blood circulation. The main aim of this report is to fully document the process that was involved in the development of this project listing all of the necessary details including requirements, technologies, design, testing, evaluation and further developments...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the state of fire {{prevention}} research, provide an updated synthesis of evaluated fire prevention programs, and discuss the role of fire fighters and data systems in prevention efforts. The review included all evaluations of U. S. based fire prevention interventions published between January 1998 and September 2004 and any earlier articles about U. S. fire prevention interventions not included in two prior review articles. We retrieved information from each identified study including evaluation findings, involvement of fire service personnel and use of existing data systems. We identified twelve articles: seven reported on smoke alarm interventions, three on multi-faceted programs, and two other programs. Five programs involved fire service personnel in the design, implementation, and/or evaluation, and three used existing data systems. Studies reviewed suggest that canvassing and smoke alarm installations are the most effective means of distributing alarms and increasing the functional status of distributed <b>alarms.</b> The <b>functionality</b> of smoke <b>alarms,</b> an issue noted in earlier reviews, remains a problem. Programs involving partnerships with fire departments have indicated success in preventing fires and deaths, improving smoke alarm ownership and functional status, and improving children’s fire safety knowledge. Using existing data systems to target and to evaluate interventions was effective. In the years since prior reviews, some improvements in the rigor of evaluation designs have been made, but there is still a need for high quality evaluations that will inform fire injury prevention efforts...|$|R
40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} RTAP product was undertaken within the CNC associate program to determine the feasibility of utilizing it to replace the current Supervisory Control System that supports the AVLIS program. This document contains {{the results of that}} evaluation. With some fundamental redesign the current Supervisory Control system could meet the needs described above. The redesign would require a large amount of software rewriting and would be very time consuming. The higher level <b>functionality</b> (<b>alarming,</b> automation, etc.) would have to wait until its completion. Our current understanding and preliminary testing indicate that using commercial software {{is the best way to}} get these new features at the minimum cost to the program. Additional savings will be obtained by moving the maintenance costs of the basic control system from in-house to commercial industry and allowing our developers to concentrate on the unique control areas that require customization. Our current operating system, VMS, has become a hindrance. The UNIX operating system has become the choice for most scientific and engineering systems and we should follow suit. As a result of the commercial system survey referenced above we selected RTAP, a SCADA product developed by Hewlett Packard (HP), as the most favorable product to replace the current supervisory system in AVLIS. It is an extremely open system, with a large, well defined Application Programming Interface (API). This will allow the seamless integration of unique front end devices in the laser area (e. g. Optical Device Controller). RTAP also possesses various functionality that is lacking in our current system: integrated alarming, real-time configurable database, system scalability, and a Sequence Control Language (SQL developed by CPU, an RTAP Channel Partner) that will facilitate the automation necessary to bring the AVLIS process to plant-line operation. It runs on HP- 9000, DEC-Alpha, IBM-RS 6000 and Sun Workstations...|$|R
