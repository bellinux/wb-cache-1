In 1499 there was a bigger {{structural}} change, because of the indulgence grant. Franz Xaver Horneis structured the ceiling new in 1742. But the building of this church was cancelled and was replaced with a neo-Gothic building, which was consecrated in 1867. Because of the <b>annex</b> <b>to</b> the <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> {{in the west and}} a completely new constructed nave, the present day sacral building was built from 1959 to 1961 after the plans of the architect Luwig Geith. At 8 December 1959 there was a fire in the neighbourhood and the church spire was damaged. This church spire was rebuilt and, because of the lean format with a copped ending, it is called the pen of God.|$|R
50|$|The school {{continued}} {{to run as}} a grammar school until November 1967, when the then Archbishop of Liverpool, Dr. Andrew Beck, approached the sisters {{to see if they}} would take over a nearby secondary school that had not yet opened, St. Paul's Catholic Secondary Modern. They agreed, and in September 1968 it was <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> their <b>existing</b> <b>building.</b> It was the first co-educational voluntary aided school in the Archdiocese, opened under the new title of Maricourt Catholic High School, with Sister Mary Magdalen as headmistress. She retired at Christmas in 1989, and was succeeded by Sister Mary Teresa, who led the school until 2007. The school is now the largest Catholic secondary school in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton. A jubilee mass was celebrated on 21 September 2007 in the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. The chief celebrant was the Archbishop of Liverpool, Patrick Kelly, with thousands of friends, students, past and present attending the ceremony to celebrate the milestone.|$|R
5000|$|Jose de Asis {{introduced}} few improvements when {{he became}} president in 1904. He built a new church to replace the old one destroyed by storm in 1905. After de Asis, Capt. Diego Gagan came back to position followed by Mateo Almozara, Matero Apordo, Sisenando Pineda and Andres Jardin. President Gregorio Abeja built a new municipal building and a new semi-concrete schoolhouse during his term. Untoward incidents happened during President Fortunato Oblena which hindered the realization of any remarkable accomplishments. On November 1934, a strong typhoon hit the municipality which brought down the church, houses and took some lives. In 1935, the notorious bandit Asidillo hit the town and people were confined under martial law. People were in constant fear which pushed a military campaign in the area. On December 31, 1935, Lt. Jesus Vargas {{put an end to}} the reign of terror when he was able to kill Asidillo in Brgy. Caldong. The Second World War also affected the peaceful municipality. Ramon Villaverde was on his second term as mayor when the war broke out forcing him to flee to the hills. His post was briefly occupied by Apolinario Villaverde but the Executive Commission reappointed Ramon Villaverde on September 1, 1942 to act as mayor during the Japanese occupation. He ruled tactfully during his term to help spare the locals from the Japanese onslaught and the recognized guerrillas. Began the occupation conflicts, Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army sending the operations in Sampaloc to adding recognized guerrillas and fought the Imperial Japanese Army. He was again reappointed by President Jose P. Laurel after the liberation and was in office until June 30, 1946. President Manuel Roxas assigned Sixto Obnamia as acting municipal mayor after the Americans granted Philippines Independence on July 4, 1946. During his reign, the HUKBALAHAP became active in the town. The situation asked for a leader of tact and foresight. It was during this time in 1947 when Paterno Abcede came to light. He led Sampaloc for another two consecutive terms before becoming a Board Member of Quezon in 1959. Fidel V. Torres came to power in the municipality in 1959 when he won the mayoralty bid against Dr. Rodolfo Veluz. He was re-elected again in 1963, defeating Rodolfo S. Obnamia, son of former Mayor Sixto Obnamia. The tides, however, turned to Rodolfo Obnamia’s favor when he was put into power in 1967 election, this time winning against Fidel Torres. It was in his term when the right wing portion of the municipal <b>building</b> was <b>annexed</b> <b>to</b> the <b>existing</b> <b>building.</b> This was called the Executive Hall which served as the session hall of the Sangguniang Bayan.|$|R
