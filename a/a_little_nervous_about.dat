500|$|Jepsen's second studio {{album was}} {{initially}} {{planned to be}} released on February 14, 2012; however, she chose not to release it {{because she wanted to}} make sure she [...] "got the second CD right. I think I got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the idea of the sophomore being a little less-than because it's so rushed. So I wanted to give myself the time to not feel that pressure." [...] She then worked with songwriter Josh Ramsay and producer Ryan Stewart on most of the album's tracks. Jepsen's songwriting process was inspired by her life and friends. After the recording sessions were completed, Curiosity was announced as a full-length album, with a digital release date confirmed for February 14, 2012. A few days before its official release, however, the label decided to change the format of the album, turning it into an extended play. The songs cut from the album [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Alice In Wonderland", [...] "Dear Julian", [...] "Europe" [...] and [...] "Angels" [...] came to have their preview on iTunes Canada, before having changed album to EP.|$|E

500|$|Accepting {{an award}} at the 2005 Q Awards, Ono {{mentioned}} that Lennon had once felt insecure about his songwriting. She had responded, [...] "You're a good songwriter.

5000|$|On October 22, 2016, {{it became}} known that {{in the midst of}} his tour in Germany, the Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, gave an {{interview}} to the journalist Jenny Pérez, on the television network Deutsche Welle, where several topics were talked about, among them the scandal of the [...] "misnamed" [...] Panama Papers. The president took several minutes to say that there has been [...] "progress" [...] in transparency and have signed many agreements to exchange tax information and that tax evasion is a global problem and not just Panama's. Varela was losing the serenity that he had when starting the interview, as the journalist questioned about the scandal, he even was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> when asked <b>about</b> the link he has with Ramón Fonseca Mora, managing partner of the firm Mossack-Fonseca and recognized it's his friend.|$|R

60|$|He {{was very}} intent {{to do the}} thing that was {{expected}} of him. His nerves and muscles were quivering, his mind was perhaps a little confused, but he felt neither fear nor anger.

He was desirous of immediate action, he knew he must not think too much in detail of the huge complexity of the struggle about him lest be should be paralysed by the sense of its intricacy.|$|E
60|$|And {{so it was}} indeed: she was {{now only}} ten inches high, and her face brightened up {{at the thought that}} she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.

6000|$|We tried {{all sorts}} of subjects, but they dropped one after the other. The elder gentlemen seemed {{to be afraid of}} {{committing}} themselves by talking too freely within hearing of us juniors, and we, on our side, restrained our youthful flow of spirits and youthful freedom of conversation out of deference to our host, who seemed once or twice to be feeling <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the continued propriety of our behavior in the presence of his respectable guests. To make matters worse, we had dined at a sensible hour. When the bottles made their first round at dessert, the clock on the mantel-piece only struck eight. I counted the strokes, and felt certain, from the expression of his face, that the other junior guest, who sat on one side of me at the round table, was counting them also. When we came to the final eight, we exchanged looks of despair. [...] "Two hours more of this! What on earth is to become of us?" [...] In the language of the eyes, that was exactly what we said to each other.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Polly, undeterred by a {{sense of}} grave damage done to his nose, pressed the attack in front, the two young men in violet and blue skirmished on Uncle Jim's flanks, the man in white and black checks sought still further {{outflanking}} possibilities, and two of the apprentice boys ran for oars. The gold-spectacled gentleman, as if inspired, came down the wooden steps again, seized the tablecloth of the jam and egg party, lugged it from under the crockery with inadequate precautions against breakage, and advanced with compressed lips, curious lateral crouching movements, swift flashings of his glasses, and a general suggestion of bull-fighting in his pose and gestures. Uncle Jim was kept busy, and unable to plan his retreat with any strategic soundness. He was moreover manifestly <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the river in his rear. He gave ground in a curve, and so came right across the rapidly abandoned camp of the family in mourning, crunching a teacup under his heel, oversetting the teapot, and finally tripping backwards over the hamper. The eel flew out at a tangent from his hand and became a mere looping relic on the sward.|$|E

However, nothing more happened so she decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.|$|E

60|$|She {{felt very}} slender and young and rather unclothed about {{the arms and}} neck, {{in spite of the}} six hundred pound pearl {{necklace}} that had been given to her just as she stood before the mirror in her white-and-gold dinner dress ready to start. She had to look down at that dress ever and again and at her shining arms to remind herself that she wasn't still in schoolgirl clothes, and it seemed to her there was not another woman in the room who was not fairly entitled to send her off to bed at any moment. She had been <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the details of the dinner, but there was nothing strange or difficult but caviare, and in that case she waited for some one else to begin. The Chartersons were there, which was very reassuring, and the abundant flowers on the table were a sort of protection. The man on her right was very nice, gently voluble, and evidently quite deaf, so that she had merely to make kind respectful faces at him. He talked to her most of the time, and described the peasant costumes in Marken and Walcheren. And Mr. Blenker, with a fine appreciation of Sir Isaac's watchful temperament and his own magnetism, spoke to her three times and never looked at her once all through the entertainment.|$|E
6000|$|P.S. The hand of Providence guided me, after {{finishing}} the preceding, {{to which the}} present is postscriptal, to keep it over a few days instead of posting it directly: so possible I thought it that I might have something more definite to add--and I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the way I had left our question. Behold then I have then to add that I have just received your letter of August 4--which so simplifies our situation that this accompanying stuff becomes almost superfluous. But I have let it go {{for the sake of}} the interest, the almost top-heavy mass of response that it embodies. Let us put it then that all is for the moment for the best in this worst of possible worlds; all the more that had I not just now been writing you exactly as I am, I should probably--and thanks, precisely, to the lapse of days--be stammering to you the ungraceful truth that, after I wrote you, my tale of terror did, as I was so more than half fearing, give way beneath me. It has, in short, broken down for the present. I am laying it away on the shelf for the sake of something that is in it, but that I am now too embarrassed and preoccupied to devote more time to pulling out. I really shouldn't wonder if it be not still, in time and place, to make the world sit up; but the curtain is dropped for the present. All thanks for your full and prompt statement of how the scene has shifted for you. There is no harm done, and I don't regard the three weeks spent on my renewed wrestle as wasted--I have, within three or four days, rebounded from them with such relief, vaulting into another saddle and counting, D.V., on a straighter run. I have two begun novels: which will give me plenty to do for the present--they being of the type of the [...] "serious" [...] which I am too delighted to see you speak of as lifting again ... its downtrodden head. I mean, at any rate, I assure you, to lift mine! Your extremely, touchingly kind offer to find moments of your precious time for [...] "handling" [...] something I might send you is altogether too momentous for me to let me fail of feeling almost ashamed that I haven't something--the ghost or t'other stuff--in form, already, to enable me to respond to your generosity [...] "as meant." [...] But heaven only knows what may happen yet! For the moment, I must peg away at what I have in hand--biggish stuff, I fear, in bulk and possible unserialisability, to saddle you withal. But thanks, thanks thanks. Delighted to hear of one of your cold waves--the newspapers here invidiously mentioning none but your hot. We have them all, moreover, réchauffées, as soon as you have done with them; and we are just sitting down to one now.
