They meet Rita, Howie, Joe, and Gibbis, who have also appeared in the hotel, without <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> they arrived. The Doctor learns that each hotel room contains the greatest fear of someone who has been in the hotel, and that a minotaur-like creature is feeding off their fear.|$|E

Fry has said, [...] "I think we all agree that nobody in this universe understands QI's scoring system." [...] John Lloyd, QIs creator, has, on one occasion, admitted that not even he has <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> the scoring system works, but there is someone who is paid to check on the scores. According to the Series A DVD, guests are allowed the right of appeal if they believe their score is wrong, but none has so far exercised that right.|$|E

2500|$|According to a {{multiple}} sourced VeloNews article published on 20 July 2007, mountain bike racer Whitney Richards accused Rasmussen {{of trying to}} get him to transport a box, which Rasmussen had told Richards contained his favourite cycling shoes, to his training base in Italy in early 2002. The box turned out to contain packets of Hemopure, a bovine-hemoglobin-based blood substitute which is not currently approved for human use outside South Africa and did not become commercially available there until January 2006, and which might potentially have been used in a doping program. At the time there was no screening test for Hemopure; it is, however, banned by the WADA. Richards said he destroyed the Hemopure, at which Rasmussen is said to have grown angry and said to Richards [...] "Have you <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> much that shit cost?" ...|$|E

Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but {{he knew what he was}} doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you have <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E

50|$|The other idea, {{which is}} the idea that's locked away in Shapirov's brain, is to couple Planck's {{constant}} {{with the speed of}} light, so that when one is decreased, the other is increased.
