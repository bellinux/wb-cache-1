The aim of this research was to study the difference of forced vital capacity (FVC) on workers between foundry and fitting-shop in “ED” aluminium cast industry, Giwangan Yogyakarta. Method: This was an observational research using cross sectional design. The population was 15 workers on each location. The data was collected using questionnaire, measuring of lung function and total dust content. The data would be analyzed using Mann-Whitney test. Result: The result showed that the average of total dust content on those location was 0. 65 mg/m 3 and 2. 75 mg/m 3 orderly. This was still below the threshold value (10 mg/m 3). The measuring of lung function showed that 73. 35 % of workers in foundry  and 66. 6 % of workers in fitting-shop had  FVC decreasing with the average of FVC was 75. 80 % and 77. 27 % in order.

40|$|Objectives This {{study has}} {{researched}} {{the significance of}} histologically raised findings and <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analyses {{in the context of}} claiming the recognition of and thus compensation for an asbestos-associated occupational disease. Material and Methods For this approach, all findings from the German Mesothelioma Register in 2015 that included <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analyses were evaluated and were compared with information on asbestos fiber exposure at work based on fiber years, and with the results of radiological findings. Results For 68 insured persons, recognition of an asbestos-induced lung disease according to Section 4104 of the German Ordinance on Occupational Diseases (Berufskrankheitenverordnung – BKV) could be recommended {{solely on the basis of}} the histological examinations of lung tissues and complementary <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analyses. Neither did the calculation of the cumulative asbestos dust exposure at work yield 25 fiber years, nor could bridge findings (e. g., plaques) be identified. In addition, the autopsies of 12 patients revealed plaques that had not been diagnosed during radiological examinations. These results show that – irrespective of the prescribed working techniques and radiological diagnosis – pathological/anatomical and histological diagnostics are often the only way for the insureds to demonstrate the causal connection between asbestos and their disease. Even after long intervals of up to 40 years post last exposure, the asbestos fibers would still be easily detectable in the lung tissues evaluated. Conclusions Whenever suitable tissue is available, it should be examined for mild asbestosis with the aid of a <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analysis.

In the context of health insurance, the <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analysis and the resulting proof of the presence of asbestosis often constitute one option of providing evidence of an occupational disease.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, the {{influence}} of humidity on dust explosions of metallic (aluminium) and organic materials (icing sugar, polyethylene and magnesium stearate) has been studied. The impact of pre-humidification of powders on their ignition sensitivity, their volume resistivity and charge decay time has been assessed. The influence of humidity on explosion severity has also been studied by two methods: on the one hand, the dust sample was stored in a controlled workstation at constant relative humidity; on the other hand, the dry dust was dispersed in a humidity controlled atmosphere in the vessel. As expected, the effect of humidity strongly depends on the chemical nature of the particles. Experiments on powders volume resistivity and charge decay time have shown typical trends but have especially pointed out the inadequacy of some standards.

Also, this study defines the total and respirable <b>aluminium</b> <b>dust</b> fractions in two different potrooms, and correlates their concentrations with biological indicators in this group of workers. METHODS: Air was sampled at defined work sites. Non-destructive and conventional techniques were used to find total and respirable aluminium content of the dust. Blood and urine was collected from 84 volunteers employed at various work stations throughout the smelter and from two different cohorts of controls matched for sex, age, and socioeconomic status. Aluminium in serum samples and urine specimens was measured by flameless atomic absorption with a PE 4100 ZL spectrometer. RESULTS: The correlation of aluminium concentrations in serum and urine samples with the degree of exposure was assessed for three arbitrary exposure categories; low (0. 036 mg Al/m 3), medium (0. 35 mg Al/m 3) and high (1. 47 mg Al/m 3) as found in {{different areas of the}} smelter. At medium and high exposure, the ratio of respirable to total <b>aluminium</b> in the <b>dust</b> samples varied significantly. At high exposure, serum aluminium, although significantly raised, was still within the normal range of an unexposed population. The workers with low exposure excreted aluminium in urine at levels significantly higher than the controls, but still within the normal range of the population. However, potroom workers with medium and high exposure had significantly higher urinary aluminium than the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that only urinary aluminium constitutes a practical index of occupational exposure at or above 0. 35 mg Al/m 3, and that the respirable fraction of the dust may {{play a major role in}} the biological response to exposure to aluminium in a smelter environment...|$|R
