40|$|A {{series of}} {{ultrasonic}} assisted <b>acid</b> <b>washing</b> and thermal desorption tests {{were performed on}} sludge and other solid matrices with the aim to assay these removal technologies and {{to determine if the}} application of low frequency ultrasound was effective to enhance mercury removal. Unpolluted dredging sludge, 820 K calcinated dredging sludge, silica and alumina were characterized, polluted with a known concentration of mercury and treated both by <b>acid</b> <b>washing</b> and thermal desorption with and without low frequency ultrasound application. The <b>acid</b> <b>washing</b> was carried out by a 4 % HNO 3 acid solution and the thermal desorption was performed in a 370 - 620 K range. X-ray semi-quantitative analysis of dredging sludge before and after <b>acid</b> <b>washing</b> and granulometric curves of the matrices after the ultrasonic treatment were considered in order to evidence chemical or physical changes during these treatments. Total residual mercury measurements were carried out before and after sonication. Results showed not measurable <b>acid</b> <b>washing</b> extraction from polluted dredging sludge, a little (3 %) extraction from 820 K heat-treated sludge and a significant (10 - 20 %) extraction from alumina and silica within 120 min of treatment. The ultrasound application gave generally poor improvement of the mercury removal. On the contrary thermal desorption of mercury was somewhat effective for alumina, silica and heat-treated dredging sludge samples in which mercury removal was 30 - 40 % at 370 K and 90 - 99 % at 570 K. Likewise ultrasound application did not improve desorption. Instead, the thermal treatment of dredging sludge had a negligible amount of mercury desorption at 370 K but it reached 95 % at 570 K. The application of ultrasound improved the thermal extraction of 25 % in the 470 - 520 K range of temperature...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{efficient}} {{method for}} purification of Yard-Glass Shaped Boron Nitride NanoTubes (YG-BNNTs) fabricated via a Chemical Vapour Reaction (CVR) route has been developed. Impurities including carbon, Boron Nitride (BN), and Fe {{species in the}} pristine YG-BNNT sample are removed by a combined physical and chemical procedure which involves ultrasonication, high temperature oxidation, hot-water <b>washing</b> and <b>acid</b> <b>washing.</b> The samples {{at different stages of}} the purification process are monitored using X-Ray powder Diffraction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The results reveal that the carbon and BN impurities could be easily eliminated. However, the catalyst nanoparticles (Fe 3 C) encaged in the tubes prove to be effectively shielded from oxidation and acid corrosion. Although the content of catalyst nanoparticles could be satisfactorily reduced to about 1. 0 wt % by prolonged ultrasonication and <b>acid</b> <b>washing,</b> a small number of such magnetic nanoparticles are still left in the final purified YG-BNNTs. The YG-BNNTs exhibit a typical ferromagnetic behaviour even after a longtime oxidizing and <b>acid</b> <b>washing</b> treatment, indicating that they could be potentially used for harsh-environment magnetic devices...|$|R

40|$|Treatment of Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is {{challenging}} {{due to its}} hydrophobic nature and {{the stability of the}} carbon-chlorine bond, particularly in aromatic molecules. Zero Valent Iron (ZVI) has been used as an effective in situ passive treatment process for PCP contaminated groundwater. However, ZVI applications can experience a decrease in degradation rates over time due to: ZVI surface passivation, the formation of non-conducting iron oxides on the ZVI surface, and the accumulation of less chlorinated intermediates. In this study, ZVI modification by <b>acid</b> <b>washing</b> and formation of bimetallic systems by the incorporation of Nickel (Ni) was explored to overcome these limitations. PCP degradation was investigated in batch tests using ZVI as received (unwashed or UW) and <b>acid</b> <b>washed</b> (AW) ZVI. Two forms of bimetals were tested - one in which the Ni powder and ZVI (UW or AW) were physically mixed (NiS/Fe) and the other in which the Ni was coated onto <b>acid</b> <b>washed</b> ZVI (NiC/Fe) by reacting ZVI with NiSO 4 solutions. PCP dechlorination was confirmed by gas chromatography quantifying PCP and all intermediates formed. Raman spectroscopy was used to characterise the ZVI surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Effect of {{hydrothermal}} treatment, <b>acid</b> <b>washing</b> and {{annealing temperature}} {{on the structure}} and morphology of TiO 2 nanotubes during the formation process was assessed. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis were conducted to describe the formation and characterization of the structure and morphology of nanotubes. Hydrothermal treatment of TiO 2 precursor nanoparticles and <b>acid</b> <b>washing</b> are fundamental to form and define the nanotubes structure. Hydrothermal treatment causes {{a change in the}} crystallinity of the precursor nanoparticles from anatase phase to a monoclinic phase, which characterizes the TiO 2 nanosheets structure. The <b>acid</b> <b>washing</b> promotes the formation of high purity nanotubes due to Na+ is exchanged from the titanate structure to the hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution. The annealing temperature affects the dimensions, structure and the morphology of the nanotubes. Annealing temperatures in the range of 400 °C and 600 °C are optimum to maintain a highly stable tubular morphology of nanotubes. Additionally, nanotubes conserve the physicochemical properties of the precursor Degussa P 25 nanoparticles. Temperatures greater than 600 °C alter the morphology of nanotubes from tubular to an irregular structure of nanoparticles, which are bigger than those of the precursor material, i. e., the crystallinity turn from anatase phase to rutile phase inducing the collapse of the nanotubes.

50|$|Stonewashed jeans are jeans {{that have}} been treated to produce a faded, worn appearance. This is usually {{accomplished}} either by washing the jeans with pumice in a rotating drum, or also by using chemicals to create the appearance {{without the use of}} a rotating drum. The expanding cost of importing pumice stone from Italy, Greece and Turkey led to extensive mining of pumice deposits in California, Arizona, and New Mexico, triggering a negative response from American ecologist groups. The reduction of pumice usage and the growing disposal of its chemically-tainted residue triggered a search for novel methods, notably the use of alternative abrading materials or machines and the use of cellulase enzymes. Stonewashed jeans were a popular 1970s fashion trend, before commercial <b>acid</b> <b>wash</b> denim (discussed below) was introduced in the 1980s.
