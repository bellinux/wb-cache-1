5|$|Feminist {{theory can}} also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a {{critique}} of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters <b>and</b> <b>slaves</b> formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.|$|E
5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards <b>and</b> <b>slaves</b> was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would prevent this. Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to hold his position.|$|E

Thomas Hancock was the {{proprietor}} of a firm known as the House of Hancock, which imported manufactured goods from Britain and exported rum, whale oil, and fish. Thomas Hancock's highly successful business made him one of Boston's richest and best-known residents. He and Lydia, along with several servants <b>and</b> <b>slaves,</b> lived in Hancock Manor on Beacon Hill.

5|$|From the Early Preclassic, Maya {{society was}} sharply {{divided between the}} elite and commoners. As {{population}} increased over time, various sectors of society became increasingly specialized, and political organization became increasingly complex. By the Late Classic, when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected in a complex web of political hierarchies, the wealthy segment of society multiplied. A middle class may have developed that included artisans, low ranking priests and officials, merchants, and soldiers. Commoners included farmers, servants, labourers, <b>and</b> <b>slaves.</b> According to indigenous histories, land was held communally by noble houses or clans. Such clans held that the land was {{the property of the}} clan ancestors, and such ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{registered}} marketplace merchants had a {{very low}} social status and were often subject to additional restrictions. Emperor Gaozu passed laws levying higher taxes, forbidding merchants from wearing silk, and barring their descendants from holding public office. These laws were difficult to enforce. Emperor Wu targeted both the registered and unregistered merchants with higher taxes. While registered merchants {{were not allowed to}} own land, if they broke this law their land <b>and</b> <b>slaves</b> would be confiscated. However, wealthy unregistered merchants owned large tracts of land. Emperor Wu significantly reduced the economic influence of great merchants by openly competing with them in the marketplace, where he set up government-managed shops that sold commodities collected from the merchants as property taxes.|$|E
5|$|Like {{elsewhere}} in Madagascar, Antankarana society was traditionally {{divided into three}} classes: nobles, commoners <b>and</b> <b>slaves.</b> Slavery was abolished under the French colonial administration but families often retain their historic affiliations. In traditional communities, descendants of nobles live on the northern side of the village and non-nobles live in the southern part. The areas may be divided by a central clearing where the town hall is often situated; if the village also has a zomba (house reserved for royalty), it would traditionally be located here. Intermarriage across classes is common among the Antankarana, and most can claim a family relation {{to a member of}} the noble class. Historically, commoners were further sub-divided into caste-like groups called karazana ("types of people") based on their form of livelihood.|$|E

5|$|Mason {{was born}} in 1725, most likely {{in what is now}} Fairfax County, Virginia. His father died when he was young, and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age. He married in 1750, built Gunston Hall, and lived the life of a country squire, supervising his lands, family, <b>and</b> <b>slaves.</b> He briefly served in the House of Burgesses and {{involved}} himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor George Washington. As tensions grew between Britain and the American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, and used his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause, finding ways to work around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the pro-independence Fourth Virginia Convention of 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention of 1776.|$|E
5|$|Neaira was {{certainly}} living with Phrynion in Athens by 373BC, {{when he took}} her to a feast given by the general Chabrias to celebrate his victory in the Pythian Games. During this celebration, Apollodorus says, Neaira was sexually assaulted by the guests <b>and</b> <b>slaves</b> of Chabrias while she was drunk and asleep. Due to this and other mistreatment by Phrynion, in 372BC Neaira left his household and went to Megara, taking with her her clothing and jewellery, two maids, and other possessions belonging to Phrynion.|$|E
5|$|Nobles, {{who were}} {{believed}} to be direct descendants of the descended person from heaven, lived in tongkonans, while commoners lived in less lavish houses (bamboo shacks called banua). Slaves lived in small huts, which had to be built around their owner's tongkonan. Commoners might marry anyone, but nobles preferred to marry in-family to maintain their status. Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles. Commoners <b>and</b> <b>slaves</b> were prohibited from having death feasts. Despite close kinship and status inheritance, there was some social mobility, as marriage or change in wealth could affect an individuals status. Wealth was counted by the ownership of water buffaloes.|$|E
