[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] By conducting a controlled experimental design, this study examined the effectiveness of conflict positioning, which was defined by Cameron (2004) as positioning an organization favorably in anticipation of conflicts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>proactive</b> <b>approach</b> in a crisis communication. Using multiple sample structural equation modeling (SEM), this study tested noninvariance across groups between people exposed to news coverage with a conflict positioning strategy and those not exposed to a conflict positioning strategy. The study showed multi-group models representing differences of people's evaluation process of a crisis across conditions of presence or absence of conflict positioning. From the model, this study found that there was a difference in the relationship between cognitive attitude (impression) and affective attitude (trust) across groups. Not only did this study show the robustness of the conflict positioning framework in the contingency theory, but also this study presented the public's evaluation process of a crisis at a glance. Theoretically, this study showed the applicability of conflict positioning <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>proactive</b> <b>approach</b> to the literatures on pre-crisis communication.

It {{focuses on the}} products with nutrition and health claims (NHCs) and {{the analysis of the}} main consumers' characteristics which influence their awareness and knowledge about NHCs, their attitudes toward products with NHC and their purchase intentions. Different socio-demographic factors that influence consumers' behavior were investigated. Education, gender, age and income of the respondents are the key factors which influence awareness, knowledge and consumption. As those products are closely related to consumers' health, we presented the results based on the differences in health status of the respondents. Main findings show that the respondents with health problems do not consume those products as often as others, which is the outcome of a low level of nutrition knowledge. This represents a major restraining factor for the increase in consumption.

This approach has more significance {{in light of the}} increasing climatic hazard patterns and the climate scenarios projected for different hazard prone countries in the world. The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) has been monitoring the food security issues in the sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and in Haiti. FEWS NET monitors the rainfall and moisture availability conditions with the help of NOAA RFE 2 data for deriving food security status in Africa. This paper highlights the efforts in using satellite estimated rainfall inputs to develop drought vulnerability models in the drought prone areas in Malawi. The satellite RFE 2 based SPI corresponding to the critical tasseling and silking phases (in the months of January, February, and March) were statistically regressed with drought-induced yield losses at the district level. The analysis has shown that the drought conditions in February and early March lead to most damage to maize yields in this region. The district-wise vulnerabilities to drought were up scaled to obtain a regional maize vulnerability model for southern Malawi. The results would help in establishing an early monitoring mechanism for drought impact assessment, give the decision makers additional time to assess seasonal outcomes, and identify potential food-related hazards in Malawi...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{planning}} in Europe and in Flanders is changing fundamentally. In the Europe 2020 strategy (2010 - 2020) Europe introduced {{the idea of}} <b>a</b> ‘place-based approach’ <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alternative or addition to traditional spatial planning. It refers to the context-dependent nature of efficiency and equity problems that the policy deals with, and {{to the fact that}} design of integrated interventions must be tailored to places, as it largely depends on the knowledge and preferences of the people living in it. Nevertheless, little research has examined the use of the place-based approach in Flanders. In this paper the place-based approach, also called area development, is referred to <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>proactive</b> planning <b>approach,</b> characterized by an intensive coordination of initiators, plans and projects in one specific area, in order to implement the plans and projects in the field.

Design/Methodology/Approach An interdisciplinary review of literature was undertaken as current literature on the topic of values as it relates to conflict was very limited in scope. The key concepts investigated were the connection between values (including alignment and congruence) and decision-making, behaviour, collaboration, strategy, prioritization and conflict within an organization. Research was guided using Constructionism, Chaos and Complexity theories within a framework of Chaordic Systems Thinking. Findings Provides documentation that previous values research practices have been fragmented and have had limited practical applications. Support is provided indicating values alignment fosters collaboration and could be a proactive approach to conflict management. Research Implications/Limitations No long-term studies were found on the topic of inquiry although some documentation on business performance is starting to appear.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{offers a}} theoretical and socio-political {{reflection of the}} meaning of happiness in times of crisis and explores the role of Community Psychology <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key and <b>proactive</b> <b>approach</b> to understanding human relationships and planning suitable transformations. We will explore the main social inequalities emerging nowadays in Europe, such as the suffering welfare state, beginning with the heated debate emerging over the last decade among epidemiologists, sociologist and economists. We imagine possible ways out following Rifkin and his theory about the third industrial revolution, which moves towards the empathy economy, requiring high levels of participation, involvement of all social actors, and new attitudes in decision makers and citizens. Proximity plays a relevant importance: cooperation with neighbours becomes a strategic asset for better living conditions such as, being both producers and users of social services. This paper proposes three areas of action: the social capital; the enterprise <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social factor, not only economical – resource producer (and we refer to Olivetti, an Italian entrepreneur famous for his anticipatory vision and relationship between local and global, and his building, not only of an innovative enterprise but also of a new community setting); and the local government and the role of policy makers. These areas may be explored to generate strategies of intervention thanks to Community Psychology, which enables the provision a sound theoretical and methodological framework so as to move towards collective well-being and happiness...|$|R
40|$|An {{energetic}} Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector plays {{a pivotal}} role in the growth of any economy <b>as</b> it provides <b>a</b> number of benefits for economies, irrespective of their level of development. Recognising this reality, governments around the world increasingly encourage and support SMEs as part of their overall national development strategies (Abdullah & bin Bakar, 2000), and Sri Lanka is no exception. The commitment of the government of Sri Lanka to the strengthening of the country's SME sector is clearly stipulated in its national economic policies. Despite this external push from the government, SMEs in Sri Lanka have yet to improve their sustainability (Wijesinghe et al., 2011, 2012). Prior research suggests a positive relationship between strategic planning and business performance. As such, it is highly likely that internal factors such as having formalised plans among SMEs could help to facilitate their survival and growth. The {{purpose of this paper is}} three-fold: 1) to explore, by means of an empirical investigation, the strategic behaviour of Sri Lankan SMEs; 2) to examine the reasons for adopting such behaviour; and 3) to ascertain whether their strategic behaviour is related to their performance in business. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, a mixed methods research approach is used. Ansoff's (1988) model, which indicates that strategic behaviour can be reactive, proactive-ad hoc or proactive-systematic, is adapted to analyse the data collected from a survey of 150 selected SMEs and eight case studies. The respondents are the owners or senior managers responsible for long-term planning and decision-making. Findings reveal that less than 25 % (32) of the respondents are using formal strategic plans. Further analysis confirms that these same respondents, classified <b>as</b> employing <b>a</b> <b>proactive</b> systematic <b>approach,</b> experienced growth in their operations...|$|R
40|$|Given {{that any}} {{construction}} project is inherently a human endeavour, {{it follows that}} issues of trust are significant {{in terms of the}} stakeholder interactions that deliver eventual project outcomes.   Previous research indicates that the relational basis upon which projects are undertaken are intended to influence the likelihood of trusting relationships between stakeholders.  Thus, experiences of trust in a construction project environment are likely to be influenced by the contextual specifics of respective transactional and relational contracting (RC) procurement mechanisms, given the divergent theoretical principles upon which they are founded.  The influence of trust has therefore been examined through the lived experiences of construction practitioners.   A phenomenological interview study consisting of thirty-five (35) participants was conducted with sensitivity to the procurement of experiences being recounted. Issues of trust were shown to be integral to stakeholder experiences in both procurement environments, with the benefits of trust acknowledged in many instances.  However, little understanding was evident regarding methods for building and maintaining trust, nor for repairing trust when problems arose. Importantly, despite the differing principles that underpin transactional and relational procurement, and particularly the contention that relational procurement would increase trust between trading partners, this was not evident; with individual personalities and appropriate risk apportionment shown to be greater influences upon the likelihood of trusting relationships.   It is reasonable to conjecture that relational contracts actually diminish the need for trust, given that the objective is to reduce uncertainty through formulaic approaches to risk distribution and reward; the absence of risk negates the need for trust.   Ultimately, the potential to deliver improved project outcomes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of <b>proactive</b> <b>approaches</b> to developing and maintaining trust, as well as repairing trust after difficulties, was shown to apply under all procurement conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Green {{supply chain}} {{management}} has emerged <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>proactive</b> <b>approach</b> for improving environmental performance of processes and products {{in accordance with the}} requirements of environmental regulations. Various approaches for implementing green {{supply chain management}} practices has been proposed and recognized in previous literatures, yet no investigation has identified {{the reliability and validity of}} such approaches particularly in electronic industry. This study examines the consistency approaches by factor analysis that determines the adoption and implementation of green supply chain management in Taiwanese electronic industry. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method is applied to prioritize the relative importance of four dimensions and twenty approaches among nine enterprises in electronic industry. The findings indicate that these enterprises would emphasize on supplier management performance in the crucial role of implementing green supply chain management. Establishing an environmental database of products, asking for product testing report and top management support are among the most important approaches. The results for the implications of green supply chain management implementation in electronic industry investigated in this work generate a generic hierarchy model for decision-makers who can prioritize those approaches for implementing green supply chain management in Taiwan.

40|$|Introduction: Many, indeed {{probably}} most, {{decisions made}} in societies have intended and unintended health outcomes; this alone provides sufficient reasoning {{to ensure that}} health professionals are engaged in these decisions rather than deal with the consequences at a later date. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) provides one approach to ensuring that health outcomes of decisions {{are taken into account}} (Harris- Roxas et al., 2012). Harris- Roxas et al. (2012) show that historically HIA has emerged from three strands: environmental health concerns (where the environment has an effect on human health); the social determinants of health (where the concern is the ‘upstream’ causes of ‘downstream’ health conditions); and a focus on health equity (where interventions can address or promote health equity through planning). When any of these strands are performed effectively, or even more, when the three might be combined, the capacity to produce a powerful analysis of health consequences can be envisaged. HIA has considerable value <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>proactive</b> and systematic <b>approach</b> to identifying the health impacts of projects, programmes, plans and policies, including those associated with resource development (Utzinger et al., 2005; Winkler et al., 2012; Parkes, 2016). An overarching theme in the development of HIA has been the engagement by the public health sector in non- health sector activities (Harris- Roxas et al., 2012; Harris- Roxas and Harris, 2013; Lee et al., 2013), and this intrinsically demands interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches capable of seeking both to minimize negative health effects and to enhance positive health effects (Winkler et al., 2010). In their work on sustainability assessment, Bond et al. (2012) expand on this latter point, outlining a series of reasons why more integrative, deliberative and positive approaches to ‘impacts’ are desirable. They cite the shortfalls of focusing on mitigation and minimizing impacts (<b>as</b> compared to <b>a</b> systems approach), and emphasize the value of going beyond the pillars approach of sustainability (which encourages trade- offs), and working to deliver net sustainability gains (through greater system health and resilience over the long term) ...|$|R

This thesis has been written at LNEC, Portugal, {{in cooperation with the}} AWARE-P team, who is developing a software to deal with future planning of rehabilitation of the network. The work has been to collect the need of data in their modules, looking at data collected from other rehabilitation softwares and comparing it to what is available in Gemini VA to value the use of Gemini VA for rehabilitation planning support. Planning tools for rehabilitation of water and wastewater networks is still in the developing phase. The programs are often data hungry, and collecting data is time demanding. Gemini VA represent a good software for collecting base data used in rehabilitation planning, and is the most used water and wastewater maintenance software in Norway. It's important to identify the limits and possibilities of the software for future development, and the goal of this thesis has been to look into improvements of the software to give better data at a lower time cost. In the Asset Management approach the condition of the network must first be decided. This analysis can be done with basic data such as material, construction year, dimension and condition factor from surveys done on the network (CCTV etc). When the condition is determined, assessments within cost, performance and risk can be completed at the strategic, tactical and operational level. Gemini VA can provide a lot of base data, but even though the data is available, the preparations is time demanding, and the only data validation feature available, is a material-dimension-construction yearvalidation. Therefore historical data, {{and the rest of the}} structural data, must be validated manually. Gemini VA should try to move towards an Asset Managment approach by including more validation reports, pre made statistical reports, and visualisation effects of the statistics. The software should also include cost, more information on stormwater assets, water quality tests and more pumpingstation and treatment plant information. Gemini VA can be used to collect data for a national statistical database for utilities with low or poor record of historical data to retrieve statistical numbers for planning (failure rate for different materials, etc) ...|$|R

The objective of the consortium was to research opportunities to advance a more sustainable, yet still profitable, fashion industry. The final stage of the project involved developing practice-based approaches through physical exhibition prototypes, which formed the basis of the project’s online exhibition, The Textile Toolbox (Earley & Goldsworthy, 2014). Here we discuss two of these design prototypes which both explored ‘designing for cyclability’ <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>proactive</b> <b>approach</b> to improving the retention of material value within ‘circular fashion systems’. Designing in order to enable fully joined up cycles of material use is the ultimate aim for both approaches, but this ‘speed’ of cycle creates very different challenges on which to make informed and appropriate design choices. The two approaches are deliberately extreme opposites, with ‘short-life’ closed-loop garments explored as complementary to ‘long-life’ user engagement strategies. Both can ultimately be argued to have an ‘extending’ affect on materials in the value-chain; one by keeping products in use over multiple cycles in perpetuity, the other by extending the single use cycle of a product over time. By exploring this polarisation of ‘speeds and needs’ we aim to gain insights into creating an effective circular materials economy, which acknowledges the complex nature of our current and emerging fashion system...|$|E

The outcome of those who opted for right-lobe LDLT (n = 34) was compared with that of those who did not opt for LDLT (n = 16). Results: In the group that opted for right-lobe LDLT, 16 patients eventually received a live donor right-lobe graft (14 patients survived) and three patients received a cadaveric liver graft that became available while the potential live donor was undergoing evaluation (all three patients survived). Among the group who did not opt for LDLT, only one patient received a cadaveric liver graft and survived. The former group had a higher overall survival rate (17 of 34 versus one of 16). With a proactive approach, the overall transplant rate was increased from four of 50 to 20 of 50. The morbidity rate among donors was low and none died. Conclusion: Right-lobe LDLT improves the overall survival rate of patients with acute liver failure and should be considered as one of the treatment options for adult patients with acute liver failure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a framework identifying the central drivers of start-up commercialization strategy {{and the implications}} of these drivers for the firm competitiveness. I first analyze the environment outside the firm (the microeconomic and strategic conditions facing a firm that is translating its "idea" into a value proposition). Then, {{the focus is on the}} internal factors of a firm, which influence the licensing decisions, such as the financial resources or the nature of the technology (general or specific). The last chapter analyzes a case-study, based on the information collected about Frim, a Malaysian organization, which operates actively through licensing. The analysis is based on qualitative data about the commercialization of HTC, a new patented technology by Frim. The main findings suggest that firms in markets for technology tend to prefer licensing-out their patents when uncertainty is low or transaction cost is high, whereas they do not license out when their market share is low. Moreover, in order to limit competition, technologies licensed often are those of the "old generation ", already replaced by new developments or those considered not the core business. Another strategy could include the license of technology in different markets where the licensor is not present or has no interest in working. In addition, licensing can be seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>proactive</b> <b>approach</b> to the latest technological developments. A company, in fact, may sublicense the technology to make sure that this will become the industry standard and thus enjoy the fist mover advantage...|$|E
