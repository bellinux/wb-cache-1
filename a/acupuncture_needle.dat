40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the necessity {{and importance of}} enhancing the sterilization management of <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needles.</b> MethodTraditionally, <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needles</b> were cleaned manually without thermal disinfection, which often caused needle-stick injuries. To solve the problems, a special cleaning case for <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needles</b> was designed and built to help achieve optimization of the processing flow if the case is used correctly {{in the process of}} recycling, cleaning, and package checking. ResultClosed treatment of <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needles</b> reduced the percentage of needle-stick injuries to zero, and centralized management raised patients' satisfaction rate from 93 % to 98 %. ConclusionEffective sterilization of <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needles</b> is a precondition for the safe treatment of patients.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present the}} first {{investigation}} of electrical corrosion in <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needles</b> after electrical stimulation. Using scanning electron microscopy, we observed {{the occurrence of}} electrochemical corrosion {{on the surface of}} stainless steel 304 <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needles</b> after electrical stimulation in the tibial muscles of rats. Biphasic pulse electrical stimuli with 10 -Hz frequency, 1 -mA intensity and 1 -ms pulse width were applied to the needles. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method labels fragmented DNA. Positive staining using this test indicates apoptotic cells in electrically stimulated tissues. The risk of electrical corrosion was found to be less in bipolar, short-duration, low-current or voltage and short-period stimulation than in monopolar, long-duration, high-current or voltage and long-period stimulation. Evaluation with a scanning electron microscope revealed that electrical stimulation can increase the electrical corrosion of stainless steel 304 <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needles.</b> In biocompatibility studies of stainless steel 304 <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needles</b> for electrical stimulation, TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the tibial muscle within 5 days after electrical stimulation. The results of this study demonstrate that the corrosion products of stainless steel 304 <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needles</b> might affect the post-electrical stimulation tissue response...|$|R

40|$|Objective : This {{study was}} {{performed}} to compare <b>needle</b> <b>acupuncture</b> combined herbal acupuncture therapy with only <b>needle</b> <b>acupuncture</b> therapy in VAS and pain threshold. Methods : We used pressure algometer to evaluate the change of pain threshold before and after treatment. The numberical value of pressure algometer is obtained twice and averaged by identical acupuncturist. Visual analogue scale(VAS) was used to estimate the efficacy of <b>needle</b> <b>acupuncture</b> combined herbal acupuncture therapy. Result : The following results were obtained; 1. The significant difference in VAS was showed before and after treatment in only <b>needle</b> <b>acupuncture</b> therapy. 2. The significant difference in pain threshold and VAS was showed before and after treatment in <b>needle</b> <b>acupuncture</b> combined herbal acupuncture therapy. 3.

50|$|There {{are several}} methods of moxibustion. Three {{of them are}} direct scarring, direct non-scarring, and {{indirect}} moxibustion.

Direct non-scarring moxibustion removes the burning moxa before the skin burns enough to scar, unless the burning moxa is left on the skin too long. Indirect moxibustion holds a cigar made of moxa near the acupuncture point to heat the skin, or holds it on an <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needle</b> inserted in the skin to heat the needle.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} instruments for applying nonspecific pressure by rubbing, rolling, or applying {{pressure on the}} reflex zones of the body. The acuball is a small ball made of rubber with protuberances that is heatable. It is used to apply pressure and relieve muscle and joint pain. The energy roller is a small cylinder with protuberances. It is held between the hands and rolled {{back and forth to}} apply acupressure. The foot roller (also [...] "krupa chakra") is a round, cylindrical roller with protuberances. It is placed on the floor and the foot is rolled back and forth over it. The power mat (also pyramid mat) is a mat with small pyramid-shaped bumps that you walk on. The spine roller is a bumpy roller containing magnets that is rolled up and down the spine. The Teishein is one of the original nine classical acupuncture needles described in the original texts of acupuncture. Even though it is described as an <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needle</b> it did not pierce the skin. It is used to apply rapid percussion pressure to the points being treated.|$|E
40|$|In a {{clinical}} setting, acupuncture treatment consists of multiple components including somatosensory stimulation, treatment context, {{and attention to}} needle-based procedures. In order to dissociate somatosensory versus contextual and attentional aspects of acupuncture, we devised a novel form of placebo acupuncture, a visual manipulation dubbed phantom acupuncture, which reproduces the <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needling</b> ritual without somatosensory tactile stimulation. Subjects (N = 20) received both real (REAL) and phantom (PHNT) acupuncture. Subjects were retrospectively classified into two groups based on PHNT credibility (PHNTc, who found phantom acupuncture credible; and PHNTnc, who did not). Autonomic and psychophysical responses were monitored. We found that PHNT can be delivered in a credible manner. <b>Acupuncture</b> <b>needling,</b> a complex, ritualistic somatosensory intervention, induces sympathetic activation (phasic skin conductance [SC] response), which may be specific to the somatosensory component of acupuncture. In contrast, contextual effects, such as needling credibility, are instead associated with a shift toward relative cardiovagal activation (decreased heart rate) during needling and sympathetic inhibition (decreased SC) and parasympathetic activation (decreased pupil size) following <b>acupuncture</b> <b>needling.</b> Visual stimulation characterizing the needling ritual {{is an important factor}} for phasic autonomic responses to acupuncture and may undelie the needling orienting response.
