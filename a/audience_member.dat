5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns. The film performed {{better in the}} French and West German markets, {{largely due to the}} presence of Trintignant and Kinski. It has been reported that during a screening of the film in Sicily, one <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> fired a gun at the screen in anger over the film's ending.|$|E
5000|$|Display polling results immediately: The {{audience}} response system includes {{software that}} runs on the presenter's computer that records and tabulates the responses by <b>audience</b> <b>members.</b> Generally, once a question has ended (polling from the audience has ceased), the software displays a bar chart indicating what percent of <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> chose the various possible responses. For questions with right/wrong answers, <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> can get immediate feedback about whether they chose the correct answer, since it can be indicated on the bar chart. For survey-type polling questions, <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> {{can see from the}} summary how many other <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> chose the same response, along with how many <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> (or what percent of the audience) chose different responses.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} first {{screened}} on April 7, 1933 in Paris. The premiere shocked many <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> who hissed and booed Vigo. Other <b>audience</b> <b>members,</b> most notably Jacques Prevert, loudly clapped.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, The Beatles {{performed}} two {{sold out}} shows to nearly 30,000 <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> September 3 and, in 1989, New Kids on the Block set a Grandstand attendance record with 18,509 <b>audience</b> <b>members.</b>|$|R
5|$|The single {{was written}} to {{originally}} include Ronnie himself but {{was changed to}} be a tribute to him as his health was declining. Proceeds from sale of the single went to The Irish Cancer Society {{at the request of}} Drew himself. The song was performed live on The Late Late Show aired by RTÉ Entertainment on 22 February with Ronnie Drew in attendance as an <b>audience</b> <b>member,</b> and entered the Irish Single Charts at No. 2.|$|E
5|$|Borden {{launches}} a solo magic career and hires the silent, mysterious Fallon as his ingénieur. Borden courts and eventually marries Sarah, who {{gives birth to}} their daughter, Jess; but their relationship is shadowed by Sarah's intuition that Borden is keeping secrets and that sometimes he is lying {{when he says he}} loves her. At his first show, Borden's bullet catch trick is sabotaged by Angier, and Borden loses two fingers. Angier launches his own magic career, hiring Olivia Wenscombe as his assistant and Cutter as his ingénieur. During the finale of Angier's show, a disguised Borden sabotages Angier's bird cage act, which maims an <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> and ruins Angier's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during his}} college tour, Chapman {{mentioned}} that a television <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> {{had written to}} the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, adding that the Bible said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and stoned. With other Pythons already aware of his sexual orientation, Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E
50|$|On occasion, Norton {{would even}} {{go so far}} as to {{secretly}} produce a pre-selected <b>audience</b> <b>member’s</b> parents or lover to witness or take part in an embarrassing event without the <b>audience</b> <b>member’s</b> knowledge.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a {{hardware and software}} system for an orchestral performance in which the <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> are the performers, led by the orchestra’s conductor. The system is designed such that <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> {{are not required to}} have previous musical knowledge. <b>Audience</b> <b>members</b> are seated at banquet tables throughout the performance space. By tapping on a lighted dome {{at the center of the}} table when prompted by the conductor, the <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> trigger musical sequences in the composition. Coordination is managed through a central software controller. Like all good centerpieces, the domes are not tethered in any way, easily moved, and unobtrusive when the performance is not in progress...|$|R
50|$|During its concerts, Consolidated placed {{microphones}} in the crowd, so that <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> could {{interact with}} the band between songs. The short tracks on this disc are comments by <b>audience</b> <b>members,</b> or interaction between the band and the audience.|$|R
5|$|Marge discovers Maggie's {{first baby}} tooth, {{which appears to}} be a sharp fang. Maggie later loses her legs and grows green tentacles. Maggie's {{pacifier}} sucks contact the alien duo, Kang and Kodos. They arrive at the Simpson house, coming to retrieve Maggie. Marge reveals that Kang is Maggie's real father and explains how it happened. Kang and Kodos demand that the Simpsons give Maggie to them, and Kang and Homer start to fight until they are taken on The Jerry Springer Show. When an <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> criticizes Kang, he vaporizes her, as well {{as the rest of the}} audience and the film crew. After leaving the studio, Kang and Kodos threaten to destroy every politician in Washington unless given Maggie. Marge and the Simpsons slyly imply that the aliens could not possibly destroy every politician, and they fly off to do so.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often {{directly}} inspired by the Sex Pistols. In London, women were {{near the center of}} the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple Erectors. Other groups included Subway Sect, Eater, Wire, The Stranglers, the Subversives, the aptly named London, and Chelsea, which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20–21, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups (London's big three and Buzzcocks), as well as Paris's female-fronted Stinky Toys, arguably the first punk rock band from a non-Anglophone country. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night; that same evening, Eater debuted in Manchester. On the festival's second night, <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> Sid Vicious was arrested, charged with throwing a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident fueled punk's reputation as a social menace.|$|E

50|$|The last ballot, a China {{official}} notary will randomly select 101 <b>audience</b> <b>members,</b> {{who voted}} {{in the second round}} and give a dedicated screening for all nominated pictures. Eventually, the 101 <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> will have a secret ballot and subsequently announce the winners.|$|R
50|$|In the program, Deen offers help to <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> {{who have}} culinary problems. This new format {{allows her to}} be {{friendly}} with her guests; frequently {{she sits on the}} laps of various male <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> and feeds them sensuously, often making food-related double entendres.|$|R
50|$|InterActors {{may also}} read data from other interActors {{attached}} to slides presented to other <b>audience</b> <b>members.</b> This forms a real-time polling mechanism. Interactions may be viewable by the presenter only, or optionally viewed by all <b>audience</b> <b>members.</b> This {{forms the basis}} of Group Decision Support Systems.|$|R
25|$|Zach Galifianakis as Hobo Joe, a {{homeless}} man who is the first <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> of The Muppet Telethon. Joanna Newsom did his brief singing voice.|$|E
25|$|Griffin {{would also}} {{frequently}} chat with audience members. One regular <b>audience</b> <b>member,</b> Lillian Miller, {{would become a}} fixture on Griffin's program throughout its run.|$|E
25|$|An <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> {{would be}} brought onto the stage and {{presented}} with an unusual word. Various Hey Hey crew members (usually Dickie, Red or Russell) would each give the member a possible meaning of the word, {{one of which was}} the word's actual meaning. If that person correctly guessed whose meaning was the right one, that person would win a prize.|$|E
50|$|Seating up to 2001 <b>audience</b> <b>members,</b> the Grand Hall (大ホール) is {{used for}} orchestral, ballet and opera performances. The {{interior}} is almost entirely wood, designed for optimal acoustics. <b>Audience</b> <b>members</b> can sit on the inclined floor seating area, or {{in one of the}} hall's four balconies.|$|R
50|$|Theaters {{sometimes}} use specially planted <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> who are {{instructed to}} give ovations at pre-arranged times. Usually, {{these people are}} the ones who clap initially, {{and the rest of the}} audience follows. Such ovations may be perceived by non-expert <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> as signals of the performance's quality.|$|R
5000|$|Expedition Impossible was premiered at B-2 is Moscow. Alex told <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> {{that there}} were cameras {{in the room and}} footage would be taken so if <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> were lucky they might [...] "feature in (Hooverphonic's) new video". Some of the footage {{appeared}} in the music video.|$|R
25|$|On Friday episodes {{which ran}} short, {{during the first}} season, a game was played with {{audience}} members for a small cash prize, usually $50. The game was played with regular panelist Brett Somers first. A word or phrase with a blank would be asked of Somers, and she would write it down on her card. Rayburn would then circulate amongst audience members who raised their hands to play, and if the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> matched the answer Somers had written down, then they would win $50. Rayburn would continue picking on audience members until someone matched the answer. If there was more time left, the same game would be played with Charles Nelson Reilly responding to and writing down an answer for another <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> to guess. Rayburn sometimes seemed frustrated by {{this part of the}} show and with the answers given by some of the audience members; {{at the end of one}} episode, he was shown collapsed in one of the audience seats, seemingly exhausted.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Crawford {{attended}} the Gala Performance {{of the stage}} version of The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway at the Majestic Theatre to celebrate the show's becoming the longest-running musical in Broadway history (surpassing the run of Cats). He was delighted with it, stating {{this was the first}} time he had been an <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> of any of the shows he had done.|$|E
25|$|Coca-Cola ran an {{overarching}} “Open Happiness” campaign across multiple media platforms including print ads, web ads, and television commercials. The {{purpose of this}} central function was to communicate a common message over multiple platforms to further encourage an audience to buy into a reiterated message. The strength of such campaigns with multimedia, like the Coca-Cola ‘Happiness’ campaign, is that it implements all available mediums - any of which could prove successful with a different <b>audience</b> <b>member.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{response}} from <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> has been highly polarized. Although the film currently scores a Rotten Tomatoes [...] "fresh" [...] rating of 93% from critics, the site's audience rating {{for the film}} is much lower—just 51%—with many <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> rating it one or one half stars.|$|R
50|$|Play {{continued}} until all six (7 {{in the pilot}} episode) questions were played. If any <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> were left standing, the team lost and the audience survivors split $500. However, if all 30 <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> were knocked out in six questions or less, the winning team split $5,000.|$|R

25|$|In November 1994, Minty began a two-week-long show at London's Freedom Cafe, {{including}} <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> Alexander McQueen, {{but it was}} {{too much}} for Westminster City Council, who closed the show down after only one night. This was to be Bowery's last performance. The show was documented by photographer A.M. Hanson with imagery subsequently published in books about Bowery and McQueen. Minty was a financial loss and represented a low point in Bowery's colourful career. A spin-off band called The Offset later formed including artist Donald Urquhart.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there was}} no orchestra, {{there was no}} space {{separating}} the audience from the stage. The audience could stand {{directly in front of}} the elevated wooden platform. This gave them the opportunity to look at the actors from a much different perspective. They would have seen every detail of the actor and hear every word he said. The <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> would have wanted that actor to speak directly to them. It was a part of the thrill of the performance, as it is to this day.|$|E
25|$|During {{a seminar}} in Dunedin in 1917 on his war {{experiences}} at Gallipoli, Moore-Jones mentioned his recollections {{of a man}} who, {{with the help of}} a donkey, transported wounded from the hills at Gallipoli to medical posts. An <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> loaned him a photograph, taken by James Jackson who served at Gallipoli with the New Zealand Medical Corps, of a medical orderly transporting a wounded soldier on a donkey. It was from this photograph, now held by the Waikato Museum, that Moore-Jones based his work entitled 'The Man with the Donkey'.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} three seasons, the [...] "Talent Showcase", the dogs would perform a talent of some sort within a 30-second time limit, then a panel of three <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> would give the dog up to 30 points (10 from each panelist). After both dogs performed, the <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> won prizes.|$|R
