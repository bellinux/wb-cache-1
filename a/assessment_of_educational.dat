In addition, critics note that despite rising CATS scores, the remedial requirements for Kentucky's entering college freshmen remain very high (nearly one of two recent high school graduates requires at least one college remedial course in Kentucky's public college system) which has led to pending legislation to replace CATS with a more up to date and credible assessment.|$|E

40|$|There {{is clear}} {{evidence}} {{that the number of}} multiracial children in the U.

We address this gap by using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to assess racial differences in education. Specifically, we compare vocabulary scores, grade point averages, and odds of repeating a grade for multiracial and single-race youth. Our findings are generally consistent with the marginal man hypothesis, an influential, yet rarely tested, thesis about {{the costs and benefits of}} being multiracial. We find that white/black youth have outcomes that are unlike those of blacks, and white/American Indians do not differ from whites, but the situation is more complex for white/Asians. We close by acknowledging that racial classification is a social process, and then discussing the implications of racial fluidity for <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> differences.
