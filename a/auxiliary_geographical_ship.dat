40|$|Maritime Domain Awareness is the {{understanding}} of all aspects relating to the maritime domain that may {{have an effect on}} the security, economy or environment of a country bordering the sea. Large ships in South Africa have historically been monitored using ship-based transponder systems such as Automatic Identification System. These systems transmit <b>geographical</b> <b>ship</b> coordinates which allow operators to track ships. The greatest disadvantage of monitoring ships in this manner is that the transponders need to be installed and switched on in order to track ships. The monitoring of ships can be done in another manner by taking advantage of Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery which allows for the monitoring of large portions of the Earth. This imagery is generated using an active sensor which makes use of radar pulses to observe areas under any weather condition, day or night. In this dissertation, various ship detection systems configurations were tested using Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery and experimental conclusions were drawn for each configuration. The system was tested against simulated Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery and actual Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery located within the South African Exclusive Economic Zone. Tests were performed in order to evaluate which noise distribution model best models the Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery used in this study over South African coastal waters. The parameters and the effects of varying them within each system configuration were evaluated. Experimental results found that the K-distribution is the noise distribution model that best describes the noise of sea-water found within the Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery used in this study. Furthermore, it was determined that ship detection system configurations using the Constant False Alarm Rate prescreening method had the highest average detection accuracies and lowest false alarm rates amongst all of the configurations tested. The various detection system configurations had similar detection accuracies at low thresholds but varied significantly in terms of the number of false alarms.

40|$|UCM-MACB 2. 0 is {{the name}} of a project leaded by a {{multidisciplinary}} team composed by university professors, students and collaborators as well as national and foreign visiting professors and researchers under the European Area of Higher Education. This is an e-learning project oriented to training and teaching being available to the general public, students and professionals from different areas {{on the basis of the}} plant biology, plant popular uses and their applications. At present, the initial steps of the project have received the financial support of Vicerrectorado de Calidad y Desarrollo, Complutense University of Madrid (PIMCD 3 / 2010). The target of the project is the developing and configuration of a computer system implementing a virtual herbarium based on plant species from the MACB herbarium (Faculty of Biology, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain). The system also will includes a web page and an IT application (as a client-servant application) to transfer herbarium information to the potential interested community. MACB herbarium sheets will be associated with a set of databases containing the following information: taxonomic information, geographic distribution, specimen photographs, links to external online resources such as educational, scientific and other databases containing freely available molecular data (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics), for instance, GenBank or GenomeNet, PDB, InterPro, Enzyme, Prosite, Pir, TrEMBL, EMBL-Bank, Swiss-prot or NCBI taxonomic data as Taxonomy Browser, GBIF, Species 2000, or Tree of Life, etc. It is important to note that <b>auxiliary</b> information (<b>geographical,</b> ecophysiological, genomics, etc) is one of the main distinguishing features of UCM-MACB 2. 0. Furthermore, plant images are enriched with information in multimedia format (MP 3 voice) to make available UCM-MACB 2. 0 to visually impaired users. In this sense, we plan to cooperate with the Office for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities at the Complutense University of Madrid. Thus, one of the main contributions of this project is that we extend the classical idea of herbarium enriching the usual botanical information with multimedia elements, opening the definition of ‘herbarium sheet’ to new educational and scientific possibilities. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe general {{aim of the}} International Maritime Organization (IMO) is the {{adoption}} of the highest practicable standards in matters concerning maritime safety, efficiency of navigation, prevention and control of environmental effects due to maritime traffic. The major environmental consequences investigated by IMO include air pollution, water pollution and the planning of ships’ waste reception and handling. However, in specific conditions (i. e. port channels or channels along historical sites) other effects should be taken into account, such as: the ships’ wake wash (that causes vibrations on the buildings, disruption to their foundations and corruption on the embankment system), the noise impact on neighboring residential areas (during mooring and ship loading/unloading operations) and emissions during the approaching phase. Furthermore, it is important to protect ports in particular <b>geographical</b> conditions. <b>Ship</b> movements near inhabited centers must be preserved from casualties and accidents involving ships, like collisions in the inner route or loose of load, engine failure, oil spill off (the 2009 / 18 /EC Directive established the principles for investigating accidents). In some cases offshore ports could reduce some risks and environmental impacts. This research deals with the Venice Lagoon case study, where an offshore port (able to serve container, dry bulk and tanker ships) is under feasibility evaluation. Some of the benefits that could be obtained are: a reduced pollution, energy savings and lower environmental/infrastructural impacts. These issues will be investigated through the application of a Multicriteria Analysis model (MCA) to evaluate any benefit and/or disadvantage arising from the offshore terminal in deepsea waters, highlighting how several parameters (including safety) must be evaluated in justifying a massive investment as the offshore terminal. The goal of the research is to define a general methodology for the appraisal of huge infrastructure investments...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedUntil recently no standard atmospheric propagation codes included {{the effects of}} polarization. Recently a research grade upgrade to MODTRAN (Zeisse, Nrad) has allowed the polarized case. This upgrade, called SEARAD, calculates the infrared polarization of sea surface radiance. Data available in the EOPACE data base were used for a direct comparison of the code prediction to the measurements. The data consist of polarized and unpolarized images of the R/V POINT SUR in the Long Wave Infrared (LWIR), taken with the AGA 780 camera during an experiment conducted in San Diego Bay in April 1996. Meteorological, <b>geographical,</b> and external <b>ship</b> temperature data were recorded along with the images. The analysis of the EOPACE data was conducted by using IDL (Interactive Data Language) analysis programs and included 34 sets of images. The sea pixels were extracted from the images, and correlated with meteorological, and geographical data to provide input to the SEARAD code. The comparison of the experimental data with the SEARAD predictions yielded an average error of 1. 57 / sq Wm/sr in unpolarized sea radiance, which is within approximately 5 % of the experimental radiance, and an average 0. 51 absolute difference between the predicted and experimental degree percentage of polarization[URL] Junior Grade, Hellenic Nav...|$|R
5000|$|Richardson compares {{several factors}} {{that contributed to}} slave revolts on board ships: {{conditions}} on the <b>ships,</b> <b>geographical</b> location, and proximity to the shore. [...] He suggests that revolts {{were more likely to}} occur when a ship was still in sight of the shore. The threat of attack from the shore by other Africans was also a concern. If the ship was hit by disease and {{a large portion of the}} crew had been killed, the chances of insurrection were higher. [...] Where the slaves were captured also had an effect on the amount of insurrections. In many places, such as the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Biafra the percentage of revolts and the percentage of the slave trade match up. [...] Yet ships taking slaves from Senegambia experienced 22 percent of shipboard revolts while only contributing to four and a half percent of the slave trade. Slaves coming from West Central Africa accounted for 44 percent of the trade while only experiencing 11 percent of total revolts. [...] Lorenzo J. Greene gives many accounts of slave revolts on ships coming out of New England. These ships belonged to Puritans who controlled much of the slave trade in New England. Most revolts on board ships were unsuccessful. The crews of these ships, while outnumbered, were disciplined, well fed, and armed with muskets, swords, and sometimes cannons, and they were always on guard for resistance. The slaves on the other hand were the opposite, armed only with bits of wood and the chains that bound them.|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} {{evolution in}} terms of computational capacity, data acquisition systems, numerical modelling and operational oceanography is supplying opportunities for designing and building holistic approaches and complex tools for newer and more efficient management (planning, prevention and response) of coastal water pollution risk events. A combined methodology to dynamically estimate time and space variable individual vessel accident risk levels and shoreline contamination risk from ships has been developed, integrating numerical metocean forecasts and oil spill simulations with vessel tracking automatic identification systems (AIS). The risk rating combines the likelihood of an oil spill occurring from a vessel navigating in a study area – the Portuguese continental shelf – with the assessed consequences to the shoreline. The spill likelihood is based on dynamic marine weather conditions and statistical information from previous accidents. The shoreline consequences reflect the virtual spilled oil amount reaching shoreline and its environmental and socio-economic vulnerabilities. The oil reaching shoreline is quantified with an oil spill fate and behaviour model running multiple virtual spills from vessels along time, or as an alternative, a correction factor based on vessel distance from coast. Shoreline risks can be computed in real time or from previously obtained data. Results show {{the ability of the}} proposed methodology to estimate the risk properly sensitive to dynamic metocean conditions and to oil transport behaviour. The integration of meteo-oceanic + oil spill models with coastal vulnerability and AIS data in the quantification of risk enhances the maritime situational awareness and the decision support model, providing a more realistic approach in the assessment of shoreline impacts. The risk assessment from historical data can help finding typical risk patterns (“hot spots”) or developing sensitivity analysis to specific conditions, whereas real-time risk levels can be used in the prioritization of individual <b>ships,</b> <b>geographical</b> areas, strategic tug positioning and implementation of dynamic risk-based vessel traffic monitoring...|$|R
