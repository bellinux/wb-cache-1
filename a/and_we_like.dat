500|$|Despite the film's {{failure to}} enjoy {{immediate}} success, Wiseau paid {{to keep the}} billboard up for over five years, {{at the cost of}} [...] a month. Its bizarre imagery and longevity led to it becoming a minor tourist attraction. When asked how he managed to afford to keep the billboard up for so long in such a prominent location, Wiseau responded: [...] "Well, we like the location, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> the billboard. So we feel that people should see The Room. [...] we are selling DVDs, which are selling okay." ...|$|E
500|$|Blair {{is largely}} {{motivated}} by matters surrounding family, romance, and ambition. However, her tendency to overachieve {{can lead to}} feelings of paranoia, with dramatic or comical results. In a review for The New Yorker, Janet Malcolm remarked that Blair's issues made her [...] "both a broader caricature and a more real person" [...] than the other Gossip Girl characters. In a 2009 interview, Gossip Girl creator Cecily von Ziegesar claimed to identify with Blair the most, stating, [...] "She is so unpredictable and dramatic. Such a bitch, but we understand why she is a bitch <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> her anyway".|$|E
500|$|Interviewed in January 2006, Chambers foreshadowed major {{developments}} for his character when he stated: [...] "I think Sam's ideal woman might be Connie because she's feisty, doesn't beat around {{the bush and}} is very talented, which is always sexy. However I reckon they clash quite a lot because she manipulates with her power play and won't drop the act {{so it would be}} very much on a love hate basis." [...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked up <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> {{to keep it that way}} until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through in your work - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E

[...] At that time, one of three {{remaining}} original residents, Serril Gerber, told the Times {{that he and his}} wife had joined with nine other couples in seeking out Ain, hiring him to build a low-cost complex with a high quality of design. Gerber said, [...] "We'd seen these modern houses in magazines, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> the idea of having a living space that is both indoors <b>and</b> outdoors. <b>We</b> <b>liked</b> the idea of doing something really modern, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> Greg. He was a radical person in his thinking, because he wanted to put his ideas in the service of regular people. That was his mission, really." [...] Each couple contributed $11,000 to the project.|$|R

5000|$|The songwriting is {{much more}} stuck to the classic {{boundaries}} of songwriting {{as far as a}} verse <b>and</b> chorus.
