40|$|INTRODUCTION: Congenital microphthalmos and <b>anophthalmos</b> are rare. The reduced eyeball size, or its absence, {{prevents}} the normal {{development of the}} orbit. This lack of development has functional, physical and psychological repercussions. The authors report their experience of prosthetic treatment for microphthalmos and <b>anophthalmos.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our study is about 11 children with 13 cases of microphthalmos and 2 of <b>anophthalmos.</b> These cases have been clinically observed between 1998 and 2002. A detailed history, ophthalmological and complete paediatric examination and a prosthetic treatment were undertaken for all of them. RESULTS: 4 children had bilateral involvement. 8 children had other ocular or general malformations. No prenatal infections during pregnancy were detected (rubella, cytomegalovirus). One treatment of clinical <b>anophthalmos</b> was interrupted on the parents' request (slow and bad evolution with complete retraction of the orbital socket after a conjunctivitis). For 9 children, the evolution was good with growth of the orbital cavity and a satisfactory cosmetic result. However, hypoplasia was observed on the lateral orbital wall for severe microphthalmos. One child presenting a bilateral microphthalmos received a cosmetic scleral shell with optical correction. CONCLUSIONS: Management of <b>anophthalmos</b> is difficult and unrewarding. But the use of cosmetic scleral shells in all cases of microphthalmos, even severe ones, is useful and effective...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} a rare {{example of a}} bilateral congenital <b>anophthalmos</b> and an agenesis of the optic pathways. The MR imaging studies revealed that the eyeballs, optic nerves, optic chiasm, optic tracts and optic radiation were absent. The chromosomal examination was normal. Mild mental retardation was also observed. Apart from the rarity of the <b>anophthalmos</b> and the total absence of the optic pathways, no etiologic reason for this pathology could be detected, which makes this case more significant...|$|E
40|$|Many {{anomalies}} of {{the visual}} system, bilateral <b>anophthalmos,</b> unilateral <b>anophthalmos</b> and optic nerve degeneration seem to be closely related to microphthalmos were found in KUHW-rats derived from a Wistar strain inbred colony. Nevertheless the rats have no recognizable eye and optic nerve in both sides were completely missing, their eyelids and optic tracts were present in <b>anophthalmos</b> rats. Diffuse axonal degeneration of the optic nerve on the affected side and contra-lateral optic tract were observed in microphthalmos rats. Breeding and morphological studies were undertaken to determine {{the nature of the}} ocular defect, as well as its cause and pathogenesis. These anomalies were found to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with variable expressivity. The studies of the prenatal morphogenesis of the microphthalmos suggested that the primary disorder reflects a disturbance of the neuroepithelium of the retinal anlage and results in defective early formation of the optic cup.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} alterations {{observed in}} patients with congenital clinical anophthalmia and the occurrence of association with other ocular and extra ocular abnormalities. Methods: An observational retrospective study was conducted evaluating 12 patients with congenital clinical anophthalmia at Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu-UNESP, between 1992 and 2005. In those patients it was observed the ocular abnormalities, severity, laterality, follow-up and to systemic abnormalities associated. The congenital clinical anophthalmia have been associated to major severity abnormalities extra-oculars, mainly when the anophthalmia was bilateral, such agenesis of corpus callosum, others craniofacial anomalies and cardiac defects. In the cases unilateral, the alteration associated more frequently was the facial asymmetry, showing the direct correlation between <b>anophthalmos</b> and development of orbit and face.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Congenital <b>anophthalmos</b> {{is a rare}} {{condition}} in which intervention {{at an early age}} can stimulate orbital expansion and maximise facial symmetry. Much is still unknown, however, regarding the degree of soft tissue and bony orbital growth achieved using the orbital expanders presently available. METHODS [...] A retrospective review of 59 congenitally anophthalmic orbits in 42 patients was carried out. RESULTS [...] The soft tissue and bony orbital expansion achieved using serial solid shapes is reported, and experience with hydrophilic expanders and inflatable silicone expanders is reviewed. CONCLUSION [...] Although serially fitted solid shapes in the orbit lead to increased expansion of orbital soft tissue and bone compared with no orbital implant, further orbital tissue enlargement is required. The inflatable silicone expander may allow more rapid and extensive orbital tissue expansion, but design changes are needed to achieve this...|$|E

40|$|As {{in other}} areas of the body, {{developmental}} anomalies of the eye arise as a result of the disturbance of events during embryology and in a proportion of cases these anomalies are genetically inherited. Developmental anomalies that occur early in embryonic life may be so severe that the embryo may not survive but others result in the birth of healthy babies but with developmental eye defects of varying severity. The most dramatic developmental defects of the eye include <b>anophthalmos</b> (complete absence of an eye), microphthalmos (a general failure of the eye to develop resulting in a small, undeveloped eye), coloboma (caused by failure of the optic vesicle to invaginate), and aniridia (complete or partial loss of the iris). The present article does not provide an exhaustive review of the topic but considers the major types of developmental anomaly to affect the eye and will discuss how recent progress in genetics has increased our understanding of these disorders.

The patient had noticed increasing discharge and swelling of her right eyelid. Incisional biopsies of an underlying orbital mass revealed poorly differentiated sebaceous gland carcinoma. The sebaceous gland carcinoma in this case could have been caused by chronic irritation as a result of long-standing use of a poorly fitted ocular prosthesis.

40|$|AIM—To report five {{children}} with horizontal jerk nystagmus in whom eye movement recordings {{in the dark}} revealed a spontaneous reversal {{in the direction of}} the nystagmus beat. Three patients were blind in one eye and were diagnosed as having a manifest latent nystagmus (MLN), and two patients had strabismus and congenital nystagmus (CN).  METHODS—Eye movements were recorded using DC electro-oculography with simultaneous video recording, including infrared recording in total darkness.  RESULTS—Four patients had decelerating velocity slow phase jerk nystagmus when recorded under natural lighting conditions; the fifth case had accelerating velocity and linear slow phase jerk nystagmus. Under absolute darkness, nystagmus reversed in direction of beat with a mixture of linear and decelerating velocity slow phase waveforms. One child with unilateral <b>anophthalmos</b> could wilfully reverse the beat direction of his nystagmus by trying to look with his blind eye in the light and dark.  CONCLUSIONS—These observations support the theory that LN/MLN beat direction is determined by the "presumed" viewing eye and may be consciously controlled. The spontaneous reversal of beat direction in the dark suggests eye dominance is predetermined. Eye movement recordings identified mixed nystagmus waveforms indicating that CN (accelerating velocity slow phases) and LN/MLN (linear/decelerating velocity slow phases) coexist in these subjects. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of a new fluorescent in situ hybridization technique is discussed, which uses {{a complete set of}} telomeric probes to reveal cryptic chromosome rearrangements that remain undetected by standard cytogenetic analysis. We report the obstetric history of a patient who had a termination of pregnancy at 20 weeks for a fetus with multiple congenital anomalies but a normal male karyotype using conventional G-banding analysis on a mid-trimester placental biopsy. In a subsequent pregnancy, a diaphragmatic hernia and intra-uterine growth restriction were detected at 34 weeks' gestation and a fetal blood sample showed a normal female karotype. However, her child was born with dysmorphic features and additional severe abnormalities including microcephaly, <b>anophthalmos</b> and left fixed talipes. The child has shown marked developmental delay. In view of a strong family history of congenital abnormalities and recurrent miscarriage suggestive of a familial translocation, a fluorescent in situ hybridization technique using specific telomeric probes was performed on blood from the affected child and her parents. An unbalanced subtelomeric translocation was detected involving the long arms of chromosomes 2 and 7 in the child and a balanced translocation was detected in her father.

40|$|Severe corneal {{ulceration}} related to self-inflicted {{injury in the}} presence of congenital corneal anaesthesia is described in four boys under 2 1 / 2 years of age. The ulcers had failed to heal until it was recognised that the children were scratching their own eyes. The application of arm splints allowed rapid healing. Although {{corneal ulceration}} is a recognised complication of congenital corneal anaesthesia, this preventable cause of the ulceration has not previously been recognised. In two cases there were isolated recurrences which healed quickly with the reapplication of splints. All four children had good vision initially, and, although there were no overt gross development abnormalities, two had neurological signs on detailed investigation suggesting cerebellar or brain stem malformation and one had unilateral <b>anophthalmos,</b> talipes equinovarus, and patent ductus arteriosus. All the children showed normal intellectual development. Whether the eye scratching behaviour was the primary cause of the ulceration or merely an aggravating factor, the identification of this abnormal behaviour is important in any child with idiopathic corneal ulceration, as even {{in the presence of}} congenital corneal anaesthesia the eyes heal quickly with effective splinting of the elbows.

40|$|Retinoic acid is a vitamin-A derived com-pound {{that plays}} an {{important}} role in cranio-facial development. However, numerous studies have shown that exogenously adminis-tered retinoic acid analogues have teratogenic effects both in humans and in experimental animals. This paper presents the results of a study where exogenous administration of retinoic acid analogues to pregnant Wistar rats resulted in major craniofacial malforma-tions of most of the foetuses. Seven groups of pregnant rats were exposed to a variety of retinoic acid analogues, administered in dif-ferent doses on different gestational days. A further control group was not exposed to these compounds. All the rats were impregnated and sacrificed on the same gestational days (GD 0 and GD 18 respectively). Following examination of the 34 foetuses obtained from the retinoic acid-treated litters, 5 were chosen for histological investigation to describe the major, external craniofacial malformations resulting from exposure to the teratogens. These malformations included exophthalmos, <b>anophthalmos,</b> exencephaly, craniofacial asym-metry and facial tags. Also reported here are the incidences of teratomas and absorptions in these litters. Previously, we have reported the incidence of cleft lip and palate in rats subject-ed to an identical experimental regimen. Our data provide further evidence that retinoic acid analogues, all-trans-retinoic acid in par-ticular, disturb normal craniofacial develop-ment in such a way that a spectrum of craniofacial malformations can be induced by embryonic exposure to these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to report the {{spectrum}} of anterior and posterior segment diagnoses in Asian Indian premature infants detected serendipitously during routine retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening during a 1 year period. Methods: A retrospective review of all Retcam (Clarity MSI, USA) imaging sessions during the year 2011 performed on infants born either < 2001 g at birth and/or < 34. 1 weeks of gestation recruited for ROP screening was performed. All infants had a minimum of seven images at each session, which included the dilated anterior segment, disc, and macula center and the four quadrants using the 130 ° lens. Results: Of the 8954 imaging sessions of 1450 new infants recruited in 2011, there were 111 (7. 66 %) with a diagnosis other than ROP. Anterior segment diagnoses seen in 31 (27. 9 %) cases included clinically significant cataract, lid abnormalities, <b>anophthalmos,</b> microphthalmos, and corneal diseases. Posterior segment diagnoses in 80 (72. 1 %) cases included retinal hemorrhages, cherry red spots, and neonatal uveitis of infective etiologies. Of the 111 cases, 15 (13. 5 %) underwent surgical procedures and 24 (21. 6 %) underwent medical procedures; importantly, two eyes with retinoblastoma were detected which were managed timely. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the importance of ocular digital imaging in premature infants. Visually significant, potentially life-threatening, and even treatable conditions were detected serendipitously during routine ROP screening that may be missed or detected late otherwise. This pilot data may be used to advocate for a possible universal infant eye screening program using digital imaging...|$|E
40|$|Background: The northeastern region (NER) of India is {{geographically}} {{isolated and}} ethno-culturally {{different from the}} rest of the country. There is lacuna regarding the data on causes of blindness and severe visual impairment in children from this region. Aim: To determine the causes of severe visual impairment and blindness amongst children from schools for the blind in the four states of NER of India. Design and Setting: Survey of children attending special education schools for the blind in the NER. Materials and Methods: Blind and severely visually impaired children (best corrected visual acuity &# 60; 20 / 200 in the better eye, aged up to 16 years) underwent visual acuity estimation, external ocular examination, retinoscopy and fundoscopy. Refraction and low vision workup was done where indicated. World Health Organization&#x 2032;s reporting form was used to code anatomical and etiological causes of visual loss. Statistical Analysis: Microsoft Excel Windows software with SPSS. Results: A total of 376 students were examined of whom 258 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The major anatomical causes of visual loss amongst the 258 were congenital anomalies (<b>anophthalmos,</b> microphthalmos) 93 (36. 1 &#x 0025;); corneal conditions (scarring, vitamin A deficiency) 94 (36. 7 &#x 0025;); cataract or aphakia 28 (10. 9 &#x 0025;), retinal disorders 15 (5. 8 &#x 0025;) and optic atrophy 14 (5. 3 &#x 0025;).

Materials and Methods: The students in the blind schools visited were included in the study and informed consents from parents were obtained. Relevant ocular history and basic ocular examinations were carried out on the students of the blind schools. Results: A total of 90 students were examined in four schools of the blind in Allahabad and in the vicinity. The main causes of severe visual impairment and BL in the better eye of students were microphthalmos (34. 44 %), corneal scar (22. 23 %), <b>anophthalmos</b> (14. 45 %), pseudophakia (6. 67 %), optic nerve atrophy (6. 67 %), buphthalmos/glaucoma (3. 33 %), cryptophthalmos (2. 22 %), staphyloma (2. 22 %), cataract (2. 22 %), retinal dystrophy (2. 22 %), aphakia (1. 11 %), coloboma (1. 11 %), retinal detachment (1. 11 %), etc. Of these, 22 (24. 44 %) students had preventable causes of BL and another 12 (13. 33 %) students had treatable causes of BL.

40|$|Childhood {{blindness}} has {{an adverse}} effect on growth, development, social, and economic opportunities. Severe visual impairment (SVI) and blindness in infants must be detected {{as early as possible}} to initiate immediate treatment to prevent deep amblyopia. Although difficult, measurement of visual acuity of an infant is possible. The causes of SVI and blindness may be prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal. Congenital anomalies such as <b>anophthalmos,</b> microphthalmos, coloboma, congenital cataract, infantile glaucoma, and neuro-ophthalmic lesions are causes of impairment present at birth. Ophthalmia neonatorum, retinopathy of prematurity, and cortical visual impairment are acquired during the perinatal period. Leukocoria or white pupillary reflex can be cause by congenital cataract, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, or retinoblastoma. While few medical or surgical options are available for congenital anomalies or neuro-ophthalmic disorders, many affected infants can still benefit from low vision aids and rehabilitation. Ideally, surgery for congenital cataracts should occur within the first 4 months of life. Anterior vitrectomy and primary posterior capsulotomy are required, followed by aphakic glasses with secondary intraocular lens implantation at a later date. The treatment of infantile glaucoma is surgery followed by anti-glaucoma medication. Retinopathy of prematurity is a proliferation of the retinal vasculature in response to relative hypoxia in a premature infant. Screening in the first few weeks of life can prevent blindness. Retinoblastoma can be debulked with chemotherapy; however, enucleation may still be required. Neonatologists, pediatricians, traditional birth attendants, nurses, and ophthalmologists should be sensitive to a parent’s complaints of poor vision in an infant and ensure adequate follow-up to determine the cause. If required, evaluation under anesthesia should be performed, which includes funduscopy, refraction, corneal diameter measurement, and measurement of intraocular pressure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{complete}} {{absence of}} the chiasm (chiasmal aplasia) is a rare clinical condition. Hypoplasia of the optic nerve and congenital nystagmus are almost invariably associated characteristics. Microphthalmos or <b>anophthalmos</b> are common features in chiasmal aplasia, while central nervous system abnormalities are less frequent. Esophageal atresia can be isolated or syndromic. In syndromic cases, it is frequently associated with cardiac, limb, renal or vertebral malformations and anal atresia. More rarely, esophageal atresia {{can be part of}} anophthalmia-esophageal-genital syndrome, which comprises anophthalmia or microphthalmia, genital abnormalities, vertebral defects and cerebral malformations. Here, a previously unreported case of chiasmal aplasia presenting without microphthalmos and associated with esophageal atresia is described. Case presentation Aplasia of the optic chiasm was identified in a Caucasian Italian 8 -month-old boy with esophageal atresia. An ultrasound examination carried out at 21 weeks' gestation revealed polyhydramnios. Intrauterine growth retardation, esophageal atresia and a small atrial-septal defect were subsequently detected at 28 weeks' gestation. Repair of the esophageal atresia was carried out shortly after birth. A jejunostomy was carried out at four months to facilitate enteral feeding. The child was subsequently noted to be visually inattentive and to be neurodevelopmentally delayed. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed chiasmal aplasia. No other midline brain defects were found. His karyotype was normal. Conclusion If achiasmia is a spectrum, our patient seems to depict the most severe form, since he appears to have an extremely severe visual impairment. This is in contrast to most of the cases described in the literature, where patients maintain good [...] or at least useful [...] visual function. To the best of our knowledge, the association of optic nerve hypoplasia, complete chiasmal aplasia, esophageal atresia and atrial-septal defect, choanal atresia, hypertelorism and psychomotor retardation has never been described before. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the visual and anatomic/structural outcomes of severe ocular injuries and their predictive factors. The objectives of the study: 1. 	To evaluate the risk factors for severe ocular injuries. 2. 	To evaluate the differences between open globe and closed globe ocular injuries 3. 	To evaluate visual and anatomic/structural outcomes in severe open globe and closed globe injuries. 4. 	To evaluate visual and structural outcomes in globe ruptures and penetrating injuries. 5. 	To evaluate the final visual outcomes in intraocular foreign body injuries. The study was carried out in the Laboratory of Ophfthalmology of the Institute of Biomedical Research and the Eye Clinic of Kaunas University of Medicine. The prospective study is based on the initial examination and the six month follow-up data of the patients with severe ocular injuries, treated in the Department of Ophthalmology of Kaunas Medical University Hospital in the period 2001 - 2005 (approval of the Kaunas Regional Comitee of Ethics No. BE- 2 - 23). The inclusion criteria – the severe eye injury, defined as injury resulting in permanent and significant (measurable and observable on rutine eye examination) structural and/or functional changes of the eye. Severe eye injuries were classified by BETT system and mechanical eye injury clasiffication. According to final visual acuity visual outcomes was defined as: •	Poor VA= 0 - 0. 02. •	Satisfactory VA= 0. 03 - 0. 4. •	Bad VA≥ 0. 5 [55]. Study population The total of 1261 cases of severe ocular injuries were presented: 1089 males and 172 females. Mean age was 42. 95  16. 24 years (min 18. 00, max 95. 74, SE 0. 46). Bilateral injuries were observed in 5. 55 % of cases, the right eye was involved in 48. 37 %, and the left eye – 51. 63 % of cases. The patients came from all the regions of Lithuania: 53. 85 % – from urban, and 46. 15 % – from rural population. All the cases with severe eye injuries were analysed according to the type of injury: closed-globe 48. 46 % (611 / 1261) and open globe 51. 54 % (650 / 1261). Factors included in univariate analysis for the first two objectives were: age, gender, occupation, place of injury, source of injury, intent, alcohol use. Multivariate analysis was performed for factors, statistically signifficant in univariate analysis. The analysis of 440 severe eye trauma cases with six month follow-up was performed: 24. 77 % – closed-globe, 75. 23 % – open globe. Initial and final visual acuity was compered by Wilcoxon matched pairs test. Univariate analysis was done for initial and final grade of injury, tissues involvement, initial diagnoses, visual loss contributing factors, lens status, final diagnoses, number of surgeries, time from injury to surgery, time from injury to initial examination. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent significant prognostic factors of poor visual outcome in open globe and closed globe injuries. Visual and anatomic/structural outcomes were evaluated for different mechanisms of ocular trauma. Blunt mechanism was represented by globe ruptures (n= 48), and sharp mechanism – by penetrating injuries (n= 181). Univariate analysis was done for initial and final grade of injury, zone of injury, tissues involvement, visual loss contributing factors, lens status, final diagnoses, number of surgeries (1, ≥ 2), time from injury to surgery (≤ 24, 24 - 72, > 72 hours) and the method of initial surgery (initial wound repair, anterior segment reconstruction, PPV). Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent significant prognostic factors of poor visual and anatomic/structural (phthisis, <b>anophthalmos)</b> outcome in cases of ocular ruptures and penetrating injuries. Visual results of 95 cases with IOFB injuries were presented: 97. 90 % male, 2. 10 % – female. Of those 95 cases of IOFB 24 were located in the anterior segment and 71 – in the posterior segment of the eye. Magnetic were 70 and non-magnetic – 25. Visual outcomes were evaluated for the zone of injury, location of IOFB and their magnetic features. Univariate analysis was performed for initial and late diagnoses, time of initial surgery (≤ 24, 24 - 72, > 72 hours), and IOFB removal technique (extraocular magnet vs. forceps and PPV). Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent significant prognostic factors of poor visual outcome in cases of IOFB injuries.

Darbo tikslas – įvertinti akių struktūrinius ir regos pokyčius sunkių akių traumų atvejais bei nustatyti juos sąlygojančius veiksnius. Pagrindiniai darbo uždaviniai: 1) nustatyti tikėtinus sunkių akių traumų rizikos veiksnius; 2) palyginti uždaro ir atviro tipo sunkias akių traumas; 3) įvertinti blogą regą ir akies anatominę struktūrą sąlygojančius pokyčius sunkių uždaro ir atviro tipo akių traumų atvejais; 4) nustatyti regos rezultatus ir įvertinti akies struktūrinius pokyčius akies plyšimų ir penetruojančių žaizdų atvejais; 5) nustatyti akių sužalojimų, sukeltų intraokuliniais svetimkūniais, regos rezultatus. Įtraukimo į tyrimą kriterijus – sunki akies trauma. Akies trauma yra sunki, kai ji sukelia pastovius ir žymius funkcinius bei anatominius akies pokyčius. Sunkios akies traumos klasifikuotos, remiantis BETT sistema ir mechaninių akies sužalojimų klasifikacija. Atviro tipo akių traumos suskirstytos pagal: 1) rūšį (A. Plyšimas; B. Penetruojanti ��aizda; C. IOSv; D. Perforuojanti žaizda); 2) laipsnį – regėjimo aštrumą (RA) (1 ˚  0, 5; 2 ˚ 0, 2 - 0, 4; 3 ˚ 0, 03 - 0, 1; 4 ˚ 1 /∞- 0, 02; E˚ 0); zoną – žaizdos lokalizaciją (I. ragena; II. ragenos limbas ir 5 mm į odeną; III. nuo 5 mm orientyro odenoje į užpakalinį polių). Uždaro tipo traumos suskirstytos pagal: laipsnį (1 ˚  0, 5; 2 ˚ 0, 2 - 0, 4; 3 ˚ 0, 03 - 0, 1; 4 ˚ 1 /∞- 0, 02; 5 ˚ 0). Regos rezultatas vertintas pagal galutinį koreguotą RA: 1) blogas (RA= 0 - 0, 02); 2) patenkinamas (RA= 0, 03 - 0, 4); 3) geras (RA≥ 0, 5). Ištirtas 1261 sunkių akių traumų atvejis (1225 ligoniai). Ligoniams užpildytos pradinio tyrimo anketos ir analizuoti pradinio tyrimo duomenys. Vyrų buvo 86, 36 proc., moterų – 13, 64 proc. Atviro tipo akių traumų atvejų buvo 51, 54 proc.

Statistiškai reikšmingi veiksniai buvo įtraukti į daugiavektorinės logistinės analizės modelį ir nustatyti tikėtini veiksniai, sąlygoję blogus regos rezultatus. Išanalizuotos ir palygintos dvi atviro tipo sužalojimų rūšys, atspindinčios skirtingą akių traumos mechanizmą: akies plyšimas – bukas mechanizmas (n= 48), penetruojanti žaizda – aštrus mechanizmas (n= 181). Veiksniai įvertinti ir palyginti akies plyšimų ir penetruojančių žaizdų atvejais: traumos laipsnis (pradinis ir galutinis RA), pažeisti akies audiniai, galutinį RA bloginantys veiksniai, galutinė lęšiuko būklė, galutinės diagnozės, traumos zona, pradinės operacijos laikas (1 para, 2 – 3 para, ≥ 4 parų), operacijų skaičius (1, 2, 3) bei pradinės operacijos metodas (pirminis žaizdos sutvarkymas, pirminis žaizdos sutvarkymas su priekinio segmento rekonstrukcija, PPV). Į daugiavektorinės logistinės analizės modelį įtraukus statistiškai reikšmingus veiksnius, nustatyti tikėtini prognostiniai veiksniai, sąlygoję blogus regos rezultatus, akies subatrofiją ir anoftalmą. Ištirta 95 / 440 akių traumų, padarytų IOSv atvejai.
