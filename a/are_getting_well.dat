40|$|Abstractâ€”The Computer {{has become}} an inseparable part of life for {{many people in the}} world. Its innumerable uses have changed the life of many, not only in {{technical}} field but also in non-technical field. Moreover, now-a-days, with increasing use of the computer, people <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>well</b> aware of the peripherals that are associated with it. These peripherals give additional features to the already existing functionalities of the computer, while some enhance them. Along with the advancements in capabilities of the Computer, the capabilities of these peripherals have also been improved, thus, making it simpler and more user-friendly for the user. Gradually, using the computer has become very easy these days. To make it even more simple, the interfacing of the peripherals with the computer have also changed and improved a lot. The main idea of this project is related to one such peripheral the USB. This user friendly device is actually recognized by its Connection type- the BUS; called the Universal Serial Bus. It comprises of just four connection wires between the Host (Computer) and the Device, governed by a set of rules called the Protocol. The aim of this project is to transfer data without using a computer, from one USB flash disk to another...|$|E
40|$|BACKROUNDS/PURPOSE: Hereditary hemorrhagic {{telangiectasia}} or Rendu-Weber-Osler is an {{autosomal dominant}} inherited disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasia {{that may affect}} the nose, skin, lungs, brain and gastrointestinal tract. Liver involvement of the disease has been described to be responsible of biliary tract necrosis, high cardiac output and portal hypertension, due to intra-hepatic vascular shunts. We aimed to present four cases of successful orthotopic liver transplantations in this indication performing our modified Piggy-back technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2008, four patients have been diagnosed for Rendu-Weber-Osler disease and underwent liver transplantation. Three of them suffered from high cardiac output with heart failure, two presented HBV infection and one patient suffered from renal failure requiring a liver-kidney transplantation. We performed our modified Piggy-back technique for liver implantation, which consists to clamp selectively the hepatic veins during the hepatectomy, without venous bypass, the retro-hepatic vena cava is preserved. RESULTS: No hemodynamic concerns disturbed the surgery and no massive transfusions were needed. The liver replacement corrected the cardiac insufficiency due to high cardiac output for the three patients. At present, the four patients <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>well.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Despite new advances in immunotherapy for the medical treatment of Rendu-Weber-Osler disease, liver transplantation remains the curative option for hepatic based-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia...|$|E
40|$|A {{fast track}} to {{employment}} and profit? CUE: When a country finds it has {{a high rate of}} unemployment among its young people, what can it do? Some governments offer free training, or subsidise credit for small businesses. Our next report comes from Zimbabwe, where some young people have benefited from the ?Fast Track? land resettlement programme. Sylvia Jiyane met two young men who received land under the programme, and are now {{trying to make a living}} from agriculture. She was keen to know whether simply giving young people a piece of land had enabled them to earn a living, or whether they needed more help to set up a successful farming business. IN:		?In the programme today ? OUT:		? I am Sylvia Jiyane. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 14 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And Sylvia was reporting from Zimbabwe on the government?s ?Fast track? land resettlement programme. Transcript Jiyane	In the programme today, I will be talking to two youths who are engaged in agricultural activities in Mashonaland West Province, North West of Harare in Zimbabwe. The youth were recently resettled under the government's fast track resettlement programme. Chitumbura	My name is Japson Chitumbura. I was resettled here in Mapinga in October. Jiyane	So what crops have you grown this year? Chitumbura	This year I have grown quite a lot of crops, such as maize, groundnuts, beans, Soya-beans and so forth. Jiyane	What other plans do you have? Chitumbura	I need to keep chickens, if my crops are well. Jiyane	Besides being resettled on this piece of land did you get any assistance from government? Chitumbura	No assistance. Jiyane	What assistance were you looking forward to? Chitumbura	They have to help us because our crops are now becoming yellowish, because of shortage of fertilizer. Jiyane	And now that you have got a piece of land and you are already working on that piece of land, would you encourage other youth like you to venture into agriculture? Chitumbura	Yes I would like to encourage other youth to practice agriculture. Jiyane	Now here is what another youth in agriculture had to say about his new vocation. Gawani	My name is Patrick Gawani; I'm staying in Banket that's where I got my land from Government from the fast track. Jiyane	What crops did you grow this season? Gawani	Especially maize, groundnuts and paprika. Jiyane	Looking at your crops, we?ve been going through the farm, there is quite a lot of green. At what condition exactly are they? Gawani	Now we think it?s alright, because in the middle of this month rains had almost gone, but now I can see the crop, they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>well.</b> Jiyane	Besides this piece of land did you get any form of assistance from either government or anywhere? Gawani	You know the government only gave us these seeds, but now we are just waiting for them to assist us with fertilizer, again. Jiyane	You seem to be doing very well, your crops look quite OK. Do you have any other projects in the pipeline that you would want to do in the next season besides just growing crops? Gawani	We were planning to have the range of cattle, even chicken projects, so that we will not have to wait for only ploughing or doing farming. Jiyane	The projects that you are mentioning require quite a lot of finance. How are you going to go about getting finance for those projects? Gawani	We want the government to help us. Even the donors who can come and help us to have that money to start those projects. Jiyane	I certainly hope that all other youths in other parts of the world, benefited from our discussion with the two youths in this programme. The prime lesson for youths is that white collar employment is not the only way to earn a living. Engaging in properly planned agricultural activities is a good vehicle of improving one?s life, especially in this critical time of economic stagnation, all over the world. Till we meet again in the next programme, I am Sylvia Jiyane. End of tape. The ?Fast Track? programme in Zimbabwe has redistributed land to landless people, in order to give them the opportunity to make a living from agriculture. This report features two young recipients of land, who describe the difficulties they have faced, and the potential they see for their future as farmers...|$|E
