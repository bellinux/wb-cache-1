5|$|After it was shelved by Jive Records for two years, Miguel {{released}} his debut album All I Want Is You in November 2010. It sold poorly {{at first and}} was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. He said {{that the experience of}} balancing creativity and business sense on his first album made him more confident in his approach on Kaleidoscope Dream.|$|E
5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E
5|$|The Indians offered Gromek {{a salary}} cut for 1950 {{due to his}} losing record the prior year, to which Gromek objected. In voicing his objection, Gromek offered that he would welcome being dealt to his {{hometown}} Detroit Tigers. The Indians used a four-man starting rotation {{for most of the}} season, relegating Gromek to spot starter status as they had done in prior seasons. The highlight of his season came on May 28 against the Chicago White Sox, throwing a 7–0 complete game shutout, dropping his ERA on the year from 7.98 to 4.94 in the process. Gromek had a 10–7 record and a 3.65 ERA in 31 games on the year. The Indians had a new manager, Al López, entering the 1951 season, and as a result Gromek signed a new contract immediately, feeling that López would utilize him <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> spot starter and that he would be treated more fairly than he had under Boudreau. Lopez ended up using Gromek the same way Boudreau had, keeping him primarily in the bullpen, but using him as a starting pitcher when one of the regular starters was injured or they needed a second pitcher for a doubleheader. Gromek finished the year with seven wins, four losses, and a 2.77 ERA, lowest on the team, in 27 games.|$|E

25|$|Abolitionists also {{attacked}} slavery as {{a threat}} to the freedom of white Americans. Defining freedom <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> simple lack of restraint, antebellum reformers held that the truly free man was one who imposed restraints upon himself. Thus, for the anti-slavery reformers of the 1830s and 1840s, the promise of free labor and upward social mobility (opportunities for advancement, rights to own property, and to control one's own labor), was central to the ideal of reforming individuals.|$|E

25|$|Dede {{has been}} criticised by Turkish music purists {{for not being}} steeped in the Sufi traditions and for not {{properly}} representing Sufism in his music and writings. Another criticism is that the whirling dancers he uses to accompany his shows do not accurately display the correct dervish routines. However, <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> ney player, working just as often as a DJ as performing live in concert, with an audience consisting of clubbers, not Islamic scholars, Dede aims to synthesise several different traditions rather than recreate a historically pure music.|$|E
25|$|Holden's current {{projects}} {{include two}} novels {{about the events}} surrounding Japan's triple disaster of March 11, 2011: Tsunami and Escape from Sonoyo. The former, covers the disaster in sixteen self-contained, interconnected stories; the latter centers on the ordeals of one family divided, in search of themselves and one another. Combined, the books present a portrait of loss, heroism, survival, and perseverance {{through the eyes of}} victims, witnesses, rescuers, refugees, reporters, civil authorities, soldiers and criminals. The result can be read <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> record of one period in a particular nation’s history, but a universal story of sacrifice, heartbreak, faith, redemption and transcendence during crisis.|$|E

Hitler instructed Mussolini to establish the Italian Social Republic in German-held northern Italy. The Italian Social Republic was a German puppet state. The Fascist state's armed forces were a combination of Mussolini loyalist Fascists and German armed forces. However Mussolini had little power, Hitler and the German armed forces led the campaign against the Allies and saw little interest in preserving Italy <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> buffer zone against an Allied invasion of Germany.|$|E

25|$|As of 2012, {{there are}} 118 known elements, about 80 {{of which are}} stable – that is, they do not change by {{radioactive}} decay into other elements. Some elements can occur <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> single chemical substance (allotropes). For instance, oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3). The majority of elements are classified as metals. These are elements with a characteristic lustre such as iron, copper, and gold. Metals typically conduct electricity and heat well, and they are malleable and ductile. Around a dozen elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are classified as non-metals. Non-metals lack the metallic properties described above, {{they also have a}} high electronegativity and a tendency to form negative ions. Certain elements such as silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non-metals, and are known as metalloids.|$|E
25|$|In North America, the American lobster did {{not achieve}} {{popularity}} until the mid-19th century, when New Yorkers and Bostonians developed {{a taste for}} it, and commercial lobster fisheries only flourished after {{the development of the}} lobster smack, a custom-made boat with open holding wells on the deck to keep the lobsters alive during transport. Prior to this time, lobster was considered a mark of poverty or as a food for indentured servants or lower members of society in Maine, Massachusetts, and the Canadian Maritimes. It has been suggested servants specified in employment agreements that they would not eat lobster more than twice per week, however there is no evidence for this. Lobster was also commonly served in prisons, much to the displeasure of inmates. American lobster was initially deemed worthy only of being used as fertilizer or fish bait, and until well into the 20th century, it was not viewed <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> low-priced canned staple food.|$|E
