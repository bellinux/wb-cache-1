Some Grammar schools also align their catchments with <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Catchment area boundaries, in common with other over-subscription criteria used in admissions policies, must not unfairly disadvantage children from particular social or racial groups.|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2003 Dr. Serryn EaglesonThe fragmentation of <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{is a serious problem}} in the analysis of social, environmental and economic data. This research focuses on the development of a coordinated approach to the design of <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries</b> that endeavours to support accurate decision making. Around the world, <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries</b> have been structured in an uncoordinated manner, limiting data exchange and integration between organisations. The solution proposed in this research adopts the hierarchical reorganisation of <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries</b> to enhance data integration and data exchange within the spatial data infrastructure (SDI) framework. The SDI is an initiative intended to facilitate access to complete and consistent data sets. One of the most fundamental problems restricting the objectives of the SDI is the fragmentation of data between non-coterminous boundary systems. The majority of <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries</b> have been constructed by individual agencies to meet individual needs. Examples of the proliferation of different boundary systems include postcodes, census-collector districts, health districts and police districts. Due to the lack of coordination between boundary systems, current technologies for analysing spatial data, such as geographic information systems (GIS), are not reaching their full potential. A review of the current literature reveals that, until now, little has been done to solve this problem. The prototype developed within this research provides a new mechanism for the design of <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The prototype incorporates two algorithms. These are based on HSR theory and administrative-agency constraints and are implemented within the GIS environment. Such an approach {{is an example of the}} potential that is available when we link spatial information theory with the SDI framework and disciplinary knowledge. Open Acces...|$|R
