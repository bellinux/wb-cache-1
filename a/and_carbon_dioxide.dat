5|$|Yeast is the {{microorganism}} that {{is responsible}} for fermentation in beer. Yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains, which produces alcohol <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> and thereby turns wort into beer.

5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized {{this was due to}} the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{can live}} {{on a wide variety}} of {{substrates}} and uses mixed-acid fermentation in anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Since many pathways in mixed-acid fermentation produce hydrogen gas, these pathways require the levels of hydrogen to be low, as is the case when E. coli lives together with hydrogen-consuming organisms, such as methanogens or sulphate-reducing bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Like other insects, {{cockroaches}} breathe {{through a}} system of tubes called tracheae which are attached to openings called spiracles on all body segments. When the carbon dioxide level in the insect rises high enough, valves on the spiracles open <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in. The tracheal system branches repeatedly, the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to each cell, allowing gaseous exchange to take place.|$|E

The lack of evidence for historic seismicity prior to 2007 suggests that the area is tectonically stable, making the Nechako Basin one of the most seismically inactive areas of British Columbia.|$|E

The vortex tube was used to separate gas mixtures, oxygen <b>and</b> nitrogen, <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> helium, <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> air in 1967 by Linderstrom-Lang.|$|R
5|$|Amino acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> {{as a source}} of energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase. The amino group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured {{dairy products}} such as yogurt and cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties. The principal microbes involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, and ordinary bread; and bacteria, in the case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, dairy products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of the {{periodic}} table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> in the arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre does so via motor neurons which activate the muscles of respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E
5|$|Lutetium metal is {{slightly}} unstable in air at standard conditions, but it burns readily at 150°C to form lutetium oxide. The resulting compound {{is known to}} absorb water <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> and {{may be used to}} remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres. Similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water (slow when cold and fast when hot); lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction. Lutetium metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form trihalides; all of them (except the fluoride) are soluble in water.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E

5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen <b>and</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> in the arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A {{rise in the}} arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E
