She was afraid of moving to Castile because, although her mentally unstable mother Joanna (who died aged 77 in April 1555) had been sovereign there, Mary had never lived in Castile. She was afraid that Eleanor's death would leave her alone in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>whose</b> customs she did not know. In the end, she {{decided to move to}} Castile, while retaining the possibility of moving back to the Netherlands in case she could not adjust to the Castilian customs. Charles, Eleanor, and Mary sailed from Ghent on 15 September 1556.|$|E

25|$|When he {{took office}} on March 4, 1845, Polk, at 49, became the {{youngest}} man {{at the time to}} assume the presidency. Polk's inauguration was the first inaugural ceremony to be reported by telegraph and to be shown in a newspaper illustration (in The Illustrated London News). Polk presided over <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>whose</b> population had doubled every twenty years since the American Revolution and which had reached demographic parity with its former colonial overlord, Great Britain. Polk's tenure saw continued technological improvements, including the continued expansion of railroads and increased use of the telegraph. These improved communications and growing demographics increasingly made the United States into a strong military power, while also stoking expansionism.|$|E

Countries with notably lower proportions of deaths include Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Italy, and Norway. Albania was the only country occupied by Germany that had a significantly larger Jewish population in 1945 than in 1939. About two hundred native Jews and over a thousand refugees were provided with false documents, hidden when necessary, and generally treated as honored guests in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>whose</b> population was roughly 60% Muslim.

25|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I caught Pușcariu in Techirghiol, Romania. A reserve {{officer in the}} Austro-Hungarian Army, and overall an Austrian patriot, he rushed back to be mobilized in Brașov, and was later ordered to Cisnădie. In September 1914, after a liturgical music concert in the Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral, he met Onisifor Ghibu, whom he had known since 1905, and who records the deep concern the ongoing conflict was causing Pușcariu. Subsequently, he was stationed on the Italian Front. There, his sentiments of loyalty toward the Empire conflicted with the Italophilia he felt toward <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>whose</b> inhabitants he saw as the natural allies of the Romanians, a fellow Latin people. Czernowitz (Cernăuți), the site of his residence, manuscripts and materials, fell to the Imperial Russian Army {{in the first half}} of the war. From February to June 1916, he was intermittently hospitalized for eye problems, first at Trieste, where he met Iuliu Maniu, and later at Innsbruck, followed by Brașov. When the Romanian Kingdom entered the war in August, on the side of the Triple Entente, he was either at home on leave or at the front, but in either case continued his research. The following January, he began keeping a diary, writing fairly regular entries until his wife's death in 1944. While on the front in early 1918 dealing with military accounting and supplies, he worked on a glossary of the Istro-Romanian language.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Ryckmans and Lieutenant General Paul Ermens {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} sending an expedition to Italian East Africa with the South African and British military missions in Léopoldville. There were two problems with such an undertaking: Italian territory was thousands of kilometers away and Belgium was not at war with Italy. The Belgian government in exile was wary of declaring war on <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>whose</b> royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship. A declaration of war was eventually delivered on 23 November 1940. Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that {{a state of war}} existed between Italy and the Congo.|$|E

Some critics of the war, particularly within the U.S. military community, argued pointedly against the conflation of Iraq and the war on terror, and criticized Bush for losing focus on the more important objective of fighting al-Qaeda.
