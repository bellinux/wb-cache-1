40|$|After we woke {{from the}} “exhilaration” of December ’ 89, glad that we “got rid” of socialism, in the {{following}} years we have been looking around us, and we saw everywhere all kinds of problems: financial blockages, the lack of markets both for the “inputs” and for the “outputs”, massive restrictions of activity and, as a consequence, unemployment and powerful social conflicts, <b>abnormal</b> <b>prices</b> rises. When we thought we pulled ourselves together, reaching to the year of 2008, we didn’t {{have a lot of}} time to enjoy our success, noticing that USA, instead of giving us its economic performance, brought us a financial crisis, followed by an economic one. That’s the last straw! and now we’re waiting now for a sheet anchor to save us from the current economic-financial crisis…from the management. The paper seeks to highlight the necessary changes in the management activity in the current crisis context, respectively the existence of a coherent strategy of the company to assure it the necessary performance for entering the competition, the changing of the dominant way of thinking, the impact of the clients’ attitude regarding the employees, the need of leadership and the awareness of the fact that any crisis means another opportunity. the crisis’ management, economic crisis, destructive competition, menaces, opportunities, leadership. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Numerous {{studies suggest}} that {{announcements}} of capital offerings cause <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> reaction in stock markets. However, despite extensive research, relevant studies on the property sector are still relatively scarce, {{especially in the case}} of Hong Kong. The determinants of the post-offering price effects, which vary across industries and regions, are yet to be identified. This paper aims to examine the abnormal stock return phenomenon of Hong Kong property developers and construction companies surrounding the announcement and offer dates of capital issuances. Design/methodology/approach - It employs the event-study methodology and regression analysis to verify such effects. Findings - The major findings are: on equity offering announcements, there is a significant negative price reaction; the pre-offering debt/equity ratio of a firm is significantly associated with the level of <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> reactions; and on debt offerings there is, to the contrary, a modest increase in stock prices. Practical implications - This study has identified a set of determinants of the post-offering stock price effects. Originality/value - It can be concluded that there is evidence of <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> effects over the announcement and offer dates of capital issuances with unique characteristics of the property and construction sectors in Hong Kong.

The {{evidence suggests that}} the observed stock prices react within 90 minutes after the ad hoc disclosures. Trading volumes take even longer to adjust. We find no evidence for <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> reactions or <b>abnormal</b> trading volume before announcements. The bigger the company that announces an ad hoc disclosure, the less severe is the <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> effect following the announcement. The number of analysts is negatively correlated to the trading volume effect before the ad hoc disclosure. The higher the trading volume on the last trading day before the announcement, the greater is the price effect after the ad hoc disclosures and the greater the trading volume effect.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of stock and option prices around block trades in stocks. The results indicate that for both uptick and downtick block trades the stock prices adjust within a fifteen minute period after the block trade. Moreover, for uptick blocks {{there is no evidence}} of any stock price reaction before the block trade. However, the adjustment of stock price for downtick blocks begins about fifteen minutes before the block trade. They also find that option price behavior differs considerably from stock price behavior. Specifically, the authors' results suggest that options exhibit <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> behavior starting thirty minutes before the block and ending one hour after the block. The pattern is more pronounced for downtick blocks and for put options. The authors interpret this <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> behavior of options before the block trade as consistent with intermarket frontrunning. Copyright 1992 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

Using a unique product-level scanner data set of a national grocery chain, we find a pronounced and significant reduction in beef sales following the first discovered infection, which dissipates slowly {{over the next three}} months. Cattle futures show a comparable pattern of <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> drops to the scanner data. Contracts with longer maturity show smaller drops, suggesting that the market anticipated the impact to be transitory.

40|$|The result {{shows that}} the stock <b>prices</b> {{recorded}} positive <b>abnormal</b> returns for both inclusion and exclusion on the announcement day. In general, price effects for inclusion in both periods are considerably smaller magnitude than those {{for changes in the}} S&P 500, and the Nikkei 500. The result also {{shows that the}} trading volume, on average, increase (decrease) for stocks added (deleted), on the announcement day. The temporary price effect for exclusion support price-pressure hypothesis in both periods. The price-pressure hypothesis also exists for inclusion in period 1995 - 2004. Inclusion in period 2000 - 2004 supports both the information hypothesis and the downward-sloping-demand-curve hypothesis. No evidence to support the liquidity hypothesis.

We find strong evidence that investment strategy and fiduciary restrictions affect institutional investor demand for stocks after spin-offs. However, contrary to prior research conjecturing that trading related to investor preferences creates short-term price pressure in entities emerging from spin-off transactions, we find that, in general, this trading is not associated with <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> movements for parents or subsidiaries around the spin-off. ...|$|R

The information content of inclusion does not account for the entire share price response, lending support to the hypothesis of increased purchases by index funds. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a database}} of 60, 000 + individual repurchase trades from the Toronto Stock Exchange. The average intraday price impact of repurchase trades is negative, since, because of execution rules, 60 % are seller-initiated. Prices fall less following repurchase than matched non-repurchase trades-there is an <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> impact. We find evidence consistent with two hypotheses: repurchases provide price support, and the market learns that the shares are undervalued. Consistent with the latter, we find that repurchasing companies have superior timing. Share <b>prices</b> show <b>abnormal</b> losses (gains) before (after) the repurchase trades. We find no significant market reaction to the mandatory public disclosure of the trade details. Copyright 2006 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

Generally speaking, fiscal policy cannot address the causes of inflation, but may contribute towards offsetting its redistributive effects. It has at its disposal measures influencing public revenues (changes in taxes, social security contributions or public charges) or expenditure (cash transfers or the provision of public services that may serve as substitutes for market goods and services showing <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> increases). They often put heavy claims on budgetary resources while mitigating only the impact of price hikes. Much more efficient is therefore policy action addressing {{the root causes of}} inflation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of integrated mobile financial information and transaction services which can help private investors in making time-critical investment decisions and portfolio transactions in time. The analysis of intraday stock price reactions following company announcements provides evidence regarding the added value of such services if <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> movements can be observed. As efficient capital markets react very quickly to new information available, private investors require combined mobile notification and transaction services. So far, existing concepts can not fulfill these requirements which results from inappropriate implementation of the security mechanisms in order to realize secure and trustworthy processing. After identifying potential weaknesses of current solutions we introduce an adequate system infrastructure which can realize secure information and transaction processing in time by permitting a smart integration of notification and transaction services...|$|R

In addition, the tax-loss selling hypothesis, which is commonly {{thought to be a}} cause of the January effect in the US, is tested with the April year-end for UK investors. We find evidence of excess <b>abnormal</b> share <b>price</b> returns. However, this does not impact upon excess <b>abnormal</b> share <b>price</b> returns in January.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} short-term price reactions after one-day <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> {{changes and}} whether they create exploitable profit opportunities in various financial markets.

A trading robot approach is then used to test two trading strategies aimed at exploiting the detected anomalies to make abnormal profits. The results suggest that a strategy based on counter-movements after overreactions does not generate profits in the FOREX and the commodity markets, but it is profitable {{in the case of the}} US stock market. By contrast, a strategy exploiting the "inertia anomaly" produces profits in the case of the FOREX and the commodity markets, but not in the case of the US stock market...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the propensity, {{characteristics}} and performance of directors' trades. Consistent with prior research we show that on average, directors outperform the market. However, we also find that there exist a large number of trades which do not share these <b>abnormal</b> share <b>price</b> returns and consequently have little information content. This has important consequences for market participants who use director trading activity as a signal for their own trading strategies. Using different measures of directors' trades based on trade characteristics, we report that purchases by directors are more informative than sales. In addition, the number of directors trading within a twenty day window and the percentage of the directors' holding that is being traded are both important factors in the <b>abnormal</b> share <b>price</b> performance following the trade.

Clients of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Wachovia saw their stock prices fall almost 5 percent, on average, on the day it appeared that their equity underwriter might collapse. Representing a loss in equity value of more than $ 3 billion, the decline was more than 1 percent lower than the conditional return predicted by a market model. The price impact was worse for companies with more opaque operations and fewer monitors, suggesting that underwriters {{play an important role}} in monitoring newly public companies.

Using the event study method, the speed of reaction of the market to annual earnings information releases for a sample of 16 firms listed on the exchange is tested. Significant <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> reactions around earnings announcements suggest the earnings announcements contain value-relevant information. We find that {{the magnitude of the}} cumulative abnormal returns is dominated by significant reactions 20 days before the earnings release date which suggests that a portion of the market reaction may be due to private acquisition and, possibly, abuse of information by insiders. The persistent downward drift of the cumulative abnormal returns, 20 days after the announcement, is inconsistent with the efficient markets hypothesis, and therefore suggests that the Nigerian stock market does not efficiently adjust to earnings information for the sample firms within the study period. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{accounting}} standards harmonization enhances the comparability of financial information across countries. I hypothesize that a firm yet to announce earnings reacts more strongly to the earnings {{announcement of a}} foreign firm when both report under the same rather than different {{accounting standards}}. My analysis of <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> reactions for a global sample of firms supports the prediction. Next, {{in an attempt to}} control for the underlying economic comparability and the effects of changes in reporting quality, I use a difference-in-differences design around the mandatory introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards. I find that mandatory adopters experience a significant increase in market reactions to the release of earnings by voluntary adopters compared to the period preceding mandatory adoption. This increase is not observed for nonadopters. Taken together, the results show that accounting standards harmonization facilitates transnational information transfer and suggest financial statement comparability as a direct mechanism...|$|R

In particular we focus on price behaviour using daily market indexes from 40 stock exchanges over the period 1989 to 1997. Our results are not consistent with the over-reaction hypothesis. We find positive (negative) <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> performance in the short-term windows (up to 10 days) following positive (negative) price shocks. Our analysis also highlights some important differences across markets classified as either developed or emerging. While the price shock occurrences are evenly distributed between our two groups of markets, we show that the post-shock abnormal performances are significantly larger for our sample of emerging markets.

The ex-day share price behaviour is modelled {{to take account of}} the personal taxes of long-term investors as well as the transaction costs and holding risks of short-term traders. The post-announcement drift is linked to the behaviour of share prices around the exdividend dates. The results show that the <b>abnormal</b> <b>price</b> performance and <b>abnormal</b> volume persist throughout the announcement to ex-dividend day interval. However, the pre-ex-day abnormal performance is not a function of the two factors, dividend yield and transaction costs, linked to short-term trading, but, rather, to the magnitude of dividend changes.

This research makes a number of contributions relative to prior research. South Africa, unlike most other national markets, favours rights issues over cash offers. Since most of the research has been conducted in developed markets, South Africa, as an emerging economy, provides a valuable opportunity to determine whether the underperformance of seasoned equity offers is confined only to first world economies. Results from the study showed that over a three to five year period, rights issuing firms underperformed their equally-weighted benchmarks. The underperformance appeared to be driven primarily by small issuers. These findings are consistent with the South African study by Affleck-Graves & Page (1996).
