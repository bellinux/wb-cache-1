5|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> the {{situation}} here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative {{powers of the}} Crown {{in the hands of}} the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, but it would not be proper for her to intervene in person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.|$|E
5|$|During Queen Victoria's widowhood, Edward {{pioneered the}} idea of royal public {{appearances}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> them today—for example, opening the Thames Embankment in 1871, the Mersey Tunnel in 1886, and Tower Bridge in 1894—but his mother did not allow Edward {{an active role in}} the running of the country until 1898. He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals. He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the Schleswig-Holstein Question in 1864 (she was pro-German) and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet Giuseppe Garibaldi. Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone sent him papers secretly. From 1886, Foreign Secretary Lord Rosebery sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some Cabinet papers were opened to him.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} custom of Europe {{in the late}} {{classical}} and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women. But the date and circumstances of {{the foundation of the}} church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century that he should be commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following the example of the Life of St David written at Llanbadarn about 1090. That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such lives. They are not biographies <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> them today. Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint’s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.|$|E

5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the exact}} date Saint Padarn founded {{the church is}} uncertain, it seems clear however that Llanbadarn Fawr was an early sixth-century foundation, a Celtic clas church. The church {{may have been the}} seat of an abbot or bishop during the years {{immediately}} following Saint Padarn, who was traditionally said to be its first bishop (as a clas church, it was not a cathedral <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> the term today, but closer to a collegiate church), nor did it necessarily possess any substantial buildings. It was one of the leading clasau of early Christian Wales, and the one we know most about, partly because of the significant role it played as a literary centre.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{complicated}} nature of rationalist thinking, {{the nature of}} philosophy, and the understanding that humans are aware of knowledge available only {{through the use of}} rational thought, many of the great philosophers from antiquity laid down the foundation for rationalism though they themselves weren't rationalists <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> the concept today.|$|E

60|$|At first Captain Smith was of {{the belief}} that she had come on some errand; but after much questioning, more by signs than words, it came out, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understood</b> the matter, that the girl was in Jamestown for no other purpose than {{to see what we}} white people were like.|$|R
25|$|In {{those days}} the kings were warlords rather than kings <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> that title today, {{and what was}} to become Sweden, Norway and Denmark in a modern sense, were a number of petty kingdoms whose borders changed {{constantly}} as the kings killed each other, and had the local assemblies accept them as kings. The politics of these early kingdoms are retold in Beowulf (see e.g. the semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars) and the Norse sagas.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} two decades, NASA will {{continue}} to conduct missions to address whether life ever arose on Mars. The search begins with determining whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> it, requires water, so the history of water on Mars is critical to finding out if the Martian environment was ever conducive to life. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers {{do not have the}} ability to detect life directly, they are offering very important information on the habitability of the environment in the planet's history.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, Oz sent imprisoned former Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti {{a copy of}} {{his book}} A Tale of Love and Darkness in Arabic {{translation}} with his personal dedication in Hebrew: “This story is our story, I hope you read it and understand us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> you, hoping to see you outside and in peace, yours, Amos Oz”. The gesture was criticized by members of rightist political parties, among them Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely. Assaf Harofeh Hospital canceled Oz's invitation to give the keynote speech at an awards ceremony for outstanding physicians in the wake of this incident.|$|E

25|$|Centralized {{dairy farming}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> it {{primarily}} developed around villages and cities, where residents {{were unable to}} have cows of their own {{due to a lack}} of grazing land. Near the town, farmers could make some extra money on the side by having additional animals and selling the milk in town. The dairy farmers would fill barrels with milk in the morning and bring it to market on a wagon. Until the late 19th century, the milking of the cow was done by hand. In the United States, several large dairy operations existed in some northeastern states and in the west, that involved as many as several hundred cows, but an individual milker could not be expected to milk more than a dozen cows a day. Smaller operations predominated.|$|E
25|$|Size is not {{the only}} factor in making red dwarfs {{potentially}} unsuitable for life, however. On a red dwarf planet, photosynthesis on the night side would be impossible, since it would never see the sun. On the day side, because the sun does not rise or set, areas in the shadows of mountains would remain so forever. Photosynthesis <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> it would be {{complicated by the fact that}} a red dwarf produces most of its radiation in the infrared, and on the Earth the process depends on visible light. There are potential positives to this scenario. Numerous terrestrial ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis, for instance, which would be possible in a red dwarf system. A static primary star position removes the need for plants to steer leaves toward the sun, deal with changing shade/sun patterns, or change from photosynthesis to stored energy during night. Because of the lack of a day-night cycle, including the weak light of morning and evening, far more energy would be available at a given radiation level.|$|E
500|$|Seton's {{intention}} {{in writing}} his stories was to [...] "freely translate" [...] the animals' language into English, as they [...] "have no speech <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> it". The stories were typically prefaced by the author's strong assertion of their accuracy, and Wild Animals I Have Known marked the nature writer's first {{emphasis on the}} perspective of a wild animal. As Canadian poet and author Charles G.D. Roberts described it, the genre focused on [...] "the personality, individuality, mentality, of an animal, as well as its purely physical characteristics." ...|$|E
30|$|Note {{that the}} third and fourth {{learning}} areas were created based on the NEL’s Language and Literacy learning area.

60|$|Now {{it is easy}} to <b>understand</b> why <b>we,</b> so sorely pressed {{and lacking}} the wherewithal to hold our own, were left on Breed's hill to meet this third assault, which would be made by fresh men, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understood</b> when <b>we</b> saw yet more barges put out from Boston, and {{afterward}} learned that General Clinton was joining Howe as a volunteer, bringing with him additional reinforcements.|$|R
60|$|As {{these words}} were uttered, Marble {{appeared}} on deck, and waved his hat, again, in recognition. This was enough; <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understood</b> each other, the two ships took sufficient room, and hove-to. We lowered our boat, and Talcott went alongside of the Dundee, in quest {{of our old}} shipmate. Newspapers and news were exchanged; and, in twenty minutes, I had the extreme gratification of grasping Marble once more by the hand.|$|R
500|$|In the future, the {{survival}} of human civilisation is increasingly threatened by rising pollution, environmental damage and the depletion of the Earth's natural resources. The narrator (Ed Bishop) introduces Space Station Delta and the [...] "lightship" [...] Altares – the latter {{of which is the}} first Earth spacecraft to [...] "harness the limitless power of the photon", allowing it to travel at the speed of light: [...] "This could create the effects predicted by Einstein's Theory of Relativity – effects that could shrink the very fabric of space, distort time, and perhaps alter the structure of the universe <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{primordial}} singularity {{is itself}} sometimes called [...] "the Big Bang", but the term can also {{refer to a}} more generic early hot, dense phase of the universe. In either case, [...] "the Big Bang" [...] as an event is also colloquially {{referred to as the}} [...] "birth" [...] of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a regime where the laws of physics <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> them (specifically general relativity and the standard model of particle physics) work. Based on measurements of the expansion using Type Ia supernovae and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, the time that has passed since that event [...] otherwise known as the [...] "age of the universe" [...] is 13.799 ± 0.021billion years. The agreement of independent measurements of this age supports the ΛCDM model that describes in detail the characteristics of the universe.|$|E
500|$|Eve Myles {{previously}} {{appeared in}} the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] as Gwyneth, a 19th-century clairvoyant. Gwyneth had {{a connection to the}} Cardiff Rift, which later became a central plot device in Torchwood. In response to questions about the similarity of the characters' names, Russell T Davies denied they were connected, stating they are [...] "just two names beginning with [...] "G"." [...] Subsequently however, Davies' 2008 Doctor Who episode [...] "Journey's End" [...] alluded to a familial relationship between the characters (with the Doctor specifically asking if Gwen was a family name and Gwen replying that it was), explaining their physical resemblance as the result of [...] "spatial genetic multiplicity". Eve Myles said of the two characters, [...] "it was never on the cards as such, but something {{in the back of my}} head always said that they were going to be connected somehow." [...] Davies explained that the relationship between the characters is not literal, stating that [...] "It's not familial <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> it" [...] instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as [...] "an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift." ...|$|E

500|$|As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the {{utilitarian}} John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience {{does not}} necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that [...] "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home." [...] Arendt believed {{that people who are}} unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can [...] "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" [...] bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|E

60|$|This trade held a good while, and {{we found}} that our {{customers}} came more from other islands than from the island where the governor resided; the reason of which, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>understood</b> afterwards, was, because, as the governor had not openly granted a freedom of commerce, but privately winked at it, so they were not willing to carry it on openly before his face, or, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> say, under his nose; whereas, in other islands, they could convey their goods on shore with very little hazard, agreeing with the custom-house officer for a small matter.|$|R
