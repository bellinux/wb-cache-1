This type of spray nozzle may require more <b>atomizing</b> <b>air</b> and a higher <b>atomizing</b> <b>air</b> pressure drop because the mixing and atomization of liquid takes place outside the nozzle. The liquid pressure drop is lower for this type of nozzle, sometimes drawing liquid into the nozzle due to the suction caused by the <b>atomizing</b> <b>air</b> nozzles (siphon nozzle). If the liquid to be atomized contains solids an external mix atomizer may be preferred. This spray may be shaped to produce different spray patterns.

40|$|The {{present data}} set {{consists}} of detailed measurements obtained within methanol sprays {{produced by a}} research atomizer which is operated with three <b>atomizing</b> <b>air</b> modes: none, non-swirling, and swirling. In addition, the cases with nonswirling and swirling <b>atomizing</b> <b>air</b> are characterized under reacting conditions. In each case, state-of-the-art diagnostics are applied. Measurements of the gas phase velocities in both the single and two-phase cases, droplet size distributions, and vapor concentration are obtained. The data are reported in a standardized format to ensure usefulness as modeling challenges. The results obtained reveal the presence of significant interaction between phases and significant changes in spray structure {{as a result of}} altering the <b>atomizing</b> <b>air</b> characteristics. Efforts have been directed toward delineation of errors and comparison with existing data sets where possible. The result is a comprehensive data base for vaporizing sprays under reacting and non-reacting conditions which permit a systematic variation in aerodynamic effects to be explored. © 1995 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} within sprays {{are needed}} to understand the vaporization, transport, and combustion of liquid fuels. While diagnostics {{have been developed to}} characterize the structure of the spray droplets in great detail (e. g., phase Doppler interferometry), details regarding the gas phase (e. g., oxidizing media and fuel vapor) are more difficult to obtain. In the present study, measurement of gas phase vector properties are achieved in the spray field of a twin-fluid atomizer using phase Doppler interferometry. A gas phase scalar, the concentration of hydrocarbon vapor, is measured using an infrared extinction/scattering technique. When combined, the two measurements provide a direct measure of the vaporization characteristics of the spray. A methanol spray is studied which is produced by an atomizer operating at three conditions, (1) no <b>atomizing</b> <b>air,</b> (2) non-swirling <b>atomizing</b> <b>air,</b> and (3) swirling <b>atomizing</b> <b>air.</b> The injection mode alters the vaporization behavior of the spray. For the non-reacting cases, (1) the presence of non-swirling air-assist, while not strongly affecting the spatial vaporization history, enhances the temporal vaporization rate compared to the case without atomizing air; (2) the presence of swirling <b>atomizing</b> <b>air</b> greatly enhances the vaporization rate in both space and time; and (3) examination of the rate of change of vaporization reveals a correlation among all three injection modes, suggesting that the fundamental mechanism of vaporization in all three sprays is the same. For the reacting cases, swirling air increases the production of fuel vapor in both time and space compared to the non-swirling air case. The change in vaporization rate shows a trend similar to the non-reacting case, although the rate of change is negative in the region of the reaction zone due to competition between vaporization and consumption. © 1992 Combustion Institute...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} technical advances made to {{the concept}} of a low pressure, <b>air</b> <b>atomized</b> oil burner for home heating applications. Currently all oil burners on the market are of the pressure atomized, retention head type. These burners have a lower firing rate limit of about 0. 5 gallons per hour of oil, due to reliability problems related to small flow passage sizes. High pressure <b>air</b> <b>atomized</b> burners {{have been shown to be}} one route to avoid this problem but air compressor cost and reliability have practically eliminated this approach. With the low pressure <b>air</b> <b>atomized</b> burner the <b>air</b> required for atomization can be provided by a fan at 5 - 8 inches of water pressure. A burner using this concept, termed the Fan-Atomized Burner or ''FAB'' has been developed and is currently being commercialized. In the head of the FAB, the combustion air is divided into three parts, much like a conventional retention head burner. This report describes development work on a new concept in which 100 % of the air from the fan goes through the atomizer. The primary advantage of this approach is a great simplification of the head design. A nozzle specifically sized for this concept was built and is described in the report. Basic flow pressure tests, cold air velocity profiles, and atomization performance have been measured. A burner head/flame tube has been developed which promotes a toroidal recirculation zone near the nozzle for flame stability. The burner head has been tested in several furnace and boiler applications over the firing rate range 0. 2 to 0. 28 gallons per hour. In all cases the burner can operate with very low excess air levels (under 10 %) without producing smoke. Flue gas NO{sub x} concentration varied from 42 to 62 ppm at 3 % O{sub 2 }.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{optimize}} the process parameters required {{for the production of}} spray-dried oily core nanocapsules (NCs) with targeted size and drug yield using a two-level four-factor fractional factorial experimental design (FFED). The coded process parameters chosen were inlet temperature (X 1), feed flow rate (X 2), <b>atomizing</b> <b>air</b> flow (X 3), and aspiration rate (X 4). The produced NCs were characterized for size, yield, morphology, and powder flowability by dynamic light scattering, electron microscope, Carr’s index, and Hausner ratio measurement, respectively.

The substrate was lactose-polyvinylpyrrolidone particles containing or not acetaminophen {{as a drug}} model. Polyethylene glycol (MW, 4000) used as binder was atomized onto the bed by a two-fluid spray nozzle. The granulation experiments followed a 2 (3) factorial design with triplicates at the center point and were carried out by varying the spray nozzle vertical position, the <b>atomizing</b> <b>air</b> flow rate and the binder feed rate. Granules were evaluated by their pharmacotechnical properties like size distribution, bulk and tapped densities, Carr index, Hausner ratio and tableting characteristics. Analysis of variance showed that granule sizes were affected by the PEG feed rate and <b>atomizing</b> <b>air</b> pressure at the significance levels of 1. 0 and 5. 0 %. respectively, but spray nozzle distance to the substrate bed was not significant. The spray conditions also affected granule flow and consolidation properties. measured by the Carr index and Hausner ratio.

Tablets prepared with acetaminophen-containing granules showed good properties and adequate release profiles in in vitro dissolution tests.

40|$|The {{investigation}} was conducted {{as a part}} of the requirements for a Masters Degree in Agriculture at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. The work is a result. of cooperation between the Department of Agricultural Engineering and The Swedish Sugar Company. Earlier Swedish investigations have indicated that band spraying with small volume rates (30 - 60 l/ha) can produce a result as good as when spraying with conventional volume rates (about 200 l/ha). Therefore, there is an interest to find an equipment able to distribute small volume rates of spray in a reliable way. The intention was to compare a new Swedish air-turbine-powered rotary atomizer to two other rotary atomizers, two flat fan nozzles and one <b>air</b> <b>atomizing</b> nozzle in band spraying in sugarbeet. The nozzles were used in two field trials with different combinations of spray rates, liquid pressure and, where appropriate, air pressure. The trials were conducted in order to elucidate differences in biological effect. The differences were small and only in some cases significant. There was however a tendency towards better and more even effect to the overall spraying with SS 11001 which was included as a comparison. Droplet size was determined with a laser instrument and the results were in very good accordance with what one can expect when varying pressure, flow rate and measuring point in the spray. All the centrifugal nozzles gave a more narrow drop size spectrum than the hydraulic nozzles, though partly dependent on where the measurement was carried out in the spray. The <b>air</b> <b>atomizing</b> nozzle gave a droplet size as small as 50 m. A comparison of treatments with the same amount of spray, i. e. the same herbicide concentration, does not distinctly show better weed control of small droplets than of big ones.

In addition, the burner head was modified to reduce the flow area to maintain roughly 1 inch of water pressure drop across the head at a firing rate of 0. 25 gallons of oil per hour. The burner ignited easily and could be operated at low excess air levels without smoke. The major disadvantage of this burner approach is the need for the air compressor as part of the system.

The experiments were carried out in a water-cooled horizontal combustion chamber. The pneumatic atomization using effervescent atomizer was used in test. As <b>atomizing</b> medium compressed <b>air</b> and superheated steam was chosen. The tests were performed at GLR = 15, 20 and 25 %. The experiments were focused on {{the investigation of the}} flame characteristics, quality of combustion, emissions, temperature of flue gas, distribution of heat fluxes and stability of combustion. Results revealed that atomization by compressed air is more efficient (approximately by 6 %), on the other hand it leads to higher NO emissions (for 13 mg/mN 3 due to higher in-flame temperature) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model of}} spray combustion was evaluated. The model was compared with measurements in both a gaseous propane flame and an <b>air</b> <b>atomized</b> n-pentane spray flame (35 micron Sauter mean diameter). Profiles of mean velocity, temperature, and species concentrations, {{as well as}} velocity fluctuations and Reynolds stress, were measured. The predictions for the gas flame were in excellent agreement with measurements, except for product species concentrations where errors due to finite reaction rates were detected. Predictions within the spray were qualitatively correct, but the model overestimated the rate of development of the flow; e. g., predicted flame lengths were 30 % shorter than measured. Calibrated drop-life-history calculations showed that finite interphase transport rates caused the discrepancy and that initial drop diameters less than 20 microns would be required for quantitative accuracy of the model...|$|R
