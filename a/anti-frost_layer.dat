40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{infrastructure}} of flexible pavement {{is composed of}} aggregate subbase, <b>anti-frost</b> <b>layer,</b> and subgrade. In particular, the subgrade performance is affected by climates such as frost action and precipitation. The method of TDR(Time Domain Reflectometry) sensors to measure moisture contents in subgrade layer {{has been used in}} the research. Due to the TDR method using dielectric permitivity of soil and water, the sensors can be affected by the low subgrade temperatures. The air temperatures frequently drops below- 20 ℃ in the winter in Korea. As a result, it is necessary to estimate the accuracy of the TDR moisture sensors in the range of below zero temperatures. In this study, the subgrade temperatures of lower than- 2 ℃ were extended to evaluate temperature sensitivity of the TDR moisture sensors. The test results revealed that the moisture contents around the sensors were reduced while those of the upper part of specimen showed a tendency to increase as the specimen surface temperature drops below zero under the volumetric moisture contents(VMC) of 20 % and 30 %. However, the impact o...|$|E
