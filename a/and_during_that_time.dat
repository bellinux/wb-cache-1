5|$|In {{the period}} of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a {{detached}} fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Ploče Gate was built {{to the east of}} the city in 1462.

The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses {{in the service of the}} Spanish admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new, much stronger Revelin Fortress.
