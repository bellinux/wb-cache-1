25|$|Author Margaret Atwood recalls reading Graves's The White Goddess {{at the age}} of 19. Atwood {{describes}} Graves' {{concept of}} the Triple Goddess as employing violent and misandric imagery, <b>and</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> restrictive role this model places on creative women. Atwood says that it put her off being a writer. Atwood's work has been noted as containing Triple Goddess motifs who sometimes appear failed and parodic. Atwood's Lady Oracle has been cited as a deliberate parody of the Triple Goddess, which subverts the figure and ultimately liberates the lead female character from the oppressive model of feminine creativity that Graves constructed.|$|E

25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} when the ALF first emerged in the United States. The FBI writes that animal rights activists {{had a history of}} committing low-level criminal activity in the U.S. dating back to the 1970s. Freeman Wicklund and Kim Stallwood say the first ALF action there was on May 29, 1977, when researchers Ken LeVasseur and Steve Sipman released two dolphins, Puka and Kea, into the ocean from the University of Hawaii's Marine Mammal Laboratory. The North American Animal Liberation Press Office attributes the dolphin release to a group called Undersea Railroad, <b>and</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> first ALF action was, in fact, a raid on the New York University Medical Center on March 14, 1979, when activists removed one cat, two dogs, and two guinea pigs.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial of}} Socrates is the central, unifying event of Plato's dialogues. Because of this, Apology {{is among the}} most {{frequently}} read of his works. In the Apology, Socrates tries to dismiss rumors that he is a sophist and defends himself against charges of disbelief in the gods and corruption of the young. Socrates insists that long-standing slander will be the real cause of his demise, <b>and</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> legal charges are essentially false. Socrates famously denies being wise, and explains how his life as a philosopher was launched by the Oracle at Delphi. He says that his quest to resolve the riddle of the oracle put him at odds with his fellow man, and that this is the reason he has been mistaken for a menace to the city-state of Athens.|$|E

25|$|Kierkegaardian {{scholars}} have made several interpretations of how Kierkegaard proceeds with parodying Hegel's dialectic. One {{of the more}} popular interpretations argues the aesthetic-ethical-religious stages are the triadic process Kierkegaard was talking about. See section Spheres of existence for more information. Another interpretation argues for the world-individual-will triadic process. The dialectic here is either to assert an individual's own desire to be independent and the desire {{to be part of a}} community. Instead of reconciliation of the world and the individual where problems between the individual and society are neatly resolved in the Hegelian system, Kierkegaard argues that there's a delicate bond holding the interaction between them together, which needs to be constantly reaffirmed. Jean-Paul Sartre takes this latter view <b>and</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> individual is in a constant state of reaffirming his or her own identity, else one falls into bad faith.|$|E

This view is shared by Mike Kropveld—the executive director of an anti-cult organization with the name Info-Cult—who says the controversy leads to criticism by both religious and non-religious people.|$|E
