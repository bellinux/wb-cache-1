In this study we focused on identifying and quantifying errors in the handwritten drug ordering and dispensing documentation processes which could possibly lead to adverse drug events. Methods We studied 1, 934 ordered agents (165 consecutive patients) retrospectively for medication documentation errors. Errors were categorized into: Prescribing errors, transcription errors and <b>administration</b> <b>documentation</b> errors on the nurses' medication lists. The legibility of prescriptions was analyzed to explore its possible influence on the error rate in the documentation process. Results Documentation errors occurred in 65 of 1, 934 prescribed agents (3. 5 %). The incidence of patient charts showing at least one error was 43 %. Prescribing errors were found 39 times (37 %), transcription errors 56 times (53 %), and <b>administration</b> <b>documentation</b> errors 10 times (10 %). The handwriting readability was rated as good in 2 %, moderate in 42 %, bad in 52 %, and unreadable in 4 %. Conclusions This study revealed a high incidence of documentation errors in the traditional handwritten prescription process. Most errors occurred when prescriptions were transcribed into the patients' chart. The readability of the handwritten prescriptions was generally bad. Replacing the traditional handwritten documentation process with information technology could potentially improve the safety in the medication process. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Residential aged care {{services}} are challenged by {{an increasing number}} of residents and a shortage of nursing staff. Developing strategies to overcome this challenge requires an understanding of nursing staff work patterns. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the work processes followed by nursing staff and how nursing time is allocated in a residential aged care home. Methods: An observational time-motion study was conducted at two aged care units for 12 morning shifts. Seven nurses were observed, one per shift. Results: In all, there were 91 h of observation. The results showed that there was a common work process followed by all nurse participants. Medication <b>administration,</b> <b>documentation</b> and verbal communication were the most time-consuming activities and were conducted most frequently. No significant difference between the two units was found in any category of activities. The average duration of most activities was less than 1 min. There was no difference in time utilisation between the endorsed enrolled nurses and the personal carers in providing nursing care. Conclusion: Medication <b>administration,</b> <b>documentation</b> and verbal communication were the major tasks in morning shifts in a residential aged care home. Future research can investigate how verbal communication supports nursing care.

40|$|We {{investigated}} incidence {{rates to}} understand the nature of medication errors potentially introduced by utilizing a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system in the three clinical phases of the medication process: prescription, <b>administration,</b> and <b>documentation.</b> Overt observations and chart reviews were employed at two surgical intensive care units of a 950 -bed tertiary teaching hospital. Ten categories of high-risk drugs prescribed over a four-month period were noted and reviewed. Error definition and classifications were adapted from previous studies for use in the present research. Incidences of medication errors in the three phases of the medication process were analyzed. In addition, nurses' responses to prescription errors were also assessed. Of the 534 prescriptions issued, 286 (53. 6 %) included at least one error. The proportion of errors was 19. 0 % (58) of the 306 drug administrations, of which two-thirds were verbal orders classified as errors due to incorrectly entered prescriptions. Documentation errors occurred in 205 (82. 7 %) of 248 correctly performed administrations. When tracking incorrectly entered prescriptions, 93 % of the errors were intercepted by nurses, but two-thirds of them were recorded as prescribed rather than administered. The number of errors occurring at each phase of the medication process was relatively high, despite long experience with a CPOE system. The main causes of <b>administration</b> errors and <b>documentation</b> errors were prescription errors and verbal order processes.

The MCCA marked a turning point in Medicare policy. It sought to expand Medicare by requiring the beneficiaries themselves to find the added benefits to the program through increased premiums and linking the size of the increase to beneficiary income. The MCCA was largely financed by middle and upper income beneficiaries. Enacted on July 1, 1988, the MCCA was repealed 17 months later on November 22, 1989, due to controversy and opposition from senior citizens concerned about its financing and lack of long-term care benefits. This thesis examines the fiscal and political environment that led to the genesis, evolution, passage, and repeal of the MCCA.

40|$|Learning Management Systems (LMS) are {{software}} for web applications oriented for the <b>administration,</b> <b>documentation,</b> tracking, and reporting of e-learning programs. Moodle {{is a free}} source LMS with more than 63 million users, which makes it the most used LMS around the world. Like some other LMS, the stated philosophy of Moodle includes a constructivist and social constructionist approach to education, emphasizing that learners (and not just teachers) {{can contribute to the}} educational experience. This is the web 2. 0 applied to education. Easy Java Simulations (EJS) is an authoring tool written in Java that helps to create interactive simulations in Java, mainly for teaching and learning purposes. By means of this tool, instructors can easily create virtual and/or (if they also use the appropriate additional software) remote laboratories. While virtual laboratories are based on mathematical models, remote ones use real equipment and so, the experiments are carried out in the reality. Virtual and remote laboratories (created with EJS, for example) as well as LMS (Moodle, for example) offer different but fundamental educational tools to both teachers and students. Since these resources are complementary (and not mutually exclusive), e-learning programs should offer both kinds of tools to be considered a complete experience for students. However, the integration between these two different resources is still an open issue that must be addressed. This thesis gathers together the two previous resources and provides the necessary tools and methodology for developing web experimentation portals (such as UNEDLabs, also presented here) that can offer e-learning programs based on: 1) experimentation (thanks {{to the use of the}} virtual and remote laboratories) and 2) theory documentation provision, social interactivity and easy management (thanks to the use of a LMS). Moreover, the presented tools and methodology allow people not specialized in these particular topics (such as they are the vast majority of the teachers) to easily create these kind of experimentation portals and populate them with virtual and/or remote laboratories (VRLs). Four new Moodle plug-ins facilitate this task: EJSApp, EJSApp Booking System, EJSApp Files Browser and EJSApp Collab Sessions. Nowadays, UNEDLabs holds two courses (among others); one in Control Engineering and another one in Physics. Both of them offer three experiments which are all available in the two possible versions: virtual and remote. The Physics course is still growing and new experiments are added every year. Right now, the three available ones are a motorized rotatory laser for studying the light in isotropic media, a motorized optical bench for determining the focal length of a thin lens, and an experiment with three springs and related to Hookes law. Thanks to the tools presented in this work, not only all the EJS laboratories in UNEDLabs are added and integrated into the Moodle web portal in a very easy and natural way, but they also acquire several special functionalities they lack when they are used outside this LMS. The first of these functionalities is the capability of saving and/or loading files to/from the private files repository in Moodle. The second one is the possibility to create collaborative experimental sessions with other users of Moodle who are enrolled to the course the EJS lab belongs to. The third one is an automatic integration with a booking system specifically designed for managing users access to the remote laboratories. Finally, EJS labs in Moodle can be administrated exactly in the same way as any other Moodle resource or activity, meaning they can be updated or deleted; their access can be restricted to a certain group of users or to users that have previously fulfilled some steps or conditions; security copies are automatically performed during Moodles system backups, etc...|$|E
