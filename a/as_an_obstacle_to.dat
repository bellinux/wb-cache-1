5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may act <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> students when learning about natural selection. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.|$|E
5|$|Because the Home Army was {{loyal to}} the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> a Soviet {{takeover}} of Poland. Consequently, {{over the course of}} the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces.|$|E
5|$|Gilsig has {{characterized}} Terri as being emotionally {{still in high}} school, and lacking the skills to make her marriage work. She has explained that Terri feels threatened by her husband's commitment to the glee club, worried that it is pulling him away from her, and will stop at nothing to keep her marriage together. She {{does not know how}} long Terri will be featured in the series, as she was initially created simply <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> come between Will and Emma.|$|E

30|$|Many authors {{consider}} government corruption <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> {{innovation in}} China (Anderlini 2010; Suttmeier 1985; Otter and Weber 2015). In her work, Zhou discussed Chinese corruption <b>as</b> <b>a</b> long-term <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> innovation (Zhou 2014; see also Balzer and Askonas 2016; Tagscherer et al. 2012). However, Zhou {{and many other}} authors never venture beyond the legal concept of corruption and discuss criminal misbehavior of individuals—for example, bribery by, and personal gain for, individuals in business and administration. Other authors have concentrated on areas such as mafia corruption, high-level government corruption, and discussion of how anti-corruption campaigns {{are being used to}} target political rivals (Broadhurst and Wang 2014; Wang 2014).|$|R
5|$|One reason {{senators}} {{were reluctant}} to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically {{in much of the}} nation. Additionally, a President Wade was seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> Grant's ambitions.|$|E
5|$|As {{the site}} of the Necropolis station had been {{intentionally}} chosen to abut the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> any {{increase in the number of}} lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to permit the expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E
5|$|Before Rommel was {{assigned}} {{defense of the}} Atlantic Wall, obstacles to amphibious landing were being built upon the beaches of Belgium and France. On February 3, 1944 {{during a visit to}} the beach at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Rommel was shown a method by which local troops employed a high pressure water hose to quickly create a hole in beach sand, one which could be used to set high wooden stakes (Hochpfähle) into the beach <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> landing craft. The water hose method took three minutes, fifteen times faster than using a pile driver. Rommel ordered such methods to be used to place wooden beams, metal rails and other obstructions along the beaches of Normandy. Nearly 11,000 were emplaced in the south part of Normandy's coastline where the Allies would eventually land.|$|E

5|$|By 1965, the Americans {{were looking}} for someone to {{overthrow}} Khánh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers to move against Khánh {{since the start of the}} year, even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any regime change back in Washington. At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E

25|$|Critics of smoke-free provisions, {{including}} musician Joe Jackson, {{and political}} essayist Christopher Hitchens, {{have claimed that}} regulation efforts are misguided.

Most of the peasants fled into the forests due to the violence.|$|E
50|$|To the Vietnamese communists, the {{war against}} the United States simply {{extended}} the war for independence initiated against the French.

25|$|The {{filing of}} patents on vaccine {{development}} processes {{can also be}} viewed <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> {{the development of new}} vaccines. Because of the weak protection offered through a patent on the final product, the protection of the innovation regarding vaccines is often made through the patent of processes used in the development of new vaccines as well as the protection of secrecy.|$|E

President of the Philippines Diosdado Macapagal initially did not oppose the concept and even initiated the Manila Accord, but while the Philippines did not engage in hostilities, Malaysia severed diplomatic ties after the former deferred recognising it as the successor state of Malaya.|$|E

Qutb ad-Din {{recognized}} Nur ad-Din as overlord of Mosul, so that the major cities of Mosul and Aleppo were united under one man.

25|$|By {{this time}} the U.S. {{relationship}} with Khánh had broken down and the U.S. became more intent on a regime change as Khánh was reliant on Buddhist support, which they saw <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> {{an expansion of the}} war. In the first week of February, Taylor told the leading officers that the U.S. was not supporting Khánh, and they thought that Khiêm was a possible replacement although not among the most preferable. However, the candidates favoured by the Americans fell behind Thảo in their planning.|$|E
25|$|The road {{provides}} {{easy access}} to Stewart International Airport via International Boulevard, a newly built connecting road. The lack of such access has long been seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> the airport's development.

25|$|By this time, Taylor's {{relationship}} with Khánh had already broken {{down over the}} issue of the HNC, and the U.S. became more intent on a regime change as Khánh was reliant on Buddhist support, which they saw <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> an expansion of the war. Knowing that he was close to being forced out, Khánh tried to start negotiations with the communists, but this only increased the plotting. In early February, Taylor told Kỳ, who then passed on the message to colleagues in the junta, that the United States was “in no way propping up General Khanh or backing him in any fashion.” Taylor thought his message had been effective.|$|E
50|$|In the past, popular cults were {{regulated}} by imperial government policies, promoting certain deities while suppressing other ones.
