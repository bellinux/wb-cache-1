500|$|For Whitehead {{the core}} of {{religion}} was individual. [...] While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact {{for its own sake}} before it is an external fact relating to others. [...] His most famous remark on religion is that [...] "religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness... <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> never solitary, you are never religious." [...] Whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person's character. [...] He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not necessarily good – an idea which he called a [...] "dangerous delusion" [...] (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).|$|E

2500|$|Johnson’s {{biggest impact}} on the {{business}} was his role in diversification. Said Johnson, [...] "The primary objective for a corporate leader is to ensure institutional survival.... To survive you have to grow. To grow you have to diversify... When a company is diversified into various fields, it is rarely seriously vulnerable to {{the ups and downs}} that ravage individual business. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> geographically diversified... then you have some insulation between yourself and localized political and economic trouble." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{says the}} text from Ecclesiastes should [...] "awaken you to concern about yourself." [...] "The {{thought of the}} Creator is youth's most {{beautiful}} splendor" [...] and the Preacher [...] "is not just saying that you can think about your Creator, but he admonishes you to do it; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> young, whether you are joyful or dejected; whether you are carefree or discouraged, whoever you are, it is nevertheless to you, precisely to you, that he is speaking, you to whom the admonition applies ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, {{she grew}} {{critical}} {{of what she}} perceived as misogyny in orthodox Judaism. In an interview later in her life, Krasner recalls reading a prayer translation and thinking it was [...] "indeed a beautiful prayer in every sense except for the closing of it... {{if you are a}} male you say, 'Thank You, O Lord, for creating me in Your image'; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a woman you say, 'Thank You, O Lord, for creating me as You saw fit.'" [...] She also began reading existentialist philosophies during this time period, causing her to turn away from Judaism even further.|$|E

2500|$|Churchill {{wound up}} the debate for the government, {{defending}} {{the conduct of}} the Norwegian campaign with some robustness. [...] He explained that even the successful use of the battleship HMS Warspite at Narvik had put her at risk from many hazards; had any come to pass, the operation, now hailed as an example of what should have been done elsewhere, would have been condemned as foolhardy. [...] "It is easy when you have no responsibility. If you dare, and forfeit is exacted, it is murder of our sailors; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> prudent, you are craven, cowardly, inept and timid". If nothing similarly bold had been done at Trondheim, it was not because it was thought too dangerous; but because it had been thought unnecessary: military advice had been against an opposed landing and instead predicted rapid success from the steps actually taken.|$|E
2500|$|Ibn Ubay {{was also}} {{involved}} in Muhammad's conflict with another Jewish tribe, the Banu Nadir. Ibn Ishaq writes that when Muhammad ordered the tribe {{to leave the city}} within ten days, [...] "certain persons of Medina who were not Believers sent a message to the Banu al-Nadir, saying, 'Hold out, and defend yourselves; we shall not surrender you to Muhammad. If you are attacked we shall fight with you <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sent away we shall go with you.'" [...] Other sources include or even identify these persons with the Muslim Ibn Ubayy. Waqidi reports that Ibn Ubayy at first strove to bring about a reconciliation, and Tabari relates that Abd-Allah accused Muhammad of treachery and urged the Nadir to resist by promising aid. However, as the promised help failed to materialize, the Nadir surrendered and Muhammad expelled them from the city.|$|E
2500|$|Muhammad besieged the Banu Nadir. He {{ordered them}} to {{surrender}} their property and leave Medina within ten days. The tribe at first decided to comply, but [...] "certain people of Medina who were not Believers of Muhammad {{sent a message to}} the Banu al-Nadir, saying, 'Hold out, and defend yourselves; we shall not surrender you to Muhammad. If you are attacked we shall fight with you <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sent away we shall go with you.'" [...] Huyayy ibn Akhtab decided to put up resistance, hoping also for help from the Banu Qurayza, despite opposition within the tribe. The Nadir were forced to surrender after the siege had lasted for 14 days, when the promised help failed to materialize and when Muhammad ordered the burning and felling of their palm-trees. Under the conditions of surrender, the Banu Nadir could only take with them what they could carry on camels with the exception of weapons.|$|E

2500|$|Another of Abu Bakr's grandsons, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, {{was very}} close to Husayn bin Ali. After Hussein ibn Ali was betrayed by the people of Kufa and killed by the army of Yazid I, the Umayyad ruler, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr confronted Yazid and {{expelled}} him from Iraq, southern Arabia and the greater part of Syria, and parts of Egypt. Following a lengthy campaign, on his last hour Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr asked his mother Asma' bint Abu Bakr, the daughter of the first caliph, for advice. Asma' bint Abu Bakr replied to her son: [...] "You know better in your own self, that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you have been killed <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say, that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others, then you will not truly be free". Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the Syrian Army now {{under the control of the}} Umayyads.|$|E
