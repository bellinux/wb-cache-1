The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E
25|$|Later {{additions}} to the church include toilets, built <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the church, and a brick columbarium wall near the entrance, both added in 1995. A rectory, which stood behind the church, was sold and removed in early 2004, and a recent steel building has been constructed in its place. The original timber church has also been demolished. St Paul's continues to function as the main church for the Parish of Proserpine.|$|E
25|$|In the {{background}} of the painting various objects are used to further symbolize the theological significance of the subject. A ladder, referring to Jacob's Ladder, leans <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall,</b> and a dove which represents the Holy Spirit rests on it. Other carpentry implements refer to the Holy Trinity. Millais likely used Albrecht Dürer's print Melancholia I as a source for this imagery, along with quattrocento works. The sheep in the sheepfold seen through the door represent the future Christian flock.|$|E
5000|$|A {{retracted}} vowel is a vowel {{sound in}} which the body or root of the tongue is pulled <b>back</b> into <b>the</b> pharynx.

5000|$|The palate {{comprises}} two parts, {{the hard}} palate (palatum durum) {{and the soft}} palate (palatum molle), which {{is connected to the}} uvula. The movements of the soft palate and the uvula are made possible by the velopharyngeal sphincter. During speech or swallowing, <b>the</b> uvula lifts <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> throat <b>wall</b> to close the nasal cavity. When producing nasal consonants (such as [...] "m", [...] "n", and [...] "ng"), the uvula remains relaxed, thereby enabling the air to go through the nose.|$|R
5000|$|Thutmose IV {{also built}} a unique chapel and peristyle hall <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> or eastern <b>walls</b> {{of the main}} Karnak temple building. The chapel was {{intended}} for people [...] "who had no right {{of access to the}} main Karnak temple. It was a 'place of the ear' for the god Amun where the god could hear the prayers of the townspeople." [...] This small alabaster chapel and peristyle hall of Thutmose IV [...] has today been carefully restored by French scholars from the Centre Franco-Egyptien D'Étude des Temple de Karnak (CFEETK) mission in Karnak.|$|R
25|$|Boast: The ball {{is played}} off a side wall at an angle, or the back wall, {{before hitting the}} front wall. A 'three wall boast' has the ball hit at a side wall such that the ball hits the front wall {{followed}} by the opposite side wall before finally hitting the floor. A 'back wall boast' has the ball struck <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> before reaching the front wall. It is typically not recommended to beginners due {{to the risk of}} hitting spectators above and behind players on solid backed courts. A 'trickle boast' is a boast performed at a shallow angle with the front wall at a low trajectory. A 'reverse boast' is a boast played towards the sidewall furtherst from the striker. It is played rarely at high levels due to the high risk of hitting the opponent and the typical ease of counterattack.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, {{and would have been}} very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to put one. Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may {{have been one of the}} items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as they still do in the Netherlands.|$|E
500|$|Room 3 is {{the middle}} room of the superstructure. It was the only room {{not to have been}} sealed during the Terminal Classic and due to this is in a poor state of preservation.

5000|$|Opposite {{this stage}} load-in door was the [...] "star {{dressing}} room" [...] which was completely rebuilt for Jerry Lewis. The first floor dressing room {{had a small}} front bar with a mirrored back bar, an upright piano, and a sofa lounge area. A circular spiral metal stairway lead to the second floor, a make-up mirrored counter desk, with a Hollywood bed/couch. The adjacent toilet suite was equipped with a wall mounted telephone for Lewis to conduct business while using the facilities and his make-up area. The front stage apron, {{in front of the}} proscenium was extended by filling (pouring concrete) into the original orchestra pit. A stage centered 4' wide concrete camera ramp connected the stage apron with a 6' deep camera aisle <b>against</b> <b>the</b> auditorium <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> <b>The</b> [...] "level" [...] concrete ramp and stage apron supported the Chapman Crane required for video taping talent and performers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, ABC {{sold the}} theatre to private {{businessman}} Dennis Lidtke, who restored it and reopened it {{four years later}} with an abridged name, The Palace.The theater's audience seating area was removed. The audience raked floor was leveled to flush (same level) out from the lobby entrance area to the stage apron. Bands were located on the stage area. A double staircase was installed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> auditoriums <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> with an open arch which connected to the lobby staircase first landing, for balcony access, where tables and seating were arranged for balcony viewing of the band and dance floor below. One early production using the revamped facility was the 1983 Sheena Easton HBO concert special, Sheena Easton Live at the Palace, Hollywood. It was the venue for the performance portion of Bruce Willis' ACE nominated HBO special [...] "The Return of Bruno," [...] which was written and produced by Paul Flattery and directed by Jim Yukich.|$|R

For example, armless wooden chairs are lined <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> white stone <b>wall,</b> with its large door shut <b>against</b> <b>the</b> world. [...] "When Bernarda draws the bolt, a sense of airlessness immediately descends over the daughters, illogical as this seems." [...] "LaChiusa and Daniele are determined to illustrate passion as vividly as possible in what is being called a musical but could just as easily be described as a dance piece with singing, an oratorio, or performance art. It's a beautifully seamless fusion of all these influences." ...|$|R
500|$|With no working prototypes, Green {{set about}} {{building}} seven lifts. The principle was simple. Two caissons were suspended from three carrying wheels of [...] diameter, by wrought iron chains. The caisson {{at the bottom}} was jacked against the front wall of the lift to seal it, and a door or gate was opened to allow the boat to float in. The caisson at the top was jacked <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> in a similar manner. When both boats were in, the doors on the caissons and lift were closed, and the jacks released. Because a boat displaces its own weight in water, the system should be balanced, and {{a small amount of}} energy is required to start the boats moving. When the top caisson reaches the bottom, the jacks are applied, the doors are opened, and the boats can continue.|$|E
500|$|The Palazzo dei Conservatori ("Palace of the Conservators") {{was built}} in the Middle Ages for the local {{magistrate}} on top of a sixth-century BC temple dedicated to Jupiter [...] "Maximus Capitolinus". Michelangelo's renovation of it incorporated the first use of a giant order that spanned two storeys, here with a range of Corinthian pilasters and subsidiary Ionic columns flanking the ground-floor loggia openings and the second-floor windows. Michelangelo’s new portico is a reinvention of older ideas. The portico contains entablatures and a flat, coffer-like ceiling. The entablatures rest on columns set at the front of each bay, while matching half-columns stand <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> Each pilaster forms a compound unit with the pier and column on either side of it. Colossal pilasters set on large bases join the portico and the upper story. All of the windows are capped with segmental pediments. A balustrade fringing the roof emphasizes the emphatic horizontality of the whole against which the vertical lines of the orders rise in majestic contrast. The verticality of the colossal order creates the feeling of a self-contained space while the horizontality of the entablatures and balustrades emphasize the longitudinal axis of the piazza. The palazzo’s facade was updated by Michelangelo in the 1530s and again later numerous times.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Yurovsky Note", {{an account}} of the event filed by Yurovsky to his Bolshevik {{superiors}} following the killings, was found in 1989 and detailed in Edvard Radzinsky's 1992 book, The Last Tsar. According to the note, {{on the night of the}} deaths the family was awakened and told to dress. They were told they were being moved to a new location to ensure their safety in anticipation of the violence that might ensue when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg. Once dressed, the family and the small circle of servants who had remained with them were herded into a small room in the house's sub-basement and told to wait. Alexandra and Alexei sat in chairs provided by guards at the Empress's request. After several minutes, the guards entered the room, led by Yurovsky, who quickly informed the Tsar and his family that they were to be executed. The Tsar had time to say only [...] "What?" [...] and turn to his family before he was killed by several bullets to the chest (not, as is commonly stated, to the head; his skull, recovered in 1991, bears no bullet wounds). The Tsarina and her daughter Olga tried to make the sign of the cross, but were killed in the initial volley of bullets fired by the executioners. The rest of the Imperial retinue were shot in short order, with the exception of Anna Demidova, Alexandra's maid. Demidova survived the initial onslaught, but was quickly murdered <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the basement, stabbed to death while trying to defend herself with a small pillow she had carried into the sub-basement that was filled with precious gems and jewels.|$|E

The Club are striving {{to apply for a}} SFA National Club License for the start of 2012 and work {{necessary}} to take the park up to the required standard was completed. This included the upgrade of the floodlight, creation of a medical room and a successful safety inspection and associated “letter of compliance” from Highland Council. In additional both stands received a freshen up with bench seating installed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> south stand <b>back</b> <b>wall,</b> boarding was erected around the park perimeter fence, new goal posts were erected and a massive amount of work was done to the playing surface to take it into tip-top condition.|$|R

The pyramid is flanked by roughly symmetrical architectural complexes on {{the north and south}} sides of the plaza, consisting of a long council-house structure and a smaller shrine standing between the east end of each long structure and the radial temple. The flanking shrines stand approximately 3 m high, and each possessed a single west-facing stairway. The long structures flanking the plaza each possessed a single room upon a basal platform, with benches set <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and side <b>walls.</b> One of the long structures measures 22 by 5 m, standing upon a basal platform measuring 32 by 12 m.|$|R

2500|$|For both Orthodox and Eastern Catholics, the Holy Table (altar) is {{normally}} free-standing, although in very small sanctuaries {{it might be}} placed flush <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> for reasons of space. They are typically about one meter high, and although they may be made of stone they are generally built out of wood. The exact dimensions may vary, but it is generally square in plan and in reasonable proportion {{to the size of}} the sanctuary. It has five legs: one at each corner plus a central pillar for supporting the relics which are placed in it at its consecration (if, however, the consecration was not performed by a bishop, but by a priest whom he delegated for that purpose, relics are not placed in the Holy Table). A plain linen covering (Greek: Katasarkion, Slavonic: Strachítsa) is bound to the Holy Table with cords; this cover is never removed after the altar is consecrated, and is considered to be the [...] "baptismal garment" [...] of the altar. The linen covering symbolizes the winding sheet in which the body of Christ was wrapped when he was laid in the tomb. Since the altar is never seen uncovered thereafter, the table tends to be constructed more with sturdiness than aesthetics in mind. Above this first cover is a second ornamented altar cloth (Indítia), often in a brocade of a liturgical color that may change with the ecclesiastical season. This outer covering usually comes all the way to the floor and represents the glory of God's Throne. In many churches it is the custom for a dust cover to be placed on the Holy Table between services. This is often a simple red cloth, though it may be made of richer stuff. Sometimes it covers only the Gospel Book or the front half of the Holy Table, but it may be large enough to cover the entire Holy Table and everything on it, including candlesticks and the seven-branch candelabra.|$|E
60|$|This {{was found}} to be trifling. The {{stonework}} of the house was strong, and the guns were light.

25|$|After the serve, {{the players}} take turns hitting <b>the</b> ball <b>against</b> <b>the</b> front wall, above the tin {{and below the}} out line. The ball may strike <b>the</b> side or <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> at any time, {{as long as it}} hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line {{along the top of the}} tin is {{considered}} to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times <b>against</b> <b>the</b> side or <b>back</b> <b>walls)</b> before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.|$|R
5000|$|The Oval Fountain {{was one of}} {{the first}} fountains in the garden, and among the most famous. It was {{designed}} by Pirro Ligorio, the architect of the villa, as a water theater, spraying water in variety of forms. It was begun in 1565 and finished in 1570. It was made by fountain engineers Tomasso de Como and Curzio Maccarono, with sculpture by Raffaello Sangallo. A massive stone basin <b>against</b> <b>the</b> semicircular <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> cascades water into the fountain, and sprays it into the air, while water jets into the basin from vases in the hands of statues of Nereids, and also sprays in fan shapes from vases in niches in the semi-circular wall behind the fountain. An artificial mountain rises above the fountain, symbolizing the Tiburtine landscape; the mountain is pierced by three grottos. each pouring forth water, and is decorated with statues representing the Sibyl Albunesa with her son Melicerte, by Gillis van den Vliete (1568), and statues representing rivers Erculaneo and Anio, by Giovanni Malanca (1566), all of which pour water into the Oval Fountain. An upper walkway above the fountain leads past past the ring of basins and cascades. The fountain also has its own grotto, the Grotto of Venus, designed by Pirro Ligorio, and built in 1565-68. It served as a meeting place for guests on hot summer days. The original statues of the grotto; a figure of Venus similar to the Capitoline Venus and two putti are no longer there, but traces of the monochrome murals of grotesque figures, tiles and sculpted grotto walls still remain.|$|R
50|$|In an {{incident}} between Romanian and Soviet military men in Herţa, neighboring Dorohoi, the Soviets killed a Romanian officer, and a Jewish-Romanian soldier, Iancu Solomon, {{who was trying}} to defend the officer. The two were laid to rest in separate funerals. A firing squad was sent to Solomon's funeral, made up of 10 Jewish soldiers from the battalions stationed nearby. Some local Jews also participated in the funeral. Right after the coffin was lowered into the grave, many shots were heard, and the local Jews ran and hid in the local cleansing room. The Jewish soldiers, turning to the cemetery gates, were surrounded by soldiers from the 3rd Border Patrol battalion, commanded by a Colonel. The Jews, peering from the cleansing room, saw the Jewish soldiers disarmed and stripped of their uniforms. They were put up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cemetery's <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> and shot by the Romanian soldiers. Seven were killed instantly, and three injured. The Romanians placed a submachine gun {{in the hands of the}} already dead Emil Bercovici, the senior Jewish soldier, to stage the notion that he had started firing on the Romanians. An especially strong downpour begun, stopping the killing for a while, and allowing some of the Jewish crowd to slip away. Many Romanian soldiers, commanded by a Lieutenant, removed the Jews from the cleansing room using violence and threats. They were led to a ditch outside the cemetery. Two old men and one child managed to escape before the shooting began. The soldiers continued hunting the Jews hiding in the cemetery with the help of the place's Romanian keeper.|$|R

In this paper we present a visually compelling and informative cartoon rendering style for liquid animations. Our style is inspired by animations such as Futurama, 1 The Little Mermaid, 2 and Bambi 2. We take as input a liquid surface obtained from a three-dimensional physically based liquid simulation system and output animations that evoke a cartoon style and convey liquid movement. Our method is based on four cues that emphasize properties of the liquid’s shape and motion. We use bold outlines to emphasize depth discontinuities, patches of constant color to highlight near-silhouettes and areas of thinness, and, optionally place temporally coherent oriented textures on the liquid surface to help convey motion.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of harmful and unwanted behavior in fattening pigs {{is influenced by}} different factors including housing. Housing may include the opportunity to hide from aggressive pen mates and this ability is related to pen design and shape. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of a hiding wall in the pen on the behavior and performance of pigs during the entire fattening period (30 – 110 kg). A total of 383 pigs were spread over standard control pens without hiding opportunities, and treatment pens. In the latter pens, a hiding wall was constructed, consisting of two solid panels positioned in a “T” shape <b>against</b> <b>the</b> side or <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of <b>the</b> pen. Behaviors using an extended ethogram, the presence of lesions and weight were recorded during the entire fattening period. The presence of a hiding wall influenced neither growth, nor the {{prevalence of}} most pen mate manipulations (based on behavioral observations), but it did affect the prevalence of belly nosing and manipulating pen fittings. A lower frequency of these behaviors was observed in pens with hiding walls, which might indicate a lower stress level. Severe ear lesions were recorded more frequently in pens with a hiding wall, while severe tail lesions were recorded more often in control pens. These contradictory results might be related to the fact that the hiding wall disturbed lying behavior in the pen and caused restricted access to the backside of the pen, due to its position. Consequently, ear lesions might have been caused by pigs trying to reach <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> pen. Other aggressive behaviors were not affected, as both the frequency of fighting and head butting were not influenced by the prevalence of a hiding wall, and the prevalence of lesions on the front region of the body did not differ between control and treatment pens. In conclusion, these results suggest that the hiding wall did not contribute to a lower frequency of aggressive behavior, but was associated with less tail lesions, and a lower frequency of pen manipulation and belly nosing. The latter results might indicate a lower stress-level in pens with hiding walls. status: publishe...|$|R
