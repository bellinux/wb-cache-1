60|$|He {{looked so}} attentively <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I looked attentively {{at him and}} felt sure I {{understood}} him.|$|E
60|$|My {{attention}} was so {{attracted by the}} singularity of his fixed look <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> the words died away on my tongue.|$|E
60|$|The guide looks slowly {{all round}} him, and then looks <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> is his {{answer to my}} question. And that is enough.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't let him hit me! Oh, please don't let him hit me! I've {{been hit}} cruel to-day because I {{spoke to a}} man. Don't let him look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like <b>that!</b> He's reg'lar wicked, that one. Don't let him look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like <b>that,</b> neither! Oh, I feel as if I hadn't nothing on when he looks <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like that!' ...|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with <b>that</b> queer {{expression}} of mirth he sometimes has.|$|R
60|$|She glanced sidelong <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with <b>that</b> {{stealthy}} gravity {{that lay}} under all her lightness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I fibbed, Uncle," [...] said Patsy despondently. [...] "I fibbed willfully. But--how could I help it {{when she}} looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> way?" ...|$|E
60|$|In his savage taunting, he flared {{the candle}} so close <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I turned my face aside {{to save it}} from the flame.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he didn't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> way," [...] {{continued}} the senator's son. [...] "I {{believe he was}} {{doing his best to}} try to place you." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with <b>that</b> same smile I could have struck her for.|$|R
60|$|She {{threw up}} {{her chin and}} made a step and a cry <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> so <b>that</b> I fell back incontinent.|$|R
60|$|DOOLITTLE. Can {{you blame}} the girl? Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like <b>that,</b> Eliza. It ain't my fault. I've come into money.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't stare <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> way, you damn nigger," [...] said Clarke, who {{was used}} to being obeyed by negroes. [...] "Quick, you idiot. Where is the Colonel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> way! You {{have n't}} {{advanced}} so rapidly as I {{used to think}} you would; you haven't distinguished yourself so much," [...] she went on, irrelevantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} I say? Hold your jaw, will you, {{and not be}} halloaing <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> way? I know what I'm a saying of, and what I'm a doing of." ...|$|E
60|$|Why are you {{all looking}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like <b>that?</b> You look {{as if you were}} going to try me for something.|$|R
5000|$|... ”Moenie vir my loer nie, ek is nie 'n hoer nie!” (rhyming) - “Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> (like <b>that),</b> I'm not a whore!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You want something," [...] she {{answered}} sharply and suspiciously. [...] "Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like <b>that.</b> Speak to me--tell {{me what you}} want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. I'm the walkin' {{dictionary}} and cyclopædia of this hull district," [...] answered Jed Wallop, with a grin. [...] "Go on and fire {{all the questions}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you want to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{speak at}} a disadvantage,’ he resumed. ‘My supplanter, with perhaps more wisdom than delicacy, remains in the room,’ and he cast a glance <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> might have {{withered}} an oak tree.|$|E
6000|$|Then Bernard smiled <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> I should gaze [...] But I had gazed already; {{caught the}} view, [...] Faced the unfathomable ray of rays [...] Which to itself and {{by itself is}} true.|$|E
60|$|ENID. [Rising.] Oh! that's not true! {{the poor}} thing's heart---- What {{makes you look}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like <b>that?</b> I tried to help her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What can be {{the matter}} with the beast?' said the merchant. 'Why should he bark <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like <b>that,</b> when he knows me quite well?' ...|$|R
60|$|He held me by {{the collar}} and stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so, <b>that</b> I began to think his first idea about cutting my throat had revived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> was the rummy part of it. At a {{mosquito}} on the wall, he said. Well, I mean to say, do chappies bung paper-weights at mosquitoes? I mean, is it done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{how can she}} {{when you}} keep fussing at her all the time?" [...] said Aunt Betsy. [...] "Why, with a person pecking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> way, I should get that fuzzled and fuddled that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{speak at}} a disadvantage," [...] he resumed. [...] "My supplanter, with perhaps more wisdom than delicacy, remains in the room," [...] and he cast a glance <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> might have {{withered}} an oak tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then what--Why do {{you look}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in <b>that</b> fashion, sir?" [...] and {{springing}} up, Adrian rushed forward, and held the candle to Amyas's face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not papa!" [...] said Jenny, startled. [...] "No, nor Phil! Tell me, Rosamond. There is {{only one}} you could look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like <b>that</b> for!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{drive me}} to despair!" [...] he cried, with a startling abruptness. [...] "Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in <b>that</b> way, now I {{have found it}} out!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told you," [...] went on Mr. Fregelius, [...] "and you laughed <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> it {{was most}} unlucky her having sung that hateful Norse song, the 'Greeting to Death,' when you found her upon the steamer Trondhjem." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{asked me}} my age, my name, where I came from, if I could dance, sing, ride; and stared so roundly <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I seemed {{to see my}} garish colours {{reflected}} in the metallic grey of his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> way," [...] pleaded the pirate, [...] "as if I {{had done}} the deed. You know I didn't. I swear I didn't! If I had been there, I would have saved Orlando at the cost of--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Burns, to whom I {{imparted}} my fears, {{chose to}} take great umbrage at them. He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with <b>that</b> usual incredulous stare, and said bitterly: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{directed}} his eyes <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in <b>that</b> sidelong glance again, {{and he made}} his face very lantern-jawed, for the greater convenience of scraping, as he answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must," [...] said Fraser, doggedly; [...] "I’m {{not going}} to lose you now. It is no good looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like <b>that.</b> It is too late." ...|$|R
