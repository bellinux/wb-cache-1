5|$|Although Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown had a storyline rivalry that dated {{back to when}} Doink {{turned on}} Lawler by dumping <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been {{mentioned}} since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced many more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.|$|E
5|$|The branch was {{included}} in the Beeching report of 1963 which concluded that, since 30% of the railway network carried less than 1% of the total passenger traffic, much of it should be closed. The residents of Newport Pagnell resisted the closure, demanding an enquiry which took place on 7 June 1964. Despite many objections, it was determined that the line would close. The last passenger service was the 5:34 pm train from Newport Pagnell on 5 September 1964, just under a century after the line opened to passengers. The mourning of the line was so great that <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> was poured over a double dressed as Richard Beeching, the man commonly associated with the closure of over 4,000 miles of the British railway network. The crowd cheered as this happened, a mark of the public's feelings about the closure.|$|E
5|$|Back at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba {{has already}} {{captured}} Dorothy, refusing to release {{her until she}} relinquishes Nessarose's slippers – the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other for all grievances, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace {{for the last time}} before saying goodbye forever, and acknowledge that they are who they are because of each other ("For Good"). As the mob arrives at the castle, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> on Elphaba, who appears to melt away. Grief-stricken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her black hat and the small bottle of green elixir which she had slept with under her pillow.|$|E
50|$|John Locke (Berkeley's predecessor) {{states that}} we define an object by its primary and {{secondary}} qualities. He takes heat {{as an example of}} a secondary quality. If you put one hand in <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>water,</b> and the other hand in <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> warm <b>water,</b> then put both hands in <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> lukewarm <b>water,</b> one <b>of</b> your hands is going to tell you that the water is cold and the other that the water is hot. Locke says that since two different objects (both your hands) perceive the water to be hot and cold, then the heat is not a quality <b>of</b> the <b>water.</b>|$|R

25|$|Before the 18th century, {{science courses}} were taught almost {{exclusively}} through formal lectures. The structure of courses {{began to change}} in {{the first decades of the}} 18th century, when physical demonstrations were added to lectures. Pierre Polinière and Jacques Rohault were among the first individuals to provide demonstrations of physical principles in the classroom. Experiments ranged from swinging <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> at the end of a rope, demonstrating that centrifugal force would hold the water in the bucket, to more impressive experiments involving the use of an air-pump. One particularly dramatic air-pump demonstration involved placing an apple inside the glass receiver of the air-pump, and removing air until the resulting vacuum caused the apple to explode. Polinière’s demonstrations were so impressive that he was granted an invitation to present his course to Louis XV in 1722.|$|E

25|$|The Hartford circus fire {{occurred}} on July 6, 1944, in Hartford, Connecticut, during an afternoon performance that {{was attended by}} approximately 7,500 to 8,700 people. It {{was one of the}} worst fire disasters in the history of the United States. Although the Hartford Fire Department responded quickly, the fire was fanned by the fact that the canvas circus tent had been waterproofed through a mixture of highly flammable paraffin and gasoline. During the ensuing panic Emmett Kelly, the tramp clown, threw <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> at the burning canvas tent, and a poignant photograph of his futile attempt was transmitted around the world as news spread of the disaster. At least 167 people were killed in the disaster, and hundreds more were injured. Some of the dead remain unidentified to this day, even with modern DNA techniques.|$|E
25|$|Led Zeppelin's manager, Peter Grant, {{sometimes}} took extraordinary {{measures to}} combat the practice of live bootleg recordings at Led Zeppelin concerts. He {{is reported to have}} personally visited record stores in London which were selling Led Zeppelin bootlegs and demanded all copies be handed over. He also monitored the crowd at Led Zeppelin concerts so as to locate anything which resembled bootleg recording equipment. At one concert at Vancouver in 1971 he saw what he thought was recording equipment {{on the floor of the}} venue and personally ensured that the equipment be destroyed, only to find out later that the equipment was a noise pollution unit being operated by city officials to test the volume of the concert. Similarly, at the Bath Festival in 1970, he personally threw <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> over unauthorised recording equipment.|$|E

25|$|Inside Nilsen's home, {{the victims}} were usually given food and alcohol, then strangled — usually with a {{ligature}} — either to death or until they had become unconscious. If the victim had been strangled into unconsciousness, Nilsen would then drown the victim in his bathtub, his sink or <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> before observing a ritual {{in which he would}} bathe, clothe and retain the victims' bodies inside his residences for several weeks or, occasionally, months before he would dismember the corpse. Each victim killed between 1978 and 1981 at his Cricklewood residence would be disposed of via burning upon a bonfire, although prior to their dissection, Nilsen would routinely remove their internal organs, which he would dispose of either beside a fence behind his flat, or close to Gladstone Park. The victims killed in 1982 and 1983 at his Muswell Hill residence would be retained at his flat, with their flesh and smaller bones flushed down the lavatory.|$|E
25|$|Grant's {{determination}} {{to protect the}} financial interests of Led Zeppelin was also reflected by the sometimes extraordinary measures he took to combat the practice of unauthorized live bootleg recordings.

He also monitored the crowd at Led Zeppelin concerts in order to locate anything which resembled bootleg recording equipment.

How empty the streets are and how melancholy, so many poor sick {{people in the streets}} full of sores… in Westminster, there is never a physician and but one apothecary left, all being dead." [...] That people did not starve was down to the foresight of Sir John Lawrence and the Corporation of London who arranged for a commission of one farthing to be paid above the normal price for every quarter of corn landed in the Port of London. Another food source was the villages around London which, denied of their usual sales in the capital, left vegetables in specified market areas, negotiated their sale by shouting, and collected their payment after the money had been left submerged in <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to [...] "disinfect" [...] the coins.|$|E
500|$|Baer {{spent the}} next few months {{designing}} further prototypes, and in February 1967 assigned technician Bill Harrison to begin building the project. Harrison {{spent the next}} few months in between other projects building out successive modifications to the prototype. [...] Baer, meanwhile, collaborated with engineer Bill Rusch on the design of the console, including developing the basis of many games for the system. The first game was developed by May, a two-player game where the players repeatedly press a button in competition to fill or empty <b>a</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and by June multiple games were completed for what was then a second prototype box. These included a game where players controlled dots chasing each other and a light gun shooter game with a plastic rifle. Baer demonstrated the new prototype to Campman, who enjoyed the shooting game, increased funding, and recommended Baer demonstrate the project to senior management. Baer demonstrated the console to the board, who were largely uninterested, though a couple members were enthusiastic; nevertheless, CEO Royden Sanders authorized the project to be continued with the aim of selling or licensing the console as a commercial product.|$|E
