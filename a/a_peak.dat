A 52 -year-old female presented with epiretinal membrane and underwent combined cataract surgery and pars plana vitrectomy. Axial length was measured with partial coherence interferometry. Although the signal curve in the summary display showed <b>a</b> single <b>peak,</b> <b>a</b> 1. 6 diopter myopic shift occurred. Viewed retrospectively, six of 20 individual signal curves showed <b>a</b> double <b>peak.</b> Most of them showed <b>a</b> higher anterior <b>peak,</b> with only one having <b>a</b> higher posterior <b>peak.</b> The other 14 curves showed <b>a</b> single <b>peak</b> at <b>a</b> similar distance to <b>an</b> anterior <b>peak.</b> The anterior peak appeared {{to be derived from}} the epiretinal membrane.
