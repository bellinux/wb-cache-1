2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Confiscation Act of 1862 became {{effective}} in September General Butler increasingly relied upon it {{as a means}} of grabbing cotton. Since the Act permitted confiscation of property owned by anyone [...] "aiding the Confederacy," [...] Butler reversed his earlier policy of encouraging trade by refusing to confiscate cotton brought into New Orleans for sale. First he conducted a census in which 4,000 respondents failing to pledge loyalty to the Union were banished and their property seized. It was sold at ridiculously low auction prices where Andrew was often the prime buyer. Next the general sent expeditions into the countryside with no military purpose other than to confiscate cotton from residents assumed to be disloyal. Once brought into New Orleans the cotton would be similarly sold in rigged auctions. To maintain correct appearances, <b>auction</b> <b>proceeds</b> were dutifully held for the benefit of [...] "just claimants", but the Butler consortium still ended-up owning the cotton at bargain prices. Always inventive of new terminology to achieve his ends, Butler sequestered (i.e. made vulnerable to confiscation) such [...] "properties" [...] in all of Louisiana beyond parishes surrounding New Orleans.|$|E

5000|$|In September 2006, the {{military}} {{took over the}} control from a civilian government and decided to merge the telecommunications and broadcasting regulators into a convergence regulator but the task had not been completed until the muppet civilian government came into power and introduced the new bill. The new law dubbed the Act on Spectrum Allocation Authority, Regulatory & Control over Radio & TV Broadcast and Telecommunications of 2010 (aka NRA Act of 2010), terminates the NTC and creates a new [...] "convergence regulator" [...] to look over both telecommunications and broadcast in Thailand. The new law also requires that the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission which was established in 2010 as an independent regulators, must allocate all commercial spectrum license via auction. In 2012, in order to license the 3G spectrum and services, the Telecomm Commission (TC) launched the spectrum auction and resulted in three new licenses for 2.1 GHz to 3 incumbents (AIS, True and DTAC). In 2013, the Broadcast Commission (BC) also auctioned 42 new DTTV licenses. Both auctions altogether earned then the highest record for money given to public sector through auction. Later the record was beaten by another auction by sister agency - Broadcast Commission who launched the DTTV auction in December 2013. The NBTC Act in force then allowed NBTC to keep the proceed of the DTTV <b>auction</b> <b>proceed.</b> But when the Military took over the country, it amended the NBTC Act to require return of <b>auction</b> <b>proceed</b> to public purse.|$|R
