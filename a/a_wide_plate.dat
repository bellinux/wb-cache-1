50|$|Size and {{geometry}} {{also plays}} a role in determining the shape of the R curve. A crack in a thin sheet tends to produce a steeper R curve than a crack in a thick plate because there is a low degree of stress triaxiality at the crack tip in the thin sheet while the material near the tip of the crack in the thick plate may be in plane strain. The R curve can also change at free boundaries in the structure. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> may exhibit a somewhat different crack growth resistance behavior than a narrow plate of the same material. Ideally, the R curve, as well as other measures of fracture toughness, is a property only of the material and does not depend on the size or shape of the cracked body. Much of fracture mechanics is predicated on the assumption that fracture toughness is a material property.|$|E

50|$|Large clammyweed is a {{small to}} large sticky but unscented annual herb of 10-60 cm. It has {{branched}} or unbranched, green or purple stems with seated glands and glandular hairs. The 0.3-1.5 mm long, green or purple leaf stalks are often at an angle with the leaf blade. The leaf blade consists of three narrow, 0.9-3.5 cm long and only 1-2 mm wide, somewhat fleshy leaflets, {{the right and left}} halfs more or less folded towards each other (or conduplicate) with entire margins, a pointed top with a needle-like tip, the underside of the leaf with many, and the upper side with few glands. The bilaterally symmetrical flowers are set in gland-covered racemes that are initially 1-3 cm long but that keep growing to 6-8 cm when fruits are ripe. Each individual flower is subtended by a bracts consisting of one or three entire bractlets, which have an oval shape and are 7-15 mm long. The stalk of the individual flower is 1−2⅓ cm (0.4-0.9 in) long. The four deciduous, eventually deflected, green to purple coloured, hairless sepals are lanceolate to inverted egg-shaped, 2½-3½ mm (0.1-0.14 in) long and ¾-1¼ mm (0.03-0.05 in) wide, with entire margins and a pointy tip. The four petals are mostly creamy white, oblong-ovate, consist of a more yellowish straight and narrow claw and <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>plate.</b> The forward directed lower (abaxial) pair is 3-5 mm long and 2½-3 mm (0.10-0.12 in) wide the upper ⅔ deeply incised to create nine or ten finger-like lobes, often themselves bilobed at the tip (also described as a lacerate margin).

40|$|Abstract. During the {{interval}} between continental collision in the Devonian and continental breakup in the Triassic the northern Appalachians became the site of <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> boundary zone of dominantly right-lateral strike slip. As is typical of intracontinental transforms, tectonism was both diachronous and rapidly variable along strike through regimes of 'pure ' strike slip, transpressional deformation, and rapid subsidence of extensional basins. Up to 9 km of mainly nonmarine, cla•tic sediments accumulated in these local depocenters, which subsided episodically in two stages ' (1) an initial phase of stretching and thinning of the lithosphere, when subsidence was rapid, fault controlled, and often accompanied by volcanism and (2) a subsequent phase of gradual thermal subsidence, during which the depositional basins expanded to bury the earlier border faults and progressively younger sedimentary units onlapped basement. The largest depocenter, the Magdalen Basin, opened as a pull-apart between strike slip faults in Newfoundland and New Brunswick from late Devonian to early Carboniferous. Subsequent thermal subsidence affected a large area during medial and late Carboniferous, a phenomenon that is well recorded {{to the north and}} west, where no later tectonism occurred. In areas to the south and east of the basin, strike slip on other faults continued into the time of thermal subsidence, introducing complications such as localized transpressional deformation and rapid subsidence in smaller pull-aparts...|$|E
30|$|In 1994, Snodgrass (1994) first {{reported}} {{the use of}} a tubularized incised plate (TIP) to repair distal hypospadias. During the subsequent 20  years, TIP has become mainstream internationally as the optimal surgical option; however, this operation has higher requirements of the urethral plate, including <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> and good quality of the urethra. Although TIP is applicable to many fields, the limitations of TIP surgery have also been gradually revealed. Some scholars have reported that the success rate was significantly lower in crippled cases and in cases with longer neourethras who have received classic TIP. The success rate was shown to decrease in patients who had longer neourethras or multiple previous interventions (Adayener and Akyol 2006). The uroflow curves and fistula positions in patients undergoing TIP repair suggest that the neourethra distal to the fistula may be relatively narrow, creating flow resistance and leading to a proximal fistula; these patients often need regular urethral expansion due to urethral opening or urethral stenosis. A urethral plate incision enables a urethral tubularization, but due to the different features of the urethra, such as narrow urethral plate, shallow urethral groove, or a urethral dorsal incision without epithelium, scar tissue may form (Braga et al. 2007). A longer and newer urethral length means more risk of scar tissue formation, which can create flow resistance and lead to proximal fistula and limitations in urine flow (Perera et al. 2012). Asanuma et al. (2007) summarized several reports about the complications that can occur after TIP urethroplasty, and the mean overall complication rate was 10.8  %, with a 5.7  % incidence of fistula and a 4.7  % incidence of meatal stenosis.|$|E

40|$|Design {{based on}} damage {{tolerance}} concepts has become mandatory in high technology structures. These concepts are also essential for evaluating life extension of aged structures {{which are in}} service beyond originally stipulated life. Fracture analysis of such structures {{in the presence of}} single or multiple three-dimensional flaws is essential for this approach. Surface cracks are the most commonly occurring flaws and development of accurate methods of analysis for such cracks is essential for structural integrity evaluation of newly designed or aged structures. The crack fronts of these surface flaws are usually approximated mathematically to be of either part-elliptical or part-circular in geometry. In this thesis, some of the issues related to fatigue crack growth of single and multiple surface cracks are studied in detail. Here emphasis is given to the development of simple and accurate post-processing techniques to estimate stress intensity factors for surface cracks, development and/or implementation of simple numerical methods to simulate three-dimensional single and multiple cracks in fatigue and their experimental verification. Modified virtual crack closure integral (MVCCI) technique for estimation of strain energy release rates has been improved (chapter II) to deal with curved crack front and unequal elements across the crack front. The accuracy of this method is evaluated and presented in this chapter for certain benchmark surface flaw problems. The improved MVCCI is used in the investigation of interaction between multiple surface cracks in three-dimensional solids. The interaction effects are studied for both interacting and coalescing phases as observed to occur in the growth of multiple surface cracks. Extensive numerical work is performed to study the effects of various parameters such as aspect ratio, thickness ratio, interspacing on the interaction factors. These solutions are used in formulating empirical equations to estimate interaction factors. This facilitated the development of a simple semi-analytical method to study fatigue crack growth of multiple cracks. The growth of surface cracks under fatigue loading in the finite width specimens of an aero-engine superalloy has been studied experimentally (presented in chapter III). Four configurations for single semi-elliptical cracks are considered. Fatigue crack growth is simulated by two models viz. two degrees of freedom and "multi degrees of freedom with ellipse fit'. These models are sometimes referred to as semi-analytical models as the crack growth is predicted by numerical integration combining Paris equation with an empirical form of stress intensity factor solution. In order to use two degrees of freedom model for fatigue crack growth prediction of semi-elliptical cracks, empirical solution for the Ml range of geometric parameters for stress intensity factor is required for the considered configurations. The available Newman-Raju solution is useful for this purpose within a limited range of surface crack length to width (c/W) of the specimen. Based on the present finite element results, the empirical equations are developed for extended values of c/W. It is well understood that the fatigue prediction for two-dimensional crack can be improved by inclusion of crack closure effects. Usually, in semi-analytical models for growth of surface cracks under fatigue loading, the crack closure is included as a ratio of crack closure factor at surface and depth locations of semi-elliptical crack. In the present work, this ratio for the considered material of specimens is obtained by an experimental study. The difference in characteristics of preferred propagation path between semi-elliptical crack in a finite width plate and <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>plate</b> is clearly brought out. Current crack growth predictions for most of the structures are based on the presence of only a single crack. However, in structures several cracks may initiate simultaneously within a stress critical zone and may interact depending upon their geometry, spatial location, structure geometry and mode of loading. In this work various configurations of twin semi-elliptical cracks have been studied by experiments. The beachmarks created on the specimens during experiments are used in the investigation of crack shape progression during fatigue. A three degrees of freedom crack growth model for interacting and coalescing cracks has been proposed. The experimentally determined crack shape and lives have been compared with the corresponding values from numerical simulation. The correlation of experimental results with numerical predictions was carried out through improved MVCCI for eight-noded brick elements. This has worked well in the configurations analysed. However, it is known in literature that there are benefits of using 20 -noded singular elements. There could be special situations where the regular elements could fail, and singular elements could be essential. For this purpose, further development of MVCCI were carried out using 20 -noded quarter-point elements (presented in chapter IV). Also a novel technique of decomposed crack closure integral (DCCI) was developed (presented in chapter V) for both regular and singular elements to represent the variation of MVCCI more accurately along the crack front. It is well known that quarter-point elements at crack front produce the required singularity at the crack tip and give accurate stress distribution with fewer degrees of freedom than conventional elements. Thus to develop more efficient post-processing tools, the MVCCI expressions are formulated for 20 -noded singular quarter-point element for various assumptions regarding stress and displacement distributions in the elements across the crack front. A comprehensive study is presented (chapter IV) on MVCCI for 20 -noded singular brick element including various simplified expressions for three-dimensional part-through cracks in pure and mixed-mode state of deformation of fracture. The developed MVCCI expressions are also valid for 15 -noded quarter-point Penta elements. The reduction in model size can further be obtained if 12 -noded three-dimensional singular element is employed at the crack front and eight-noded elements are used away from the crack front. The MVCCI expressions are also developed for 12 -noded singular element and their accuracy is evaluated by numerical solutions. Presently, MVCCI, estimates the average stress intensity factor at the center of each element along the crack front. In this thesis, a Decomposed Crack Closure Integral (DCCI) is formulated to represent an assumed variation of stress intensity factor along the crack front in each element. The DCCI is formulated for 8 -noded brick, 20 -noded conventional brick and 20 -noded singular brick elements. The numerical examples presented here deal with three-dimensional problems of patch repair technology and part-through cracks. The technique showed a major advantage for the patch repair problems where SIF variations along the crack front are of significance and large mesh sizes are computationally expensive. This along with MVCCI for 12 -noded and 20 -noded singular elements formed a part of the work on development of accurate and effective post-processing tools. It is expected that the present work will be helpful in damage tolerance design and assessment of aerospace structures and the experimental work performed as a part of this thesis will enhance confidence in the damage tolerance analysis. The thesis is concluded in chapter VI presenting the contributions of this thesis and projecting future lines of work possible in this area...|$|E

The model defines a homogenized displacement field, which satisfies interfacial continuity, and uses a variational technique to derive equilibrium equations depending on only six generalized displacement functions, for any arbitrary numbers of layers and interfaces.
