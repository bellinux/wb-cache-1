40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze {{reinforced}} concrete frames subjected to <b>abnormal</b> <b>loads.</b> Structures are rarely subjected to <b>abnormal</b> <b>loads,</b> however, when they are subjected to them, it can lead to a progressive collapse. The World Trade Centers in New York City and the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City are examples of structures being deliberately subjected to <b>abnormal</b> <b>loads.</b> Structures can also experience unintentional <b>abnormal</b> <b>loading.</b> Examples include the Ronan Point apartment building in Canning Town, England and Husky Stadium at the University of Washington. Consequently, many analysis and design standards now explicitly account for <b>abnormal</b> <b>loads</b> and try to mitigate their effects. This study presents the development of a nonlinear computer analysis program for reinforced concrete frames. The method of analysis involves discretizing a two dimensional reinforced concrete frame into a series of beam-column elements. The element is linear-elastic, however, its end-sections model nonlinear behaviour of a total member by a series of springs. The springs represent the post-elastic stiffness of the end-sections. The post-elastic stiffness of a member-section is obtained from a post-elastic force-deformation response, which is first obtained by performing sectional analysis on a reinforced concrete section using a public domain computer program. The post-elastic force-deformation responses are modeled as either bilinear or trilinear. So-called stiffness degradation factors, which are defined as the ratio of elastic to elastic plus post-elastic deformation of a member-section, are used in modifying the elastic stiffness coefficients in the element stiffness matrix to account for the nonlinear behaviour. Once a reinforced concrete frame enters the post-elastic range of response the analysis procedure becomes incremental. The stiffness degradation factors are calculated at each load increment and the degree of post-elastic stiffness degradation is progressively tracked throughout the load history. The program also has the capability of performing a progressive collapse analysis whereby debris loads caused by falling members are calculated and applied to the structure. A series of example problems are presented to demonstrate the computer analysis program...|$|R

50|$|When a load {{cannot be}} {{dismantled}} into units {{that can be}} transported without exceeding the limitations {{in terms of the}} dimensions and/or mass, it is classified as an <b>abnormal</b> <b>load.</b> Another definition can be summarised as following: an abnormal indivisible load ('AIL') is one which cannot be divided into two or more loads for transporting (on roads). Also, break bulk is used to define the freight that cannot be loaded into any ocean container or too large for air cargo.|$|E
50|$|Typical loads {{for these}} {{vehicles}} are large boilers for power stations, turbine components or power station transformers. Due to their heavy weight and outsize dimensions these goods {{are not usually}} transported in normal goods trains, but are moved in special trains and need careful preparation. Whenever transportation restrictions arise with a wagon and its load due to its weight and size, it is designated as an <b>abnormal</b> <b>load</b> and must be labelled {{in accordance with the}} RIV as a U type. When the vehicle is unladen the two carrying arms are joined directly to one another; the wagon can then travel in goods trains at normal speeds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The <b>abnormal</b> <b>loading</b> of {{skin and}} other sur-face tissues unaccustomed to bearing large {{mechanical}} forces occurs under many circumstances of chronic dis-ease or disability. A result of <b>abnormal</b> <b>loading</b> is break-down of the body wall tissues. An effective rehabilitation program avoids the pathological processes that result in skin trauma and breakdown and encourages load-toler-ance and adaptation, changes in the body wall so that the tissues do not enter an irreversible degenerative patholog-ical process. In the past, prevention has been the principal approach {{to the challenge of}} maintaining healthy skin and avoiding breakdown; therefore, relatively little is described in the rehabilitation literature about skin adaptation. However, adaptation has been investigated in other fields, particularly biomechanics and comparative anatomy. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assemble the research to date to present the current understanding of skin response to mechanical stress, specifically addressing load cases applicable to rehabilitation. Factors important to tissue response are considered and their effects on adaptation and breakdown are discussed...|$|R

30|$|Although {{the exact}} causes of {{degenerative}} {{changes of the}} bone marrow (so-called Modic changes) are not clear, their occurrence may be closely related to mechanical stress [36]. The <b>abnormal</b> <b>load</b> and stress will affect vertebral end plates and the microenvironment of adjacent vertebral bone marrow, resulting in histological changes, which exhibit signal intensity change on MRI [36]. There are three main forms of degenerative change involving the bone marrow of the adjacent vertebral bodies. These may also occur in the pedicles [37].|$|E
40|$|Until recently, South African car-carriers {{operated}} under the <b>abnormal</b> <b>load</b> permit system allowing an additional 300 mm height and 500 mm length. Because car-carrier payloads are divisible and <b>abnormal</b> <b>load</b> permits are usually granted for indivisible loads, these permits were granted {{only as a}} special concession to the car-carrier industry. This practice is being phased out due to concerns over {{the stability of the}} over-height vehicles and a number of incidents of non-compliance by some car-carrier operators. The Abnormal Loads Technical Committee has stipulated two requirements should operators wish to operate car-carriers in excess of legislated dimensional limits. Firstly, the operator must be RTMS-certified (RTMS is the Road Transport Management System, a voluntary accreditation scheme addressing overloading, vehicle maintenance, driver training etc.); and secondly, the car-carrier should be shown to comply with the Performance-Based Standards (PBS) scheme. The PBS scheme is a detailed set of safety standards which regulate vehicle performance (such as vehicle rollover tendency) when conducting prescribed manoeuvres. A number of PBS demonstration projects are currently running in South Africa. This paper outlines the progress to date in developing and implementing PBS-compliant car-carrier designs, the regulatory challenges encountered, and the envisaged regulatory future for car-carriers in South Africa.

40|$|An oral calcium-loading test {{suitable}} for infants is described {{and the usual}} response defined. In four acute cases of idiopathic hypercalcaemia a high and sustained rise in serum calcium occurred, suggestive of hyperabsorption and consistent with a vitamin-D-like effect. In four further infants with a milder illness suggestive of hypercalcaemia the fasting calcium levels were not grossly raised, but the test produced an exaggerated hypercalcaemic response. In this type of patient the test is more sensitive in the diagnosis of idiopathic hypercalcaemia than isolated measurements of serum calcium, especially if these are taken in the fasting state. Five patients on treatment and three whose treatment had been discontinued (but who subsequently relapsed or made a poor recovery) showed <b>abnormal</b> <b>loading</b> tests {{at a time when}} fasting calcium levels were normal. In two cases full recovery from the disease was associated with reversion of the test to normal. The test can therefore be used to indicate activity of the disease and consequently as a guide to therapy.

40|$|Malalignment of Total Knee Replacement {{prosthesis}} {{has been}} reported to limit the implant survival time.

The calculated stresses and displacements were significantly higher with varus knee malalignment than with the valgus one.

40|$|Tail rotor cables of a {{helicopter}} {{were sent to the}} laboratory for identifying the mode of failure.

The breaking load of cable Nos. 9 and 13 were determined and it was found to be in the range 1100 to 1200 kg.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{deals with}} {{problems}} of passage of abnormal loads on Czech and Slovak roundabout intersections frequently present at routes of such transports. The key routes used for transport of such loads {{do not meet}} the parameters necessary for their passage. Neither the Czech nor the Slovak Republic have a regulation, which would stipulate parameters for design of roads and intersections enabling passage of oversize and abnormal loads. The article describes incorrect geometry of roundabout intersections, unsuitable placement of vertical traffic signs and of other elements present at roundabout intersections. It further presents video analysis, transportation statistics, software verification of passage including modelling of new types of vehicles with abnormal loads in the AutoTURN programme and their subsequential verification using GPS coordinates.

40|$|Although {{there has}} been some enthusiasm over the early {{clinical}} results obtained using the Graf ligament, associated mid- to long-term results are controversial. We retrospectively reviewed 43 patients (67 segments) treated with the Graf ligament for degenerative lumbar stenosis. The minimum followup was 8  years (mean, 10  years; range, 8 – 14  years). At last followup, we observed angular instability in 19 of the 67 segments (28 %) and translational instability in five (7 %). The disc height decreased from postoperatively (mean 93 % of the preoperative disc) to the final followup (mean 82 %). Of the 43 patients, 18 (42 %) had adjacent segmental instability at the upper segment, including angular instability in 11 patients, translational instability in four patients, and both in three patients. The adjacent segment instability at the lower segment revealed 13 patients (30 %) with angular instability. The data suggest the anticipated mechanical effects of the Graf ligament can be altered by degeneration of the disc and facet joints at instrumented segments and the adjacent segment can be affected, perhaps as a result of <b>abnormal</b> <b>load</b> transmission...|$|E

The {{first one}} is the direct design approach, which includes the Alternative Path method (AP) and the Specific Local Resistance (SLR), while {{the other one is}} the indirect design approach, which is called the Tie Force method (TF). In the AP method, the structure should be capable of bridging over missing structural elements.

30|$|The {{acetabular}} labrum is a fibrocartilaginous ring {{between the}} rim of the bony acetabulum and the hip joint capsule. It is triangular in cross-section and functions to support shock absorption and load dispersal, maintain synovial fluid dynamics, and extend the concentricity of the femoroacetabular articulation. Physical disruption of the labrum can alter hip joint mechanics, leading to <b>abnormal</b> <b>loading,</b> chondral injury, and eventually degenerative osteoarthritis [1, 2]. The anterosuperior labrum has a lower elastic modulus which is a suspected mechanical reason for labral tears in this area [16].|$|R
40|$|Engineered {{structures}} {{are designed to}} resist all expected loadings without failure. However, structural failures do occasionally occur due to inadequate design and construction, especially for extreme and <b>abnormal</b> <b>loads.</b> This thesis concerns the progressive collapse of structures due to <b>abnormal</b> <b>loading</b> events, and develops a method of advanced analysis for predicting the progressive collapse behaviour of building structures in the plastic limit state. Combined-stress failure states and stiffness degradation models are proposed to simulate plastic deformation of structural members. Elliptic force-deformation relationships are employed to model the nonlinear material behaviour of members. The stiffness degradation of semirigid connections is modeled by a moment-rotation relationship with four parameters. Having the proposed nonlinear model, a generic member stiffness matrix is derived taking into account elastic-plastic bending, shearing and axial deformations. A computer-based incremental-load nonlinear analysis procedure is developed that progressively updates member stiffness using reduction factors that simulate degraded stiffness behaviour. Three types of localized damage modes are investigated to identify different connection damage scenarios. Account is taken of any debris loading that occurs when disengaged structural components fall onto lower parts of the structure. The associated dynamic effect is taken into account for the quasi-static analysis by utilizing an impact amplification factor. Any progressive collapse occurring thereafter involves a series of failure events associated with topological changes. The progressive-failure analysis procedure {{is based on the}} alternate-load-path method suggested in the design and analysis guidelines of the General Services of Administration (GSA, 2003) and the Department of Defense (DoD, 2005). The residual load carrying capacity of the damaged framework is analyzed by incrementally applying prevailing long-term loads and impact debris loads. The deterioration of structural strength is progressively traced to the state at which either global stability is reached or progressive collapse to ground level occurs for part or all of the structure. The analysis procedure is extensively illustrated for several planar steel moment frames, including account for the influence of damaged connections and semi-rigid connection behaviour. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed method is potentially a powerful tool for the analysis of steel building structures under normal and <b>abnormal</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R
