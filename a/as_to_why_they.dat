40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on an inquiry {{exploring}} the experiences of 10 mainland Chinese student teachers of English so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> understand <b>why</b> <b>they</b> came <b>to</b> Hong Kong for a teacher education programme. The study revealed that these students were largely attracted to teaching in Hong Kong because of its extrinsic benefits such as professional stability, the prestige associated with the English language teaching profession and the opportunities to acquire valued skills transferable to other professions including English competence. Facing challenges as non-local students, they were also uncertain of becoming teachers in the new context. As 'elite' Chinese students were often unwilling to become teachers, we found it strategic to attract {{a large number of}} talented non-local students to the teaching profession and retain them. We conclude the paper with recommendations for various stakeholders to support these non-local students' adaptation and development as committed and competent teachers in local schools. © 2009 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

High turnover may be harmful to a company's productivity if skilled workers are often leaving and the worker population contains a high percentage of novices. Companies will often track turnover internally across departments, divisions, or other demographic groups, such as turnover of women versus men. Most companies allow managers to terminate employees at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all, even if the employee is in good standing. Additionally, companies track voluntary turnover more accurately by presenting parting employees with surveys, thus identifying specific reasons <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> may be choosing to resign.|$|E

The Br–O bond in [...] is fairly weak, which corresponds to the general reluctance of the 4p elements (especially arsenic, selenium, and bromine) to attain their maximum possible oxidation state, as they come after the scandide contraction characterised by the poor shielding afforded by the radial-nodeless 3d orbitals.|$|E
40|$|As English is now {{promoted}} {{as an academic}} subject in primary and secondary schools in China, creating an enormous demand for qualified English teachers, {{there is a need}} to understand English teachers' motivation and commitment to the teaching career. In this paper, the author reports on a biographical study of 12 teachers who taught in schools in Chinese hinterland areas so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> understand <b>why</b> <b>they</b> first joined and then left the teaching profession for postgraduate studies. Through interpreting their professional experiences, the author came to understand their ambiguous attitudes towards the teaching profession and their fascination with the English language. Initially, many of them were unwilling to become teachers but were attracted by the teacher education programmes to learn more English. Many of them became more committed to teaching after they had positive professional experiences. However, their sense of satisfaction and achievement were undermined by the challenges that they had <b>to</b> cope with <b>as</b> well as an awareness that they were unable to sustain their professional competence. In order to retain such teachers in the profession, there is a need for teacher educators and educational administrators to work out strategies to support teachers' demand for linguistic and professional improvement in remote rural areas on the Chinese mainland. © 2010 Teacher Development. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Probably the most effective way to obtain the indestructible Winslow for one's own is to vaporize the current host's home planet and collect it from amongst the remaining debris (as suggested by a tabloid reporter and rejected by her editor). Because of the obvious need to keep the whereabouts of the Winslow hidden, humanity, generally indifferent to the Winslow and its supposed divinity, accepted its secret custodianship from the Prime Mover, a member of a race of omnipotent superbeings whose primary function appears to be keeping all manners of conflicting extraterrestrial cultures, biologies, and religions from annihilating one another.

40|$|The Linguistic Geometry (LG) {{approach}} to discrete systems was introduced B. Stilman in early 80 s. It employed competing/cooperating agents for modeling and controlling of discrete systems. The approach {{was applied to}} a variety of problems with huge state spaces including control of aircraft, battlefield robots, and chess. One of the key innovations of LG is the use of almost winning strategies, rather than truly winning strategies for the playing agents. There are many cases where the winning strategies have so high time complexity that they are not computable in practice, whereas the almost winning strategies can be applied and they beat the opposing agent almost guaranteed. Independently of LG the idea of competing/ cooperating agents was employed in the late 80 s by A. Nerode, A. Yakhnis, and V.
