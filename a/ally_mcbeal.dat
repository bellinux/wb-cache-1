5|$|Before {{the end of}} {{his first}} season on <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal,</b> over the Thanksgiving 2000 holiday, Downey was arrested when his room at Merv Griffin's Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs, California was searched by the police, who were {{responding}} to an anonymous 911 call. Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and Valium. Despite the fact that, if convicted, he could face a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> episodes.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1997, he had minor {{roles in}} the comedy shows Townies, Veronica's Closet, and <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b> Originally, McCormack was {{scheduled}} to appear as a series regular in the NBC sitcom Jenny, but was fired after the pilot due to the network cutting his character.|$|E
5|$|In its {{original}} airing on the Fox Network, the episode had an 8.6 Nielsen rating and was viewed in approximately 8.5 million homes. It finished the week ranked 35th. It {{was the fifth}} highest rated show on Fox that week, after two games of the 1998 World Series, a World Series pre-game show, and <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b>|$|E
50|$|San Giacomo's {{work during}} Season 2 (1997-1998) earned her a Golden Globe {{nomination}} in 1998 for Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical; the award went to <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal's</b> Calista Flockhart.|$|R
50|$|Television audiences know Clayburgh from {{numerous}} roles in series and movies including Search For Tomorrow, Law & Order, The Practice and as <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeals</b> mother. She received Emmy Award nominations {{for her work}} in the made-for-television movie Hustling in 1975 and for guest appearances in the series Nip/Tuck in 2005.|$|R
500|$|Ling Woo's {{character}} {{has been described}} as the antithesis of <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal's.</b> [...] For example, Woo is portrayed as evil, McBeal as good; Woo growls, McBeal purrs. At the same time, Woo's verbal assaults present a fantasy of authority that appeals to even McBeal. [...] "She's my hero", says McBeal, [...] "she's vicious, I disagree with almost everything she says, she treats me like dirt, and somehow she's my hero." ...|$|R
5|$|For much of {{the late}} 1990s, he lived in Los Angeles and had minor roles. He made his feature film debut in the 1992 science-fiction {{adventure}} film The Lost World. McCormack appeared in several television series, including Top Cops, Street Justice, , Townies, and <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b> McCormack later gained worldwide recognition for playing Will Truman in Will & Grace, which premiered in September 1998. His performance earned him five Golden Globe nominations and four Emmy nominations, ultimately winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The song {{garnered}} {{positive response}} from music critics, {{many of them}} highlighting its lyrical content. It was a commercial success, becoming a top-ten hit in many countries including Australia, Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, while topping the chart in Finland. Madonna has performed the song on two of her concert tours; on the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, and 14 years later on the Re-Invention World Tour. The song has been covered by several tribute acts, and was also performed on the television series <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> (1997).|$|E
5|$|Among other things, {{the episode}} was {{inspired}} by the history of baseball in Roswell, as well as the infamous 1947 Roswell Incident. Jesse Martin was offered the lead guest role as Exley after Duchovny noticed him in a production of the musical Rent and an episode of <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b> Originally, Darren McGavin was cast as Arthur Dales, but after he suffered a stroke, he was replaced by Walsh. Many of the outdoor baseball scenes were filmed at Jay Littleton Ballfield, an all-wood stadium located in Ontario, California. The episode has been critically examined for its use of literary motifs, its fairy tale-like structure, and its themes concerning racism and alienation.|$|E
2500|$|While known {{primarily}} for his comic roles, Perry has {{carved out a}} career in drama as well, particularly in his portrayal of Associate White House Counsel Joe Quincy in Aaron Sorkin's The West Wing. His three appearances in that series (twice in the fourth season and once in the fifth) earned him two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series in 2003 and 2004. Perry is {{referred to in the}} show prior to his guest appearance - Donna Moss seeks him out (off screen) in the episode [...] "20 Hours in LA." [...] He also appeared as attorney Todd Merrick in two episodes near the end of <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeals</b> five-season run, including a 2-hour special intended to revive the legal comedy-drama.|$|R
500|$|Her {{liaisons}} {{are with}} white men, {{but not only}} men. In a dream sequence of <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal's</b> {{in which the two}} of them go on a date, they kiss on screen. [...] The kiss was shot in profile, locked lips clearly visible, rather than using the normal angle for same-sex kisses, in which the partner's head blocks the view of the actual contact. The scene was considered so racy that the episode was banned from being shown in Singapore. [...] The episode won its time slot among young adult viewers during its showing in the November 1999 sweeps, even beating Monday Night Football. [...] Ling made the [...] "damn hot kiss" [...] even hotter because [...] "she's the exotic, erotic experimenter of the group", according to Scott Seomin, media director at that time for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.|$|R
2500|$|Calista Kay Flockhart (born November 11, 1964) is an American actress. She is {{best known}} for {{starring}} as the title character in the legal comedy-drama series <b>Ally</b> [...] <b>McBeal</b> (1997–2002), Kitty Walker in the drama series Brothers & Sisters (2006–2011) and Cat Grant in the superhero drama series Supergirl (2015–present). She has also been featured in a number of films, including the comedy film The Birdcage (1996), the romantic comedy film A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999), and the drama film Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her (2000).|$|R
5|$|Downey had {{a regular}} {{role in the}} {{television}} series <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> in 2000, which won him a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. He was then cast in the 2003 films The Singing Detective alongside Robin Wright and Gothika with Halle Berry. In 2005, he starred in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with Val Kilmer; in Good Night, and Good Luck with David Strathairn and George Clooney; and voiced the character of Patrick Pewterschmidt in the animated series Family Guy. The following year, he appeared in the animated science fiction film A Scanner Darkly and as Paul Avery in the 2007 film Zodiac.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the world}} of <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b> It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
5|$|Making {{his acting}} debut {{at the age}} of five, {{appearing}} in his father's film Pound (1970), Downey Jr. appeared in roles associated with the Brat Pack, such as the teen sci-fi comedy Weird Science (1985) and the drama Less Than Zero (1987). He starred as the title character in the 1992 film Chaplin, which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won him the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. After being released in 2000 from the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison where he was on drug charges, Downey joined the cast of the TV series <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> playing Calista Flockhart's love interest. This earned him a Golden Globe Award. His character was written out when Downey was fired after two drug arrests in late 2000 and early 2001. After his last stay in a court-ordered drug treatment program, Downey achieved sobriety.|$|E
5|$|In April 2001, {{while he}} was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him {{wandering}} barefoot in Culver City, just outside Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system. After this last arrest, producer David E. Kelley and other <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and dismissed Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeals ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts, and the subsequent incarceration forced Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet, as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, benefiting from the California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.|$|E

25|$|Kelley {{frequently}} {{crossed the}} cast of different shows. One crossover program event (which crossed networks also) involved characters from Kelley's <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> on the Fox network appearing on his ABC show, The Practice, and, in turn, The Practice characters appeared on <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b> This was done {{in spite of the}} two shows' different tones (one a comedy, the other a drama). This crossover was partially credited for raising ratings for The Practice, which it sustained after those episodes.|$|E
25|$|Kelley {{repeated}} this maneuver {{with his}} Boston Public, <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal,</b> and Boston Legal shows. Thereafter, many other crossovers occurred including shows not created by Kelley.|$|E
25|$|Guest {{appearance}} in a 2001 episode of <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b> He played both a hallucination of Ally's and himself on {{stage at the}} end of the show.|$|E
25|$|Fanning {{subsequently}} {{had several}} guest roles on television series, including , The Practice, and Spin City. She also portrayed the title characters of <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> and The Ellen Show as young girls.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{she became}} the first modern-day cartoon voice of Little Lulu. In 1999, she had a {{recurring}} role as an unconventional psychotherapist on <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b> Her performance garnered her an Emmy Award and an American Comedy Award.|$|E
25|$|Premiering on FOX in 2000, Boston Public, {{which follows}} {{the lives of}} {{teachers}} and administrators at a Boston high school, joined The Practice and <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> for the season, meaning Kelley was responsible for writing or overseeing 67 episodes.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal,</b> Kelley {{utilized}} two techniques: a voiceover {{providing an}} interior monologue {{for the title}} character, and Walter Mitty fantasy sequences (ala Dream On as critics have noted) giving a humorous and often deeply honest (but sometimes ironic) explanation of the character's inner thoughts.|$|E
25|$|Fawcett {{continued}} to work in television, with well-regarded appearances in made-for-television movies and on popular television series including <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> and four episodes each of Spin City and The Guardian. Her work on the latter show earned her a third Emmy nomination in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Dame Edna's new-found {{success in}} America led to many media opportunities, {{including}} a semi-regular {{role in the}} hit TV series <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b> Vanity Fair magazine invited Dame Edna to write a satirical advice column in 2003 although after an outcry following a remark about learning Spanish, the column was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of taking}} clear stands on issues, Kelley creates {{scenarios}} meant to challenge audience preconceptions. For example, {{an episode of}} <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> dealt with a female employee who sued for sexual harassment because she noticed that other prettier women were being promoted. There was deliberately no clear point of view.|$|E
25|$|In addition, he made {{numerous}} guest {{appearances on}} shows, including The Larry Sanders Show, Walker, Texas Ranger, Touched by an Angel, Chicago Hope, The Pretender, and <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b> He {{appeared in the}} 1996 film Bogus, alongside Whoopi Goldberg and Gérard Depardieu and the 1998 made-for-TV movie The Lake, as well as I'll Remember April (1999), with future The Sixth Sense co-star Trevor Morgan.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from her}} career in the music {{industry}} and on the stage, Holliday has also made appearances on primetime television. In addition to appearances on Touched by an Angel and Hang Time, she had a half dozen appearances in a recurring guest star role on <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal,</b> where she acted out the role of choir director Lisa Knowles, often singing popular ballads.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Kelley {{entered into}} a five-year deal with 20th Century Fox Television to produce shows for both the ABC and FOX {{television}} networks, each agreeing to take two series. If one network passed on a project, the other got first refusal. Kelley retained full creative control. <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> on FOX and The Practice on ABC were the first two projects to come from this deal.|$|E
25|$|David Edward Kelley (born April 4, 1956) is an American {{television}} {{writer and}} producer, {{known as the}} creator of Picket Fences, Chicago Hope, The Practice, <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal,</b> Boston Public, Boston Legal, Harry's Law, Big Little Lies and Mr.Mercedes, {{as well as several}} films. Kelley is one of very few screenwriters to have created shows aired on all four top commercial U.S. television networks (ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC).|$|E
25|$|Besides the 500 {{original}} film {{scores that}} have been composed by Morricone for movies and television series in a career of over six decades, his music is in addition frequently reused in more than 150 other film projects. Morricone's compositions appeared in the German TV series Derrick (1989), the live-action comedy film Inspector Gadget, <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal</b> (2001), The Simpsons (2002), The Sopranos (2001–2002) and more recently in Dancing with the Stars (2010).|$|E
25|$|Flockhart {{attended}} Shawnee High School in Medford Township, New Jersey. Following graduation in 1983, Flockhart {{attended the}} Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. While there, she attended a specialized and competitive class, lasting from 6:00a.m. to 6:00p.m. In her sophomore year at Rutgers, Flockhart met aspiring actress Jane Krakowski, {{the best friend}} of her roommate. Later, they both would work together on <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Smith focused her acting career on television. She {{appeared}} on the variety series Sin City Spectacular in 1998. That same year, Smith appeared in the tell-all self-promoting film, Anna Nicole Smith: Exposed, {{which was based on}} several photo sessions during her Playboy career. She appeared as Donna, the friend of Veronica Chase played by Kirstie Alley, on the sitcom Veronica's Closet in 1999. Smith guest-starred as Myra Jacobs in a 1999 episode of the surreal series, <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{program was}} {{initially}} considered a modest hit but received less than glowing reviews. The previous season, Kelley stumbled {{with both the}} short-lived Snoops, his first attempt at delegating most of the responsibilities to others, and with Ally, the experiment with 30-minute shortened episodes of <b>Ally</b> <b>McBeal.</b> The TV critic from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram opined that these failures and the weaknesses he saw in Boston Public were a sign that Kelley had lost the Midas touch. The show lasted four seasons, garnering one minor Emmy.|$|E
