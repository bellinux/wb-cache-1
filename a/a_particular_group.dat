5|$|How species {{should be}} defined in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>group</b> of organisms gives rise to {{practical}} and theoretical problems that {{are referred to as}} the species problem.

By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at higher taxonomic ranks, from subgenus and above only, than species.|$|E
40|$|Recently, a Canadian {{administrative}} tribunal recognized homosexuals as <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> social <b>group.</b> In April 1992, the Convention Refugee Determination Division (the “CRDD”) of the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board (the “Canadian IRB”) granted refugee status to an Argentine {{man who was}} persecuted in Argentina because of his homosexuality. The Canadian IRB held in Re: Inaudi that homosexuals constitute <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> social <b>group</b> {{for the purpose of}} satisfying the definition of “refugee. ” Re: Inaudi is similar to the two U. S. administrative decisions in that Re: Inaudi does not have precedential value. This Comment argues that U. S. courts and administrative agencies should rely on Re: Inaudi to hold that homosexuals constitute <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> social <b>group.</b> Part I sets forth the origin of the social group category in U. S. and Canadian immigration law. Part I also examines how the phrase “membership in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> social group” has been interpreted and applied in Canada and the United States. Furthermore, Part I discusses the U. S. government 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of homosexuals. Part II sets forth the facts and holding of the Canadian IRB 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Re: Inaudi. Part III argues that Re: Inaudi provides a thorough analysis of why homosexuals constitute <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> social <b>group,</b> integrating into its decision the various factors that the U. S. has applied in determining what constitutes <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> social <b>group</b> in general. Because Re: Inaudi provides a thorough, detailed and sound analysis of what constitutes <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> social <b>group</b> in general, and why homosexuals, in <b>particular,</b> form <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> social <b>group,</b> U. S. courts and administrative agencies should rely on Re: Inaudi to extend their definition of <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> social <b>group</b> to include homosexuals. This Comment concludes that, in the future, the U. S. BIA and the U. S. federal courts should recognize homosexuals as <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> social <b>group</b> for the purposes of satisfying the definition of “refugee. ...|$|R

5|$|The CLB {{directors}} concurred, and on January 19, 1920, {{they formed}} an organization {{under a new}} name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although {{a handful of other}} organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>group</b> of persons, or a single theme.

In contrast, the irony is the Ethiopian government itself {{has been accused of}} genocide based on atrocities committed in Gambella. I'm not sure that they qualify as genocide either.

40|$|In typical {{studies of}} node {{grouping}} detection, the grouping {{is presumed to}} have a certain type of correlation with the network structure (e. g., densely connected groups of nodes that are loosely connected in between). People have defined different fitness measures (modularity, conductance, etc.) to quantify such correlation, and group the nodes by optimizing a certain fitness measure. However, <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>grouping</b> with desired semantics, as the target of the detection, is not promised to be detectable by each measure. We study a fundamental problem in the process of node <b>grouping</b> discovery: Given <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>grouping</b> in <b>a</b> network, whether and to what extent it can be discovered with a given fitness measure. We propose two approaches of testing the detectability, namely ranking-based and correlation-based randomization tests. Our methods are evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets, which shows the proposed methods can effectively predict the detectability of groupings of various types, and support explorative process of node grouping discovery. ...|$|R
