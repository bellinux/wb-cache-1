5|$|A {{variety of}} {{religious}} beliefs are represented among the novel's characters. Jacob Brattle is an unbeliever. Puddleham is a Primitive Methodist. The Stowte family, {{to which the}} marquis belongs, <b>are</b> <b>Low</b> Church Anglicans, and Fenwick is High church and latitudinarian. Their charity is tested by their response to Carry Brattle, and it is Fenwick who passes the test. As William Cadbury expresses it, Puddleham has been hardened by too much doctrine, Jacob Brattle by too little.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with their tendency towards extreme length, the vaults of English cathedrals <b>are</b> <b>low</b> compared {{with many of}} those found in other countries. The highest medieval stone vault in England is at Westminster Abbey at , that at York Minster being of the same height but despite its appearance, not actually of stone, but wood. The majority of English cathedrals have vaults ranging in height from 20–26 metres (65–86feet). These {{contrast with}} cathedrals such as Beauvais, Amiens and Cologne with internal heights of over 42 metres (140ft).|$|E
5|$|Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and {{starvation}} are {{the other}} leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels <b>are</b> <b>low,</b> but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.|$|E

5|$|Estimates of lifespans {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These {{estimates}} {{depart from the}} findings of a 2005 study, which pegged the mean age of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates <b>are</b> <b>low</b> due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years.|$|E
5|$|House {{prices in}} Weymouth and Portland are {{relatively}} high by UK standards, yet around {{average for the}} south of England—the average price of a detached house in 2010 was £303,622; semi-detached and terraced houses were cheaper, at £204,647 and £203,207 respectively, and an apartment or maisonette cost £155,056. The crime rate in Weymouth of 7.6 burglaries per 1000 households is {{lower than that of}} England and Wales (11.6 per 1000), but above that of Dorset (3.6 per 1000). Unemployment levels <b>are</b> <b>low,</b> particularly in summer, at 2.5% of the economically active population in July 2011, compared to the UK average of 7.7%.|$|E
5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels <b>are</b> <b>low,</b> this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There {{may be other}} features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E

30|$|From Table 1, {{some simple}} inferences can be made. For example, BER for {{conversational}} type of applications need not <b>be</b> <b>low</b> {{which means that}} BER is not a prime requirement in voice-based applications. Whereas for such applications, E 2 EDelay and Jitter should <b>be</b> <b>low,</b> meaning that these parameters should have low values for better user perceived quality. For streaming kind of applications (including live streaming) Jitter should <b>be</b> <b>low,</b> Bandwidth should <b>be</b> high, and E 2 EDelay may <b>be</b> <b>low</b> to medium, but should not be high.

It may also be diagnosed in those with a TSH of greater than 10mIU/L.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} {{the notion that}} a large {{population}} implies a large market. Though underdeveloped countries have a large population, their levels of productivity <b>are</b> <b>low.</b> This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{levels of}} {{academic}} achievement in Felling <b>are</b> <b>low.</b> Only 59% of adults have 5 or more GCSEs at grade A* – C. This compares to a borough average of 80% and is the lowest figure in the borough. The figure falls to 33% when GCSE English and Mathematics are included; {{this is the second}} lowest figure in Gateshead and is lowered only by neighbouring Deckham. 28% of school pupils have a special educational need; the highest figure in the borough and 8% higher than the Gateshead average.|$|E

Support and conflict in one relationship context were hypothesized to moderate the effects of experiences in the other relationship context. Adolescent-reported antisocial behavior <b>was</b> <b>low</b> when either parent-child relationships or friendships <b>were</b> <b>low</b> in conflict, and adolescent-reported depressed mood <b>was</b> <b>low</b> when either friendship conflict <b>was</b> <b>low</b> or parental support was high.

40|$|Both dietary {{iron and}} copper were {{inversely}} related to lead absorption as indicated by erythrocyte and kidney lead levels, dietary iron having the greatest effect. Kidney copper values were depressed when dietary iron <b>was</b> <b>low,</b> a condition which was worsened by lead.
