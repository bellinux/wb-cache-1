500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a March 2, 2011 interview, {{when asked}} whether the {{government}} should provide financial aid to a poor student with good grades who wants to further his education, Paul responded that no, the government should not because “nobody {{has a right to}} someone else's wealth. You have a right to your life and {{you have a right to}} your property but you don't have a – education isn't a right. Medical care isn't a right. These <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> have to earn." [...] (He went on to explain that there were no government loans when he went to school, yet education costs were much lower and he was able to finance his medical school education by obtaining private loans through the medical school.) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Some bribes {{are hard}} to resist when they are offered {{in the name of}} charity; for example, {{hospitals}} founded and new churches built," [...] Grahame interposed. [...] "These <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can make good use of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Complications?" [...] Mr. Flack threw off. [...] "That's {{what she}} calls them. It seems very {{different}} from America. It's just like a beautiful story--they have such strange feelings. But there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can see--without being told." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{know nothing}} about it," [...] {{observed}} Patsy, demurely, [...] "and {{that is why you}} love to rail at society. The <b>things</b> <b>you</b> know, Daddy dear, <b>are</b> the <b>things</b> <b>you</b> never remark upon." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, my dear," [...] {{said her}} aunt at last, [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> know, {{which must be}} talked about, though they are ever so disagreeable;" [...] and then she pulled {{out of her pocket}} that abominable number of the Littlebath Christian Examiner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear child, I'm badly shaken," [...] I said. [...] "Don't {{expect me}} to be natural yet. There <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can't guess. So much {{depended}} upon--Oh, never mind! I'll go now. I want to be alone, to think things out. Let me go, Sally." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> mixing <b>things!</b> <b>You</b> <b>were</b> not in Egypt," [...] Mrs. Jefferson rejoined, and Kit {{thought she}} meant to banish her husband's sombre mood.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] quoth {{the other}} complacently, [...] "was my final argument, my {{crowning}} effort, or peroratio, as the orators have it. For, coz, since all thoughts <b>are</b> <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> have but {{to think a}} pair of herrings, and then conjure up a pottle of milk wherewith to wash them down." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jefferson smiled, a curious, wry smile. [...] "It's hard--the toughest {{thing one}} can do--just to keep still; but if I climbed {{up and down}} that ladder for two hours I'd {{probably}} break out, and heave somebody into the creek. There <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> have to get over once for all--and do it quick." ...|$|E
6000|$|A bright {{smile with}} a touch of mockery in it flitted over her face as she replied: [...] "Oh, must I tell you that there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> cannot do?

2500|$|Around 1890, Bion {{invested}} $3,000 in a phosphate mining {{enterprise that}} promised {{a return of}} $100,000 in three months time. When he lost the entire amount, he never again speculated, and applied that same principle at Barnett Bank. He was fond of telling people, [...] "It <b>is</b> not the <b>things</b> <b>you</b> don't know that get you in trouble.

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Burnamy, {{willing to}} talk of himself on any terms. [...] "I suppose that prose is the thing for our time, rather more; but there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can't say in prose. I used to write {{a great deal of}} verse in college; but I didn't have much luck with editors till Mr. March took this little piece for 'Every Other Week'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{thinking}} about him and his work," [...] Joan answered. Her hand sought Hilda's and held it. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> don't understand. Men and women can't help {{each other in the}} way you think. They may try to, and mean no harm in the beginning, but the harm comes, and then not only the woman but the man also suffers, and his work is spoilt and his life ruined." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{certainly}} is coming {{as near as}} can be to keeping the thing quiet {{for the benefit of}} all concerned. What's your opinion, you pampered mail-boat swell? The old chief says that this was plainly {{the only thing that could}} be done. The skipper remarked to me the other day, 'There <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> find nothing about in books.' I think that he got out of it very well for such a stupid man." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} {{think that}} <b>is</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> could {{expect me to}} admit--that is, at least, {{as far as my}} part in it goes," [...] said Nasmyth.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're of {{the same}} race, at any rate--more or less; {{of the same}} general {{tradition}} and education, of the same moral paste. There <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> {{have in common with}} them. But I, on my side, as I've gone on trying to see if I haven't some of these things too--I, on my side, have more and more failed. There seem at last to be none worth mentioning. I can't help seeing it--I'm decidedly too different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't call {{me by my}} name, {{because he}} would be angry. I have to do, you know, as he tells me. And I do so strive to do it! Through it all I have an idea that if I do my duty {{it will be better}} for me. There <b>are</b> <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> know, which a husband may tell you to do, but you cannot do. If he tells me to rob, I am not to rob;--am I? And now I think of it, you ought not to be here. He would be very much displeased. But it has been so {{pleasant}} once more to see an old friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what is the}} use?" [...] he asked, timidly, {{yet with}} an eager look in his face. [...] "You are young, my child; I am nearly {{old enough to have}} been your father. There <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> have not yet learned; things I hope you will never learn. An oak may stand alone in a field, and be lonely because it cannot touch boughs with another. A flower may bloom alone in a garden, and wither and die for want of companionship. God's wisdom grouped every living thing. He gave Adam a comrade. He created no solitary thing. But see, my child: {{although}} this world contains countless thousands, there is not one among them I may call my friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, never mind; {{that was}} n't what I began to say. There <b>'s</b> one <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> must have, and that is, bronze boots," [...] said Fan, impressively.|$|R
