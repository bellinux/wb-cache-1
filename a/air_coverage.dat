25|$|From 1959 until 1966, a US Air Force unit {{equipped}} with two MSQ-1A radar was stationed at Celle Air Base. This unit's tasks were to link into missiles {{of the type}} TM-61C (MGM-1 Matador) and guide them towards their target. For complete <b>air</b> <b>coverage,</b> especially eastwards, the unit at Celle was not necessary. In order to save costs this unit was disbanded in 1966.|$|E
25|$|On 28 January 1944, LST-21 got {{underway}} from Bizerte to join {{a convoy}} leaving the Mediterranean for England. They were noted to have <b>air</b> <b>coverage</b> as a protection against glider bombs. On January 31, an oceangoing tug out of Oran came alongside each ship in the group to deliver charts for the approaches to Plymouth, England, as they had left Bizerte without such charts. Later that day, LST-21 learned that its ultimate destination had been changed to Milford Haven, Wales.|$|E

25|$|When {{the ball}} is new the seam is {{used to create a}} layer of {{turbulent}} air {{on one side of the}} ball, by angling it to one side and spinning the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this turbulent air creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the turbulent air due to the greater <b>air</b> <b>coverage</b> and as there is a difference in air velocity, the static pressure of both sides of the ball are different and {{the ball is}} both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the turbulent airflow side of the ball.|$|E
25|$|In its inaugural season, Rogers aired 500 games across CBC and Rogers-owned properties. On Wednesday nights, Sportsnet aired Scotiabank Wednesday Night Hockey; {{similarly}} to TSN under the previous contract, {{the network has}} an exclusive window where no other broadcaster may air NHL games in Canada. Sportsnet 360 and Sportsnet One will air around 100 games involving U.S. teams throughout the season; Sportsnet One primarily airs NBC Sports' Wednesday Night Rivalry games, while 360 airs games on Thursday nights. Sportsnet will also <b>air</b> <b>coverage</b> of the entry Draft. Rogers stated that in combination with its existing regional rights to the Vancouver Canucks, Edmonton Oilers, and Calgary Flames, it would have an effective monopoly on all NHL telecasts in Western Canada (aside from portions of the Jets' market that are shared with the Flames and Oilers, such as Saskatchewan).|$|E
500|$|IPC {{president}} Philip Craven was {{vocal about}} NBC's reluctance to <b>air</b> <b>coverage</b> in 2012, expressing his disappointment for American athletes and viewers who would miss the [...] "amazing images" [...] the games would bring, and remarking that [...] "some {{people think that}} North America always lead on everything, and on this they don't. It's about time they caught up." [...] Following the closing ceremonies, Craven hinted that the IPC might put greater scrutiny on broadcasters at future editions of the Paralympics (or may strip NBC of its broadcast rights), by stating that [...] "if we find our values don’t fit, we’ll have to go somewhere else." [...] NBC would pick up broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Paralympics, promising significantly increased coverage than before.|$|E

500|$|Broadcast {{rights to}} the 2012 Summer Paralympics were sold to local {{broadcasters}} by LOCOG, with production of the world feeds sub-contracted to Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS). The Games saw a significant growth in media coverage for the Paralympics; LOCOG reached deals with over 36 broadcasters to televise the Games in over 100 countries. LOCOG chief Sebastian Coe stated that [...] "beyond how the commercial value of this package has raised the bar financially for the Paralympic movement, the fantastic broadcast coverage we have agreed will help us {{take advantage of this}} opportunity to inspire disabled people of all ages to take up sport and be a catalyst for continued change in public attitudes towards disability." [...] LOCOG reached deals with broadcasters such as China Central Television, the Korean Broadcasting System, NHK, Rede Globo and SporTV in Brazil, the TV Pool (a consortium of free-to-air broadcasters in Thailand consisting of Channel 3, Channel 5, BBTV Channel 7, and Modernine TV), and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to <b>air</b> <b>coverage.</b> The games were to be broadcast on television in the United Kingdom by Channel 4, replacing long-time Paralympic broadcaster BBC in a £9 million deal; the BBC still held radio rights, with coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra. The IPC webcast approximately 780 hours of its coverage through its YouTube channel, with four streams of coverage in English and one in Spanish.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} May 1945, Taney {{had gone}} to general {{quarters}} 119 times, with the crew remaining at battle stations for up to nine hours at a stretch. During this period off Okinawa in April and May, Taney downed four suicide planes and assisted in numerous other [...] "kills". The command ship also conducted combat information center duties, maintaining complete radar and <b>air</b> <b>coverage,</b> receiving and evaluating information on both friendly and enemy activities. On one occasion, Taneys duties took her close inshore close enough to even receive fire close aboard from a Japanese shore battery.|$|E
2500|$|Days {{after the}} loss of Gaelic games Championship rights in 2014, the station secured live free to <b>air</b> <b>coverage</b> of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. [...] TV3 {{broadcast}} all 48 matches in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. [...] Coverage was presented by Matt Cooper or Tommy Martin alongside Keith Wood, Matt Williams, Peter Stringer, Shane Jennings, Neil Back, Murray Kinsella with commentary by 2 commentary teams – the first being Conor McNamara, Stuart Barnes and Liam Toland and the second being Dave McIntyre and Hugo McNeill. [...] Other commentary {{was provided by the}} world field such as Andrew Cotter, Joel Stransky, Alan Quinlan, Chris Patterson. [...] The coverage has been met with significant criticism due to the high number of ad breaks and their positioning throughout the coverage. After a successful Rugby World Cup for TV3 they shocked RTÉ Sport in November 2015 by winning the rights to broadcast all matches in the 6 Nations from 2018–2021 with RTÉ continuing to cover the tournament in 2016–2017.|$|E

2500|$|Reverse swing {{occurs in}} exactly the same manner as {{conventional}} swing, despite popular misconception. Over time the rough side becomes too rough and the tears become too deep – this is why golf ball dimples are never below a certain depth, and so [...] "conventional" [...] swing weakens over time; the separation point moves {{toward the front of the}} ball on the rough side. When polishing the shiny side of the ball, numerous liquids are used, such as sweat, saliva, sunscreen, hair gel (which bowlers may apply to their hair before a game) and other illegal substances like Vaseline (applied to the clothing where the ball is polished). These liquids penetrate the porous surface of the leather ball. Over time the liquid expands and stretches the surface of the ball (which increases the surface area meaning more lift) and creates raised bumps on the polished side, due to the non-uniform nature of the expansion. The valleys between the bumps hold the air in the same manner as the tears on the rough side. This creates a layer of air over the shiny side, moving the separation point towards the back of the ball on the shiny side. The greater <b>air</b> <b>coverage</b> is now on the shiny side, giving rise to more lift and faster secondary airflow on that side. There is therefore lower static pressure on the shiny side, causing the ball to swing towards it, not away from it as in conventional swing.|$|E
2500|$|On April 16, 1961 {{there were}} {{initially}} 11 targets that {{were scheduled to}} be attacked. The list later got narrowed down to 4. These 4 included the San Antonio Air Base, the Campo Liberated Air Base, and finally the naval bases located at Batabano and Nueca Gerona. Additionally, the number of B-26 crafts {{to be used in}} the strike was cut down from 15 to 5, which ultimately limited the US's <b>air</b> <b>coverage.</b> The CIA's Official History of the Bay of Pigs Operation notes that this left the Brigade air force open to attacks by Castro's forces. The document states that, [...] "There is no doubt that if there had been more JMATE aircraft and more aircrews, constant air cover would have been possible." [...] Both Kennedys ignored the fact that limited air strikes would prevent the Brigade air force from being effective because of the risk of counter attack by the Cuban air force. A White House staffer was quoted as saying, [...] "...the plan was to destroy Castro's air force on the ground before the battle began, and then provide air support, with an anti-Castro [...] "Air Force" [...] consisting of some two dozen surplus planes flown by Cuban exiles. That plan failed." [...] On the 18th of April there was an air transport scheduled from the USAF and that was the best day for the Brigade B-26’s mobilization to occur. During this strike there were no aircraft lost and there was a successful strike made on the Castro column moving from Playa Larga to Playa Giron. The Official History of this operation notes that there were several uncertainties as to the outcomes of various operations between April 17–19, 1961, including the number and identities of casualties of both pilots and Cuban civilians, as well as a question over the possible use of napalm by Acting Chief of the US Air section Garfield Thorsrud's aircraft on April 17, 1961. The Official History notes that the use of napalm had not been officially approved until the next day, April 18, 1961. 10 days later TIDE dropped 5 B-26 bombs.|$|E
