25|$|Hubel and Wiesel had {{demonstrated}} that ocular dominance columns {{in the lowest}} neocortical visual <b>area,</b> <b>V1,</b> remained largely immutable after the critical period in development. Researchers also studied critical periods with respect to language; the resulting data suggested that sensory pathways were fixed after the critical period. However, studies determined that environmental changes could alter behavior and cognition by modifying connections between existing neurons and via neurogenesis in the hippocampus and {{in other parts of}} the brain, including in the cerebellum.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{attributes}} of stimulus: modality, intensity, location, and duration. The neocortex in the mammalian brain has parcellations that primarily process sensory input from one modality. For example, primary visual <b>area,</b> <b>V1,</b> or primary somatosensory area, S1. These areas mostly deal with low-level stimulus {{features such as}} brightness, orientation, intensity, etc. These areas have extensive connections {{to each other as}} well as to higher association areas that further process the stimuli and are believed to integrate sensory input from various modalities. However, recently multisensory effects have been shown to occur in primary sensory areas as well.|$|E
2500|$|Though the {{resolving power}} {{depends on the}} size and packing density of the photoreceptors, the neural system must {{interpret}} the receptors’ information. As determined from single-cell experiments on the cat and primate, different ganglion cells in the retina are tuned to different spatial frequencies, so some ganglion cells at each location have better acuity than others. [...] Ultimately, however, {{it appears that the}} size of a patch of cortical tissue in visual <b>area</b> <b>V1</b> [...] that processes a given location in the visual field (a concept known as cortical magnification) is equally important in determining visual acuity. In particular, that size is largest in the fovea’s center, and decreases with increasing distance from there.|$|E

50|$|MT is {{connected}} to {{a wide array of}} cortical and subcortical brain areas. Its input comes from visual cortical <b>areas</b> <b>V1,</b> V2 and dorsal V3 (dorsomedial area), the koniocellular regions of the LGN, and the inferior pulvinar. The pattern of projections to MT changes somewhat between the representations of the foveal and peripheral visual fields, with the latter receiving inputs from areas located in the midline cortex and retrosplenial region.|$|R
2500|$|Separable models often {{arise in}} {{biological}} systems, and the SVD factorization {{is useful to}} analyze such systems. For example, some visual <b>area</b> <b>V1</b> simple cells' receptive fields can be well described by a Gabor filter in the space domain multiplied by a modulation function in the time domain. Thus, given a linear filter evaluated through, for example, reverse correlation, one can rearrange the two spatial dimensions into one dimension, thus yielding a two-dimensional filter (space, time) which can be decomposed through SVD. The first column of [...] in the SVD factorization is then a Gabor while the first column of [...] represents the time modulation (or vice versa). One may then define an index of separability, ...|$|E
2500|$|Proper {{development}} of normal visual acuity {{depends on a}} human or an animal having normal visual input when it is very young. Any visual deprivation, that is, anything interfering with such input over a prolonged period of time, such as a cataract, severe eye turn or strabismus, [...] anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the two eyes), or covering or patching the eye during medical treatment, will usually result in a severe and permanent decrease in visual acuity and pattern recognition in the affected eye if not treated early in life, a condition known as amblyopia. The decreased acuity is reflected in various abnormalities in cell properties in the visual cortex. These changes include a marked {{decrease in the number}} of cells connected to the affected eye as well as cells connected to both eyes in cortical <b>area</b> <b>V1,</b> resulting in a loss of stereopsis, i.e. depth perception by binocular vision (colloquially: [...] "3D vision"). The period of time over which an animal is highly sensitive to such visual deprivation is referred to as the critical period.|$|E
5000|$|The brain's primary {{visual cortex}} (<b>area</b> <b>V1</b> or Brodmann area 17) {{contains}} a spatially isomorphic representation of the retina (see retinotopy). Loosely speaking, it is a distorted [...] "map" [...] of the retina. Accordingly, the size [...] of a given retinal image determines {{the extent of the}} neural activity pattern eventually generated in <b>area</b> <b>V1</b> by the associated retinal activity pattern. Murray, Boyaci, & Kersten (2006) recently used Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that an increase in a viewed target's visual angle, which increases , also increases the extent of the corresponding neural activity pattern in <b>area</b> <b>V1.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{modeling}} of neural {{processes of the}} brain that occur when the watercolor illusion stimulus is seen is the LAMINART model. This model demonstrates that stimulus is processed in the layers 6 and 4 of the cortical <b>areas</b> <b>V1</b> and V2. The LAMINART model betters explains spatial competition which occurs when the boundary is weakened (e.g. dotted line). Also, the LAMINART model does not completely reduces the illusion visualization if the stimulus is low-contrast.|$|R
50|$|The authors {{recorded}} {{the activity of}} surface- and edge-cells (cells whose receptive fields pointed either to the filled-in surface or to {{the border between the}} disk and the ring) in the visual cortices V1 and V2 while the monkey was performing the filling-in task. The activity of surface-cells correlated with the physical stimulus change in both <b>areas</b> <b>V1</b> and V2, but not with the perceived colour change induced by filling-in. The activity of edge-cells followed the stimulus contrast when the disk colour changed physically; when the colours were constant, the edge signals also decayed, but more slowly. Together, these data are incompatible with the isomorphic filling-in theory, which assumes that colour signals spread from the borders into uniform regions.|$|R
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{study from}} Nunn et al. on the {{activation of the}} V4-complex in people with visual synaesthesia from hearing spoken words was used to predict {{the location of the}} colour centre. Synaesthesia is the phenomenon where a sensory stimulus produces an automatic and involuntary reaction in a different sensation. In this study, people who would see colours upon hearing words were studied to see if the colour reaction could be traced to a specific cortical area. fMRI results showed that the left fusiform gyrus, an area consistent with V4, was activated when the subjects spoke. They also found a simultaneous activation of V4α. Interestingly, there was little activity in <b>areas</b> <b>V1</b> and V2. These results validated the existence of the V4-complex in humans as an area specialized for colour vision.|$|R
5000|$|A {{recent study}} found that a young woman with a {{unilateral}} lesion of <b>area</b> <b>V1</b> could scale her grasping movement as she reached out to pick up objects of different sizes placed in her blind field, even though she could not report the sizes of the objects. Similarly, another patient with unilateral lesion of <b>area</b> <b>V1</b> could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field. [...] Even though he avoided the obstacles, he never reported seeing them.|$|E
5000|$|The Murray, et al. (2006) {{observers}} viewed a flat {{picture with}} two disks that subtended the same visual angle θ and formed retinal {{images of the}} same size (R), but the perceived angular size, θ′, for one disk was larger than θ′ for the other (say, 17% larger) due to differences in their background patterns. And, in cortical <b>Area</b> <b>V1,</b> the sizes of the activity patterns related to the disks were unequal, {{despite the fact that the}} retinal images were the same size. The difference between these [...] "cortical sizes" [...] in <b>Area</b> <b>V1</b> for the illusion disks was essentially the same as the difference produced by two non-illusory disks whose retinal image sizes differed by, say, 17%.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{theories}} for {{the explanation of}} blindsight. The first states that after damage to <b>area</b> <b>V1,</b> other branches of the optic nerve deliver visual information to the superior colliculus and several other areas, including parts of the cerebral cortex. In turn, these areas might then control the blindsight responses.|$|E
50|$|It seems {{possible}} that visual zombie modes in the cortex mainly use the dorsal stream in the parietal region. However, parietal activity can affect consciousness by producing attentional {{effects on the}} ventral stream, at least under some circumstances. The conscious mode for vision depends largely on the early visual <b>areas</b> (beyond <b>V1)</b> and especially on the ventral stream.|$|R

50|$|Visual {{information}} {{coming from the}} eye goes through the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus and then reaches the visual cortex. The part of the visual cortex that receives the sensory inputs from the thalamus is the primary visual cortex, also known as visual <b>area</b> 1 (<b>V1),</b> and the striate cortex. The extrastriate areas consist of visual areas 2 (V2), 3 (V3), 4 (V4), and 5 (V5).|$|R

5000|$|In a study {{conducted}} in primates, after partial ablation of visual <b>area</b> <b>V1,</b> visual areas V2 and V3 were still excited by visual stimulus.

50|$|Komatsu {{and colleagues}} {{recorded}} activity of {{cells of the}} blind spot representation in monkey striate cortex (<b>area</b> <b>V1)</b> and found some cells, in layers 4-6, that responded to large stimuli covering the blind spot (the condition under which filling-in is perceived), but not to small stimuli near the blind spot. A neuronal circuitry seems to exist that elaborates and transmits colour and brightness information through the blind region.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biological}} {{foundation of}} the mind's eye is not fully understood. Studies using fMRI [...] {{have shown that the}} lateral geniculate nucleus and the <b>V1</b> <b>area</b> of the visual cortex are activated during mental imagery tasks. Ratey writes: ...|$|R
50|$|This {{physiological}} {{change was}} paralleled by dramatic anatomical changes. The layers representing the deprived {{eye in the}} lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus are atrophied. In V1, ocular dominance columns representing the open eye are dramatically enlarged, {{at the expense of}} cortical surface area representing the sutured eye (Fig. 1 - Effect of monocular deprivation on ocular dominance columns. Light <b>areas</b> represent <b>V1</b> neurons receiving input from an eye which has been injected with radioactive amino acid. Dark areas represent neurons receiving input from the other, noninjected, eye. Image A represents normal ocular dominance columns; Image B represents ocular dominance columns after monocular deprivation). These results were confirmed in the monkey.|$|R
50|$|V1, {{also known}} as the primary visual cortex, is located in Brodmann <b>area</b> 17. <b>V1</b> is known for its {{pre-processing}} capabilities of visual information; however, it is no longer considered the only perceptually effective gateway to the cortex. Motion information can reach V5 without passing through V1 and a return input from V5 to V1 is not required for seeing simple visual motion. Motion-related signals arrive at V1 (60-70 ms) and V5 (< 30 ms) at different times, with V5 acting independently of V1. Patients with blindsight have damage to V1, but because V5 is intact, they can still sense motion. Inactivating V1 limits motion vision, but does not stop it completely.|$|R
5000|$|This model {{proposes that}} {{backward}} masking {{is caused by}} an interference with feedback from higher visual areas. [...] In this model, target duration is irrelevant because masking is supposed to occur {{as a function of}} feedback, which is generated when the target appears on screen. Lamme’s group further supported their model when they described that the surgical removal of the extrastriate cortex in monkeys leads to a reduction of <b>area</b> <b>V1</b> late responses.|$|E
50|$|Experiments in {{neurophysiology}} {{from different}} laboratories showed that fixational eye movements, particularly microsaccades, strongly modulate {{the activity of}} neurons in the visual areas of the macaque brain. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1), microsaccades can move astationary stimulus {{in and out of}} a neuron's receptive field, thereby producing transient neural responses. Microsaccades might account for much of the response variability of neurons in visual <b>area</b> <b>V1</b> of the awake monkey.|$|E
50|$|Cognitively speaking, certain {{cognitive}} processes, such as fast reactions or quick visual identification, {{are considered}} bottom-up processes because they rely primarily on sensory information, whereas {{processes such as}} motor control and directed attention are considered top-down because they are goal directed.

Other areas, such as the fusiform gyrus have inputs from higher brain areas and are considered to have top-down influence.|$|E
5000|$|The {{biological}} {{foundation of}} the mind's eye is not fully understood.

Ratey writes:The visual pathway is not a one-way street. Higher areas of the brain can also send visual input back to neurons in lower areas of the visual cortex. ... As humans, {{we have the ability to}} see with the mind's eye - to have a perceptual experience in the absence of visual input. For example, PET scans have shown that when subjects, seated in a room, imagine they are at their front door starting to walk either to the left or right, activation begins in the visual association cortex, the parietal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex - all higher cognitive processing centers of the brain.|$|R
50|$|Retinotopic maps in {{cortical}} <b>areas</b> {{other than}} <b>V1</b> are typically more complex, {{in the sense}} that adjacent points of the visual field are not always represented in adjacent regions of the same area. For example, in the second visual area (V2), the map is divided along an imaginary horizontal line across the visual field, {{in such a way that}} the parts of the retina that respond to the upper half of the visual field are represented in cortical tissue that is separated from those parts that respond the lower half of the visual field. Even more complex maps exist in the third and fourth visual areas V3 and V4, and in the dorsomedial area (V6). In general, these complex maps are referred to as second-order representations of the visual field, as opposed to first-order (continuous) representations such as V1. Additional retinotopic regions include ventral occipital (VO-1, VO-2), lateral occipital (LO-1, LO-2), dorsal occipital (V3A, V3B), and posterior parietal cortex (IPS0, IPS1, IPS2, IPS3, IPS4).|$|R
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: An {{ancillary}} phase II {{study was}} conducted to study interindividual variability in cetuximab pharmacokinetics and its influence on progression-free survival (PFS) in metastatic colorectal cancer patients cotreated with irinotecan and 5 -fluorouracil. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ninety-six patients received cetuximab as an infusion loading dose of 400 mg/m(2) followed by weekly infusions of 250 mg/m(2). Doses of irinotecan and 5 -fluorouracil were adjusted individually. Cetuximab concentrations were measured by ELISA. Compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by a population approach, and PFS was analyzed using a Cox model. RESULTS: Cetuximab pharmacokinetics was best described using a two-compartment model with both first-order and saturable (zero-order) elimination. Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters (% standard error) were as follows: central volume of distribution V(1) = 2. 96 L (4 %), peripheral volume of distribution V(2) = 4. 65 L (6 %), elimination clearance CL = 0. 497 L/d (4 %), distribution clearance Q = 0. 836 L/d (8 %), and zero-order elimination rate k(0) = 8. 71 mg/d (10 %). Body surface <b>area</b> influenced <b>V(1),</b> V(2), and k(0). Pretreatment serum albumin influenced CL. Risk of disease progression decreased with cetuximab global clearance (cumulative dose/cumulative area under the concentration versus time curve; P = 0. 00016). Median PFS of patients with a cetuximab residual concentration on day 14 below median value was 3. 3 months as compared with 7. 8 months for the other patients (P = 0. 004). CONCLUSIONS: Cetuximab pharmacokinetics in colorectal cancer patients can be described using a model combining linear and nonlinear elimination rates. PFS is influenced by global clearance of cetuximab, a parameter that can be estimated using cetuximab residual concentration on day 14...|$|R

25|$|Much of the {{confusion}} concerning modularity exists in neuroscience because there is evidence for specific areas (e.g. V4 or V5/hMT+) and the concomitant behavioral deficits following brain insult (thus taken as evidence for modularity). In addition, evidence shows other areas are involved and that these areas subserve processing of multiple properties (e.g. V1) (thus taken as evidence against modularity). That these streams have the same implementation in early visual <b>areas,</b> like <b>V1,</b> is not inconsistent with a modular viewpoint: to adopt the canonical analogy in cognition, {{it is possible for}} different software to run on the same hardware. A consideration of psychophysics and neuropsychological data would suggest support for this. For example, psychophysics has shown that percepts for different properties are realized asynchronously. In addition, although achromats experience other cognitive defects they do not have motion deficits when their lesion is restricted to V4, or total loss of form perception. Relatedly, Zihl and colleagues' akinetopsia patient shows no deficit to color or object perception (although deriving depth and structure from motion is problematic, see above) and object agnostics do not have damaged motion or color perception, making the three disorders triply dissociable. Taken together this evidence suggests that even though distinct properties may employ the same early visual areas they are functionally independent. Furthermore, that the intensity of subjective perceptual experience (e.g. color) correlates with activity in these specific areas (e.g. V4), the recent evidence that synaesthetes show V4 activation during the perceptual experience of color, as well as the fact that damage to these areas results in concomitant behavioral deficits (the processing may be occurring but perceivers {{do not have access to}} the information) are all evidence for visual modularity.|$|R

Calculation of {{the ratio of the}} integrated <b>areas</b> under the <b>v(1),</b> v(3) phosphate and Amide I peaks, as a function of changing distance from the centre of the osteon, was used as an index of the relative mineral to matrix presence at each site of micro-FT-IR spectroscopic analysis. The ratio of the integrated areas under the v(2) carbonate and v(1), v(3) phosphate peaks, as a function of changing distance from the centre of the osteon was used as an index of the relative carbonate to phosphate groups presence at each site of analysis. Both ratios were found to consistently increase with increasing distance from the centre of the osteon, for all osteons examined. In some fresh osteons, a peak near 1125 cm(- 1), characteristic of newly precipitated apatites (PO 43 -) was identified {{for the first time in}} the FT-IR spectra obtained from the inner lamellae of each Haversian system.

5000|$|The Fokker V.1 {{principal}} innovation was its unbraced cantilever wings. These {{were built}} around a pair of wooden box-girders, {{the upper and lower}} members of which were built up from several thin strips of pine, with connecting webs of birch plywood. The entire wing was covered in plywood, an innovation probably suggested to Fokker by a Swedish aeronautical engineer, Villehad Forssman, who had previously designed one of Germany's earliest multi-engined military aircraft; the V.1 upper wing's smooth surface, thick airfoil and tapered planform gave it a remarkably modern appearance. The depth of spar needed for adequate strength necessitated a wing whose root thickness was around 20% of the chord, in contrast to a typical value of around 6% for aircraft of the period and 12 to 15% for modern aircraft of comparable performance. The spars of the upper wing were parallel but those of the lower wing converged to meet at the wingtips. The intention of this was to provide a well for the fitting of a retractable undercarriage at a later date. Ailerons were fitted to the upper wing only and these were unusual in that the entire wing-tip being a separate component, and was pivoted, much like the French Blériot VIII of 1908 had done, to provide a control surface. To further Platz's desire for an aerodynamically clean aircraft, all control actuators were buried within the wing, so that there were no drag-creating control horns. The upper wing was mounted on a system of cabane struts consisting of a pair of tubular steel tripods between the fuselage and mainspar and a pair of steel struts connected to the aft spar, all basically similar to the cabane strut design for the later, likewise Platz-designed Fokker D.VI and Fokker D.VII biplane descendents — each of which also used one [...] "N-pattern" [...] interplane strut set per side — and the Fokker D.VIII parasol-wing monoplane descendent of the V.1. Unlike the later D.VI and D.VII, there were no interplane struts on the outer <b>areas</b> of the <b>V.1's</b> wing panels. Since Platz was using a novel and thick aerofoil, much like the contemporary cantilever-winged Junkers J 1 all-metal monoplane pioneered nearly a year earlier, he was unsure about the correct incidence for the wing with respect to the fuselage. Lacking a wind tunnel, he therefore made it adjustable during flight.|$|R
