Ultraviolet light degrades the synthetic materials of the skirt and frame. A well-maintained mask should last for several years.

Google Earth was released for Android on February 22, 2010, and on iOS on October 27, 2008. The mobile versions of Google Earth can make use of multi-touch interfaces to move on the globe, zoom or rotate the view, <b>and</b> <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> select the current location. An automotive version of Google Earth was made available in the 2010 Audi A8.|$|E

2500|$|The {{greatest}} {{benefit of}} PET scanning is that different compounds can show blood flow and oxygen and glucose metabolism in the tissues {{of the working}} brain. [...] These measurements reflect the amount of brain activity in the various regions of the brain <b>and</b> <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> learn more about how the brain works. [...] PET scans were superior to all other metabolic imaging methods in terms of resolution and speed of completion (as little as 30 seconds), when they first became available. [...] The improved resolution permitted better study to be made as {{to the area of}} the brain activated by a particular task. The biggest drawback of PET scanning is that because the radioactivity decays rapidly, it is limited to monitoring short tasks. [...] Before fMRI technology came online, PET scanning was the preferred method of functional (as opposed to structural) brain imaging, and it continues to make large contributions to neuroscience.|$|E

60|$|I {{can thus}} put the pipe into the suds, and blow bubbles {{by means of}} the hydrogen. You observe how the bubbles fall {{downwards}} when I blow them with my warm breath; but notice the difference when I blow them with hydrogen. [The Lecturer here blew bubbles with hydrogen, which rose to the roof of the theatre.] It shews you how light this gas must be in order to carry with it not merely the ordinary soap-bubble, but the larger portion of a drop hanging to the bottom of it. I can shew its lightness in a better way than this; larger bubbles than these may be so lifted up; indeed, in former times balloons used to be filled with this gas. Mr. Anderson will fasten this tube on to our generator, and we shall have a stream of hydrogen here with which we can charge this balloon made of collodion. I need not even be very careful to get all the air out, for I know the power of this gas to carry it up. [Two collodion balloons were inflated, and sent up, one being held by a string.] Here is another larger one made of thin membrane, which we will fill <b>and</b> <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> ascend. You will see they will all remain floating about until the gas escapes.|$|E
60|$|To Laupepa's opposition, {{as shown}} {{in the case of the}} Lauati scheme, no dweller in Samoa will give weight, for they know him to be as putty in the hands of his advisers. It may be right, it may be wrong, but we are many of us driven to the {{conclusion}} that the stumbling-block is Fangalii, and that the memorial of that affair shadows appropriately the house of a king who reigns in right of it. If this be all, it should not trouble us long. Germany has shown she can be generous; it now remains for her only to forget a natural but certainly ill-grounded prejudice, <b>and</b> <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> him, who was sole king before the plenipotentiaries assembled, and who would be sole king to-morrow if the Berlin Act could be rescinded, a fitting share of rule. The future of Samoa should lie thus in the hands of a single man, on whom the eyes of Europe are already fixed. Great concerns press on his attention; the Samoan group, in his view, is but as a grain of dust; and the country where he reigns has bled on too many august scenes of victory to remember for ever a blundering skirmish in the plantation of Vailele. It is to him--to the sovereign of the wise Stuebel and the loyal Brandeis,--that I make my appeal.|$|E
6000|$|In {{spite of}} Galitzin's blunders, the Turk War {{is going on}} at a fine rate in these months; Turks, by the hundred thousand, getting {{scattered}} in panic rout:--but we will say nothing of it just yet. Polish Confederation--horror-struck, as may be imagined, at its auxiliary Brother of the Sun and Moon and his performances--is weltering in violently impotent spasms into deeper and ever deeper wretchedness, Friedrich sometimes thinking of a Burlesque Poem on the subject;--though the Russian successes, and the Austrian grudgings and gloomings, are rising on him as a very serious consideration. [...] "Is there no method, then, of allowing Russia to prosecute its Turk War in spite of Austria and its umbrages?" [...] thinks Friedrich sometimes, in his anxieties about Peace in Europe:--"If the Ukraine, and its meal for the Armies, were but Russia's! At present, Austria can strike in there, cut off the provisions, and at once put a spoke in Russia's wheel." [...] Friedrich tells us, [...] "he (ON," [...] the King himself, what I do not find in any other Book) [...] "sent to Petersburg, {{under the name of}} Count Lynar, the seraphic Danish Gentleman, who, in 1757, had brought about the Convention of Kloster-Zeven, a Project, or Sketch of Plan, for Partitioning certain Provinces of Poland, in that view;"--the Lynar opining, so far as I can see, somewhat as follows: [...] "Russia to lay hold of the essential bit of Polish Territory for provisioning itself against the Turk, <b>and</b> <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> Austria and Prussia certain other bits; which would content everybody, and enable Russia and Christendom to extrude and suppress AD LIBITUM that abominable mass of Mahometan Sensualism, Darkness and Fanaticism from the fairest part of God's Creation." [...] An excellent Project, though not successful! [...] "To which Petersburg, intoxicated with its own outlooks on Turkey, paid not the least attention," [...] says the King. [OEuvres de Frederic, vi. 26.] He gives no date to this curious statement; nor does anybody else mention it at all; but we may fancy it to have been of Winter, 1769-1770,--and leave it with the curious, or the idly curious, since nothing came of it now or afterwards.|$|E

6000|$|We {{have tried}} to teach the {{beginner}} how to keep his books neat and clean; what men and monsters he should avoid; how he should guard himself against borrowers, book-worms, damp, and dirt. But we are sometimes compelled to buy books already dirty and dingy, foxed, or spotted with red, worn by greasy hands, stained with ink spots, or covered with MS. notes. The art of man has found a remedy for these defects. I have never myself tried to wash a book, and this care is best left to professional hands. But the French and English writers give various recipes for cleaning old books, which the amateur may try on any old rubbish out of the fourpenny box of a bookstall, till he finds that he can trust his own manipulations. There are [...] "fat stains" [...] on books, as thumb marks, traces of oil (the midnight oil), flakes of old pasty crust left in old Shakespeares, and candle drippings. There are [...] "thin stains," [...] as of mud, scaling-wax, ink, dust, and damp. To clean a book you first carefully unbind it, take off the old covers, cut the old stitching, and separate sheet from sheet. Then take a page with [...] "fat stains" [...] {{of any kind of}} grease (except finger-marks), pass a hot flat iron over it, and press on it a clean piece of blotting paper till the paper sucks up the grease. Then charge a camel-hair brush with heated turpentine, and pass it over the places that were stained. If the paper loses its colour press softly over it a delicate handkerchief, soaked in heated spirits of wine. Finger-marks you will cover with clean soap, leave this on for some hours, and then rub with a sponge filled with hot water. Afterwards dip in weak acid and water, and then soak the page in a bath of clean water. Ink-stained pages you will first dip in a strong solution of oxalic acid and then in hydrochloric acid mixed in six times its quantity of water. Then bathe in clean water <b>and</b> <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> dry slowly.|$|E
