30|$|The voltage versus {{capacity}} spectroscopy of the Si <b>anode</b> <b>battery</b> with a conductive mixture (graphite/Super P carbon black/VGCF[*]=[*] 1 : 1 : 1) and electrolyte additives (FEC) {{is depicted}} in Fig.  5 b. The initial voltage is about 1.0  V, which is relatively {{lower than that of}} the common value (about 3.0  V) because of the electrochemical prelithiation before cycling. This process helps form a stable SEI before cycling and provides an effective channel for Li ions. Consequently, the reversible capacity in the first cycle is promoted. The high CE in the first cycle is especially beneficial to whole cell with limited Li ions. The curve slightly changes from the 2 nd cycle to the 200 th cycle, thereby indicating the significant stability of the anode material. The long plateau assures a stable voltage output.|$|E

40|$|This report {{contains}} a {{life cycle assessment}} of 10 Ah lithium battery cells with metallic lithium in the anode. It was performed {{in the context of}} the Swedish TriLi - Longlife lithium electrodes for EV and HEV batteries - project. The cells have been analyzed from cradle to grave, i. e., from raw material production over own manufacturing, use in three different vehicles: Nissan Leaf, Tesla model S and a Volvo bus; and end-of-life. The study aims to highlight environmental hotspots with lithium batteries with metallic lithium in the anode in order to improve them as well as to investigate environmental benefits with such lithium batteries in different vehicles. Battery cells with metallic lithium in the anode and LFP and NMC chemistry were compared to the original vehicle batteries. In short, the study points towards the following conclusions:  Both the LFP and NMC lithium metal <b>anode</b> <b>battery</b> cells shows lower climate impact potential, lower abiotic depletion potential and lower toxicity potential than the original NMC and NCA cells with copper anodes. The main reason for the difference is higher energy density which gives lower weight and thus lower electricity consumption. However, the lower carbon footprint of the metal anode cells rests on the assumption that they last as many cycles as the original NMC and NCA, something which has not yet been proven.  For the same reason (higher energy density) the NMC chemistry shows lower environmental impacts per vehicle kilometre than the LFP chemistry for the metal <b>anode</b> <b>battery</b> cells, but here the difference is much smaller and probably within error margins.  Assembly energy is a main driver for climate impact. Sensitivity calculations with Swedish average electricity mix for production of the cells show that production impacts can be reduced by 25 % by producing in Sweden, compared to global average production. the Swedish TriLi - Longlife lithium electrodes for EV and HEV batteries - project...|$|E

40|$|Rechargeable {{batteries}} {{based on}} lithium (sodium) metal anodes have been attracting increasing attention {{due to their}} high capacity and energy density, but the implementation of lithium (sodium) metal anode still faces many challenges, such as low Coulombic efficiency and dendrites growth. Layered materials have been used experimentally as protective films (PFs) to address these issues. In this work, the authors explore using first-principles computations the key factors that determine the properties and feasibility of various 2 D layered PFs, including the defect pattern, crystalline structure, bond length, and metal proximity effect, and perform the simulations on both aspects of Li+ (Na+) ion diffusion property and mechanical stability. It is found that the introduction of defect, the increase in bond length, and the proximity effect by metal can accelerate the transfer of Li+ (Na+) ion and improve the ionic conductivity, {{but all of them}} make negative influences on the stiffness of materials against the suppression of dendrite growth and weaken both critical strains and critical stress.

40|$|In this paper, the {{performances}} of various lithium-ion chemistries for use in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles have been investigated and compared to several other rechargeable energy storage systems technologies such as lead-acid, nickel-metal hydride and electrical-double layer capacitors. The analysis has shown the beneficial properties of lithium-ion {{in the terms of}} energy density, power density and rate capabilities. Particularly, the nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathode stands out with the high energy density up to 160 Wh/kg, compared to 70 – 110, 90 and 71 Wh/kg for lithium iron phosphate cathode, lithium nickel cobalt aluminum cathode and, lithium titanate oxide <b>anode</b> <b>battery</b> cells, respectively. These values are considerably higher than the lead-acid (23 – 28 Wh/kg) and nickel-metal hydride (44 – 53 Wh/kg) battery technologies. The dynamic discharge performance test shows that the energy efficiency of the lithium-ion batteries is significantly higher than the lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride technologies. The efficiency varies between 86 % and 98 %, with the best values obtained by pouch battery cells, ahead of cylindrical and prismatic battery design concepts. Also the power capacity of lithium-ion technology is superior compared to other technologies. The power density is in the range of 300 – 2400 W/kg against 200 – 400 and 90 – 120 W/kg for lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride, respectively. However, considering the influence of energy efficiency, the power density is in the range of 100 – 1150 W/kg. Lithium-ion batteries optimized for high energy are {{at the lower end of}} this range and are challenged to meet the United States Advanced Battery Consortium, SuperLIB and Massachusetts Institute of Technology goals. Their association with electric-double layer capacitors, which have low energy density (4 – 6 Wh/kg) but outstanding power capabilities, could be very interesting. The study of the rate capability of the lithium-ion batteries has allowed for a new state of charge estimation, encompassing all essential performance parameters. The rate capabilities tests are reflected by Peukert constants, which are significantly lower for lithium-ion batteries than for nickel-metal hydride and lead-acid. Furthermore, rate capabilities during charging have been investigated. Lithium-ion batteries are able to store about 80 % of the capacity at current rate 2 It, with high power cells accepting over 90 %. At higher charging rates of 5 It or more, the internal resistance impedes charge acceptance by high energy cells. The lithium titanate anode, due to its high surface area (100 m 2 /g compared to 3 m 2 /g for the graphite based anode) performs much better in this respect. The behavior of lithium-ion batteries has been investigated at different conditions. The analysis has leaded us to a new lithium ion battery model. This model will be compared to existing battery models in future research contributions...|$|E

Using this approach, we have fabricated a composite SnO 2 /MXene <b>anode</b> for Li-ion <b>battery</b> applications. The SnO 2 /MXene anode exploits the high Li-ion capacity offered by SnO 2, while maintaining the structural and mechanical integrity by the conductive MXene platform. The atomic layer deposition (ALD) conditions used to deposit SnO 2 on MXene terminated with oxygen, fluorine, and hydroxyl-groups {{were found to be}} critical for preventing MXene degradation during ALD. We demonstrate that SnO 2 /MXene electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance as Li-ion <b>battery</b> <b>anodes,</b> where conductive MXene sheets act to buffer the volume changes associated with lithiation and delithiation of SnO 2.
