40|$|Starting {{from the}} basic Fredholm {{integral}} equations, a surface vorticity theory is {{developed for the}} prediction of <b>annular</b> <b>aerofoil</b> performance in three-dimensional flow. A mathematical model is proposed for the general case of the axisymmetric body in non-axisymmetric flow, using a Fourier series to represent circumferential variations in bound vorticity strength. Using the pure incidence case as an example, it is indicated how an economical solution of the flow may be arrived at by use of a digital computer. The theoretical pressure distributions obtained are compared {{with the results of}} wind-tunnel tests on an <b>annular</b> <b>aerofoil</b> model. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} written in FORTRAN to calculate the pressure distribution on an <b>annular</b> <b>aerofoil</b> at zero angle of incidence at subsonic speed. The theory and the program are described and some comparisons between the predicted pressure distribution and experimental results are presented. Close agreement between theory and experiment is obtained...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] A {{method of}} calculating the {{velocity}} distribution in incompressible flow on <b>annular</b> <b>aerofoils</b> of moderate thickness/chord ratio and camber, and reasonably large radius/chord ratio (the order of 1 or greater), is developed, {{based on the}} use of distributions of singularities on a cylinder whose velocity fields are tabulated here and in Ref. 1. The annular wing at zero incidence is treated first, and then the wing at incidence. Examples of the calculated velocity distributions on various aerofoils are given. 1. Introduction. [...] <b>Annular</b> <b>aerofoils</b> are cylindrical fairings whose streamwise section is an aerofoil profile; they can be used as fairings for various types of propulsive systems, e. g., propellers and turbojet engines. Their usual function is to increase the efficiency of such systems by increasing the mass flow through the system for a given power input. Other designs of annular fairings can b...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the drag and pressure measurements made in subsonic wind-tunnel tests on two <b>annular</b> <b>aerofoils</b> is described, The relation between the design pressure distribution in incompressible flow and the pressure distribution on the aerofoil at high speed, is discussed. An attempt has also been made to see what changes in the flow field {{are associated with the}} drag rise and whether the drag-rise Mach number can be predicted by methods similar to those used for ordinary aerofoils and bodies of revolution. A comparison has been made of the measurements on a two-dimensional <b>aerofoil</b> and the <b>annular</b> aerofoils; no significant differences in the structure of local regions of supersonic flow were found a...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{results of}} a series of wind tunnel tests {{involving}} velocity, surface pressure and force measurements on six <b>annular</b> <b>aerofoils</b> are presented together with details of the design procedure which was based on that given by Kiichemann and Weber 1. It is shown that theoretical predictions agreed well with experimental results when the foils were in the design condition, i. e. uniform inflow at zero incidence. Pressure, lift and drag measurements were also made on the foils at incidence, and the results differed somewhat from predictions of lifting surface theory. Three foils were further tested with concentric centre-bodies and three others in an axisymmetric inflow; in both cases the theoretical prediction...|$|R
