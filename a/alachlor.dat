25|$|Many {{pesticides}} can {{be grouped}} into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, {{and other related}} compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, {{but they have been}} phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate. Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates. Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., atrazine), ureas (e.g., diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., <b>alachlor).</b> Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system. Triazines interfere with photosynthesis. Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Alachlor</b> {{exhibits}} moderate sorption in soil, {{ranging from}} 43-209 mL/g. Photodegradation {{is a minor}} contributor to <b>alachlor</b> fate. Degradation in soil appears to be largely biologically mediated, and produces multiple metabolites. The half life in aerobic soil ranges from about 6 to 15 days and is considerably shorter under anaerobic conditions. One {{possible explanation for the}} short anaerobic half life is the observation that <b>alachlor</b> is rapidly transformed under anoxia to up to 14 degradation products in the presence of iron-bearing ferruginous smectites. The iron in such minerals can be used by certain soil bacteria as an electron acceptor when soils are flooded, thus the process of herbicide transformation by reduced clay is thought to be microbially mediated.

5000|$|The {{genes for}} enzymes AtzA-C {{have been found}} to be highly conserved in atrazine-degrading organisms worldwide. In Pseudomonas sp.

The {{insertion}} elements flanking each gene suggest that they are involved in the assembly of this specialized catabolic pathway. Two options exist for degradation of atrazine using microbes, bioaugmentation or biostimulation. Recent research suggests that microbial adaptation to atrazine has occurred in some fields where the herbicide is used repetitively, resulting in more rapid biodegradation. Like the herbicides trifluralin and <b>alachlor,</b> atrazine is susceptible to rapid transformation in the presence of reduced iron-bearing soil clays, such as ferruginous smectites.

5000|$|The {{development}} of glyphosate-tolerant (Roundup Ready) plants changed the herbicide use profile away from more persistent, higher toxicity herbicides, such as atrazine, metribuzin and <b>alachlor,</b> {{and reduced the}} volume and harm of herbicide runoff. A study by Chuck Benbrook concluded that the spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds had increased US herbicide use. That study cited a 23% increase (.3 kilograms/hectare) for soybeans from 1996-2006, a 43% (.9 kg/ha) increase for cotton from 1996-2010 and a 16% (.5 kg/ha) decrease for corn from 1996-2010. However, this study came under scrutiny because Benbrook did not {{consider the fact that}} glyphosate is less toxic than other herbicides, thus net toxicity may decrease even as use increases. Graham Brookes accused Benbrook of subjective herbicide estimates because his data, provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service, does not distinguish between genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops. Brookes had earlier published a study that found that the use of biotech crops had reduced the volume and environmental impact of herbicide and other pesticides, which contradicted Benbrook.

40|$|Abstract approved: The chloroacetanilide {{herbicide}} <b>alachlor</b> is {{the second}} most widely used herbicide in the US, where it is used on major crops such as corn and soybean. Although <b>alachlor</b> is mineralized slowly in soil, metabolites of <b>alachlor</b> have been found in soil indicating that <b>alachlor</b> is subject to chemical or biological transformation. A water-soluble, non-carcinogenic metabolite of <b>alachlor,</b> 2 -[(2, 6 -diethlyphenyl) (methoxymethyl) amino]- 2 -oxoethane-sulfonic acid (ESA), has been detected in groundwater.

Soil microorganisms are primarily responsible for conversion and migration of <b>alachlor</b> in natural environment, but knowledge concerning <b>alachlor</b> biodegradation is not complete. Therefore, we studied the ability of Paecilomyces marquandii, soil fungus tolerant to heavy metals, to eliminate <b>alachlor</b> and proposed a new pathway of its transformation. After 7 days of incubation only 3. 3 % of <b>alachlor</b> was detected from an initial concentration 50 mg L- 1 and 20. 1 % from a concentration 100 mg L- 1. The qualitative IDA LC-MS analysis showed the presence of ten metabolites. All of them were dechlorinated mainly through oxidation, but also reductive dechlorination was observed. The main route of <b>alachlor</b> conversion progressed via N-acetyl oxidation resulting {{in the formation of}} mono-, di- and trihydroxylated byproducts.

In other studies, technical <b>alachlor</b> {{as well as the}} emulsifiable concentrate formulation of the chemical were used to investigate the effect of several factors on the toxicity of the herbicide. Corn and oats absorbed alachor primarily in a passive way. The uptake of the herbicide in both species was slightly reduced in the presence of metabolic inhibitors. The reduction was somewhat stronger in corn than in oats. A raise in temperature increased the uptake of <b>alachlor</b> only slightly. Q₁₀ values of about 1. 2 were found. The part of the total uptake affected by metabolic inhibitors followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics over the <b>alachlor</b> concentration range of 0. 1 mM to 0. 5 mM. Uptake of <b>alachlor</b> was measured in the presence of an analog, propachlor. Propachlor reduced the uptake of <b>alachlor</b> at a concentra- tion of 0. 3 mM for both chemicals. At a concentration of 0. 03 mM for each herbicide <b>alachlor</b> uptake was less reduced. Total uptake by corn and oats was nearly identical up to a concentration of 0. 1 mM. At higher concentrations <b>alachlor</b> absorption by oats was about twice as high as by corn. This would suggest that selective uptake by the two species could at least partly account for the difference in tolerance towards <b>alachlor.</b> A study was conducted to determine if P, K and Ca levels in oat plants were affected by <b>alachlor</b> treatment. P and Ca content was not affected by the presence of <b>alachlor,</b> but a gradual decrease in K level with increasing herbicide concentrations was observed. Uptake of <b>alachlor</b> through the shoot region exceeded absorption by the roots in the two monocotyledonous species, corn and oats. Two dictos, soybean and cucumber, absorbed higher amounts of the herbicide through the roots. Shoot exposure of corn and cucumber was most damaging to the plant, while root exposure was more damaging to oats and soybean. The effect of <b>alachlor</b> on the growth of oats and cucumber at various levels of sub-irrigation and carrier volume could be explained on the basis of differences in effective absorption regions in the plants. Photoperiod had, in contrast with light intensity, no effect on the activity of the herbicide to corn, cucumber and oats. An increase in light intensity up to 1600 ft-c increased the toxicity of <b>alachlor</b> in corn and cucumber, but not in oats.
