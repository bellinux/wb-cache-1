40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we review the world-wide study on micro-motion systems both from an {{academic}} and an industrial perspective. The {{objective of the}} review is {{to answer the following}} questions: (1) What are the limitations of technologies to develop a micro-motion device in terms of function, motion range, accuracy, and speed it can achieve? (2) What is any economic implication of these technologies? (3) What are future research directions? The micro-motion systems considered in this paper are classified into four kinds in terms of their motion ranges: (a) 1000 μm. This review concludes that the PZT <b>actuation</b> <b>element</b> integrated with the compliant mechanism is the most promising technology which can achieve high accuracy (sub-nanometer) of all four kinds of motion ranges. This promise is further based on the amplification technology using the compliant mechanism concept. The amplification mechanism is used to com-pensate the problem with a limited stroke of the PZT <b>actuation</b> <b>element.</b> The compliant amplification mecha-nism allows one to achieve a high resolution and high stiffness motion which does not compromise the loss of accuracy due to motion amplification. The PZT <b>actuation</b> <b>element</b> and the compliant mechanism are both econom-ically viable. Future research direction should generally focus on the interface between the PZT <b>actuation</b> <b>element</b> and compliant mechanism and the reliability of the compliant mechanism under cyclic deformation of com-pliant materials...|$|E

40|$|Micro-motion devices may share {{a common}} {{architecture}} such {{that they have a}} main body of compliant material and some direct actuation elements (e. g., piezoelectric element). The shape of such a compliant material is designed with notches and holes on it, and in this way one portion of the material deforms significantly with respect to other portions of the material – a motion in the conventional sense of the rigid body mechanism. The devices of this kind are called compliant mechanisms. Computer tools for the kinematical and dynamic motion analysis of the compliant mechanism are not well-developed. In this thesis a study is presented towards a finite element approach to the motion analysis of compliant mechanisms. This approach makes it possible to compute the kinematical motion of the compliant mechanism within which the piezoelectric <b>actuation</b> <b>element</b> is embedded, as opposed to those existing approaches where the piezoelectric <b>actuation</b> <b>element</b> is either ignored or overly simplified. Further, the developed approach allows computing the global stiffness and the natural frequency of the compliant mechanism. This thesis also presents a prototype compliant mechanism and a test bed for measuring various behaviors of the prototype mechanism. It is shown that the developed approach can improve the prediction of motions of the compliant mechanism with respect to the existing approaches based on a comparison of the measured result (on the prototype) and the simulated result. The approach to computation of the global stiffness and the natural frequency of the compliant mechanism is validated by comparing it with other known approaches for some simple mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of distributed hydraulic systems in aerospace and other high-tech industries requires {{the development of}} compact high-efficiency hydraulic pumps with high reliability, low weight, and a reduced number of moving parts. This paper presents a compact high-frequency solid-state pump concept ideally suited for incorporation in distributed hydraulic systems. The driving element of this pump is a high-frequency solid-state induced-strain actuator of either piezo-electric or piezo-magnetic characteristics. An essential feature of the proposed pump is the solid-state fluid diode.

However, {{none of them}} is adopted as a general one {{and each of them}} is suggested for some specific purpose. This topic is essential in humanoid robotics, since we firstly need to understand how human moves and acts in order to exploit human movement patterns in robotics and design human like actuators. Simulations in biomechanics are intensively used in research of locomotion, safe human-robot interaction, development of novel robotic actuators, biologically inspired control algorithms, etc. This paper presents two widely adopted muscle models (Hill’s and Huxley’s model), elaborates their features and demonstrates trade-off between their accuracy and efficiency of computer simulations.

Within the R and D-project performed, a variety of technical applications have been determined in the area of piezoelectric actuators. Out of these applications vibration damping of a pantograph for highspeed trans using such piezoelectric actuators has been considered to be of major interest and has therefore been analyzed in more detail. An <b>actuation</b> <b>element</b> was designed and manufactured and finally integrated into a real pantograph. A significant reduction in vibration and thus force amplitudes was measured during laboratory tests. Using that type of technology will therefore allow to use standard pantographs even for speeds beyond 400 km/h.

40|$|The poster was {{presented}} at at SET for Britain in the Parliament 9 th March 2009 ([URL] by Thomas Steffen, representing the six members of staff from the Control Systems Group. This poster is also available at: [URL] the controlled movement and positioning of objects, is an essential function of many technical systems. It is crucial in many applications from central heating to aircrafts, and without actuation, the function or even {{the safety of the}} system would suffers. For example an aircraft is steered using control surfaces, and if the actuation of these surfaces fails, the aircraft may crash. Therefore, actuation is often provided by using several (typically between 2 and 4) redundant <b>actuation</b> <b>elements.</b> If one element fails, another takes over, and harm can be avoided. While this solution works, it involves increased cost, weight and energy use, reducing the efficiency of the system considerable. This project on high redundancy actuation investigates the use of a high number of <b>actuation</b> <b>elements,</b> such as 10 or even 100. This is a bionic (or bio-mimetic) idea: the use of <b>actuation</b> <b>elements</b> is similar to the composition of a muscle from many individual muscle fibres. Just like the muscle is highly resilient to damage in individual fibres (causing sore muscles, but no loss of movement), high redundancy actuation is highly reliable even if several elements have failed. The reliability analysis shows that this approach provides the same level or even superior protection against faults, without the loss of efficiency involved in the traditional solution. The basic advantage is that the law of large numbers applies, which provides a much more accurate prediction of how faults will affect the <b>actuation</b> <b>elements</b> over time. In the aircraft example, this would provide lighter actuators that provide superior reliability, leading to better fuel economy and easier maintenance. The main scientific problem of this project is {{how to deal with the}} complexity of using a high number of elements together. The results show that it is possible to determine the reliability of the system, and it is also possible to control the many elements as if they are just one big actuator. The next phase of the project is dealing with the technological challenges of combining many <b>actuation</b> <b>elements.</b> A simple experiment with four elements has been completed, and a demonstrator with 16 elements is being built. These experiments are used to demonstrate the resilience to faults, and understand the practical control issues at hand. A project leading to a more advanced version with up to 100 elements is currently being prepared. While the developed theories can be extended easily to consider such configurations, the practical difficulties of designing and manufacturing such a solution are challenging.

40|$|In {{machine tools}} several time and {{position}} varying heat sources causes complex temperature distributions. The resulting problems are varying thermal deformations which cause {{a loss of}} accuracy as well as non optimal drive conditions. An option {{to deal with that}} issue is to use structure integrated SM-actuators which use the thermal energy accumulated by machining processes to yield an actuator displacement. That creates a structure inherent control loop. There the shape-memory-elements work as sensing element as well as <b>actuation</b> <b>element.</b> The plant is defined by the thermal and mechanical behaviour of the surrounding structure. Because of the closed loop operation mode, the mechanical design has to deal with questions of stability and parameter adjustment in a control sense. In contrast to common control arrangements this issues can only be influenced by designing the actuator and the structure. To investigate this approach a test bench has been designed. The heat is yielded by a clutch and directed through the structure to the shape memory element. The force and displacement of the actuator are therefore driven directly by process heat. This paper presents a broad mechanical design approach of the test bench as well as the design of the SMactuator. To investigate the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the structure-integrated actuator, a model of the test bench has been developed. The model covers the thermal behaviour of the test bench as well as the thermo-mechanical couplings of the shape memory actuator. The model has been validated by comprehensive measurements...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{critical}} design considerations in dynamic microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices is the structural natural frequency of the sensing or <b>actuation</b> <b>element.</b> Most dynamic MEMS devices employ planar geometry using an assembly of beams and plates for the structural elements. Most often {{the goal is to}} place the first resonant frequency at a desired value. Since the frequency depends on mass and stiffness of the structure, designing for frequency usually requires FEM analysis of the structure. FEM calculations are intensive, depend on many subtle modeling assumptions, and require huge number of simulations to build intuition. Since the design space for such structures is fairly high dimensional, tuning the frequency of the first-cut design can be a fairly intensive optimization computation. Here, we present a lumped parameter spring-mass model for a typical microstructure consisting of a plate and beams and show how the higher dimensional geometric design space can be partitioned to effect desired frequency changes in the structure linearly with the chosen design variables. In particular, four sets of design variables are considered and their effective range and sensitivity for linear tuning of the natural frequency is presented. We include the effect of residual stress on stiffness and show how the values of residual stress affect the tuning of the natural frequency with respect to the selected design variables. All results are compared with FEM calculations and a table is presented for cross comparison of efficacy of the different design variables. The goal is to present a simple analysis that can be easily followed by MEMS designers with any background and build their intuition for such designs...|$|E

40|$|Actuator {{concepts}} utilizing NiMnGa, ferromagnetic {{shape memory}} alloy are investigated for potential use on a smart rotor for trailing edge flap actuation. With their high energy density, large dynamic stroke, and wide operating bandwidth, ferromagnetic {{shape memory alloy}}s (FSMA) like NiMnGa, seem like attractive candidates for smart rotor actuators, potentially able {{to fulfill the requirements}} for both primary rotor control and vibration suppression. However, because of the recent discovery of the material, current experimental data and analytical tools are limited. To rectify these shortcomings, an extensive set of detailed experiments were conducted on samples of NiMnGa to characterize the response of the alloy {{for a wide variety of}} mechanical and magnetic loading conditions. Measurements of the material performance parameters such as power density, damping properties, magneto-mechanical coupling, and transduction efficiency were included. Once characterized, the experimental data were used to develop a series of analytical tools to predict the behavior of the material. A model, developed in parallel to thermal shape memory alloy models is proposed to predict the quasi-static stress-strain behavior. A simple, low frequency, parameter based model was also developed to predict the alloy's dynamic strain response. A method for developing conceptual actuators utilizing NiMnGa as the <b>actuation</b> <b>element</b> was proposed. This approach incorporates experimental data into a process that down-selects a series of possible actuator configurations to obtain a single configuration optimized for volumetric and weight considerations. The proposed actuator was designed to deliver 2 mm of stroke and 60 N of force at an actuation frequency of 50 Hz. However, to generate the 1. 0 T magnetic field, the actuator mass was determined to be 2. 8 kg and required a minimum of 320 Watts of power for operation. The mass of the NiMnGa element was only 18. 3 g. It was concluded that although the NiMnGa alloy was capable of meeting the trailing edge flap actuation requirements, the material is not suitable in its present form for this application because of weight and power consumption issues. The magnetic field requirements must be reduced to improve the utility of the material for rotorcraft applications...|$|E
40|$|Lower limb {{prostheses}} {{are developed}} to assist amputees in restoring mobility {{functions such as}} walking, sit-to-stand, stair ascent/descent, and ramp climbing. Although the current prostheses are equipped with sensors, actuators, controllers, and mechanical structures, they require improvements to mimic {{the function of the}} natural limbs. The first challenge in prosthetic development is to monitor the amputee/prosthesis interaction by using sensors built into the socket. This interaction helps in detecting the gait phases and events, in addition to develop new control strategies for prostheses, which may enhance the amputees’ comfort. The second challenge is to develop a knee prosthetic mechanism that could imitate the functions of the natural knee. To accomplish the aims of this thesis, studies were undertaken consecutively. First, the technology of the knee prosthesis was studied to understand the functionality of its components. The technology review showed that the sensory system requires enhancement, in particular, a new sensory system can be added-on to the mechanical sensors to sense the user’s intent, identify the transition between phases, and improve the control performance of the prosthesis. Based on this study, the piezoelectric bimorph (PB) was selected as the sensing element while a linear motor was selected as the most appropriate actuator. Next, the PB was validated as a sensing element by finding out its characteristics for the intended application. The static and dynamic characteristics of the PB were investigated and tested as an in-socket sensor with a transfemoral amputee to check its ability to sense the movement of the knee prosthesis. Moreover, the PB was tested as an <b>actuation</b> <b>element</b> in an application named microgripper that was capable of grasping a small object. Also, the PB was compared with a force sensitive resistor (FSR) as an in-socket sensor for a transfemoral amputee performing activities such as walking, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing. The PB could track the knee angle at most of the activities, while the FSR {{could be used as a}} trigger sensor at different movements. In the second stage, the focus was on the actuation system and mechanical structure of the knee prosthesis. It was found that, the mechanical actuation system needs improvement in terms of the normal range of motion and the power generation in activities that require extra torque and power. Therefore, a new design of knee prosthesis mechanism that contains a linear actuation system was presented and modeled using a physical modelling tool. The mechanism was physically simulated and controlled using PID controller at activities of daily living (ADL). Finally, an overall control framework of the knee mechanism using in-socket sensor was presented to guide the researchers to develop a knee prosthesis that could be controlled using in-socket sensors. In conclusion, the study demonstrates the possibility of using the piezoelectric bimorph as an in-socket transducer. Furthermore, a knee prosthesis mechanism was successfully designed, modelled, and tested at ADL. Further, clinical trials are recommended for the knee mechanism upon future development. Moreover, more subjects with different types of sockets may be tested towards improving the functionality of the knee prosthesi...|$|E

This paper presents an overview of recent research into a new method of providing fault tolerant actuators for high-integrity and safety-critical applications. The High Redundancy Actuator (HRA) uses {{a large number of}} small <b>actuation</b> <b>elements</b> to make up a single actuator. It provides superior reliability and efficiency over current technology, by configuring and controlling the elements so that faults are inherently accommodated. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate feasible active and passive fault tolerant control...|$|R
40|$|A generic {{design for}} a type of {{flexible}} structural-health-monitoring sheet with multiple sensor/actuator types and a method of manufacturing such sheets has been developed. A sheet of this type contains an array of sensing and/or <b>actuation</b> <b>elements,</b> associated wires, and any other associated circuit elements incorporated into various flexible layers on a thin, flexible substrate. The sheet can be affixed to a structure so that the array of sensing and/or <b>actuation</b> <b>elements</b> {{can be used to}} analyze the structure in accordance with structural-health-monitoring techniques. Alternatively, the sheet can be designed to be incorporated into the body of the structure, especially if the structure is made of a composite material. Customarily, structural-health monitoring is accomplished by use of sensors and actuators arrayed at various locations on a structure. In contrast, a sheet of the present type can contain an entire sensor/actuator array, making it unnecessary to install each sensor and actuator individually on or in a structure. Sensors of different types such as piezoelectric and fiber-optic can be embedded in the sheet to form a hybrid sensor network. Similarly, the traces for electric communication can be deposited on one or two layers as required, and an entirely separate layer can be employed to shield the sensor elements and traces...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] High Redundancy Actuator (HRA) project deals {{with the construction of}} an actuator using many redundant <b>actuation</b> <b>elements.</b> If one element fails, this changes the behaviour slightly, but the system still remains operation. A key challenge in this project is to design a passive fault tolerant controller that maintains the required performance in the presence of faults. This paper shows how to achieve this with structurally simple controllers, by optimising the parameters using a genetic algorithm...|$|R
