50|$|United Nations Security Council {{resolution}} 690, adopted unanimously on 29 April 1991, after recalling resolutions 621 (1988) and 658 (1990) and noting a <b>report</b> by <b>the</b> Secretary-General on {{the situation}} in Western Sahara, <b>the</b> Council <b>approved</b> <b>the</b> <b>report</b> and decided <b>to</b> establish the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) in accordance with the Secretary-General's recommendations. The Mission was to implement the Settlement Plan for a referendum of self-determination for the people of Western Sahara. The Council called upon Morocco and the Polisario Front to co-operate with the Secretary-General and the Mission, expressing its full support to him and the Organisation of African Unity for their efforts. It also decided that the transitional period will begin no later than sixteen weeks after <b>the</b> General Assembly <b>approves</b> <b>the</b> budget of MINURSO. In May 1991, <b>the</b> General Assembly <b>approved</b> <b>the</b> budget.|$|R
50|$|The Council chooses its own topics {{on which}} <b>to</b> <b>report.</b> Members of <b>the</b> Council meet {{four to six}} times a year to {{consider}} progress on ongoing projects, receive updates on published reports, review recent biomedical advances that raise ethical questions, and select topics for further exploration. Once the Council has identified a major ethical issue, it organises a workshop to examine the issue further. If appropriate, a Working Party is then established <b>to</b> <b>report</b> on <b>the</b> issue. Members of the Working Party are appointed by the Council and chosen to represent a range of specialist experience and skills. Typically, a Working Party meets regularly {{over a period of}} one to two years <b>to</b> produce a <b>report.</b> A public consultation is held to gain the views {{of a wide range of}} people to inform the findings of <b>the</b> <b>report.</b> <b>The</b> Council reviews drafts of <b>the</b> <b>report</b> before it is submitted for external peer review and then <b>approves</b> <b>the</b> final <b>report</b> prior <b>to</b> publication.|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{governments have}} {{realised}} {{the potential of}} extending commercial telematics services into the regulatory context. The Intelligent Access Program (IAP) provided the first national regulatory telematics applications in Australia. Administered by TCA, it enables the provision of accurate compliance monitoring for heavy vehicles. Heavy vehicles enrolled in the IAP are provided with improved access to the Australian road network. In return, they are monitored (using GPS technology) for compliance against a set of conditions including spatial, temporal, speed, vehicle type and mass. Non-compliant activities are <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> regulator. Sweden is now running a three year pilot of the IAP. Interestingly, rather than duplicate that infrastructure just for a trial, the Swedes are using Australian infrastructure: the vehicles are in Sweden, but are being tracked electronically by Australian providers. If there is a breach in compliance to the regulatory conditions (such as traveling off an <b>approved</b> route) <b>the</b> <b>report</b> goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> TCA in Melbourne, which then advises the transport authority in Sweden. This gives the Swedish agencies and stakeholders an opportunity to test the concept and how it might work in their jurisdiction before they invest more fully in the compliance policy and the associated technology. Dr Walker and his colleague Alexandra Moulis received {{a grant from the}} Australia and New Zealand School of Government to study this international policy transfer case, with a particular focus on how the trial contributes to improving our practice in the field. In other words, what does this policy transfer experience deliver for agencies here in Australia...|$|R
