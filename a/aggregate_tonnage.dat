5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the repatriation effort, Montana was transferred to the west coast of the United States. She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Seattle on 16 August, where she remained until 2 February 1921, when she was decommissioned. During this period of inactivity, she was renamed Missoula on 7 June 1920 so her original name could be used for one of the planned South Dakota-class battleships, and she reclassified with the hull number CA-13. Though decommissioned in 1921, the ship remained in the Navy's inventory until 15 July 1930, when she was formally stricken from the naval register, according to the terms of the London Naval Treaty, which placed <b>aggregate</b> <b>tonnage</b> limits on the cruiser fleets of the signatory countries. She was sold to John Irwin Jr. on 29 September and was eventually broken up in 1935.|$|E
25|$|In all 108 {{ships were}} at La Coruna, most others would join after departing from other ports. By October 1 the fleet {{consisted}} of 136 ships of 34,080 tons, {{of these were}} 44 royal galleons, of an <b>aggregate</b> <b>tonnage</b> of 12,686 tons; 16 merchantmen, of 5880 tons, 52 German and Flemish hulks for stores, of 15,514 tons, and 24 caravels, pinnaces and barks. 8,634 soldiers, 4,000 sailors, a total of 12,634 men and 300 horses. In this squadron of 32 Andalusia troopships included Carlos de Amésquita who had raided Cornwall two years earlier.

50|$|The North East Atlantic {{individual}} biological {{stocks of}} nephrops {{are identified as}} functional units. A number of functional units make up the sea areas over which a total allowable catch (TAC) is set annually by the EU Council of Ministers. For example, the TAC set for North Sea nephrops {{is based on the}} <b>aggregate</b> total <b>tonnage</b> of removals recommended by science for nine separate functional unit areas. This method has attracted criticism because it can promote the over-exploitation of a specific functional unit even though the overall TAC is under-fished. In 2016, the UK has implemented a package of emergency technical measures aimed at recovering the nephrop stock in the Farn(e) Deeps off North East England which is close to collapse.|$|R
50|$|Local and {{intercity}} {{passenger services}} (5am - 1am, very few overnight trains) operate at 95.3% on-time performance. 2008 annual passenger ridership was 179 million (incurring 5.45 billion passenger-miles), generating US$434 million in revenue. Commuter trains carry 76% of riders (43% of passenger miles). WCML carries >90% of ridership. TRA’s loose-car and unit-train bulk freight services haul mainly <b>aggregates</b> (58% of <b>tonnage),</b> cement (26%), and coal (9%). In 2008, 9.5 {{million tons of}} freight (481 million ton-miles) generated US$28.6 million in revenue. Limited container services operate between Port of Hualien and suburban Taipei, but loading gauge restrictions preclude piggyback operations. During typhoon season, small trucks are carried on flatcars when highways are closed by flooding or mudslides.|$|R

60|$|A like unfriendly {{disposition}} {{has been}} manifested {{on the part}} of Canada in the maintenance of a claim of right to exclude the citizens of the United States from the navigation of the St. Lawrence. This river constitutes a natural outlet to the ocean for eight States, with an aggregate population of about 17,600,000 inhabitants, and with an <b>aggregate</b> <b>tonnage</b> of 661,367 tons upon the waters which discharge into it.

50|$|Apparently, some {{shipping}} firms staged strong {{protest against}} this proposed tax. The <b>aggregate</b> <b>tonnage</b> of British shipping in Hong Kong in 1907 was about 6 million tons, {{and those of}} foreign ships were about 5.5 million tons. The proposed construction cost of the second typhoon shelter was HK$1.5 million.

50|$|A {{number of}} highly {{specific}} restrictions were imposed on {{what type of}} warships are allowed passage. Non-Black Sea state warships in the Straits must be under 15,000 tons. No more than nine non-Black Sea state warships, with a total <b>aggregate</b> <b>tonnage</b> {{of no more than}} 30,000 tons, may pass at any one time, and they are permitted to stay in the Black Sea for no longer than twenty-one days.

5000|$|In 1855, St. Louis was {{the most}} {{populated}} city west of the Mississippi River and the second largest port city, by <b>aggregate</b> <b>tonnage,</b> in the United States. [...] With its strategic location along the major steamboat transportation routes, {{as well as its}} central proximity to the city's waterfront lumberyards, St. Louis was geographically and economically primed to become a major paper producing center during the Second Industrial Revolution. Indeed, these conditions proved to be conducive to Graham Paper's financial success, as the company grew rapidly following the Civil War era. Among the first buildings Henry Graham had built included a rag warehouse, for the storage of raw materials in the production of cotton paper. [...] The company located its facilities in the waterfront district of St. Louis for easy access to river shipping. There were also a number of lumberyards located in the waterfront district during this era.|$|E
5000|$|Tokomaru Harbour Board is {{the only}} harbour board in New Zealand that has never levied a harbour rate. In 1911 it built a wharf {{at a cost of}} £10,000, and, in 1914, made {{substantial}} improvements. jetty had been built at Te Ariuri in 1906. Mr. McCracken (who carried out the work) used large manuka trunks obtained from [...] "Mangaroa" [...] In 1925 some rocks were removed, enabling vessels drawing up to 11 ft to berth. Two years later the board bought the New Zealand Shipping Co.'s brick wool sheds, etc., for £13,000. A new wharf and approach were built in 1940 at a cost of £28,300. The port's busiest years were from 1913 to 1916, when 400 vessels (<b>aggregate</b> <b>tonnage,</b> about 400,000) were handled annually. As in the case of other small ports, it suffered a heavy decline in business when—during the Second World War—it was excluded from the itineraries of Home vessels.|$|E
50|$|The Mississippi-Ohio river {{systems were}} navigated by {{steamboat}} starting in 1811 with the New Orleans steamboat travelling from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to New Orleans. On December 16, 1811, the New Madrid earthquakes smashed the lightly populated region. In 1817, the first steamboat reached Saint Louis. That year, the commerce from New Orleans to the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville was carried in barges and keel-boats having {{a capacity of}} 60 to 80 tons each, with 3 to 4 months required to make a single trip. In 1820 steamboats were making the same trip in 15 to 20 days, by 1838 in 6 days or less. By 1834 there were 230 steamboats, having an <b>aggregate</b> <b>tonnage</b> of 39,000 tons, engaged in trade on the Mississippi. Large numbers of flat boats, especially from the Ohio and its tributaries, continued to carry produce downstream. In 1842 Ohio completed an extensive canal system that connected the Mississippi with the Great Lakes. These were in turn connected in 1825 by the Erie Canal with the Hudson River and the Port of New York on the Atlantic Ocean. There was expansive growth of resource commodity, and agricultural products trade throughout the rivers and Great Lakes network.|$|E
