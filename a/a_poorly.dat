5|$|A closed {{low-level}} circulation nearly {{developed on}} August 14 {{to the east}} of Key Largo, Florida, but it weakened due to the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid-level center. The mid-level storm continued westward and moved across Florida.

5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish <b>a</b> <b>poorly</b> differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium carbonate, Dy2(CO3)3, and {{dysprosium}} sulfate, Dy2(SO4)3, {{result from}} similar reactions. Most dysprosium compounds are soluble in water, though dysprosium carbonate tetrahydrate (Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O) and dysprosium oxalate decahydrate (Dy2(C2O4)3·10H2O) are both insoluble in water. Two {{of the most}} abundant dysprosium carbonates, tengerite-(Dy) (Dy2(CO3)3·2–3H2O) and kozoite-(Dy) (DyCO3(OH)) are known to form via <b>a</b> <b>poorly</b> ordered (amorphous) precursor phase with a formula of Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O.

5|$|Hurricane Earl was an atypical, {{short-lived}} Category 2 hurricane {{that caused}} moderate damage throughout the Southeast United States. It formed out of <b>a</b> <b>poorly</b> organized tropical disturbance over the southwest Gulf of Mexico late on August31, 1998. Tracking towards the northeast, the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane on September2 and made landfall {{early the next}} day near Panama City, Florida. Rapidly tracking towards Atlantic Canada, the extratropical remnants of Earl significantly intensified before passing over Newfoundland on September6. The remnants were absorbed by former Hurricane Danielle two days later.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Ten was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that made landfall on the Florida Panhandle in September2007. The system {{developed as a}} subtropical depression on September21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the interaction of a tropical wave, {{the tail end of}} a cold front, and an upper-level low. Initially containing <b>a</b> <b>poorly</b> defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned into a tropical depression after convection increased over the center. Tracking northwestward, the depression moved ashore near Fort Walton Beach early on September22 and dissipated over southeastern Alabama shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting {{in the development of}} a subtropical depression on October7. Upon formation, the system consisted of a very broad subtropical low, as well as <b>a</b> <b>poorly</b> defined surface circulation. As the subtropical depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the subtropical depression intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>poorly</b> {{organized}} tropical wave {{moved into}} the eastern Pacific on August29 and quickly developed into a tropical depression by 0600UTC the following day. Within an environment of low wind shear, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, acquiring the name Henriette, at 1200UTC on August31. Moving west-northwest around a ridge positioned over inland Mexico, the center passed narrowly offshore after producing squally weather along the coastline. The system moved westward while continuing to intensify, becoming a Category1 hurricane at 0600UTC on September4 and subsequently attaining its peak intensity with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 972mb (hPa; 28.71inHg) six hours later. An approaching upper-level trough caused Henriette to turn northwest later that day, moving it ashore near San Jose del Cabo, Mexico at 2100UTC as a minimal hurricane. After crossing Baja California Sur, Henriette weakened to a tropical storm and made a second landfall near Guaymas, Mexico. The system moved inland and quickly weakened, dissipating by 1200UTC on September6.|$|E
