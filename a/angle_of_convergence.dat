40|$|By {{means of}} a discrete-trial {{simultaneous}} discrimination procedure, pigeons were trained to respond differentially to visual arrays that were identical except {{that one of them}} contained a circle displaced in depth when viewed stereoscopically. Performance was severely disrupted when one eye was occluded. The monocular deficit was peculiar to the depth task, inasmuch as no such decrement was seen on a pattern discrimination. The results imply that presence of the displaced circle was discriminated {{on the basis of a}} binocular cue. It was also found that pigeons could discriminate the direction of the displacement. Discrimination of depth was independent of the global form and still occurred when elements of the array were randomly displaced in depth. Performance was not disrupted when the absolute <b>convergence</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the depth stimulus was changed. The cue that consistently accounted for the behavior seen was the detection <b>of</b> the relative <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> [...] that is, the retinal disparity of the two planes in depth.

40|$|An image triplet of Pleiades images {{covering}} {{the area of}} Zonguldak, Turkey has been investigated. The height to base relation {{of the first to}} the last image is just 1 : 4. 5 and for the first and the second image 1 : 9. This is quite below the usual height to base relation of 1 : 1. 6 for a typical stereo pair of space images. The corresponding small <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> influences the possible vertical accuracy, but images with such a small <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> are more similar to each other as images with larger convergence angles. This enables a better image matching, improving the vertical accuracy and compensating partially the influence of poor intersection geometry. Even over forest areas no matching gaps occurred. Height models are generated with different base configurations and compared with a reference height model. Pleiades images are distributed with 50 cm ground sampling distance instead of the physical size of 70 cm, the image quality justifies this zooming and also the geometric results are in the range of other space images with originally 50 cm GSD. The image orientation by bias corrected Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPC) is leading with more as 160 ground control points (GCP) to root mean square (RMS) differences slightly below 1. 0 GSD of the distributed images (0. 5 m GSD). Only negligible systematic errors have been identified. With the combination of the first and last image a standard deviation of the generated height model of 1. 6 m, respectively for flat terrain close to 1. 0 m has been reached in relation to a reference height model.

A {{model is}} {{presented}} that combines {{the traditional approach}} to transpression with the thin viscous sheet approx-imation of the lithosphere, to study deformation {{in front of an}} obliquely colliding indenter. The model produces a zone dominated by lateral simple shear (orogen parallel transcur-rent movements) close to the indenter and a zone of dom-inant pure shear (orogen perpendicular pure shear/thrusting regions) further away from the indenting boundary. The rel-ative width of simple shear dominated zone with respect to the more distant pure shear domain in terms of the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> is discussed. The possibility of development of transcurrent faults in front of an indenting plate is enhanced by the reactivation of fabric anisotropy created progressively during indentation. ...|$|E

The Rayleigh-Ritz deflection functions which were used were products of vibration modes of uniform clamped-free and free-free bars. Deflections were computed, using six terms in the series, for three different loading conditions at sweep <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> 20 °, 40 °, and 60 °.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{preliminary}} results of co-extrusion and spheronization of wet masses are reported. A ram co-extruder, manufactured in-house, was designed with two concentric single dies mounted on two concentric and independent chambers. This equipment {{has allowed the}} production of three types of extrudates. (rod or solid extrudates, tubular or hollow extrudates. and co-extrudates). Different wet mixtures of microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, a non-soluble in water dye and water were produced and used to feed the chambers of the ram co-extruder. Extrusions of the wet masses were carried out at different speeds of the ram (25 - 400 mm/min). The extrudates were evaluated according to surface characteristics (by visual inspection), force of extrusion and duration of steady-state (after recording the force applied to the ram and its displacement). Simultaneously, for each process of extrusion {{it was possible to}} assess the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> {{to the bottom of the}} chambers for both the external and internal chambers. These angles reflected the high complexity of the extrusion occurring on the external chamber in consequence of its annular geometry, in which the bisecting-line was not parallel to the axis of the extruder, by opposition to the converging angle in the internal chamber, where the bisecting-line was perfectly aligned to the axis of the extruder. Variations in the amount of water in the formulations and the speed of extrusion affected both the production and the quality of the extrudates and their ability to provide pellets. The rod extrudates were the easiest to produce and the relationships between the formulations, the processing conditions and the properties of the extrudates were immediately apparent. On the other hand, co-extrudates were more complex to characterise, although identical relationships between formulations, processing conditions and the properties of the co-extrudates were observed as for the rod extrudates. Different batches of extrudates (rod, tubular and co-extrudates) were spheronized to a maximum spheronization time of 10 min at 1000 rpm. The pellets were characterized with respect to size, size distribution, sphericity and density. Results have shown that for a larger diameter of the co-extrudates, the pellets produced were bigger (approximate to 3. 38 mm) than the pellets produced from rod extrudates (1. 22 mm). For longer times of spheronization, the aspect ratio and the density increased for both pellets produced from rod (0. 95 and 1. 46 g/cm(3)) and co-extrudates (0. 90 and 1. 47 g/cm(3)). The study has shown the potential of this new technology in providing a product with advantages over the traditional spheres produced by extrusion and spheronization. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

The mechanism of the chassis {{is made up of}} several smaller subsystems with different functions. The first mechanism is used to eject the chassis before landing (touchdown) and fold it to hatchway after the lift off. The second mechanism is designed to perform rotation of the crossover with the wheel, in order to adjust the position of the wheel to fit it in the limited space in the hold. The third mechanism allows movement of the chassis resulting from the change in length of the damper. To determine the position of the following links of the mechanism was used calculus of vectors in which unit vectors were used to represent the angular position of the links. Often used equation, which describes a polygon vector, and the equation of unknown unit vector possible to determine if the other two and the angles between them are known. Calculations were performed in the three local systems of reference, thus were obtained the simplest forms of solutions for links positions. The corresponding scalar products of unit vectors are elements of two transition matrices. These matrices are needed for the vectors calculation {{in each of the three}} coordinate systems.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} axial length with the combined effect <b>of</b> accommodation and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> gaze (<b>convergence</b> and downward gaze) over 5 minutes in groups of myopes and emmetropes. Methods: A total of 31 subjects (nine emmetropes, 10 low myopes, and 12 moderate to high myopes) aged from 18 to 31 years were recruited. To measure ocular biometrics in inferonasal gaze with accommodation, an optical biometer (Lenstar LS 900) was inclined on a tilt and height adjustable stage, with the subject’s chinrest mounted on a rotary stage to induce various levels <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> by rotation <b>of</b> the subject’s head in primary or downward gaze. Initially, the subjects performed a distance viewing task in primary gaze for 10 minutes to provide a ‘wash-out’ period for prior visual tasks, and then the subject’s axial length and ocular biometrics were measured in nine different combinations of gaze/accommodation over 5 minutes. These nine sessions for all gaze measurements (i. e. three levels of accommodation 9 three levels <b>of</b> <b>convergence)</b> were completed across 3 days of testing (one accommodation condition on each day). The nine combinations of gaze/accommodation were based on those required to view the centre, right and left edges of a distant TV at 6 m in primary gaze, an intermediate task (i. e. computer at 50 cm in 10 ° downward gaze) and a near task (i. e. reading A 4 page at 20 cm in 20 ° downward gaze). Subjects were wearing a custom built three-axes head tracker throughout the experiment that monitored subjects’ relative head movements (roll, pitch and yaw) during measurements. Results: A significant increase in axial length occurred with the combined effect <b>of</b> accommodation, <b>convergence</b> and downward gaze (repeated measures ANOVA, p 0. 05). Moderate to high myopes had a greater change in the axial length (mean change 40 ± 11 lm after 5 minutes of near task) than that of emmetropes (mean change 29 ± 15 lm after 5 minutes of near task) and low myopes (mean change 29 ± 16 lm after 5 minutes of near task) associated with time (p = 0. 02) and accommodation by time (p = 0. 03). Conclusions: The combination <b>of</b> accommodation, <b>convergence</b> and downward angle has a significant short term effect on axial length over time. The near task in downward gaze with convergence caused a greater change in axial length than the intermediate and distant visual tasks. The greater axial elongation measured in the infero-nasal direction with accommodation is most likely associated {{with a combination of}} biomechanical factors such as, extraocular muscle forces and ciliary muscle contraction...|$|R
40|$|While recent {{scholarship}} has emphasised the narratives of immersive realism {{that surrounded the}} parlour stereoscope, my aim in {{this paper is to}} better understand the counter-currents of nineteenth century stereoscopic culture – the artefacts, practices and discourses that powerfully undermined realist assumptions about spatial perception and the “truth” of stereoscopic representation. Wheatstone’s original stereoscopes were designed to “hack” spatial perception and subject each of its component principles to artificial manipulation. What Wheatstone uncovered were glaring anomalies in the prevailing theories of veridical sight, which had relied upon the principle <b>of</b> binocular <b>convergence</b> (understood as a precise trigonometric measure of depth). Following a popular tradition of critical inquiry known as “rational recreation,” amateurs too used their stereoscopes to reflect on the perplexities of binocular spatial perception. Analytic line drawings highlighted the inexplicable binocular suture of strikingly disparate images. Stereoviews with their images transposed revealed the capacity of the mind to constitute volumetric objects irrespective of binocular cues. Hyper-stereo images (taken from a wide separation and therefore at an increased <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> binocular <b>convergence)</b> sparked debate and perceptual uncertainty as to whether their 3 D effects, or indeed all stereoviews, were distorted – elongated along the z axis and/or miniaturised. Realists, including some astronomers hoping to use hyper-stereo photographs as visual evidence of the shape of the moon’s surface, sought unsuccessfully {{to solve the problem of}} elongation by ensuring that the angles at which stereo photographs were taken were reproduced in the angles at which the eyes viewed them in the stereoscope. Astronomers were forced to quietly abandon the stereoscope as a reliable witness of spatial form. Others, artists in particular, revelled in the anti-realist implications of a spatial imagination which constructed the perceptual world in a sometimes capricious fashion...|$|R

However, when the projected width of the base of the trapezoid projection was used in the model, instead of the projected length, excellent agreement between the theoretical and obtained slant judgements resulted.

The interaction between the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence,</b> kinematic vor-ticity, infinitesimal strain axes, finite strain, and rotation of material lines and planes is investigated. Quantification of the finite strain indicates that the orientation, magnitude, and geometry (flattening, constriction, etc.) change continually during steady-state trans-pression. These results are then applied to the cases of transpression, particularly resulting from oblique plate convergence of terranes. The obliquity of plate motion and the geometry of the plate margin determine which of the types of transpression r transtension is favoured. A component ofmargin-parallel stretching also potentially causes terrane motion to locally exceed oblique plate motion, or move opposite to the general direction of movement between the converging plate boundaries. The kinematic models also suggest that th...|$|E

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the Seismological Society of America {{and can be}} found at: [URL] Queen Charlotte Fault (QCF) is a major strike-slip fault that forms the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates from 51 ° to 58 ° N. Near 53. 2 ° N, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> oblique <b>convergence</b> predicted by the Mid-Ocean Ridge VELocity (MORVEL) interplate pole of rotation decreases from > 15 ° in the south to < 15 ° in the north. South of 53. 2 ° N, the convergent component of plate motion results in the formation of a 40 km wide terrace on the Pacific plate west of QCF and earthquakes with thrust mechanisms (including the 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake sequence) are observed. North of 53. 2 ° N, in the primary rupture zone of the M 8. 1 strike-slip earthquake of 1949, the linear terrace disappears, and topography of the continental slope west of the QCF is characterized by a complex pattern of ridges and basins that trend obliquely to the primary trace of the QCF. Deformation within the Pacific plate appears to occur primarily through strike-slip faulting with a minor thrust component on secondary synthetic faults. The orientations of these secondary faults, as determined from seismic reflection and bathymetric data, are consistent with the reactivation of faults originally formed as ridge-parallel normal faults and as thrust faults formed parallel to the QCF south of the bend at 53. 2 ° N and subsequently translated to the north. We suggest that an oblique <b>convergence</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 15 ° represents a critical threshold separating distinct crustal responses to transpression. This result is consistent with theoretical and analog strain models of transpressive plate boundaries. The sharpness of this transition along the QCF, in contrast to purely continental transform boundaries, may be facilitated by the relatively simple structure of oceanic crust and the presence of pre-existing, optimally oriented faults in the young Pacific plate...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} {{effectiveness}} of home-based pencil push-ups (HBPP) therapy for patients with symptomatic convergence insufficiency. Methods: Data was collected prospectively on 16 patients who were diagnosed with convergence insufficiency beginning in January 2009. The study group was composed of ten male and six female patients. The duration of symptoms, refractive error, distant and near deviation angles, and near point <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> (NPC) prior to and after 12 weeks of HBPP therapy were measured in all patients. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 19. 3 years. The mean deviation <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> exophoria was 3 prism diopters (PD) at distant and 11. 2 PD at near. The mean value of NPC prior to HBPP therapy was 36. 3 cm; however, the near point of accommodation was within the normal range. After 12 weeks of HBPP therapy, the mean deviation <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> exophoria decreased to orthophoric at distant and 4 PD at near. The mean value of NPC decreased to 14. 4 cm. Conclusions: Twelve weeks of HBPP therapy appears to be an easy, cost-free and effective therapy for patients with symptomatic convergence insufficiency.
